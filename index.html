Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that a loss to Russia could ultimately force the U.S. to choose between the “collapse of NATO” or going to war. 
“If Ukraine would lose, if Russia would occupy Ukraine, Russia will continue going towards Baltic countries, Poland, etcetera,” Zelensky said in an interview with NBC News. 
“And they will start war with one of the NATO countries, and at this moment, the U.S. would have to choose the collapse of NATO or go to war.”

Warzone/The Drive: Israel’s Merkava Tank Has Possible Export Customer In Europe

 
Israel is negotiating sales of Merkavas with two countries, including one in Europe, prompting speculation about a possible deal for Ukraine.  
The Israeli government says that it is in very active talks with two countries about what could be the first confirmed international sales of variants of the country&#x27;s unique Merkava main battle tank. The identities of those nations have not been disclosed, but one of them is in Europe, which has already led to speculation that Merkavas may eventually be bound for Ukraine. 
Yair Kulas, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense&#x27;s International Defense Cooperation Directorate, also known by its Hebrew acronym SIBAT, disclosed the potential foreign Merkava sales in a recent interview with the Calcalist newspaper. SIBAT work includes negotiating the sale of weapon systems and other materiel from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inventory.

Rightwing members of the Swiss parliament boycotted an address by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that called for war materiel export restrictions to be eased. 
Members of the Swiss People’s Party were absent from the parliamentary chamber in protest against perceived interference of Swiss affairs. 
Zelensky has in the past urged Switzerland to beef up sanctions against Russian oligarchs and now wants Swiss-manufactured weapons to be sent to Ukraine.

 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he believes military conflict between China and Taiwan is likely if tensions continue on their current course, though he still holds out for dialogue that will lead to deescalation — as he’s been urging. 
“On the current trajectory of relations, I think some military conflict is probable,” Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, when asked about the possibility that China would invade Taiwan. “But I also think the current trajectory of relations must be altered.” 
The remarks, delivered as Kissinger looked back on his life and career soon after his 100th birthday, were some of his most downbeat about the state of relations between China and the US, which has vowed to back Taiwan in the event China attacks. Kissinger said it was up to both Washington and Beijing to step back from their standoff, which he said was at “the top of a precipice.”

BBC: Valery Zaluzhny, the man behind Ukraine&#x27;s counter-offensive 
Ukraine&#x27;s long-awaited attempt to take back the territories in the east and south of the country, occupied by Russia for the past 18 months, is now in full swing. 
A key figure in planning and executing this operation is Gen Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#x27;s 49-year-old commander-in-chief. 
Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Gen Zaluzhny, or &quot;our Valera&quot; as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have agreed that the Russian leader will visit Turkey &quot;soon&quot;, Interfax cited a Kremlin aide as saying on Friday. 
The visit would be Putin&#x27;s first to a NATO country since he ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has only rarely traveled outside Russia since the beginning of full-scale hostilities. 
 &quot;There is an invitation from the president of Turkey. Putin and Erdogan agreed that the visit will be in the near future, but we have not yet talked about a specific day, specific dates,&quot; Interfax cited Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov as saying.

* Breakthroughs in electromagnetic launch technology pave the way for a nuclear-powered warship to carry rail gun, laser and high-powered microwave: Ma Weiming 
* Researchers do not say when the supership will be built, but say China is ready to take the idea from science fiction to the real world 
Rear Admiral Ma Weiming, who is key to the development of China&#x27;s most advanced naval technologies, has revealed the conceptual blueprint of a futuristic warship which he says is unlike any ship the world had seen. 
&quot;It will completely overturn the combat formation of naval fleets that has been in place for over a hundred years,&quot; he said in a peer-reviewed paper published in Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society journal on June 13. 
Currently, naval combat platforms around the world, aircraft carrier groups, have been made more complicated by the diversity of tasks they must perform. This makes it harder for them to coordinate their actions effectively. These vessels are also expensive to build and operate.

China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping called the partnership an &#x27;important milestone in the history of bilateral relations&#x27; 
China said Wednesday that it established a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with the Palestinian Authority during a visit to Beijing by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 
The announcement marked another step in China’s campaign to gain political and economic influence in the Middle East, where it is competing with the United States. 
China is seeking energy resources and markets for its military and civilian exports while also promoting its version of authoritarian government as part of joint challenge with Russia to the Western-led democratic world order.

                              <span>CNN: India demonstrates naval strength with dual aircraft carrier exercise, a feat China has yet to accomplish 
India’s two aircraft carriers led their battle groups in a combined operation in the Arabian Sea earlier this week, showcasing what the service calls its “formidable maritime capabilities” and ability to project power around the Indian Ocean and beyond. 
Analysts say it’s a big accomplishment and one that only the United States Navy has pulled off in recent memory. 
“This is not a small achievement and underlines that the Indian Navy is one of very few in the world that operates more than one aircraft carrier,” said Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Independent: Scholz: &#x27;We need to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine&#x27; 
According to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to seize neighboring territories, therefore, Kyiv&#x27;s partners must discuss concrete security guarantees for Ukraine, Deutsche Welle wrote on June 14. 
The chancellor added that &quot;freezing the war&quot; and thus legitimizing Russia&#x27;s invasion is not an option, because borders cannot be moved by force.

&quot;The Russian president wants to seize certain neighboring territories: he holds such plans for Ukraine, and it is obvious he has such plans for Belarus,&quot; Scholz said.

Consortium News: Suspended for Providing Balanced News on Ukraine

 
An editor at Radio New Zealand has been suspended and is under investigation for the time-honored practices of providing balanced and factual reporting, writes Tony Kevin. 
On Friday The Guardian Australia website carried a news report, with a follow-up piece on Monday, whose implications for free speech are profoundly disturbing. 
They concern a Radio New Zealand, or RNZ, broadcasting employee — unnamed, but everyone in the small New Zealand broadcasting world will soon know who it is — who has been placed on leave while their professional conduct is investigated.  Obviously, a career hangs in the balance. 
The malign ghosts of Orwell’s 1984 stalk this story.

WNU Editor: Radio New Zealand is not the only news media outlet making the decision to provide news on the Ukraine war from only one side. I would say most Western news agencies have made the decision to ban any news from the Russian side on what is happening in the war. And while there are rare occasions when major US outlets do provide a glimpse on what is actually happening on the front-lines, that coverage is very rare and it is often obscured with other news breaking stories.</span>

HAVANA (Reuters) -Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz-Canel on Thursday, his last stop on a three-nation Latin American tour aimed at shoring up support among Latin American allies saddled, like Iran, by U.S. sanctions. 
Raisi told reporters at a trade forum in Havana early on Thursday that Cuba and Iran would seek opportunities to work together in electricity generation, biotechnology, and mining, among other areas. 
&quot;The conditions and circumstances in which Cuba and Iran find themselves today have many things in common,&quot; Raisi said in a conversation with Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel. &quot;Every day our relations grow stronger.&quot;

Several US federal government agencies have been hit in a global cyberattack by Russian cybercriminals that exploits a vulnerability in widely used software, according to a top US cybersecurity agency. 
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency “is providing support to several federal agencies that have experienced intrusions affecting their MOVEit applications,” Eric Goldstein, the agency’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in a statement on Thursday to CNN, referring to the software impacted. 
“We are working urgently to understand impacts and ensure timely remediation.”

Warzone/The Drive: Ukraine’s Armor Appears To Have A Russian Attack Helicopter Problem 
Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters’ presence at the front highlights the need for highly mobile and survivable short-range air defenses. 
As Ukraine presses on with its counteroffensive in the south and east, making incremental advances in the process, there is evidence that Russia may be starting to enjoy more aerial access over critical areas near the front lines. 
As Russia continues to adapt its application of air power, after a fairly dismal start to the campaign, some of its aircraft are now able to operate in a less restricted way, or at least Russia is willing to take on more risk in doing so. Either way, this will put further pressure on the Ukrainian forces, raising questions, in particular, about the availability of mobile short-range air defense systems, or SHORAD. At the very least, as Ukraine gets away from its more entrenched and fixed air defense capabilities, the importance of SHORAD is only going to be underscored.

A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guard member accused of posting secret and sensitive military documents on social media, on six counts related to his retention and transmission of those documents. 
“The unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified information jeopardizes our nation’s security,” acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S.

The head of the UN atomic energy agency has said the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine is “serious” and that ensuring water for cooling was a priority of his visit, adding that the station could operate safely for “some time”. 
Rafael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was inspecting the state of Europe’s largest nuclear plant following last week’s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro River. He said IAEA inspectors would remain at the site.

Washington Post: GOP senator blocks arms sale to Hungary for stalling Sweden’s NATO bid 
Sen. James E. Risch, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is halting a $735 million U.S. arms sale to Hungary as punishment for the country’s refusal to approve NATO membership for Sweden, a rare move aimed at pressuring Budapest into greenlighting the military alliance’s expansion ahead of a major summit next month. 
In a statement to The Washington Post, Risch (Idaho) said Hungary must allow Sweden into NATO if it wants the arms package, which includes 24 HIMARS rocket launcher batteries, and more than 100 rockets and pods along with associated parts and support. 
The decision to slam the brakes on new arms sales to Budapest demonstrates the growing anger toward Hungary by NATO backers like Risch, who rarely holds up arms sales to countries in any part of the world.

                              <span>Russia has announced plans to hold elections in the occupied parts of Ukraine in three months. The move is seen as Moscow&#x27;s latest attempt to signal it is in control, even as a Ukrainian counteroffensive has pushed back its forces in some areas. While the decisive battles still lie ahead, Ukrainian troops have recaptured villages and territories previously held by Russia since last year.</span>

In rapid succession along the eastern shore are Alligators Point, Traitor’s Bay, and Caution Point. Elsewhere around the coast are Deception Bay and Alert Rock, as well as Cannibal Point and,

                              <span>New Zealand has officially entered a recession however it is seen as a necessary part of steering the economy back on a sustainable path, says ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner. 

“It’s important to note that this is the plan,” Ms Zollner told Sky News Australia.

“So this is a bit different from the typical recession where you get some kind of negative shock and monetary policy goes into overdrive to try and get the economy out of it as fast as possible.

“It’s not clear that’s going to be the plan this time.”</span>

BBC: Sharp decline in appetite for news in recent years, Reuters Institute says 
The number of people taking a strong interest in the news has dropped by around a quarter in the last six years, a global study suggests. 
A report by Oxford University&#x27;s Reuters Institute says 48% of people around the world are very or extremely interested in the news - down from 63% in 2017. 
In the UK, the proportion is lower than the global average at 43%. 
More than a third of people (36%) worldwide say they sometimes or often actively avoid the news. 
The authors of the institute&#x27;s report said there was evidence that audiences &quot;continue to selectively avoid important stories such as the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis as they cut back on depressing news and look to protect their mental health&quot;.

                              <span>Politico.eu: Turkey’s Erdoğan plays down Sweden’s NATO hopes 
His remarks injected a chill into the growing optimism that Sweden could get the NATO green light soon. 
Sweden has still not won Turkey’s support to join NATO ahead of the military alliance’s summit in Vilnius next month, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Wednesday — pouring cold water on rising hopes that a deal might be near. 
“Sweden’s expectations don’t mean we’ll follow them,” Erdoğan said during a trip to Azerbaijan, according to Bloomberg and Turkish media, referring to Stockholm’s aspirations of becoming a NATO member before the alliance’s annual summit in July. 
Erdoğan’s comments were conspicuously timed, coming just as senior officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland met in Ankara to discuss Turkey’s concerns over Sweden’s NATO bid.

Cable news’s on-screen graphics — known as chyrons — were originally designed to highlight the latest news to viewers in a concise way. But on Tuesday night, Fox News viewers got one that was unusually politically charged.
Just before 9 p.m., the network split the screen to present comments from President Biden at the White House simultaneously with Donald Trump’s combative remarks after pleading not guilty to federal charges of illegally retaining classified documents.

WNU Editor: The fun part of this story is that the Biden administration&#x27;s Justice Department DID arrest and charge their main political rival. Isn&#x27;t that what authoritarian governments around the world do to their political opponents?

Warzone/The Drive: F-22 Deployment To Middle East Aimed Squarely At Russia In Syria

 
The Air Force’s top commander in the Middle East says that Iranian support for Russia’s war in Ukraine may be fueling incidents in Syria. 
U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters recently arrived in the Middle East as part of a broader and explicit show of force in direct response to actions in recent months by elements of the Russia&#x27;s military in the region. American forces have been experiencing an uptick in unsafe and unprofessional Russian aerial activity in skies over Syria and this may be tied in part to Iranian support for the latter&#x27;s war effort in Ukraine. That&#x27;s the view of the Air Force&#x27;s top commander in the Middle East. 
Read more ....

 
WNU Editor: CENTCOM knows that the U.S. military presence in Syria (see map below) makes it an ideal target for Iranian backed groups in the region. But by deploying F-22s the U.S. is sending a message that if US forces are threatened or attacked they will respond. 
But respond against who? 
The F-22s are too valuable to be used on bombing missions. They are there to shoot down enemy planes. Or more specifically .... Russian military aircraft. 
You can take this to the bank. If F-22s start shooting down Russian military aircraft, we will be on the brink of World War 3.</span>

WNU Editor: Wall Street Silver&#x27;s analysis is spot on .... 
.... Any military people out there? Is there a solution for this? 
How can expensive equipment on the battlefield be protected when cheap drones can just destroy everything remotely? 
Is the future of war cheap drones blowing everything up? 
 Next … artificial intelligence drones. 
Since the beginning of this blog WNU has been predicting that drones are going to play a major role in future wars. It has been a long wait, but that future is now today&#x27;s reality on the Ukraine battlefield. 
And here is another prediction. This is just the beginning. The future of war will be mostly fought with cheap and accurate drones blowing everything up, and the victor will be the one with the most drones.</span>

WNU Editor: Here is a little insight on the Russian mindset (and the Ukrainian mindset). 
Russian and Ukrainian humor (and trolling) only comes out when we are hurting or facing doom and gloom. In both Russia and Ukraine a lot of people are currently in the doom and gloom mindset. 
Needless to say. Being one whose mom is Russian and father Ukrainian .... sighhh ....  my doom and gloom mindset is doubled.</span>

How is Ukraine’s counter-offensive going so far? (Reuters). The Economist is saying the same thing .... Ukraine’s counter-offensive is making mixed progress (The Economist). 
As to what is my take.
According to many reports Ukraine is now putting in their reserves for this offensive. Russian drone, artillery, and helicopter gunships are blunting most of the attacks. There has definitely been no breakthrough to the main Russian defense lines. There are concerns that Ukraine can only sustain this offensive for another 2 -3 weeks. Casualty numbers for both sides are very high.</span>

News of these audacious raids was jarring enough, given the many prior assurances of U.S. and Ukrainian war planners, who insisted no attacks would be carried out inside Russian territory. It was all the more conspicuous that …</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Global level of forced displacement climbs to record 110 million, UN says 
GENEVA (Reuters) - The number of people forcibly displaced around the world has climbed to a record 110 million people, the head of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said, with conflicts in Ukraine and Sudan spurring millions of people to flee their homes. 
The increase of around 19 million people to 108.4 million by the end of last year is the biggest annual jump on record, UNHCR said in a report released on Wednesday. 
That number has since risen further to 110 million, mostly due to Sudan&#x27;s eight-week-old conflict, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told journalists.
&quot;It&#x27;s quite an indictment on the state of our world to have to report that,&quot; he said at a Geneva press conference.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled the country&#x27;s first &quot;National Security Strategy.&quot; The plan envisages more coherent foreign and security policies to prevent Berlin from being wrong-footed by geopolitical events. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and members of his Cabinet on Wednesday presented Germany&#x27;s long-delayed national security strategy, with the aim of avoiding past mistakes that have left the government red-faced. 
Although Germany has had policy documents in the past covering security, it has never had a dedicated comprehensive strategy.

                              <span>In an all-caps rant on his Truth Social platform Monday, former President Donald Trump vowed to appoint another special counsel to prosecute President Joe Biden. It was a single word that raised the alarm for an expert in religious extremism.
&quot;NOW THAT THE &#x27;SEAL&#x27; IS BROKEN, IN ADDITION TO CLOSING THE BORDER &amp; REMOVING ALL OF THE &#x27;CRIMINAL&#x27; ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ILLEGALLY INVADED OUR COUNTRY, MAKING AMERICA ENERGY INDEPENDENT, &amp; EVEN DOMINANT AGAIN, &amp; IMMEDIATELY ENDING THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA &amp; UKRAINE, I WILL APPOINT A REAL SPECIAL &#x27;PROSECUTOR&#x27; TO GO AFTER THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA, JOE BIDEN, THE ENTIRE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY, &amp; ALL OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS, BORDERS, &amp; COUNTRY ITSELF!&quot; wrote Trump.
The use of &quot;seal&quot; may not be an accident, wrote religion reporter and extremism expert Jeff Sharlet. It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.
&quot;QAnon &amp; many fundamentalists will read this — &amp; I don’t think it’s a stretch to imagine Trump’s people are aware of that — as both the indictment &amp; 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ,&quot; wrote Sharlet.
The Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. 
This could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist — as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.
All of this comes as Trump prepares to face arraignment in Miami on Tuesday, and as authorities brace for the possibility of violence from Trump supporters in the vicinity, supported by escalating violent rhetoric on pro-Trump corners of the internet.</span>

UN Secretary General António Guterres has issued a warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence and called for the creation of a regulatory body.
&quot;Alarm bells over the latest form of artificial intelligence – generative AI – are deafening,&quot; Guterres said at a press conference in New York on Monday.
&quot;Scientists and experts have called on the world to act, declaring AI an existential threat to humanity on a par with the risk of nuclear war. We must take those warnings seriously,&quot; he said.
Guterres presented a position paper in which the United Nations makes proposals on how to deal with AI worldwide and announced plans to create a high-level advisory body on the issue.
He also said that he supported the establishment of a regulatory authority, but that it could not be set up by him alone, only in partnership with the UN member states.
He suggested that such an authority could be inspired by what the International Atomic Energy Agency is today.</span>

Kyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.
Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had &quot;overall control&quot; over the separatist forces.
Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine&#x27;s MH17 case was based on &quot;nonsense&quot; and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.
On Monday, Ukraine&#x27;s lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been &quot;subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory&quot; about the shooting down of MH17 which would be &quot;better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet&quot;.
Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.
Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine&#x27;s allegations on Thursday.
The World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.

                              <span>A leading international think tank said Monday that the world is &quot;drifting into one of the most dangerous periods in human history&quot; as nuclear-armed countries continue adding to their stockpiles, with the total number of operational weapons of mass destruction growing last year.

The latest research from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that the nine countries currently known to be in possession of nuclear weapons had 9,576 working nukes at the beginning of 2023, up slightly from the 9,490 total in January 2022.
Just two countries—the United States and Russia—control 90% of the world&#x27;s nuclear arsenal, respectively possessing 3,708 and 4,489 working nukes, SIPRI found. Both nations have thousands of warheads deployed on military bases with operational …</span>

                              <span>BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in Colombia&#x27;s southern jungle will tell their own story about the ordeal, the father of the two youngest siblings said on Sunday.
The children, aged 1 through 13, survived a May 1 plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults and were found on Friday in Caqueta province after weeks of searching by the military and Indigenous communities.
Their ordeal began in the early hours, when the Cessna 206 aircraft carrying seven people and traveling between Araracuara airport in Caqueta and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure.
&quot;They will tell their stories and you will hear them,&quot; said Manuel Ranoque, the father of the 1-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, after visiting them at Bogota&#x27;s military hospital.
&quot;It&#x27;s not easy to ask them because the children went 40 days without eating well, so I have not been able to get information from the oldest child,&quot; Ranoque told reporters.
Ranoque also told reporters the children&#x27;s mother had survived for four days after the crash, an account disputed by another family member who also spoke to journalists. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -At least 10 people died and 25 were injured after a chartered bus carrying wedding guests rolled off a ramp at a roundabout in the Hunter region in Australia&#x27;s New South Wales (NSW) state, police said on Monday.
The accident occurred around 11:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Sunday near the town of Greta, about 180 km (112 miles) northwest of Sydney, in an area famous for its vineyards and wedding spots.
&quot;I understand they had been at a wedding together, it&#x27;s my understanding they were travelling together ... presumably for their accommodation,&quot; NSW Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Tracy Chapman said during a televised media briefing.
At this stage, it appeared to be a single-vehicle accident, Chapman said. Police were still trying to identify all the passengers, …</span>

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran&#x27;s supreme leader on Sunday said a deal with the West over Tehran&#x27;s nuclear work was possible if the country&#x27;s nuclear infrastructure remained intact, amid a stalemate between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.
Months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since September, with both sides accusing each other of making unreasonable demands.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#x27;s guarded approval comes days after both Tehran and Washington denied a report that they were nearing an interim deal under which Tehran would curb its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, also a federal lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s ruling party, is the subject of a criminal case filed by seven female wrestlers who accused him of groping young athletes at training camps and tournaments.
Singh has denied all the allegations. Delhi police are investigating and will submit their findings before a trial court on Thursday.

KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - For Kherson resident Iryna Radetska, the catastrophic flooding of her city after the giant Kakhovka dam was destroyed is the latest chapter in more than a year of wartime suffering.
&quot;They say a new love kills the old one. Maybe it&#x27;s the same with tragedy,&quot; said 52-year-old Radetska, who is deputy head of a school in the southern Ukrainian city.
Few places have felt the extent of suffering that Kherson has since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Few people bore the brunt of it harder than Radetska, who said she has survived imprisonment, beatings and rockets.
The city, which had a peacetime population of 280,000, was occupied by Russian forces on March 2, 2022. It was liberated by Ukrainian troops in early November, but since then has b…</span>

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) - Honduras opened an embassy in China on Sunday, Chinese state media reported, after the Central American nation cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan earlier this year.
The embassy in Beijing was opened by foreign ministers from the two countries, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro is in China for a state visit, during which she is to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, state media have reported.
Tegucigalpa in March ended its decades-long relationship with Taipei and established diplomatic ties with Beijing.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that a counteroffensive was underway as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Kyiv and criticised Russia over flooding from the breached Kakhovka dam.
&quot;Counteroffensive and defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine: at which stage I will not talk in detail,&quot; Zelensky said at a joint press conference in Kyiv with Trudeau.
Zelensky commented after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv&#x27;s long-expected counteroffensive was already failing.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
