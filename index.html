The publication of the Independent Commission report into Equity in Cricket came in the wake of a racism scandal centred around the treatment of Pakistan-born bowler Azeem Rafiq at English side Yorkshire.
Rafiq went public with allegations of racism and bullying in 2020, prompting the England and Wales Cricket Board to commission the report.
Six former Yorkshire players found guilty of using racist language in the Rafiq case were last month fined by the Cricket Discipline Commission.

Instead, an increasingly vocal Christian-led opposition was granted the spot, highlighting the struggles South Korea&#x27;s campaigners for LGBTQ rights face.
The heat, humidity and backlash still did not deter supporters from throning to Seoul&#x27;s Queer Parade, which organizers estimated drew a crowd of around 50,000 people.

&quot;No, no. All the evidence is coming back,&quot; he replied, according to a White House transcript.

Britain ceded the long-time colony to China in 1997 under a 50-year governance model known as &quot;one country, two systems&quot;, which guaranteed key freedoms and a measure of autonomy.
These rights -- such as the freedom of assembly -- set Hong Kong apart from the mainland, and July 1 was once a day of demonstrations for the city&#x27;s outspoken civil society.
But following huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019, China imposed a sweeping national security law that -- when combined with legal changes putting &quot;patriots&quot; in charge -- effectively stamped out most forms of dissent from Hong Kong …</span>

Politico: Pentagon to filmmakers: We won’t help you if you kowtow To China

 
DOD will no longer work with directors if their movie will be censored by Beijing. 
If you’re a filmmaker and you want the Pentagon’s help, from now on you’ll have to guarantee that you won’t let China censor your movie first. 
On Wednesday, the Defense Department updated its rules for working with movie studios to prohibit any assistance to directors who plan to comply or will likely comply with censorship demands from the Chinese government in order to distribute their movie there. 
The issue came to a head with last year’s release of “Top Gun: Maverick.” In trailers for the film, viewers noticed that the studio removed the flags of Taiwan and Japan from Capt. Pete “Maverick” Mitchell’s flight jacket in an apparent attempt to appease Chinese investor Tencent. 
But after criticism in the U.S. — and after Tencent reportedly dropped its investment in the film –– the flags were restored in the final version.

France has been shaken by a wave of violence sparked by the killing of a teenager of North African descent by police. 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday postponed a long-planned state visit to Germany to deal with the worsening turmoil in France, in a clear sign of the gravity of the violent protests gripping the country. 
The killing of a 17-year-old of North African descent by a police officer on Tuesday has thrown France into chaos, sparking violent demonstrations in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, where the teen was shot. The violence has spread to other big cities.

Warzone/The Drive: Poland Wants To Host NATO Nukes To Counter Russia

 
Poland says Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus are driving its desire to be part of NATO’s nuclear sharing program.  
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says his country wants to join NATO&#x27;s nuclear weapon sharing program. This is in direct response to Russia&#x27;s deployment of some of its own nuclear weapons to neighboring Belarus. This also comes as Poland is pushing ahead with a massive conventional rearmament effort that was accelerated in the wake of the all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine last year. 
Prime Minister Morawiecki made his remarks about Poland&#x27;s desire to become of NATO&#x27;s nuclear weapon sharing arrangements in response to a question at a press conference on the sidelines of a European Union in Brussels, Belgium, earlier today.

The Telegraph: Nigel Farage says he may have to leave UK after bank closes his accounts 
Nigel Farage has said he may be forced to leave Britain after his bank closed his accounts and others refused his custom. 
The former UKIP leader said his personal and business accounts with a major retail bank have been closed because of a “commercial decision” and other high street firms have refused to allow him to transfer his funds to them. 
Mr Farage told The Telegraph he may have been the victim of “blatant corporate prejudice” because of his campaigning for Brexit, or fallen foul of “politically exposed person” rules designed to lower banks’ exposure to bribery and money-laundering.

WNU Editor: There is zero evidence that he has done anything illegal. This is political, with the UK banking system clearly colluding to ban citizens that they disagree with politically. 
And it gets worse. There is no outcry over this ban, and little if any media coverage. 
A friend of mine in the UK is telling me that the British establishment is driving out anyone that they disagree with, and closing their access to a bank account is one of the tools that they are using. 
The Duran has a good analysis on why this is happening (see video below).

(Bloomberg) -- The US must lift sanctions against China if the Biden administration wants high-level communication between the Chinese and American armed forces, a Chinese diplomat said on Wednesday. 
“The US side knows the reason for difficulties in its military-to-military relations with China — it actually imposed unilateral sanctions on China,” Liu Pengyu, the spokesman for China’s Embassy in Washington, said in a briefing on Wednesday. 
“Such obstacles should be removed before any exchange and cooperation could take place between the two countries.”

 VOA: Chinese Army Invasion of Taiwan Not a Given, US General Says 
WASHINGTON - There is still time to dissuade Beijing not to use force to reunify Taiwan with mainland China, according to America’s most senior military official. 
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, said Friday that despite well-publicized plans calling for the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, there is no indication Chinese President Xi Jinping has made a decision one way or the other. 
Speaking to an audience at the National Press Club in Washington, Milley said that gives the U.S. and other countries time to show Xi the use of force would be a bad idea.

“You want to make sure that every single day, President Xi wakes up and says, &#x27;Today is not that day,&#x27; and that that decision never comes,” he said.

The junta has rallied behind Russia and brought in the paramilitary Wagner Group to meet its security needs.

The UN Security Council on Friday voted to end a decade-old peacekeeping mission in Mali as demanded by the country&#x27;s military junta. 
The French-drafted resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, ordered the mission, known as MINUSMA, to immediately start the withdrawal of over 15,000 personnel. 
The pullout is to be completed by the end of the year.

Fourth night of demonstrations sees 45,000 police deployed as authorities claim the situation is calmer 
More than 1,300 people were arrested in a fourth night of violence in France after the police shooting of a 17-year-old boy. 
Forty-five thousand police officers, including special forces, were deployed to respond to rioting across the country on Friday night, with the situation in two big cities – Marseille and Lyon – highlighted as particularly chaotic, with buildings and vehicles torched and stores looted. 
The ministry of the interior reported that 1,311 people were arrested overnight, while 79 police officers and gendarmes were injured and 2,500 fires were recorded.

EU leaders at the Brussels summit also called on China to press Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine. But they failed to agree on a plan to distribute migrants in the bloc, after it was blocked by Poland and Hungary. 
European Union leaders pledged to reduce their economic dependence on China, as they concluded a two-day summit in Brussels on Friday. 
The bloc&#x27;s leaders vowed to pursue a mutually beneficial economic relationship with Beijing that would &quot;continue to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities,&quot; they said in a joint statement. 
&quot;We must prevent strategic dependencies. It will take a few years for companies to diversify, but it will remain an economic cooperation which is also necessary in terms of climate policies and food security,&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.

Update #2: EU leaders agree to &#x27;de-risk&#x27; the bloc&#x27;s trade dealings with China (SCMP)

 
WNU Editor: Not everyone is onboard. Hungary&#x27;s foreign minister Péter Szijjártó says that efforts by Europe to decouple or derisk from China would be an act of economic suicide (see video below). 
As to what is my take. 
The EU&#x27;s economic/business model was based on obtaining cheap and relaible energy imports from Russia that in turn help make European products competitve in global markets and inflation in control. That model no longer exists, and targeting countries like China is not going to solve the economic problems that Europe is facing.</span>

                              <span>CNN: Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro barred from running for office for 8 years  
Brazil’s highest electoral court has barred former President Jair Bolsonaro from running for political office until 2030, after finding him guilty of abusing his power and misusing public media during last year’s election campaign. 
Five out of seven judges found the former president guilty, effectively ending any hope of a political comeback in the forthcoming 2026 election. Two of the judges voted against the decision, which prevents Bolsonaro from running for public office for eight years. 
The case stems from a meeting Bolsonaro held with foreign ambassadors in July 2022, in which he spread false information about Brazil’s electoral system and brought its credibility into question ahead of last year’s fractious election. The meeting was livestreamed by official television channels and on YouTube.

WNU Editor: That is one way to get rid of your political opponent. Former President Jair Bolsonaro has already said that he will appeal the decision. 
Asto what is my take. 

I have always said that on issues like this one the power to decide who rus (and wins) an election should ultimately reside with the voters. Not seven appointed judges.

Washington Post: CIA director, on secret trip to Ukraine, hears plan for war’s endgame 
During a secret visit to Ukraine by CIA Director William J. Burns earlier this month, Ukrainian officials revealed an ambitious strategy to retake Russian-occupied territory and open cease-fire negotiations with Moscow by the end of the year, according to officials familiar with the visit. 
 The trip by Burns, which has not been previously reported, included meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine’s top intelligence officials. It came at a critical moment in the conflict as Ukrainian forces struggle to gain an early advantage in their long-awaited counteroffensive but have yet to deploy most of their Western-trained and -equipped assault brigades.

WNU Editor: The trip was done a few weeks ago. Probably during the start of the Ukraine counteroffensive. 
According to Ukraine, the plan that CIA Director heard involved driving Russia out of the occupied territories, and then entering into talks with Moscow at the end of the year.

The New Voice of Ukraine: Ukraine’s costly counteroffensive must produce results before NATO summit – Zelenskyy 
Ukraine&#x27;s partners expect rapid success in the counteroffensive before the July NATO summit in Vilnius, but every meter of liberated territory comes at a high cost, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Spanish media, as reported by broadcaster RTVE on June 30. 
&quot;We must show results before the (NATO) summit (on July 11-12), but every meter comes at a cost of lives,&quot; said Zelenskyy. 
The president revealed that the plans for Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive have been slowed down in recent months due to heavy rains. He called on partners to continue supporting Ukraine with weapons. 
Zelenskyy noted that during the autumn 2022 counteroffensive, &quot;with respect to our allies,&quot; the supply of artillery was “too late.”

CTV News/Canadian Press: U.K. wants NATO to speed up Ukraine&#x27;s membership process as alliance prepares to meet 
Britain&#x27;s defence secretary said Thursday that he wants NATO leaders to consider fast-tracking Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the military alliance when they meet next month in Vilnius, Lithuania. 
Ben Wallace met with Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand as she visited London, where the pair talked about priorities for the upcoming NATO leaders&#x27; summit on July 11 and 12. 
Wallace said he believes the 31 member countries should consider allowing Ukraine to skip the membership action plan portion of the accession process.

Reuters: Hungary opposes EU plan to grant more money to Ukraine -PM Orban 
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary rejects the European Commission&#x27;s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU&#x27;s increased debt service costs, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told state radio on Friday. 
Orban, speaking on the sidelines of the EU summit in Brussels, said it was a &quot;ridiculous&quot; request from the Commission that Hungary should contribute more money, when Budapest - along with Poland - has not received funds from the EU&#x27;s Recovery Fund amid a rule of law dispute. 
The European Union will provide Ukraine with 50 billion euros ($54.30 billion) in aid for 2024-27, the bloc&#x27;s president said on June 20. This comes after a review of the EU&#x27;s 2021-27 shared budget, which has been depleted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and an energy crisis. High inflation and interest rates have also doubled debt-servicing costs. 
&quot;One thing is clear, we Hungarians ... will not give more money to Ukraine until they say where the previous around 70 billion euros worth of funds had gone,&quot; Orban said.

Moscow Times/AFP: Poland Detains Russian Hockey Player Suspected of Spying for Moscow 
Poland said Friday it arrested a Russian ice hockey player on suspicion of having spied for Moscow while playing for a Polish club, prompting Russia to protest and demand an &quot;immediate&quot; explanation. 
Relations between Warsaw and Moscow have been hostile historically but have reached new lows during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Poland being one of Kyiv&#x27;s staunchest allies. 
Warsaw said the man was the fourteenth person arrested in what it called a spy ring taking orders from Moscow. 
&quot;All of them were identified as foreigners from beyond the eastern border of the Republic of Poland,&quot; Warsaw&#x27;s ABW secret services said, without clarifying if all of the suspects were Russian citizens. 
 &quot;The entire group was used by the Russians to conduct intelligence activities, including monitoring railway routes, as well as spreading propaganda against NATO, Poland and the policies of the Polish government,&quot; it added.

In anticipation of a busy summer, U.S. airlines have taken measures like trimming schedules and beefing up staffing to prevent large-scale flight disruptions, though inclement weather in some regions presents a risk to travelers during the period.

                              <span>Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Friday likened Donald Trump’s plight to that of disgraced Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro.
The far-right congresswoman suggested that special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump is politically motivated, but she did the former president no favors comparing him to Bolsonaro.
She isn’t the first to make the comparison. 
Both leaders are election deniers who inspired failed insurrections after spreading baseless theories of voter fraud. 
Bolsonaro was found guilty of abusing his power and misusing public media during last year’s election, and Brazil’s highest electoral court on Friday issued a ruling that bars him for running for public office until 2030.
Brazilian prosecutors alleged that Bolsonaro in July 2022 held a meeting with foreign ambassador in which he spread misinformation about Brazil’s electoral system. 
Trump is facing a 37-count indictment over allegations he mishandled classified documents. 
“That&#x27;s EXACTLY what the American liberals are trying to do through the court system here,” Boebert tweeted.
“Unbelievable how liberals use lawfare since they can&#x27;t win fairly.”</span>

                              <span>A Brazilian court on Friday reached the majority it needs to bar far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro from politics for eight years over unfounded claims against the voting system.
Four of the seven judges of the Superior Electoral Tribunal have voted to discipline Bolsonaro for alleged abuses of power, while one so far has found in his favor.
With two votes outstanding, the trial could yet be postponed to a later date for the final ruling.
The tribunal is trying the former president on charges he abused his office and state media in making unfounded allegations of security flaws in Brazil&#x27;s electronic voting system.
Prosecutors have linked Bolsonaro&#x27;s statements to his supporters invading the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court on January 8, a week after the inauguration …</span>

                              <span>Pope Francis met Friday with the wife of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as he nears the &quot;endgame&quot; of his fight against extradition to the United States on espionage charges.
Francis, the head of the worldwide Catholic Church, &quot;received in audience Ms Stella Assange, with family members,&quot; the Vatican said in a short statement.
On Twitter, Stella Assange said she and her children had been given a private audience with the 86-year-old Argentine pontiff, adding: &quot;We are overwhelmed.&quot;
Julian Assange is in prison in Britain, fighting extradition to the US, where he faces trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010 related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could be sentenced to decades behind bars if found guilty.
During a protest in London against his extradition earlier this month, his wife said his transfer to the United States could be imminent.
&quot;Julian could be a few weeks away from extradition. We don&#x27;t have a clear timeline, but this really is the endgame,&quot; Stella Assange told reporters.
Supporters portray the Australian publisher as a martyr to press freedom.
The 51-year-old has been held since 2019 at the Belmarsh high security prison in southeast London.
He previously spent nearly seven years holed up in Ecuador&#x27;s embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault.
He claimed the allegations were politically motivated, linked to the work of WikiLeaks.</span>

If a majority of the Brasilia court&#x27;s seven judges find he abused his power by summoning ambassadors to vent unfounded claims about Brazil&#x27;s voting system ahead of last year&#x27;s vote, Bolsonaro will be ruled ineligible to hold public office until 2030.

                              <span>French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said Friday that the government was considering &quot;all options&quot; to restore order, including declaring a state of emergency, after a third night of rioting over a police officer&#x27;s killing of a youth.
Asked by reporters if a state of emergency was a possibility, as some right-wing opposition parties have demanded, Borne replied: &quot;I won&#x27;t tell you now, but we are looking at all options, with one priority: restoring order throughout the country&quot;.
The prime minister, who was visiting a police station in Evry-Courcouronnes south of Paris, is to attend a crisis security meeting chaired by President Emmanuel Macron at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT).
A state of emergency would give authorities increased powers to declare localized curfews, ban demonstrations, and give police…</span>

                              <span>Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey was on Friday described as a &quot;sexual bully&quot;, as prosecutors opened their case against him in London for a string of sexual offense charges.
&quot;Kevin Spacey Fowler is an actor; many of you will already know that,&quot; lawyer Christine Agnew told a jury at Southwark Crown Court, using the star&#x27;s full name.
&quot;He is an extremely famous actor who has won a number of awards. He is also, the prosecution allege, a man who sexually assaults other men.&quot;
Agnew said Spacey, a two-time Academy Award winner for &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, did not respect personal boundaries or space.
He was &quot;a man who it would seem delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable, a sexual bully&quot;, the lawyer alleged in her opening speech.
&quot;His preferred method of assault is it appears to grab aggressively other men in the crotch. On one occasion things went further than that.&quot;
Spacey, 63, denies three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault, and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He also pleaded not guilty to a further charge of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The alleged offenses, against four men who cannot be identified under English law, are said to have occurred between 2001 and 2013.
Agnew said Spacey had dismissed some of the allegations as &quot;quite simply made up&quot;, and others that were consensual.

The warning came ahead of a July 23 election that has been widely dubbed a sham after authorities denied registration to the chief challenger to Hun Sen&#x27;s ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party.
Facebook announced Thursday it would remove one of Hun Sen&#x27;s videos in line with a ruling by the Oversight Board for Meta, Facebook&#x27;s parent company, which also recommended his account be suspended.
Tech experts characterized the move as a &quot;turning point&quot;.
The ruling said his speech contained &quot;unequivocal statements of intent to commit violence&quot; against opposition politicians.

AFP&#x27;s fact-checkers have exposed a slew of cases around the world in which fraudsters impersonated doctors, fabricating their comments or endorsements to push out bogus treatments and products or to peddle propaganda.
The trend underscores how medical professionals are often sitting targets for online scammers seeking to profit off disinformation, which leaves their reputations tarnished, provokes harassment and, in some cases, legal challenges.

It&#x27;s not the K-pop image that South Korea usually projects to the world.
Gay marriage is banned in the country, social pressure keeps many in the closet, and the annual Pride celebration attracts vicious Christian-led opposition.
But change is coming. Hurricane Kimchi told AFP when they first went to Seoul Pride more than a decade ago only a few hundred people were there.
More than 150,000 are expected this Saturday, according to organizers, despite a growing official backlash.
This year&#x27;s celebration, one of Asia&#x27;s largest, was denied permission to use the capital&#x27;s central…</span>

The protest came a day after an Iraqi citizen living in Sweden, Salwan Momika, 37, stomped on the Islamic holy book and set several pages alight in front of the capital&#x27;s largest mosque.
Swedish police had granted him a permit in line with free-speech protections, but authorities later said they had opened an investigation over &quot;agitation&quot;.

The guessing game in Moscow these days: Where are they? 
Days after a mutiny by the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, who sent thousands of his fighters racing toward the Russian capital, a growing number of prominent commanders and public figures have disappeared from public view. 
Rattled by the biggest challenge he has faced in his 23 years as the country&#x27;s preeminent political figure, President Vladimir Putin has suggested he would root out those inside and outside the military people who have allied themselves, quietly or overtly, with Prigozhin. 
He may also be seeking to sideline those who let it happen or whose conduct of Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine has made them liabilities in his eye…</span>

Rioting and looting spread across Europe last night after the &#x27;execution&#x27; killing of a teenager in Paris - as pictures emerged of President Emmanuel Macron partying with Elton John while his country burnt, triggering a furious backlash. 
Mr Macron was filmed at Paris&#x27;s Accor Arena on Wednesday evening, watching the singer on his farewell tour, while rioters caused mayhem in the capital following the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old identifie…</span>

Zero Hedge: Biden Picks Up After Journalist Calls Secret Burner Phone Revealed In Hunter Scandal 
On Sunday, investigative journalist and Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer revealed that Hunter Biden had been paying for a secret global phone from AT&amp;T to the tune of $300 per month.
&quot;We know from the laptop that Hunter Biden&#x27;s business paid for a private phone line that Joe Biden used while he was vice president,&quot; Schweizer told Fox News&#x27; Maria Bartiromo. 
&quot;It was from AT&amp;T, it was $300 a month, it was a global phone where you could access somebody anywhere around the world.&quot;

* Russian president lapped up praise from a fervent crowd in Dagestan last night 
* It is the first time since before the pandemic he has attended such an event 
* His uncharacteristic behaviour has fuelled speculation it was a body double 
Vladimir Putin has been consolidating support in Russia following last week&#x27;s failed Wagner rebellion with a rare meet-and-greet that saw him cheered by a crowd as he posed for selfies with young girls. 
Footage from last night&#x27;s event - a presidential appearance during a trip to the city of Derbent in the Dagestan region of southern Russia - showed how he dived into a nighttime crowd like a Hollywood actor at a red carpet show. 
Seemingly imbued with fresh energy after averting a small scale civil war last week, the normally stoic and isolated Putin was uncharacteristically personable, shaking hands and planting kisses on the head of a young teenage girl who gushed over him and pleaded with her mother to snap a photo of her with the president.

* He got up and walked off set while she was still on-air 
* Biden traveled to New York to raise funds for his 2024 bid 
President Joe Biden walked off the set of a live MSNBC interview Thursday afternoon, while the cameras were still rolling. 
The president took a day trip to New York City to raise money for his presidential campaign. 
His first stop, however, was to &#x27;30 Rock,&#x27; to sit for an interview with Deadline: White House host Nicolle Wallace, who previously worked for Republicans including President George W. Bush and the late Sen. John McCain.

                              <span>VOA/AFP: Blinken Says No Nuclear Deal on Table With Iran  
New York — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that no new nuclear agreement was on the table with Iran, after quiet new diplomacy between the adversaries. 
&quot;There is no agreement in the offing, even as we continue to be willing to explore diplomatic paths,&quot; Blinken said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
&quot;We&#x27;ll see by their actions,&quot; Blinken said of the future relationship, calling on Iran to choose to &quot;not take actions that further escalate the tensions&quot; with the United States and in the Middle East. 
President Joe Biden took office with hopes of returning to a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that was scrapped by his predecessor, Donald Trump. But EU-mediated talks collapsed and mass protests in Iran made Washington increasingly hesitant to strike a deal with the clerical state.

Conflict deaths are higher than they have ever been this century with over 238,000 people killed in conflicts last year. 
Since the 21st century began, war has never cost humanity so much. The number of conflict deaths almost doubled in 2022 compared to the previous year. And war caused a 13% loss of global GDP, according to the Global Peace Index, released on Wednesday by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP). 
The major new survey by the global think tank said that the average level of &quot;global peacefulness&quot; had sunk for the ninth year in a row, with conflict deaths topping the previous global peak reached in 2014 during the Syrian Civil War. 
The dramatic increase in death rates was mostly driven by the war in Ukraine, where 83,000 people were killed in the past year, though the bloodiest conflict was in Ethiopia, where 100,000 people lost their lives.

Politico: Stoltenberg to stay on as NATO chief another year 
The move ‘will be formalized next week,’ a European diplomat said, ahead of the NATO summit in Lithuania. 
 Jens Stoltenberg is set to stay on as NATO’s chief for another year, four people familiar with the decision told POLITICO. 
A U.S. official said the secretary general’s leadership extension is “a done deal.” Asked if that was the case, a senior diplomat from Western Europe said “yes,” adding it “will be formalized next week.” A senior diplomat from Eastern Europe and a senior NATO official also confirmed there is consensus within the alliance for an extension.
The officials were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to preview the move before the official announcement. A spokesperson for NATO didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The move to retain Stoltenberg was widely rumored and expected ahead of a major NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania next month, billed as one of the most important alliance gatherings in years amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

                              <span>ABC News: Chinese spy balloon didn’t collect intelligence as it flew over US: Pentagon

 
The vessel passed over sensitive military sites before being downed in February. 
The Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean in early February was built, at least partly, using American off-the-shelf parts, a U.S. official has confirmed to ABC News. 
The official could not say whether any of the American gear was sold illicitly to China but said determining whether any of it came from illegal trade was a topic of serious concern among officials since some items -- like chips -- are forbidden to sell to certain markets.
Later Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said that the balloon not only did not transmit data back to China -- it never collected any.

                              <span>CNN: France sees third night of violence after 17-year-old shot dead by police  
Paris CNN — Parisian suburbs imposed curfews on Thursday as France saw a third night of protests across the country following the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy that was captured on video. 
France’s elite police force, the RAID, were deployed to the cities of Bordeaux, Lyon, Roubaix and Lille, to help contain the protests.
 Confrontations flared up between protesters and police in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre – where the 17-year-old named Nahel was killed days before – and in the southern port city of Marseille, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. 
Amid burning debris, “vengeance pour Nael” appeared to be spray painted on a wall in Nanterre, which translates to “revenge for Nael” in reference to the slain teenager, according to footage from the suburb.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
