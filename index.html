“There are no other crafts that can go to Titanic depths that can be mobilised in a day and a half, and even if there were, there isn’t one that can tow it back to the surface,” he told Sky News Australia.

“So I think the underwater search is an exercise in futility.”</span>

Kyiv’s forces may be temporarily halting their counteroffensive operations to re-evaluate their tactics for future operations, according to military experts. 
Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center Colonel Margo Grosberg said on 16 June that in his assessment “we won’t see an offensive over the next seven days”. 
The Wall Street Journal similarly reported on 17 June that Ukrainian forces “have mostly paused their advances in recent days” as the command in Kyiv re-examines tactics.

WNU Editor: After two weeks of fighting and losing thousands of soldiers and hundreds of pieces of equipment, the only thing that Ukraine has to show for it are about a dozen small villages and 45 square miles. A re-evaluation is necessary. 
There are also reports now coming in that Russia has launched a major offense in the northeastern part of the country. If true, Ukraine will need to draw on their reserves to counter it, thereby depriving men and equipment for their southern counteroffensive.</span>

Daily Mail: Kremlin warns US and Britain will be seen as &#x27;full-fledged&#x27; war participants if Storm Shadow and HIMARS missiles are used to hit targets in Crimea or Russia

The Kremlin has warned the US and Britain they will be seen as &#x27;full-fledged&#x27; participants in the war in Ukraine if Storm Shadow and HIMARS missiles are used to hit targets in Russia or Russian-occupied Crimea. 
Vladimir Putin&#x27;s defence minister Sergei Shoigu warned he will target &#x27;decision-making centres&#x27; in Ukraine - implying he plans to order his military to target Volodymyr Zelensky and his government leaders in Kyiv. 
Shoigu said: &#x27;According to our information, the leadership of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is planning to launch strikes on the territory of the Russian Federation, including Crimea, with HIMARS and Storm Shadow missiles.

Reuters: Ukraine targets initial $40 billion for &#x27;Green Marshall Plan&#x27; 
LONDON (Reuters) -Ukraine is seeking up to $40 billion to fund the first part of a &quot;Green Marshall Plan&quot; to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry, a senior Ukrainian official said ahead of an international summit. 
Politicians and financiers will discuss short-term funding issues as well as look at long-term reconstruction efforts at the two-day meeting, starting in London on Wednesday and co-hosted by Ukraine and Britain. 
It is expected to launch a &quot;war risk&quot; insurance scheme to cover companies that begin investing in Ukraine again and see government officials discuss behind the scenes if and how to use frozen Russian assets to fund some of the rebuild effort. 
The World Bank estimates Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction will cost more than $400 billion, three times the country&#x27;s gross domestic product. Since Russia&#x27;s invasion in February 2022, external backers have poured $59 billion into Ukraine to support it during the war.

WNU Editor: I just finished talking to a friend who lives in Odessa. And all that he talked about (besides the war) was how bad the corruption has become in the country. Basically if you want something, be ready to pay a bribe. 
I have zero confidence that the monies for this &#x27;Green Marshall Plan&#x27;, plus an EU financial package of $50 billion that is now being arranged, will go to the people who will rebuild the country. It is going to go somewhere else.</span>

The Times reported on Sunday.

Daily Mail: Biden warns Putin&#x27;s threat to use tactical nuclear weapons is &#x27;real&#x27; after Russian despot moved them close to the Polish border in Belarus 
* President Biden denounced Russia&#x27;s deployment of such weapons in Belarus 
* Belarus said they have started taking delivery of the tactical nuclear weapons 
Joe Biden has warned the threat of Russian President Vladimir Putin using tactical nuclear weapons is &#x27;real&#x27;, days after denouncing Russia&#x27;s deployment of such weapons in Belarus. 
It comes after Biden on Saturday called Putin&#x27;s announcement that Russia had deployed its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus &#x27;absolutely irresponsible&#x27;. 
&#x27;When I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,&#x27; Biden told a group of donors in California on Monday.

* Pair of charges relate to alleged failure to pay taxes 
* Other charge relates to sworn statement regarding drugs for gun purchase 
Hunter Biden has reached a deal with prosecutors that would see him plead guilty to a trio of crimes but likely avoid jail time, according to new Justice Department filings. 
The president&#x27;s son has been under investigation for five years for tax and financial allegations, as well as for paperwork for purchasing a handgun where he attested that he did not abuse drugs. 
That contradicted admissions in his own autobiography where he detailed an addiction to crack cocaine that led to a stint in rehab.

It’s unclear if Beijing and Havana have already struck a deal, or when one would be completed. 
China and Cuba are in active conversations about creating a new joint military training facility on the island nation 100 miles from the American homeland. 
According to a senior U.S. official, Beijing and Havana are discussing what kind of training would take place at the facility and what the leadership structure would look like. Biden administration officials have brought up these talks with their counterparts in Beijing and Havana. It’s unclear, however, how far along China and Cuba are in their chats about the prospects for a deal, the official said.

New York Times: Blinken Visit Reveals Chasm in How U.S. and China Perceive Rivalry 
An austere greeting on the airport tarmac in Beijing sans a red carpet. A stone-faced handshake from China’s top foreign policy official. A seat looking up at the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, perched at the head of a long table. 
To international audiences, the optics of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s two-day visit to Beijing barely raised any eyebrows. Foreign ministers are rarely, if ever, met with much fanfare at the airport. And an audience with a head of state alone is a sign of great importance and respect. 
But to nationalist-leaning audiences in China, especially on social media, the scenes…</span>

Politico: Western countries launch a raft of plans to keep up with Ukraine’s weapons needs

 
NATO leaders are expected to sign off on a new defense production plan next month. But can industry keep up? 
NATO defense ministers wrapped up two days of meetings in Brussels Friday where they pledged billions more in military aid for Ukraine as Kyiv enters the second week of its long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia. 
At the same time, officials in the U.S. and Europe intensified plans to build more weapons for Ukraine over the long-term while also working to restock their own shelves at home.

Zero Hedge: China Says Xi, Blinken Meeting Was Just A &quot;Courtesy&quot;, Castigates US For &quot;Misperceptions&quot; 
Initial statements to come out of Monday&#x27;s meeting between President Xi Jinping and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken were generally positive and upbeat, with an emphasis on healing ties. But more statements were issued in follow-up upon the conclusion of Blinken&#x27;s two day visit to Beijing. 
It seems China wants to let it be known that it will maintain the upper hand while not being too eager to embrace diplomatic détente. According to the latest from Bloomberg: 

    
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was &quot;out of courtesy&quot; in which Xi gave strategic guidelines over the bilateral ties, Chinese state television reports, citing Yang Tao, an official at the Foreign Ministry.

Firstly, as the incumbent, Biden&#x27;s bid for re-election is customary. 

&quot;Number two, and probably just as importantly, he&#x27;s there to beat Donald Trump,&quot; Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia.

&quot;He beat Donald Trump in 2020 ... the Democrats simply want him to do it again.&quot;</span>

Top North Korean officials have labelled their botched attempt to launch a spy satellite their &quot;most serious&quot; shortcoming this year and vowed to make a second attempt soon. 
In late May, a North Korean rocket carrying a military reconnaissance satellite crashed soon after lift-off. 
State media reported the launch was heavily discussed during a three-day ruling party meeting over the weekend and was referred to as &quot;the gravest failure&quot;.

Daily Mail: EXCLUSIVE: 71% of Americans and half of all Democrats say Biden, 80, is too old to be president and most voters say they are worse off since he took power, according to damning DailyMail.com poll 
* Some 71 percent of voters say 80-year-old Joe Biden is too old to be president 
* That includes 49 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of independent voters 
* The data come from a new DailyMail/JL Partners poll of 1000 likely voters 
A new poll for DailyMail.com lays bare the challenge facing President Joe Biden as he runs for reelection: Almost half of Democrats believe he is too old for the job, and 52 of all voters believe they are worse off since he became president. 
Republicans have used both as attack lines in their campaigns to unseat Biden. 
The president has always been gaffe-prone, but now any botched comment is seized on as evidence that the 80-year-old is no longer fit for office

                              <span>New York Times: In Rush to Arm Ukraine, Weapons Are Bought but Not Delivered, or Too Broken to Use 
Ukraine has paid contractors hundreds of millions of dollars for weapons that have not been delivered, and some of the much-publicized arms donated by its allies have been so decrepit that they were deemed fit only to be cannibalized for spare parts. 
Ukrainian government documents show that as of the end of last year, Kyiv had paid arms suppliers more than $800 million since the Russian invasion in February 2022 for contracts that went completely or partly unfulfilled. 
Two people involved in Ukraine’s arms purchasing said that some of the missing weapons had eventually been delivered, and that in other cases brokers had refunded the money. But as of early this spring, hundreds of millions of dollars had been paid — including to state-owned companies — for arms never materialized, one of these people said.

Washington Post: Russia aims to defeat counteroffensive with mines, artillery and aviation 
RIGA, Latvia — As Ukraine readied its counteroffensive by gathering Western weapons and sending its troops for NATO training, Russia spent at least seven months preparing for this potentially definitive stage of the war — by readying reserves, artillery and aviation support, stockpiling ammunition and fuel, and procuring more drones. 
Russian forces also burrowed into the territory they occupy in southeast Ukraine, digging lines of trenches and erecting fortifications along the entire 900-mile-long front…</span>

First Post: &#x27;Iron General&#x27;: Putin hints that Ukraine&#x27;s top general may be abroad 
In a report by Russia&#x27;s RIA Novosti news agency last month, citing a security source, it was claimed that Zaluzhny had suffered severe injuries in a Russian missile strike near Kherson in early May 
During a meeting with Russian military correspondents and bloggers, President Vladimir Putin suggested that General Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of Kiev’s armed forces, could be outside of Ukraine. 
Speculation about Zaluzhny’s whereabouts arose after he missed a high-profile NATO meeting and reports claimed he was gravely wounded in a Russian missile strike. 
While the Ukrainian Defense Ministry denies these allegations, Putin stated that he believes Zaluzhny is abroad, although he admitted that he could be mistaken.

WNU Editor: You do not miss critical NATO meetings if you are head of the Ukraine military. But General Zaluzhny has. My gut now tells me that he has not been wounded, he has been fired, especially since it was known that he was been against the counteroffensive in the first place.

                              <span>Reuters: Ukraine says eight villages retaken from Russian forces in two weeks 
KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine said on Monday it had driven Russian forces from an eighth village in its two-week-old counteroffensive, a settlement on a heavily fortified part of the front line near the most direct route to the country&#x27;s Azov Sea coast. 
A Russian-installed official said on Sunday that Ukraine had taken control of the village, Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. He later said Moscow had pushed them out and on Monday morning he said Ukraine was attacking again. 
Ukraine&#x27;s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had not only retaken Piatykhatky but had advanced by up to seven km (4.3 miles) into Russian lines in two weeks, capturing 113 square km (44 square miles) of land.

Five Palestinians were killed as heavy clashes broke out between gunmen and Israeli troops in the city of Jenin on Monday morning. 
An Israeli helicopter gunship carried out rare strikes, the first in the West Bank in some two decades, in order for seven wounded soldiers to be evacuated from the battle zone after a vehicle was hit by an explosive device, the military and local officials said.
In a brief joint statement, the Israel Defense Forces and Border Police said forces entered the northern West Bank city in the early morning hours to detain two wanted Palestinians.

                              <span>WNU Editor: Here is my take on US Secretary Of State Antony Blinken&#x27;s visit to China. 
1) The only positive thing that can be said of this trip is that President Xi decided to spend a brief time (and it was very brief) with the US Secretary. 
2) The readout from the meeting that US Secretary Blinken had with the Chinese foreign minister was harsh and brutal. It was basically China telling the U.S. to &quot;wise up&quot;. 
3) Economic decoupling was rejected by both sides. 
4) There is a great divide between the two countries on Ukraine, Taiwan, and the West&#x27;s rule based international order. 
5) No plans for Biden and Xi to meet in the future. 
 6) No Chinese &quot;apology&quot; for buzzing US ships and planes in Asia. 
7) U.S. statements by its leaders in the past few months that war is coming against China is another issue that the Chinese are not happy hearing. All that I can say is that if the US wants better relations with China, talking about war is not going to help. 
8) China is asserting its role as an equal to the U.S..</span>

                              <span>The Hill: Xi rejects US offer to set up military crisis hotline, Blinken says  
China rejected a U.S. offer to set up a direct military line of communication between Washington and Beijing that is a priority goal for the Biden administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday. 
Blinken’s remarks came at a press conference shortly after he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a rare exception to diplomatic protocol that signals the seriousness with which Beijing took Blinken’s visit and the relationship. 
But Blinken said that while he “repeatedly” raised the need for the U.S. and Chinese militaries to have a crisis communication line to quickly tamp down tensions and walk back confrontations, “at this moment, China has not agreed to move forward with that.”

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing today after China warned Washington it must choose between &#x27;cooperation or conflict&#x27; and said there is &#x27;no room to compromise&#x27; on Taiwan. 
Blinken&#x27;s meeting with Xi at the Great Hall of the People marked the highest-level visit by a US official to Beijing in nearly five years. 
During the meeting, Xi told Blinken he hoped his visit would make a &#x27;positive contribution&#x27; in improving ties between Beijing and Washington…</span>

EurAsian Times: ATACMS For Ukraine! After Abrams &amp; F-16s, US Defense Bill OKs HIMARS-Fired Army Tactical Missile System For Kyiv 
The US could finally deliver Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) to Ukraine as the draft defense bill allocates $80 million to purchase the weapon for Kyiv’s military. 
It will, however, be at least a year until the weapon reaches Ukraine, given the ensuing procedural and industrial process, because the missile will not be dispatched from US military stockpiles. It will be ordered from the industry, which will take time to manufacture. 
Thus after main battle tanks and F-16 fighters, this becomes the third weapon system the US approved after a year of initially declining sending them to Ukraine.

Michael Rubin, AEI/19fortyfive.com: Can Biden Deter a Russia Nuclear Attack on Ukraine? Yes, if He Gives Ukraine Tactical Nukes 
Fear of nuclear exchange has long colored White House thinking on Ukraine. 
As Russian troops invaded Ukraine sixteen months ago, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan offered to evacuate Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian president rebuffed the offer. “I need ammunition, not a ride,” he responded. 
Even as Ukrainian forces defied the U.S. intelligence estimate, first blunting and then rolling back the Russian Army, fear of how Russian President Vladimir Putin might react led Washington to restrict assistance that could enable Ukraine to quicken its counterassault and save tens of thousands of lives.

WNU Editor: Michael Rubin is insane. Giving U.S. nuclear weapons to a regime that Moscow regards is run by Neo-Nazis will result in World War 3.

VOA/Reuters: Russian Attack Cannot Be Ruled Out, Says Swedish Parliamentary Report – SVT 
Stockholm — A Swedish parliament defense committee report said a Russian military attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out, Swedish public service broadcaster SVT said on Sunday, citing sources. 
Sweden has been scrambling to bolster its defenses and applied to join NATO last year following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Sweden was invited to apply but Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify the application. 
The parliamentary report, due to be published on Monday, said that although Russian ground forces were tied up in Ukraine, other types of military attacks against Sweden could not be ruled out, SVT said, citing sources who worked on the report.

The Cradle: Taliban, China discuss banking cooperation

 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021 
The Taliban’s governor of the Afghan central bank Hidayatullah Badri met with Chinese envoy Wang Yu this week to discuss banking ties and business, the bank’s spokesperson informed Reuters on 16 June. 
“In this meeting, economy, banking relations, business and some related topics were discussed,” said Badri. 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021. 
Following the withdrawal, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Italian news outlet La Repubblica that China would be its principal partner in rebuilding Afghanistan after a 20-year US occupation.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held &quot;candid&quot; talks with his Chinese counterpart at the start of two days of meetings with officials in China, the US state department says. 
Mr Blinken emphasised the need for diplomacy and keeping &quot;open channels of communication&quot;, a statement added. 
His trip is the first by a top US diplomat to China in almost five years.

A planned Blinken visit in February was called off after a suspected Chinese spy balloon flew in US airspace. 
US officials say the main goal of the Beijing talks is to stabilise a relationship that has become extremely tense.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Helped by buoyant oil prices and a period of political calm at home and in the region, Iraq appears more stable than any time since the U.S.-led invasion, although the government&#x27;s bid to cement gains with a budget splurge may prove a shaky foundation.
In office since October, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has launched a programme to rebuild infrastructure and attract foreign investors, but analysts say the plans are at risk from an uncertain oil price outlook and face the challenge of maintaining delicate diplomacy in a volatile region.
&quot;We are positive in the short-term outlook but medium to longer-term there are major challenges,&quot; said one Western diplomat.

In Finland&#x27;s eastern Karelia region, home to boreal forests and wetlands, climate change is pushing local farmers into conflict with wildlife.
&quot;Many farmers in this region have completely lost faith in the fairness of society,&quot; Pekonen says.
Two decades ago, few Barnacle geese stopped in Finland to feed during their migration north across the Arctic, where they nest, from their wintering areas in the Netherlands, Germany and beyond.
But now they number hundreds of thousands in Finland.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Flags flew lowered in the Canadian province of Manitoba on Friday following a deadly crash between a bus carrying mostly elderly passengers and a truck, as investigators identified the injured and reviewed video footage from a camera mounted on the truck.
Fifteen people were killed and another 11 people were injured in the fiery collision on Thursday between a bus headed to a casino and a tractor-trailer truck at a highway junction near the town of Carberry, 170 km (105 miles) west of Winnipeg.
It was one of Canada&#x27;s worst recent road crashes.
Crash investigators determined from video footage of the wreck that the bus entered the roadway where the tractor-trailer rig had the right of way, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendent Rob Lasson to…</span>

BRASILIA (Reuters) -One of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s closest aides sought legal advice for a military intervention that would have prevented the handover of power following last October&#x27;s election, federal police said on Friday.
Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid was one of Bolsonaro&#x27;s personal assistants who stayed on as an aide after he stepped down. He is under arrest over allegations that he faked Bolsonaro&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination card.
According to an analysis of Cid&#x27;s seized cell phone, a federal police report said he had &quot;gathered documents with the aim of obtaining &#x27;legal and judicial&#x27; support for the execution of a coup d&#x27;état.&quot;
Cid&#x27;s lawyer Bernardo Fenelon said in a statement that his client would only defend himself to investigators.

                              <span>After years of demonizing billionaire investor George Soros as a sinister liberal bogeyman, the Hungarian government and its allied media are taking aim at a fresh target -- his son Alexander.
Monday&#x27;s announcement that the elder Soros will hand over control of his philanthropic empire to 37-year-old Alexander, who goes by the name of Alex, prompted an object lesson in the workings of media loyal to nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The 92-year-old Soros has become a bête noire of the international far right because of the activities of his Open Society Foundations (OSF).
In Hungary, the government accuses him of wanting to &quot;flood Europe&quot; with migrants because of the OSF&#x27;s support for refugee rights advocates.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court on Friday upheld an asylum-seeker pact between Canada and the United States.
Under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement, which came into effect in 2004, asylum seekers who cross the land border between the two countries are turned around and sent back on the grounds that they should apply for asylum in the first &quot;safe&quot; country they arrived in.
Built-in safety valves mean the agreement does not violate asylum seekers&#x27; right to life, liberty and security of the person, the Supreme Court ruled. But it sent the case back to federal court for a ruling on whether the agreement breaches asylum seekers&#x27; right to equal treatment under the law.
The two countries amended the agreement earlier this year, making it apply to the l…</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
