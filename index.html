   WNU Editor: What astounds me about the US in the current crisis is that with the exception of Jack Posobiec and a few commentators, no one is discussing how US involvement in the Russia - Ukraine war can quickly escalate into something far worse. No discussion. No debate. Nothing but crickets. But else where in the world .... there is nothing but discussion and debate 24/7.</span>

FOX News: NATO member urges allies to pay more after Ukraine war anniversary, claims &#x27;crisis&#x27; in UN 
Estonia led charge calling for tribunal to examine potential Russian war crimes 
UNITED NATIONS, New York — Estonia has criticized NATO allies for not doing enough to continue supporting Ukraine as Russia’s invasion drags on past the one-year mark, and it also raised concerns that the U.N. may not be able to fulfill its duty in holding those in power responsible for alleged war crimes. 
&quot;Members have not done enough,&quot; Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. 
&quot;This is my comprehensive assessment.&quot;  &quot;The Western camp has supported weapons aid, given around 50 billion euros approximately, and this is far from being satisfying,&quot; Reinsalu added. &quot;If we want to invest to Ukrainian victory, not only to invest to Ukraine, that they can survive and not lose, we have to change the paradigm of our support.&quot;

Thomas Meaney, New York Times: In Ukraine, the United States Is In Over Its Head 
The greatest blunder President Vladimir Putin may have made so far in Ukraine is giving the West the impression that Russia could lose the war. The early Russian strike on Kyiv stumbled and failed. The Russian behemoth seemed not nearly as formidable as it had been made out to be. The war suddenly appeared as a face-off between a mass of disenchanted Russian incompetents and supercharged, savvy Ukrainian patriots. 
Such expectations naturally ratcheted up Ukrainian war aims. President Volodymyr Zelensky was once a member of the peace-deal camp in Ukraine. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,” he declared one month into the conflict. Now he calls for complete victory: the reconquering of every inch of Russian-occupied territory, including Crimea. Polls indicate that Ukrainians will settle for nothing less. As battles rage across Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine’s leaders and some of their Western backers are already dreaming of Nuremberg-style trials of Mr. Putin and his inner circle in Moscow.

VOA: US Army Secretary Lays Out Strategy for War with China  
Washington — The Biden administration official with direct responsibility for the U.S. Army laid out in surprising detail this week a multi-pronged strategy for deterring, and if necessary, prevailing in any future war with China. 
“I personally am not of the view that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent,” U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on Monday. “But we obviously have to prepare, to be prepared to fight and win that war.” 
Elements of the plan include placing more troops in Asia and arming them with upgraded equipment, including ship-to-shore vessels and hypersonic weapons, much of which will be pre-positioned in the region.

 El Pais: Ukraine outgunned 10 to 1 in massive artillery battle with Russia 
 Kyiv urgently requires ammunition as the Kremlin seeks a breakthrough on the eastern front, where Moscow is sending waves of infantry to deplete the defenders’ stocks of heavy shells 
The Ukraine war has become a ferocious battle dominated by artillery and Ukrainian forces are operating at a huge disadvantage: Russia has numerical superiority of 10 heavy guns to every one at the disposal of Kyiv. Furthermore, Ukraine is running low on ammunition and requires urgent supplies of shells, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government has warned. 
On the Luhansk front, at one of the Ukrainian army’s advanced positions in the area around the occupied city of Kreminna where the fighting is particularly intense, an artillery brigade is busy tuning a TRF1 howitzer cannon installed amid their sodden trenches. They received the French 155mm gun a few months ago and it is proving key to repelling Russian troops. But as the war enters its second year, Kyiv is in desperate need of fresh materiel. “We need more; we need all the ammunition they can provide. And we need it now,” says Sergey, the brigade commander, anchored next to the cannon in the mud.

WNU editor: My father commanded an artillery unit in the Second World War. He always credited Soviet artillery as the reason why Germany was defeated on the Eastern front. And the stats back my father. In the last two years of that war, artillery strikes accounted for 70% of all combat casualties. I suspect the same thing is happening right now in the Russia - Ukraine war.</span>

The JPO issued an order Wednesday evening recommending the fleetwide retrofit — globally, not just American aircraft — over the next three months, as well as immediately putting it in place for a “small number” of fighters that have been grounded since December.

Bloomberg: Putin Orders New Rules for Defense Firms in Case of Martial Law 
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Friday laying out new rules for tightening control of companies that fail to fulfill defense contracts in the event martial law is imposed, the latest step in the Kremlin’s preparations for militarizing the economy as its invasion of Ukraine stretches into a second year. 
Under the decree, the state would get the power to take over firms that fail to meet their obligations under military contracts during the period of martial law, suspending the rights of owners and shareholders. 
A government working group is to be set up on the operations of arms companies under martial law, according to the order, the text of which was published Friday.

WNU Editor: For the past few weeks I have been reading reports that Ukraine is using 3,000 to 7,000 artillery shells a day, and the Russian military is using anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 shells a day. Even at 250,000 shells a day, Ukraine will not have enough to match what Russia is using.</span>

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong women&#x27;s rights group cancelled a demonstration at the last minute on Saturday after police said violent groups might want to join the protest.
The Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association was originally granted permission by Hong Kong police to hold a rare public protest on Sunday ahead of International Women&#x27;s Day, calling for labour rights, women’s rights and gender equality.
But the association said on its Facebook page late on Saturday it had regrettably decided to cancel the march without giving a reason. It could not immediately be reached for further comment.
This would have been the first major civil rights protest to be approved by police in the city for several years.

Earlier this week, several companies announced that Canada&#x27;s federal health agency had allowed them to produce and sell cocaine.
The announcement came a month after the province of British Columbia launched an experimental decriminalization process meant to address an opioid overdose crisis that has killed thousands.
The province decriminalized the possession -- but not sale -- of small amounts of cocaine and other hard drugs, under a three-year pilot project, with the aim of removing the stigma associated with drug use that keeps people from seeking help.

Marine biologists were alerted to the find by beach walkers who stumbled upon the grim sight last week in Gansbaai, a small fishing port 150 kilometers (93 miles) south east of Cape Town.
&quot;The dead sharks are torn open at the pelvic girdle, they have Orca teeth marks known as rake marks on their pectoral fins and their liver is missing,&quot; said Alison Towner, 37, a shark scientist with the Dyer Island Conservation Trust.

                              <span>Olive oil, fragrant rose and orange blossom: the special &quot;chrism&quot; or holy anointing oil for the coronation of Britain&#x27;s King Charles III has been blessed in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City.
Friday&#x27;s ceremony was carried out at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe Jesus was buried.
&quot;The chrism oil which will be used to anoint His Majesty The King on May 6 2023 has been consecrated in Jerusalem,&quot; Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
The unique mix was &quot;perfumed with essential oils&quot;, and also included extracts of sesame, jasmine and cinnamon, it added.
Based on the same ingredients as the oil used at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, it is based on a formula &quot;which has been used for hundreds of years&quot;, the palace said Friday.
The oil, which will also be used to anoint Queen Consort Camilla, the wife of King Charles III, was consecrated in a special by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, and the Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum.
Now stored in an ornate silver flask, the oil came from the Mount of Olives, the ridge overlooking the walled Old City.
The olives were harvested from two groves, the Monastery of the Ascension and the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, where Charles III&#x27;s grandmother is buried, Princess Alice of Greece.
The olives were pressed just outside the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican church, said the coronation oil reflects Charles III&#x27;s &quot;personal family connection with the Holy Land&quot;, the palace statement added.
Welby, who will carry out the coronation service, said the oil signified the &quot;deep historic link between the coronation, the Bible and the Holy Land&quot;.
&quot;From ancient kings through to the present day, monarchs have been anointed with oil from this sacred place,&quot; he said.

Russia and its ally Belarus have been sidelined from most Olympic sports since Russian forces invaded Ukraine last February.
However, in January the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was seeking a &quot;pathway&quot; for Russians to take part in the Games.
Following that announcement, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) offered athletes from both countries the chance to compete in this year&#x27;s Asian Games.
That was a significant move because they could gain qualifying marks in competition in Asia to allow them to compete in Paris.
Africa has now followed suit.

Researchers believe they have found the earliest evidence of horseback riding, by the ancient Yamnaya people in Europe some 5,000 years ago.
Their conclusions, based on an analysis of human skeletal remains found in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, were published on Friday in the journal Science Advances.
Domestication of horses for milk is widely accepted to have begun around 3500 BC to 3000 BC, the study said, but the &quot;origins of horseback riding remain elusive.&quot;
The researchers from the University of Helsinki and other European institutions date the earliest horsemanship to 3000 BC to 2500 BC among members of the Yamnaya culture.
&quot;Our findings provide a strong argument that horseback riding was already a common activity for some Yamnaya individual…</span>

                              <span>Rafael Vinoly, a Uruguayan-born and New York-based architect known for designing landmark buildings around the world, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Friday.
Vinoly&#x27;s death Thursday was announced by his son Roman on the website of the family firm, Rafael Vinoly Architects.
&quot;He was a visionary who will be missed by all those whose lives he touched through his work,&quot; the son&#x27;s statement said.
Vinoly&#x27;s sometimes controversial work features more than 600 structures around the world, including office and residential buildings, hotels, concert halls, stadiums and airports.
One of his better known works is the so-called Walkie Talkie building in London -- an almost cartoonish skyscraper that is broader at the top than the bottom and looks like it is sagging. 
Britain&#x27;s Manchester City football team, for which Vinoly designed its training ground, called City Football Academy, expressed its condolences on Twitter.
Some of Vinoly&#x27;s projects have drawn criticism.
One is 432 Park Avenue, an 85-floor residential building in Manhattan, some of whose multi-millionaire tenants have sued over what they say are banging and creaking noises and vibrations coming from the building.
In London, the Walkie Talkie building at 20 Fenchurch Street raised eyebrows in 2013 because sunlight reflected off its mirrored concave side melted various parts on a Jaguar car parked nearby.
&quot;He leaves a rich legacy of distinctive and timeless designs that manifested in some of the world&#x27;s most recognizable and iconic structures,&quot; Roman Vinoly wrote.

                              <span>When &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; first premiered back in September, there was little to suggest it was about to wage an all-out campaign for Oscar votes.
The German-language World War I film comes from Netflix, which had a roster of far more expensive &quot;prestige&quot; movies primed for Academy Award pushes, from Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu&#x27;s &quot;Bardo&quot; to the star-studded &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.&quot;
But while those have largely fallen by the wayside, with one nomination each, &quot;All Quiet&quot; has emerged from the crowded trenches of awards season hopefuls as an Oscars frontrunner, with nine nods, including for much-coveted best picture honors.
&quot;It really feels like a wave of joy and luck that has come over us,&quot; director Edward Berger told AFP, days before his film wo…</span>

                              <span>German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann has resolved to remove any remaining terms from the Nazi era from the statute books.
In a letter to his departmental colleagues, he recently pointed out &quot;that there are still laws and ordinances that use terminology from the Nazi era or in which the &#x27;Reich&#x27; is mentioned,&quot; the lawyer told Sunday&#x27;s edition of Die Welt newspaper in comments seen in advance by dpa.
The linguistic remnants appear in laws ranging from those on banking to practitioners of alternative medicine, he said.
&quot;My goal is to eliminate these pre-constitutional remnants,&quot; the politician from the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) continued. For example, he said, there are still formulations in the criminal code for the offences of murder and manslaughter that go back to a &quot;National Socialist theory of types of perpetrators.&quot;
&quot;In general, I have set myself the goal this year of bringing the entire special section of the criminal code up to date,&quot; the justice said.
In the end, it is always up to the legislators to decide. However, he sees &quot;a great openness&quot; in the ruling coalition in which his party is the junior partner with the Greens and the Social Democrats (SPD).</span>

MALATYA, Turkey (Reuters) - The Trend Garden Residence, an upscale serviced apartment building in the Turkish city of Malatya, boasted a gym, freshly-furnished rooms and a roof-top cafeteria.
But when a powerful earthquake jolted the city in the early hours of Feb. 6, the seven-floored building disintegrated, killing 29 people, according to two government officials. It was as if the structure had “liquefied,” one survivor said.
Beneath its colourful facade, the building had been extensively remodelled a few years ago without the necessary permits, but was later registered thanks to a 2018 zoning amnesty promulgated by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to a Reuters review of municipal and amnesty documents, architects drawings an…</span>

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At around 11 a.m. on Feb 14, some 20 Indian tax officials and police burst into the BBC&#x27;s offices in New Delhi, shouting at staff to step away from their computers and hand over their mobile phones, according to two people present.
At the company&#x27;s bureau in India&#x27;s financial capital, Mumbai, tax officials launched a second raid. The government said the BBC had failed to respond to repeated requests to clarify its tax affairs related to the profits and remittances from its Indian operations.
The BBC has said it is cooperating fully with tax authorities and hopes to resolve matters quickly, adding its journalists would continue to report &quot;without fear or favour&quot;. It declined to comment for this story.

                              <span>FEB. 24 - MARCH 2, 2023

The war in Ukraine, a shipwreck off Italy’s southern coast that drove home the desperate and dangerous sea journeys of migrants seeking to reach Europe, and a collision between a freight train and a passenger train in Greece were the top stories in Europe and Africa, along with Nigeria&#x27;s elections. 

This photo gallery highlights some of the most compelling images made or published in the week by The Associated Press from Europe and Africa. 

The selection was curated by Rome-based international photo editor Fabio Polimeni.

Eight people including a nephew of Morrisseau were arrested this week and face a total of 40 charges including forgery of artworks and of paperwork that purported to authenticate them.
&quot;Over 1,000 allegedly fraudulent paintings have been seized. The total number produced and sold is unknown,&quot; Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Kari Dart told a news conference.
Some of the paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars to unsuspecting buyers across Canada and internationally.

                              <span>King Charles III will make his state first state visits as UK monarch when he travels to France and Germany later this month, Buckingham Palace announced Friday.
The choice of the two European nations and close allies is widely seen as an attempt to build post-Brexit bridges and an acknowledgement of the affection the late Queen Elizabeth II had for France.
The visits will take place from March 26 to March 31, ahead of the king&#x27;s coronation on May 6.
The tour &quot;will celebrate Britain&#x27;s relationship with France and Germany, marking our shared histories, culture and values,&quot; the palace said.
Charles and his wife Camilla will be in France from March 26 to March 29, and will join President Emmanuel Macron for a ceremony of remembrance and wreath laying at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

                              <span>Scientists have discovered a hidden passage inside Egypt&#x27;s Great Pyramid, the authorities announced on Thursday, part of a seven-year international research project. 
The passage is nine metres (30 feet) in length and more than two metres in width, the antiquities ministry said in a statement.
Egypt&#x27;s Tourism and Antiquities Minister Ahmed Issa told reporters at the ancient site in Giza also known as the Khufu, or Cheops, pyramid, that the &quot;gabled corridor&quot; with a triangular ceiling &quot;was found on the northern face of the Great Pyramid of King Khufu&quot;.
The discovery was part of the ScanPyramids project, launched in 2015 as a collaboration between major universities in France, Germany, Canada and Japan and a group of Egyptian experts.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt&#x27;s former antiquities minister, heads the committee supervising the project, which uses advanced technology to visualise hidden parts of the pyramid&#x27;s interior without having to excavate it.
The technology is a mix of infrared thermography, muon radiography imaging and 3D reconstruction -- all of which the researchers say are non-invasive and non-destructive techniques.
The Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza, standing 146 meters tall, and the only surviving structure of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
Built some 4,500 years ago, it has three known chambers, and like other pyramids in Egypt was intended as a pharaoh&#x27;s tomb.
Hawass told reporters at the pyramid on Thursday that &quot;there is a great possibility... the tunnel is protecting something. In my opinion, it is protecting the actual burial chamber of King Khufu.&quot;
In 2017, ScanPyramids announced the discovery of a passenger plane-sized cavity, the first major structure found inside the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.

The regal crib, which has its origins in a thousand-year-old tradition observed up to the time of Henry VIII in the 16th century, was lost for decades but is ready for service after a remarkable journey.
On the night before coronation, the sovereign traditionally spent the night at the Palace of Westminster, then the Royal Palace.
After falling out of favour, the tradition was revived two centuries ago for the coronation of George IV in 1821.
But that bed was destroyed in the fire that ravaged Parliament in 1834.

Raza competed in international championships with the Pakistani women&#x27;s team in 2012 and 2013, and was once described as the &quot;linchpin&quot; of the side.
But a wave of tragedies in recent years left her desperately seeking the money and opportunity to get life-saving treatment for her three-year-old son, who was diagnosed with a condition that causes paralysis.
Her options in Pakistan exhausted, she left her child at home and made her way legally to Turkey last year, her family told AFP.

                              <span>MOSCOW (Reuters) -A court in Belarus on Friday sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Ales Bialiatski to 10 years in prison for financing protests and other crimes, in a case that rights groups say was politically motivated.
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Bialiatski and other activists sentenced in the same trial had been unfairly convicted, calling the verdict &quot;appalling&quot;.
&quot;We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice &amp; free them,&quot; she said on Twitter.
Prosecutors had asked the Minsk court to give Bialiatski, who denied the charges, a 12-year sentence.
He and three co-defendants were charged with financing protests and smuggling money.
Belarusian state news agency Belta confirmed the sentences, including a decade in jail for Bialiatski.
Aged 60, Bialiatski is a co-founder of the Viasna human rights group and one of the most prominent of hundreds of Belarusians who were jailed during a crackdown on months of anti-government protests that erupted in the summer of 2020 and continued into 2021.
Viasna took a leading role in providing legal and financial assistance to those jailed. Mass demonstrations took place after long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election.
&quot;The allegations against our colleagues are linked to their human rights activity, the Viasna human rights centre&#x27;s provision of help to the victims of politically motivated persecution,&quot; Viasna has said of the case.
Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last October for his work on human rights and democracy, sharing it with Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine&#x27;s Center for Civil Liberties.
He had been arrested in 2021 along with two co-workers from Viasna.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan&#x27;s government believes China is set to renew a charm offensive targeting &quot;opinion leaders&quot; to win hearts and minds as the island gears up for a presidential election in less than a year, a security agency said in an internal report.
China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, has long taken a carrot and stick approach to the island, threatening it with the prospect of military action while reaching out to those it believes are amenable to Beijing&#x27;s point of view.
As Taipei and Beijing gradually resume travel links halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan security officials expect China to relaunch an influence campaign that in the past included all-expenses-paid trips to China for Taiwan politicians.
From this month, the campaign will …</span>

CHASIV YAR, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian forces clinging to the eastern city of Bakhmut dug new trenches in an attempt to hold back Russian attackers, as the United States said new military aid for Ukraine would be discussed at a meeting with Germany&#x27;s leader on Friday.
Russian forces have been attacking Bakhmut in Donetsk province for months, sometimes in waves and the site has become one of the bloodiest battles of the war.
&quot;Fighting is going on in Bakhmut round the clock...The situation is critical,&quot; Volodymyr Nazarenko, a deputy commander in the National Guard of Ukraine, told Ukrainian NV Radio.
&quot;They take no account of their losses in trying to take the city by assault. The task of our forces in Bakhmut is to inflict as many losses on the enemy…</span>

WIESBADEN, Germany (Reuters) - The United States is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through upcoming battlefield decisions, officials said on Thursday, ahead of the next phase of the year-old conflict with Russia.
The multi-day, table top exercises have been carried out at a war-gaming facility at a U.S. Army base in Wiesbaden, Germany, where the top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, visited on Thursday.
U.S. officials declined to talk through the potential battlefield scenarios that Ukrainian military staff were examining during the drills, which involve thought exercises to evaluate potential military courses of action.

                              <span>Daily Mail: A shot over China&#x27;s bows? Incredible moment Air Force breaks ship IN HALF with a single 2,000 pound &#x27;quicksink&#x27; bomb dropped by F-15E Strike Eagle with &#x27;torpedo-like&#x27; accuracy 
* The bomb, a JDAM, tested in the video  is called the Quicksink because of the rate at which it sinks ships 
* The JDAM is a relatively inexpensive way to convert unguided bombs into all-weather precision-guided munitions 
* An F-15E Strike Eagle fighter launched the modified bomb, successfully striking the target by detonating a GPS-navigated bomb underneath the vessel 
Recently released footage shows the decimation of a cargo ship by a 2,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munition dropped by the Air Force from an F-15E Strike Eagle. 
In the roughly one-minute video taken last April, an old, derelict cargo ship - the Courageous - is seen floating in the Gulf of Mexico.
Moments later a JDAM approaches from above and the Courageous is literally lifted out of the water and split in half, as waves begin to crash on the decks.

                              <span>James Rikards, Daily Reckoning: One of the Biggest Propaganda Campaigns Ever  
It’s extremely difficult to find the truth about the war in Ukraine. 
The first reason for this is because… it’s a war. Wars are always difficult to gauge in real-time. The phrase “fog of war” was invented to convey the uncertainty and imprecision about the progress of any particular war. 
Still, there’s another reason the war in Ukraine is confusing for so many. 
It’s because the Ukrainian propaganda effort is one of the most astonishingly effective concoctions of lies ever seen. 
From the “Ghost of Kyiv” fighter ace to the “Heroes of Snake Island” to wildly exaggerated claims of Russian casualties to the suppression of any news that reflects badly on Ukraine, the Ukrainian propaganda machine has been firing on…</span>

Peter Frankopan, Spectator: Is Putin winning? The world order is changing in his favour 
‘This is not about Ukraine at all, but the world order,’ said Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a month after the invasion. ‘The unipolar world is irretrievably receding into the past … A multi-polar world is being born.’ The US is no longer the world’s policeman, in other words – a message that resonates in countries that have long been suspicious of American power. The West’s core coalition may remain solid, but it has failed to win over many of the countries that refused to pick sides. Moscow’s diplomatic mission to build ties and hone a narrative over the past decade has paid dividends.
Look at Africa. In March last year, 25 African states out of 54 abstained or didn’t vote in a UN motion condemning the invasion, despite huge pressure from western powers. Their refusal to side clearly with Ukraine was testament to Russia’s ongoing diplomatic efforts in the developing world.

Reuters: Russia journal: Moscow mulls possible use of nuclear arms to fend off US attack  
A Russian defence ministry journal says Moscow is developing a new type of military strategy using nuclear weapons to protect against possible U.S. aggression, RIA news agency reported on Thursday. 
The article is the latest in a series of combative remarks by Russian politicians and commentators after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, suggesting Moscow would, if necessary, be prepared to deploy its vast nuclear arsenal.
RIA said the article, published in the Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought) magazine, concluded Washington was worried it might be losing dominance over the world and had therefore &quot;apparently&quot; prepared plans to strike Russia to neutralise it.

WNU Editor:  In the past few months I have noticed this change among many of my Russian family members and friends on the possibility that the US may launch a nuclear first strike against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine worsens for Kyiv. This  Russian defence ministry journal is voicing what many fear Washington will do next.

Update: I take Russian nuclear threats seriously. I completely disagree with this point of view .... Russian Nuclear Threats Are Empty, Part of ‘Information Operation:’ ISW (Newsweek).

The world&#x27;s second-largest economy is leading the US in researching 37 out of 44 critical and emerging technologies across the defense, space, energy, and biotechnology sectors — including research of advanced aircraft engines, drones, and electric batteries — the ASPI said in its Thursday report.

Reuters: US to announce new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will announce a new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday, worth roughly $400 million and comprised mainly of ammunition, two officials and a person familiar with the package said. 
Aid for Ukraine is expected to be a major topic when President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meet at the White House on Friday. 
The package, the sources said on Thursday, is expected to contain more Guided Multiple Launch Rockets (GMLRS) for HIMARS launchers, ammunition for the Bradley Fighting Vehicles, as well as armored vehicle launched bridges.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A court on Friday sentenced Belarus’ top human rights advocate and one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize to 10 years in prison, the latest move in a yearslong crackdown on dissent that has engulfed the ex-Soviet nation since 2020. 
The harsh punishment of Ales Bialiatski and three of his colleagues was delivered in response to massive protests over a 2020 election that gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a new term in office.

Ukraine has ordered some residents to leave Kupiansk, as Russia seeks to re-take the city it left last year. 
Kharkiv&#x27;s regional authorities said families with children and people &quot;with limited mobility&quot; must leave due to &quot;constant&quot; shelling by Russian forces. 
Russia seized the north-eastern city early in the full-scale invasion, with Ukraine recapturing it last September. 
Meanwhile, Russian mercenaries say they have &quot;practically encircled&quot; the key city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.

WNU Editor: Kupiansk is a critical rail hub. Russian forces will need to retake this city to deny the Ukrainian army the logistical support that is necessary for Kyiv to supply their forces in the region and northern Donbas. After the fall of Bakhmut, this may become the new battle line.

Reuters: Russian mercenary chief says Ukraine&#x27;s Bakhmut is practically surrounded 
(Reuters) -Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary force, said in a video published on Friday that the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was &quot;practically surrounded&quot; by his forces and that Kyiv&#x27;s forces had only one road left out. 
Prigozhin&#x27;s men have spearheaded the assault in eastern Ukraine for months. 
Moscow regards Bakhmut, which it calls by its Soviet-era name of Artyomovsk, as a useful stepping stone to seize bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. 
Prigozhin, wearing a military uniform in the video, called on Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to withdraw his forces from the small city.

WNU Editor: The military experts are trust tell me that Russia has now attained fire-control over all roads leading in and out of Bakhmut. I do not know how many Ukrainian soldiers are left in Bakhmut, but it looks like they are going to experience the same fate that Ukrainian soldiers faced in Mariupol. A siege that will go on for the next month or two before there is a mass surrender.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Sixty-five percent of Americans prefer the U.S. to take the leading (20%) or a major role (45%) in world affairs. This is down from 69% in 2019 and 72% as recently as 2017. The current figure is one percentage point below the prior low from 2011. In almost all years since Gallup first asked the question in 2001, more than seven in 10 Americans have favored a leading or major role for the U.S., including a high of 79% in February 2003.

WNU Editor: The world is a different place today, and many are not sympathetic to Washington. As the world breaks up into multi-polar blocs, there is going to be push-back against the U.S. and its economic/political/military/and social policies. 
My hope is that the foreign policy experts in Washington are smart enough to realize that, and be able to maneuver US foreign policy to safeguard US interests, while respecting what other countries want. This could be a new age for the US on the world stage, or a mess of disputes and conflicts that will only drain the US in both blood and treasure.</span>

The UK, Italy and France are all investing in new ships and infrastructure to protect the internet from Russian aggression. Critics argue they’re overreacting.
The Akademik Boris Petrov is officially listed as a research vessel. About 75 metres long and moored, at the time of writing, in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, the ship’s official purpose is to survey the ocean depths. Others believe its role is more nefarious. Labelled a ‘spy ship’ by several UK tabloids, the vessel’s brilliant white silhouette has been variously described as skulking away from the Shetland Islands just after its undersea internet cable connection to the rest of the world was severed, and being forced out of the Netherlands’ territorial waters by that country’s coastguard under suspicion of mapping the underwater infrastructure syphoning natural gas and internet traffic in and out of Western Europe. 
To clarify, the Akademik Boris Petrov has not been officially labelled as a Russian spy vessel by any government, and neither has it been conclusively linked to acts of sabotage or espionage as they pertain to undersea internet cables. But Western capitals are worried.

WNU Editor: The deliberate destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines last year has opened the door that undersea infrastructures are now fair game. To me it is a given that it is only a matter of time before the West&#x27;s undersea internet infrastructure is targeted as the war in Ukraine escalates.</span>

Financial Post/Reuters: Russia set to seal up damaged Nord Stream gas pipelines: reports  
Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipes ruptured in unexplained blasts last year  
MOSCOW/FRANKFURT — Russia’s ruptured undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines are set to be sealed up and mothballed as there are no immediate plans to repair or reactivate them, sources familiar with the plans have told Reuters. 
Three of the pipes were ruptured by unexplained blasts in September, and one of the Nord Stream 2 pipes remains intact.  But soaring tensions between Moscow and the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had by then already brought Nord Stream 1 to a standstill and prevented its twin, criticized by Washington and Kyiv for increasing Germany’s dependence on Russia, ever coming online.

Reuters: Iran rial plunges to new lows amid unrest, international isolation 
Iran&#x27;s currency fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Sunday, amid the country&#x27;s increasing isolation over its disputed nuclear programme, human rights violations and the supply of drones to Russia. 
The U.S. dollar was fetching as much as 601,500 rials on Iran&#x27;s unofficial market on Sunday, compared with 575,000 on the previous day and 540,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. 
Iranian authorities have blamed the currency&#x27;s fall on &quot;the enemies&#x27; plot&quot; to destabilise the Islamic Republic after months of unrest sparked by the death in custody of a young woman on Sept. 16. 
The rial has lost nearly half of its value since the start of nationwide protests, the boldest challenge to theocratic rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

   RT:  Pro-Kiev stunt in Baltics goes awry (VIDEO)  
The displays of destroyed Russian tanks somewhat backfired on those behind the project  
Actions in support of Kiev in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania went off script over the weekend as locals started bringing flowers to destroyed Russian tanks that had been put on display in the three nations’ capitals to demonstrate solidarity with Ukraine. 
A video released by RT&#x27;s video agency Ruptly shows small bouquets of flowers lying on the ground near a burnt-out Russian tank in the Latvian capital of Riga. The destroyed equipment was put on display at one of the central city squares to mark the anniversary of the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, which started in late February 2022.

People are mentioning even battles like Fallujah-2 or Raqqa-2 which only had a few thousand KIA. That is a warped view that doesn&#x27;t do the sheer scope of Bakhmut justice. Most of Wagner and tens of thousands of AFU soldiers have been fighting for months with *extreme* intensity.

Air Mobility Command has directed its refueling and cargo planes to obscure the majority of identifying information painted on the aircraft, citing national security concerns -- an unusual move that is alarming to government watchdogs. 
James Stewart, a spokesman for Air Mobility Command, told Military.com in an emailed statement that airmen&#x27;s missions take them around the globe and often involve sensitive movements of cargo -- the main reason behind the change.

The UK government on Thursday insisted the Falkland Islands remained British as Argentina walked away from a cooperation pact and demanded new talks over their sovereignty. 
Known as the Malvinas in Spanish, the UK-ruled islands were the subject of a short but brutal war after Argentina invaded in 1982. Britain drove out the invading force after dispatching a naval armada. 
In 2016, the two sides agreed to disagree about sovereignty, but to cooperate on issues such as energy, shipping and fishing, and on identifying the remains of unknown Argentine soldiers killed in battle.

BBC: Argentina&#x27;s power largely restored after fire hits national grid 
Power has largely been restored in Argentina after more than half of the country was left without electricity for several hours. 
More than 20 million people in major cities and large swathes of the countryside were affected on Wednesday. 
The blackout is believed to have been caused by a large fire in open fields west of the capital, Buenos Aires. 
The blaze brought down crucial power lines and forced a nuclear power station to be taken offline.

BALEDOGLE, Somalia — The promise and perils of America’s counterterrorism campaign were on full display at a remote training base in central Somalia.
It was graduation day for 346 recruits who would join an elite Somali commando unit trained by the State Department, advised by U.S. Special Operations forces, and backed by American air power. 
Since last August, the unit, called Danab, has spearheaded a string of Somali army victories against Al Shabab, an Islamist terrorist group that is considered the deadliest of Al Qaeda’s global branches.

Reuters: Lockheed Martin Profits More From War Than Any Other Company on Earth 
With such horrifying images from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any winners, but there are those who profit from the war, specifically military contractors. U.S. military aid for Ukraine and nearby countries has reached $3.75 billion. Almost all U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are from our stockpiles and will have to be replaced. This means a huge check to companies making military hardware and software. Lockheed Martin Corp is the largest U.S. defense contractor and the domestic company that profits the most from war. 
The financial opportunity for Lockheed Martin and other large contractors is vast. America’s defense budget will be over $800 billion this year. (Here’s how Ukraine’s newly bolstered tank army compares to Russia’s.) 
Lockheed Martin employs 116,000 people. The company reported a total of $66 billion in revenue in 2022 and a profit of $5.7 billion. It has a backlog of orders that stands at $150 billion. Last year, it was No. 55 on the Fortune 500.

Over a hundred Western-made modern battle tanks have been pledged to Ukraine over the past few months - just four have arrived so far. 
February 24 marked the first anniversary of Russia’s war against Ukraine and its people. The grim milestone was met with renewed promises of weapons from dozens of countries, but now that the buzz has died down, the harsh reality behind the handshakes and photo ops is slowly revealing itself. NATO fighter jets will not see combat in Ukraine, tanks will take months if not years to reach the battlefield. Long-term military underfunding is the root cause across Europe. Here, Express.co.uk takes a look at the countries lagging the most when it comes to delivering on their commitments.

Politico: EU looks to dedicate €1B to howitzer shells for Ukraine 
Europe wants to ensure its funds are specifically channeled to the artillery rounds that Ukraine desperately needs to fight Russia. 
BRUSSELS — In a new blueprint for military support to Ukraine, the European Union will propose that €1 billion should be specifically dedicated to ammunition, particularly 155mm artillery shells, according to a document seen by POLITICO. 
The EU is helping supply Ukraine with arms through an off-budget, inter-governmental cash pot called the European Peace Facility, which is used to reimburse countries that export arms to Ukraine. So far, the facility has disbursed €3.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine, with member countries deciding last December to increase its funding by €2 billion in 2023.

The Intercept: Pentagon Developed Contingency Plan for War With Iran 
In January, the U.S. and Israel conducted the largest joint military exercise in history. 
The U.S. military allocated spending for secret contingency operations pertaining to an Iran war plan, according to a classified Pentagon budget manual listing emergency and special programs reviewed by The Intercept. 
The contingency plan, code-named “Support Sentry,” was funded in 2018 and 2019, according to the manual, which was produced for the 2019 fiscal year. It classifies Support Sentry as an Iran “CONPLAN,” or concept plan, a broad contingency plan for war which the Pentagon develops in anticipation of a potential crisis.

Sputnik: Medvedev: Delivery of NATO Aircraft to Kiev Will Mean Alliance&#x27;s War Against Russia 
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The delivery of NATO aircraft to Ukraine and their maintenance on the territory of the alliance will be a direct entry of NATO into the war against Russia, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday. 
Since the 1920s, there has been an understanding that a country can be recognized as a participant in hostilities if, in addition to supplying weapons, it trains personnel to use them, Medvedev recalled. 
&quot;This is how it is happening today: Canadian and German instructors in the EU are already teaching Ukrainian killers how to handle Leopards,&quot; Medvedev said on Telegram.

                              <span>Residents in Taiwan’s capital Taipei have been demanding authorities bring back their bins as hundreds had been removed to reduce pollution and waste.

Taiwan has been implementing new ways to minimise waste in the country, with the waste of every person in Taiwan dropping to less than 20 per cent.

Bins had been replaced with rubbish drop-offs where a truck would pick up rubbish on a corner, however 70 per cent of Taipei citizens have requested to get more bins.

The new Mayor of Taipei is looking to install more bins due to public pressure.</span>

Situation for Bakhmut’s defenders now almost untenable as seven-month assault may be nearing end 
In the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, the volunteers collecting the civilian dead risk becoming casualties themselves. 
“Where? Where?” demands Daniel Wilk, a Canadian driver, in shaky video footage shot recently inside the city and seen by the Guardian. 
Wilk proceeds quickly, the anxiety of the situation visible in his movements as he is directed to a fence, cutting an uncertain path across the snow as another voice cries “no, no” repeatedly.

   Zero Hedge: NBC Reporter Goes To Crimea, Shocks Viewers By Telling The Truth 
Mainstream media correspondents for major US networks rarely, if ever, report from inside Crimea and certainly are nowhere near Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine. However, this week NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons went to Sevastopol, surrounded by a significant Russian military presence given it is home to the Russian Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet, and in a live segment admitted that it&#x27;s not at all realistic Zelensky and Ukrainian forces can ever hope to take Crimea. 
This is especially as the &quot;the people there... view themselves as Russian.&quot; Simmons noted that &quot;This is the closest that any US news crew has got to the Russian Black Sea Fleet in many many years.&quot; He explained that &quot;Vladimir Putin will be determined to defend that port - to not have it take it away from him - he may well do pretty much anything to try to achieve that.&quot;

Video footage has been posted online, allegedly showing a first-person view (FPV) from a drone attacking a Russian Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft. 
It was announced by ByPol, a Belarusian resistance organization formed by former law enforcement officers who changed their loyalties and went on to oppose the regime of the official Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
 ByPol claims the attack was successful and an A-50 aircraft, stationed at the base, was damaged. So far there has been no independent confirmation regarding the result of the attack.

New policies expand transgender procedures to the service academies, allow gender transitions while on-duty, and mandate group shower facility use by both biological sexes if certain administrative requirements are met. Oh, and military commanders are responsible to “not accommodate biases against transgender individuals” 
As RealClear Defense recently reported, on December 20, 2022 the Department of Defense issued an update to DOD Instruction 1300.28, entitled “In-Service Transition for Transgender Service Members,” which “expanded woke transgender mandates in significant ways.”
The article compares the original instruction, issued in the waning days of the Obama administration in October 2016, to the current expansion, with the aide of a study and summary compiled by the Center for Military Readiness (CMR).
Significantly, the CMR study and summary explain the significance of  the changes, which fall into six major areas, and which were issued  “without public debate”:

B92: No manpower, no weapons... And Berlin would fall  
New German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Monday that Germany&#x27;s military is not ready to defend the country if it is attacked.  
&quot;We do not have armed forces capable of defending the country against a brutal offensive and an aggressive war,&quot; he said, during a meeting with members of his Social Democratic Party (SPD). 
According to him, Germany&#x27;s Bundeswehr armed forces are undermanned thanks to decades of neglect by the federal government. Therefore, he believes that Germany will have to invest much more in defense in order to reach NATO standards. 
The highest-ranking officer of the Bundeswehr, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, confirmed Pistorius&#x27;s words in fact, when he declared that even the 100 billion euros earmarked for the German army by Chancellor Olaf Scholz will not be enough for the Bundeswehr to be capable of waging war.

(Bloomberg) — Two thirds of Canadians suspect China attempted to interfere in recent elections that returned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals to power, according to a new poll. 
More than half think the alleged meddling represents a serious threat to Canada’s democracy. A similar proportion says Trudeau’s response to the simmering scandal hasn’t been tough enough.

Politico:  Why Can’t Democrats Explain Themselves on China?  
Biden has yet to find the rhetoric to describe his views on America’s global rival — and that’s a big problem. 
President Joe Biden likes to sum up his approach to China with a snappy mantra: “Competition, not conflict.” He used that construction at the G-20 summit last fall in Bali, Indonesia, after meeting with Xi Jinping to revive their strained relationship. Biden deployed it again in his State of the Union address this month, days after sending warplanes to destroy a Chinese spy balloon off the Atlantic coast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources. 
The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions. 
 It was not clear what specific sanctions Washington will propose. The conversations have not been previously disclosed.  The U.S. Treasury Department, a lead agency on the imposition of sanctions, declined to comment.

WNU Editor: The EU economy is still reeling from the sanctions they imposed on Russian resources. EU sanctions on China will create the perfect storm to not only to create shortages in many finished products that families need, but also the inflationary impact that it will have. 
So the big question is .... will the EU go down this ruinous economic road? 
My answer is yes. But at the beginning it will be limited in its scope.</span>

                              <span>Wearing flamboyant costumes and masks imitating blue-eyed, bearded Europeans, carnival-goers in Mexico have turned mocking colonizers into an art form.
The colorful celebration stands out from hundreds of other carnivals in Latin America by rekindling the spirit of revenge against erstwhile invaders.
Each year, men in wooden masks playing the role of light-skinned Europeans dance through the streets of Tlaxcala, one of Mexico&#x27;s smallest states, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of the capital Mexico City.
Many sport carefully-trimmed beards resembling those of Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes, while others have mustaches.
Participants in the photogenic festivities recreate the dandy style of the people who crossed the Atlantic to the New World.
Women wear the flowing dresses and elaborate hats of European ladies centuries ago.
The aim is to &quot;mock the invaders... especially their customs and habits, which for the people of Tlaxcala were very effeminate,&quot; tourist guide Eduardo Cuautle Xochitemotl said beneath a mural depicting local history.
The feather-topped masks, hand-embroidered clothes and European-style costumes are a celebration of the cultural collisions that have shaped the region.
The Tlaxcalans allied with Cortes to capture the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan -- today Mexico City -- in 1521.
While their collaboration assured them certain privileges, the Tlaxcalans still faced exclusion by powerful Spanish landowners.
&quot;At the time when we were conquered, the big haciendas held huge parties with music and dance, which we, the indigenous people, could not enter,&quot; said dancer Carlos Gomez Vazquez.
Another target of the mockery is the French influence that took root in the late 19th century under general-turned-president Porfirio Diaz, whose legacy can be seen today in Mexico City&#x27;s Parisian-style architecture.
And in modern-day Mexico, centuries-old foes are not the only subjects of ridicule.
&quot;Nowadays the tradition is to mock today&#x27;s politicians,&quot; Xochitemotl said.

                              <span>A Belgian woman who murdered her five children in a case that shocked the country has been euthanised at her own request, 16 years to the day after their killing, her lawyer said Thursday.
Genevieve Lhermitte slit the throats of her son and four daughters aged three to 14 with a kitchen knife at the family home in the town of Nivelles on February 28, 2007 while their father was away.
She then tried to commit suicide by stabbing herself, but the attempt failed and she ended up calling the emergency services.
Lhermitte was sentenced to life in prison in 2008, before being moved to a psychiatric hospital in 2019.
The 56-year-old&#x27;s lawyer Nicolas Cohen confirmed to AFP reports in local media that his client had died through euthanasia on the sixteenth anniversary of the killings on Tuesday.

                              <span>South African Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius, who killed his girlfriend 10 years ago, will know in about a month whether he will be released on parole, his lawyer said Thursday.
&quot;We have been advised by the parole board that (the) hearing will take place on the 31st of March, 2023,&quot; his lawyer Julian Knight told AFP. &quot;It&#x27;s an internal process&quot;.
Pistorius, 36, shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2013 when he fired four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house.
He pleaded not guilty and denied that he killed Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a burglar.
Pistorius, known worldwide as the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; because of his carbon-fibre prosthetics, was sentenced to 13 years behind bars.
Offenders in South Africa are automatically eligible for parole consideration after serving half of their sentence. Pistorius has served more than half.
A decision is usually known the same day of the parole hearing or a day later, and &quot;if the decision is negative, the offender has the right to approach the courts for review,&quot; said Knight.
A year before killing Steenkamp, Pistorius became the first double-amputee to race at the Olympics at the London 2012 games.
He was initially sentenced to six years in jail but the sentence was later lengthened to 13 after the state appealed that it was unduly lenient.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
