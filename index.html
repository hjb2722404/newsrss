China reaffirmed its military relations with Russia and called on the two countries to take their defence ties to &#x27;a new level&#x27; during a meeting today. 
Chinese defence minister Li Shangfu told the head of Russia&#x27;s navy Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov that Beijing hopes for increased exchanges, joint exercises and other forms of co-operation, according to a release from his ministry. 
The pair met in Beijing for the first formal military talks between the friendly neighbours since a short-lived mutiny by Russian mercenary group Wagner, which analysts say weakened Russian president Vladimir Putin&#x27;s position.

CNN: Putin expected to meet Xi Jinping and other world leaders for first time since Wagner insurrection 
All eyes will be on Vladimir Putin this week, with the Russian president expected to make his first appearance on the world stage since the Wagner insurrection threatened his steel grip on power. 
Putin is scheduled Tuesday to attend a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a broadly-pro Russian regional security grouping led by Beijing and Moscow.
But while the leaders of the nations assembled have so far provided a sympathetic audience for Putin, his appearance – albeit virtually – could offer something of a window as to the extent of their support after last weekend’s near-crisis.

Politico:  Russian defense minister says Wagner Group rebellion failed because of Russian troops’ loyalty

 
“These plans failed primarily because the personnel of the Armed Forces showed loyalty to their oath and military duty,” Sergei Shoigu said. 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Monday the Wagner Group’s attempted rebellion failed because Russia’s army “showed loyalty to their oath and military duty,” marking the first time he has spoken out about the short-lived mutiny.
“These plans failed primarily because the personnel of the Armed Forces showed loyalty to their oath and military duty,” Shoigu said in public remarks. “The provocation did not affect the actions of the groupings of troops.” Russia responded to the rebellion by tightening security measures in Moscow.

Israeli forces has launched what a military source said is its largest military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin in more than 20 years, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 50 others, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it launched an “extensive counterterrorism effort in the area of the city of Jenin and the Jenin Camp,” striking “terrorist infrastructure,” in a statement posted to Telegram in the early hours of Monday morning.
Residents in Jenin told CNN they heard explosions and heavy gunfire in the area, while video from the scene showed wounded Palestinians being evacuated by ambulance to Jenin Government Hospital.

Foreign Affairs: How America Broke Its War Machine

 
Privatization and the Hollowing Out of the U.S. Defense Industry 
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the United States pledged its “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.” This support has materialized in over $75 billion in security assistance to date, with the United States committed to aiding Ukraine until the fighting stops. As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in announcing a new installment of weapons to Ukraine: “The United States and our allies and partners will stand united with Ukraine, for as long as it takes.”

Ukrayinska Pravda: What Ukrainian weapons will conquer the world’s weapons markets after the war 
The demand for Ukrainian combat-tested military equipment may increase globally. What are the most promising projects for export after the war? 
Ukraine has often been compared to Israel, since both countries have been at war for many years. When it comes to Israeli weapons, everyone understands that they are made to fight opposing forces, not for parades or tank biathlons. Ukrainian military technology, hardened over the years in the war against the Russians, may now enjoy the same reputation. 
Ukrainian private and state-owned companies have a unique opportunity to test their equipment in real-world combat and are using this experience to modernise it further. This is something that even leading Western manufacturers lack.

Vladimir Putin’s response to the armed Wagner rebellion was “weak” and the Russian President is losing control of his own people, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN in an exclusive interview. 
Putin faced the greatest threat to his authority in two decades last month when the head of the Wagner paramilitary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, launched a short-lived uprising, claiming control of military facilities in two Russian cities and marching toward Moscow before he agreed to stand down.

“We see Putin’s reaction. 
It’s weak,” Zelensky told CNN’s Erin Burnett in Odesa, in an interview taped on Sunday.

In the days preceding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, David Bramlette found himself in a classroom in Washington, D.C. discussing whether Russia might invade Ukraine. He was in the middle of earning a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins in international affairs. At the time, he admits, he found the prospect of a Russian invasion implausible. 
But when Russia eventually pulled the trigger and invaded Ukraine in February last year, David, who had previously completed stints working for the U.S. military as a Green Beret on a counter-Russia mission and as an Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan, felt compelled to go fight the Russians. 
“It’s good and evil in my mind,” Bramlette told The Daily Beast in an interview from Kyiv this week.

Seymour Hersh: Prigozhin&#x27;s Folly: The Russian &#x27;Revolt&#x27; That Wasn&#x27;t Strengthens Putin&#x27;s Hand 
The Biden administration had a glorious few days last weekend. The ongoing disaster in Ukraine slipped from the headlines to be replaced by the “revolt,” as a New York Times headline put it, of Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of the mercenary Wagner Group. 
The focus slipped from Ukraine’s failing counter-offensive to Prigozhin’s threat to Putin’s control. As one headline in the Times put it, “ Revolt Raises Searing Question: Could Putin Lose Power?” Washington Post columnist David Ignatius posed this assessment: “Putin looked into the abyss Saturday—and blinked.”

* Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun says rioters rammed a burning car into his family home 
* The alleged &#x27;assassination attempt&#x27; left his wife and one of his children injured 
Rioters rammed a burning car into the home of a mayor of a town outside Paris, injuring his wife and child in what he has branded as an &#x27;assassination attempt&#x27;. 
The attack in the early house of Sunday on Vincent Jeanbrun&#x27;s home in the Paris suburb of L&#x27;Hay-les-Roses came as 719 people were arrested in France following widespread rioting. 
Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun wrote on Twitter that protesters had &#x27;rammed a car&#x27; into his home before &#x27;setting a fire&#x27; while his family slept. Following the attack, he vowed to &#x27;not back down&#x27; and said his &#x27;determination to protect and serve the Republic is greater than ever&#x27;.

France 24: Israeli air strikes hit &#x27;anti-aircraft battery&#x27; in Syria 
Israel carried out air strikes in Syria near the government-held city of Homs, Syrian state media reported on Sunday, and the Israeli army later said it struck an anti-aircraft battery after rocket fire. A war monitor said the Homs-area strikes killed a member of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 
During more than a decade of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air raids on Syrian territory, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions. 
&quot;The Israeli enemy carried out air strikes coming from the northeast of Beirut, targeting some points in the vicinity of the city of Homs,&quot; which is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Lebanon, Syrian state-run news agency SANA said, quoting a military source. 
SANA reported that Syrian air defences intercepted some missiles, and that there had been some &quot;material&quot; losses.

Reuters: Japan says Russian warships spotted near Taiwan, Okinawa islands 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan&#x27;s defence ministry said late on Friday it had spotted two Russian Navy ships in the waters near Taiwan and Japan&#x27;s Okinawa islands in the previous four days, following a similar announcement this week from Taiwan. 
Taiwan&#x27;s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had spotted two Russian frigates off its eastern coast and send aircraft and ships to keep watch. 
Japan&#x27;s government said last month that repeated Russian military activity near Japanese territory, including joint drills with Chinese forces, posed &quot;serious concern&quot; for Japan&#x27;s national security.

                              <span>Euronews/AFP: Ukrainian commander warns French tanks are inadequate for counteroffensive 
Ukraine continues to press Western allies for hardware and training assistance as it seeks to take advantage of confusion and low morale on the Russian side. 
 Armour too light: a Ukrainian officer believes that the AMX-10 RC tanks delivered to Ukraine by France and currently being used in Kyiv&#x27;s counter-offensive are unsuitable for frontline attacks. 
The commander of a battalion of the 37th Naval Infantry Brigade, the pseudonymous Major Spartanets, described his observations of these French tanks on the battlefield during their current deployment in the Donetsk region. 
&quot;They are used for supporting fire, because of their light armour,&quot; he said. &quot;Their armament is good, their observation instruments are very good. But unfortunately it&#x27;s light armour, which makes them unsuitable.&quot;

Reuters: US Approves $15 Billion in Patriot and Missile Defense Upgrades for Poland 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $15 billion sale of an Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) and related equipment to Poland as it upgrades its air defenses, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. 
Despite State Department approval, the notification did not indicate that a contract had been signed or that negotiations had concluded. 
European interest in U.S. weaponry has increased with demand centered around such supplies as munitions, air defenses, communications equipment, shoulder-fired Javelin missiles and drones which have proven critical to Ukraine&#x27;s war efforts.

His apology comes from the bottom of his heart and soul, King Willem-Alexander said at an event in Amsterdam to mark the national event. &quot;Of all forms of bondage, slavery is the most degrading and inhumane.&quot; 
His apology echoes that made by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on behalf of the Netherlands and the king at the end of last year.</span>

The publication of the Independent Commission report into Equity in Cricket came in the wake of a racism scandal centred around the treatment of Pakistan-born bowler Azeem Rafiq at English side Yorkshire.
Rafiq went public with allegations of racism and bullying in 2020, prompting the England and Wales Cricket Board to commission the report.
Six former Yorkshire players found guilty of using racist language in the Rafiq case were last month fined by the Cricket Discipline Commission.

This year&#x27;s Pride Parade, one of Asia&#x27;s largest, was denied permission to congregate at the central plaza where the main festivities have traditionally taken place.
Instead, an increasingly vocal Christian-led opposition was granted the spot, highlighting the struggles South Korea&#x27;s campaigners for LGBTQ rights face.
The heat, humidity and backlash still did not deter supporters from throning to Seoul&#x27;s Queer Parade, which organizers estimated drew a crowd of around 50,000 people.

Biden was leaving a press conference on Friday on the US Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to block his student debt relief program when a reporter asked if he admitted to mistakes during the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
&quot;No, no. All the evidence is coming back,&quot; he replied, according to a White House transcript.
&quot;Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said al Qaeda would not be there. I said it wouldn&#x27;t be there. I said we&#x27;d get help from the Taliban. What&#x27;s happening now? What&#x27;s going on? Read your press. I was right.&quot;

Britain ceded the long-time colony to China in 1997 under a 50-year governance model known as &quot;one country, two systems&quot;, which guaranteed key freedoms and a measure of autonomy.
These rights -- such as the freedom of assembly -- set Hong Kong apart from the mainland, and July 1 was once a day of demonstrations for the city&#x27;s outspoken civil society.
But following huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019, China imposed a sweeping national security law that -- when combined with legal changes putting &quot;patriots&quot; in charge -- effectively stamped out most forms of dissent from Hong Kong …</span>

In a New York Times op-ed published Friday, Zygar shares that after speaking with Putin allies, it&#x27;s clear they believe &quot;this is the clearest evidence yet that the president is divorced from reality.&quot;
And as a result of his failure to prevent the rebellion — if only he had talked to Prigozhin — many of those same allies are feeling &quot;a growing appetite for change.&quot;

The Diplomat: The China-Russia Partnership After Prigozhin’s Mutiny: The View From Beijing 
While Chinese analysts – and likely the government – recognize the weaknesses of the Putin regime, Beijing is unlikely to fundamentally reassess its alignment with Moscow in the near term. 
June 24 saw the swift beginning and end of a puzzling series of events in Russia. The mercurial Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the private military contractor Wagner Group, announced that his fighters would be undertaking what he termed a “march for justice” aimed squarely against the “incompetence” of the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defense, namely Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov.

Update #2: Wagner mutiny shows China’s ‘no limits’ partnership with Russia is a risky bet (SCMP)

 
WNU Editor: There has been a lot of commentary in the past week on China&#x27;s response to the Wagner mutiny. The consensus among most of the pundits is that there will be no change in the relationship. 
I disagree. 
I personally think Beijing is going to double down on its support for Putin. Beijing views its relationship with Russia as a vital strategic security ally that must be defended. Any threat to Putin&#x27;s rule is not in China&#x27;s interest. 
So how will China respond? 
Aside from continuing to provide political support, they will primarily respond by pumping even more money into the Russian economy and government coffers by doing things like this .... China is now importing more Russian oil than ever before - and Europe has almost entirely stopped buying crude from Moscow (Business Insider).</span>

Politico: Pentagon to filmmakers: We won’t help you if you kowtow To China

 
DOD will no longer work with directors if their movie will be censored by Beijing. 
If you’re a filmmaker and you want the Pentagon’s help, from now on you’ll have to guarantee that you won’t let China censor your movie first. 
On Wednesday, the Defense Department updated its rules for working with movie studios to prohibit any assistance to directors who plan to comply or will likely comply with censorship demands from the Chinese government in order to distribute their movie there. 
The issue came to a head with last year’s release of “Top Gun: Maverick.” In trailers for the film, viewers noticed that the studio removed the flags of Taiwan and Japan from Capt. Pete “Maverick” Mitchell’s flight jacket in an apparent attempt to appease Chinese investor Tencent. 
But after criticism in the U.S. — and after Tencent reportedly dropped its investment in the film –– the flags were restored in the final version.

France has been shaken by a wave of violence sparked by the killing of a teenager of North African descent by police. 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday postponed a long-planned state visit to Germany to deal with the worsening turmoil in France, in a clear sign of the gravity of the violent protests gripping the country. 
The killing of a 17-year-old of North African descent by a police officer on Tuesday has thrown France into chaos, sparking violent demonstrations in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, where the teen was shot. The violence has spread to other big cities.

Warzone/The Drive: Poland Wants To Host NATO Nukes To Counter Russia

 
Poland says Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus are driving its desire to be part of NATO’s nuclear sharing program.  
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says his country wants to join NATO&#x27;s nuclear weapon sharing program. This is in direct response to Russia&#x27;s deployment of some of its own nuclear weapons to neighboring Belarus. This also comes as Poland is pushing ahead with a massive conventional rearmament effort that was accelerated in the wake of the all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine last year. 
Prime Minister Morawiecki made his remarks about Poland&#x27;s desire to become of NATO&#x27;s nuclear weapon sharing arrangements in response to a question at a press conference on the sidelines of a European Union in Brussels, Belgium, earlier today.

The Telegraph: Nigel Farage says he may have to leave UK after bank closes his accounts 
Nigel Farage has said he may be forced to leave Britain after his bank closed his accounts and others refused his custom. 
The former UKIP leader said his personal and business accounts with a major retail bank have been closed because of a “commercial decision” and other high street firms have refused to allow him to transfer his funds to them. 
Mr Farage told The Telegraph he may have been the victim of “blatant corporate prejudice” because of his campaigning for Brexit, or fallen foul of “politically exposed person” rules designed to lower banks’ exposure to bribery and money-laundering.

WNU Editor: There is zero evidence that he has done anything illegal. This is political, with the UK banking system clearly colluding to ban citizens that they disagree with politically. 
And it gets worse. There is no outcry over this ban, and little if any media coverage. 
A friend of mine in the UK is telling me that the British establishment is driving out anyone that they disagree with, and closing their access to a bank account is one of the tools that they are using. 
The Duran has a good analysis on why this is happening (see video below).

Bloomberg: China Wants Sanctions Lifted as Condition for Military Talks With US 
(Bloomberg) -- The US must lift sanctions against China if the Biden administration wants high-level communication between the Chinese and American armed forces, a Chinese diplomat said on Wednesday. 
“The US side knows the reason for difficulties in its military-to-military relations with China — it actually imposed unilateral sanctions on China,” Liu Pengyu, the spokesman for China’s Embassy in Washington, said in a briefing on Wednesday. 
“Such obstacles should be removed before any exchange and cooperation could take place between the two countries.”

 VOA: Chinese Army Invasion of Taiwan Not a Given, US General Says 
WASHINGTON - There is still time to dissuade Beijing not to use force to reunify Taiwan with mainland China, according to America’s most senior military official. 
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, said Friday that despite well-publicized plans calling for the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, there is no indication Chinese President Xi Jinping has made a decision one way or the other. 
Speaking to an audience at the National Press Club in Washington, Milley said that gives the U.S. and other countries time to show Xi the use of force would be a bad idea.

“You want to make sure that every single day, President Xi wakes up and says, &#x27;Today is not that day,&#x27; and that that decision never comes,” he said.

Mali&#x27;s relations with the West have deteriorated sharply since a 2020 military coup in the country. 
The junta has rallied behind Russia and brought in the paramilitary Wagner Group to meet its security needs.

The UN Security Council on Friday voted to end a decade-old peacekeeping mission in Mali as demanded by the country&#x27;s military junta. 
The French-drafted resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, ordered the mission, known as MINUSMA, to immediately start the withdrawal of over 15,000 personnel. 
The pullout is to be completed by the end of the year.

Fourth night of demonstrations sees 45,000 police deployed as authorities claim the situation is calmer 
More than 1,300 people were arrested in a fourth night of violence in France after the police shooting of a 17-year-old boy. 
Forty-five thousand police officers, including special forces, were deployed to respond to rioting across the country on Friday night, with the situation in two big cities – Marseille and Lyon – highlighted as particularly chaotic, with buildings and vehicles torched and stores looted. 
The ministry of the interior reported that 1,311 people were arrested overnight, while 79 police officers and gendarmes were injured and 2,500 fires were recorded.

In anticipation of a busy summer, U.S. airlines have taken measures like trimming schedules and beefing up staffing to prevent large-scale flight disruptions, though inclement weather in some regions presents a risk to travelers during the period.

                              <span>Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Friday likened Donald Trump’s plight to that of disgraced Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro.
The far-right congresswoman suggested that special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump is politically motivated, but she did the former president no favors comparing him to Bolsonaro.
She isn’t the first to make the comparison. 
Both leaders are election deniers who inspired failed insurrections after spreading baseless theories of voter fraud. 
Bolsonaro was found guilty of abusing his power and misusing public media during last year’s election, and Brazil’s highest electoral court on Friday issued a ruling that bars him for running for public office until 2030.
Brazilian prosecutors alleged that Bolsonaro in July 2022 held a meeting with foreign ambassador in which he spread misinformation about Brazil’s electoral system. 
Trump is facing a 37-count indictment over allegations he mishandled classified documents. 
“That&#x27;s EXACTLY what the American liberals are trying to do through the court system here,” Boebert tweeted.
“Unbelievable how liberals use lawfare since they can&#x27;t win fairly.”</span>

Four of the seven judges of the Superior Electoral Tribunal have voted to discipline Bolsonaro for alleged abuses of power, while one so far has found in his favor.
With two votes outstanding, the trial could yet be postponed to a later date for the final ruling.
The tribunal is trying the former president on charges he abused his office and state media in making unfounded allegations of security flaws in Brazil&#x27;s electronic voting system.

Francis, the head of the worldwide Catholic Church, &quot;received in audience Ms Stella Assange, with family members,&quot; the Vatican said in a short statement.
On Twitter, Stella Assange said she and her children had been given a private audience with the 86-year-old Argentine pontiff, adding: &quot;We are overwhelmed.&quot;
Julian Assange is in prison in Britain, fighting extradition to the US, where he faces trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010 related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could be sentenced to decades behind bars if found guilty.
During a protest in London against his extradition earlier this month, his wife said his transfer to the United States could be imminent.
&quot;Julian could be a few weeks away from extradition. We don&#x27;t have a clear timeline, but this really is the endgame,&quot; Stella Assange told reporters.
Supporters portray the Australian publisher as a martyr to press freedom.
The 51-year-old has been held since 2019 at the Belmarsh high security prison in southeast London.
He previously spent nearly seven years holed up in Ecuador&#x27;s embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault.
He claimed the allegations were politically motivated, linked to the work of WikiLeaks.</span>

                              <span>Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey was on Friday described as a &quot;sexual bully&quot;, as prosecutors opened their case against him in London for a string of sexual offense charges.
&quot;Kevin Spacey Fowler is an actor; many of you will already know that,&quot; lawyer Christine Agnew told a jury at Southwark Crown Court, using the star&#x27;s full name.
&quot;He is an extremely famous actor who has won a number of awards. He is also, the prosecution allege, a man who sexually assaults other men.&quot;
Agnew said Spacey, a two-time Academy Award winner for &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, did not respect personal boundaries or space.
He was &quot;a man who it would seem delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable, a sexual bully&quot;, the lawyer alleged in her opening speech.
&quot;His preferred method of assault is it appears to grab aggressively other men in the crotch. On one occasion things went further than that.&quot;
Spacey, 63, denies three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault, and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He also pleaded not guilty to a further charge of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The alleged offenses, against four men who cannot be identified under English law, are said to have occurred between 2001 and 2013.
Agnew said Spacey had dismissed some of the allegations as &quot;quite simply made up&quot;, and others that were consensual.

                              <span>Prime Minister Hun Sen warned Friday he could block access to Facebook in Cambodia, after the company said it would remove a video in which he threatened to beat up political opponents.
The warning came ahead of a July 23 election that has been widely dubbed a sham after authorities denied registration to the chief challenger to Hun Sen&#x27;s ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party.
Facebook announced Thursday it would remove one of Hun Sen&#x27;s videos in line with a ruling by the Oversight Board for Meta, Facebook&#x27;s parent company, which also recommended his account be suspended.
Tech experts characterized the move as a &quot;turning point&quot;.
The ruling said his speech contained &quot;unequivocal statements of intent to commit violence&quot; against opposition politicians.

AFP&#x27;s fact-checkers have exposed a slew of cases around the world in which fraudsters impersonated doctors, fabricating their comments or endorsements to push out bogus treatments and products or to peddle propaganda.
The trend underscores how medical professionals are often sitting targets for online scammers seeking to profit off disinformation, which leaves their reputations tarnished, provokes harassment and, in some cases, legal challenges.

Gay marriage is banned in the country, social pressure keeps many in the closet, and the annual Pride celebration attracts vicious Christian-led opposition.
But change is coming. Hurricane Kimchi told AFP when they first went to Seoul Pride more than a decade ago only a few hundred people were there.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.
