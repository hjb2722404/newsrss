And as for any hope of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. I have been looking for any and all signs of diplomacy at play to end this war, and I am sad to say that there is none.</span>

You are talking about a country that suffered +20 million deaths in the Second World War. That suffered under Stalin and Communist rule and deprivation for decades. That had to endure the chaos and suffering throughout the 1990s after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and international sanctions since 2014. Petraeus of all people must know that the people in Russia have a long history of knowing what suffering is all about, and more importantly, knowing how to handle and endure it.

Russian President Vladimir Putin called Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday morning, hours after the Likud leader announced he had formed a government. 
Putin, who has developed a close relationship with Netanyahu over the past decade, congratulated him on his election victory in November and on establishing his coalition, according to the Israeli readout of the call. 
“There is mutual confidence that Russian-Israeli relations will continue to develop progressively, and contacts at various levels will continue,” said the Russian Foreign Ministry after the call.

Washington Post: Netanyahu announces new government with sweeping powers to far-right allies 
TEL AVIV — Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu announced the formation of the most far-right government in the country’s history Wednesday night, marking the imminent return of its longest-serving leader and granting an unprecedented portion of power to his far-right and ultra-Orthodox allies, who have vowed to make far-reaching legislative changes in the country. 
Netanyahu said the new coalition, which includes once-fringe ultranationalist and ultrareligious parties, would serve “all citizens of Israel.” He has said that he aims to swear in the new government in the coming week. 
ost of the agreements, made after 1½ months of marathon negotiations between Netanyahu and his six coalition partners, have not been finalized. But the new government has already sparked concern among Israelis and members of the international community over bills that seek to prioritize Israel’s Jewish character over its democratic one.

Women and girls in Afghanistan suffered another setback in their push for equal access to education on Wednesday. Many universities closed their doors to female students hoping to take exams and attend class. 
 Reports by Voice of America and the Associated Press said young women could be seen crying after they were not permitted to go into their university buildings. 
Taliban fighters in Kabul and other Afghan cities blocked the students from going into their classrooms.  The action came one day after the Taliban administration shared a letter that said private and public universities should ban women and girls as soon as possible.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Suddenly Everyone Is Hunting for Alternatives to the US Dollar 
King Dollar is facing a revolt. 
Tired of a too-strong and newly weaponized greenback, some of the world’s biggest economies are exploring ways to circumvent the US currency. 
Smaller nations, including at least a dozen in Asia, are also experimenting with de-dollarization. And corporates around the world are selling an unprecedented portion of their debt in local currencies, wary of further dollar strength. 
No one is saying the greenback will be dethroned anytime soon from its reign as the principal medium of exchange. Calls for “peak dollar” have many times proven premature. But not too long ago it was almost unthinkable for countries to explore payment mechanisms that bypassed the US currency or the SWIFT network that underpins the global financial system.

WNU Editor: The seizure of Russia&#x27;s dollar assets was a wake-up call for everyone to start looking for alternatives. Raising interest rates and making the US dollar stronger so that America&#x27;s inflation crisis can be dumped on everyone else has made this looking for an alternative to the US dollar into a rush.And while I do expect the US dollar to be the main currency that will be used in international trade and contracts, I give it another a decade before this is no longer the case.</span>

Bloomberg: Putin Pledges Unlimited Spending to Ensure Victory in Ukraine 
(Bloomberg) -- President Vladimir Putin said Russia has “no limitations” on military spending for the war in Ukraine, as he urged the army to deliver on his declared goals with the invasion approaching its 11th month. 
“The country and government is giving everything that the army asks for — everything,” Putin told top military officials at the Defense Ministry’s annual meeting in Moscow on Wednesday. “I trust that there will be an appropriate response and the results will be achieved.” 
Russia should expand its armed forces to 1.5 million troops from the current 1.15 million to ensure its security, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin. The total should include 695,000 professional contract soldiers, he said, without explaining where the additional recruits would be found. 
The commitment to spare no expense on the war will be a strain on government finances as the proceeds from energy exports come under pressure from price restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. While Russia is running a record current-account surplus this year, the flow of money is expected to weaken in 2023 as sales of gas to Europe plunge and Group of Seven sanctions curb Russia’s oil revenue.

NATO-supplied artillery was reportedly used in a deadly strike on a hotel in Donetsk 
One person has died and several were wounded after three projectiles struck a hotel on the south side of Donetsk on Wednesday evening. 
Among the wounded were former Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin and Deputy Prime Minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Vitaly Khotsenko. 
 “I was wounded in the back. Will survive. Shrapnel got within a centimeter from the spine,” Rogozin told RT from the hospital. “I will stay in Donetsk with my wounded comrades.”

WNU Editor: When I first started this blog I got into a few arguments with Dmitry Rogozin in the comments section. He was a regular reader of the blog, followed WNU on Twitter, and he was always disagreeing with me on my views on what political/economic/and foreign policy direction Russia should take. 
I always enjoyed our discussions, but when he was appointed by Putin to be Russia&#x27;s ambassador to NATO and later Deputy Prime Minister he had to stop making his views public. 
He is a hardcore Russian nationalist, who I believe fell out of favor with Putin a few months ago. The fact that he is in Ukraine does not surprise me, nor the fact that Ukraine wants him dead.</span>

                              <span>After months of pro-Kremlin state media prediction that the U.S. support for Ukraine would die out, Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov became enraged when he saw an image of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris as they accepted and proudly held up the Ukrainian flag, The Daily Beast reports. 
As a guest was speaking, Solovyov reportedly was texting with producers, demanding that they remove the clip of Zelensky in the U.S. When the producers didn&#x27;t react to his demands fast enough, he said, &quot;Guys, get rid of this video, if you can’t read what is being written to you!”
“Zelensky is already on his way to Washington. It’s perhaps a natural path for any traitor... He betrayed his entire Soviet past,” he said. “Our weapon-makers are more talented anyway. Our men are more ingenious because we’re Russians—of many different nationalities. God is with us! Either we will win, or humanity will cease to exist, because the Lord won’t stand for the triumph of warriors of the Antichrist. We are the Lord’s weapon, we are his avenging right hand.”

                              <span>While investigating reports that Russian forces took children from two orphanages in Kherson, Ukraine, Sky News found CCTV footage that captured the moment Russians arrived to find the children.
The footage shows agents with Russia&#x27;s secret police, the FSB, leading Russian soldiers through an orphanage. 
&quot;They confiscated all the children&#x27;s files,&quot; orphanage director Volodymyr Sahaidak told Sky News, &quot;because they couldn&#x27;t figure out where the children were, so they took files, they took computers, they took away the CCTV system because they wanted to know where the children had gone.&quot;
According to Sky News, no children were at the orphanage at the time because the community had heard the call from the orphanage to hide them. &quot;The entire village rallied together to protect the children, taking them in, three or four per family. They ran the risk of collaborators exposing them to the Russians and being arrested or shot,&quot; Sky News&#x27; report stated.

The Russians never found the orphans, but sent another fifteen children from elsewhere in Ukraine for the orphanage to look after. Sky News has seen videos showing orphanage staff taking them in and treating them as their own. When the Russians finally retreated from the region, they came and took all 15 children with them.

                              <span>Russia on Thursday accused Ukraine and the United States of turning a deaf ear to its concerns after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a historic visit to Washington.
Zelensky enjoyed a hero&#x27;s welcome on a lightning trip on Wednesday in which US President Joe Biden committed nearly $1.8 billion in military supplies including, for the first time, the Patriot missile defense system.
&quot;We can say with regret that so far neither President Biden nor President Zelensky have said even a few words that could be perceived as potential readiness to listen to Russia&#x27;s concerns,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Officials in Moscow over recent months have repeatedly said they have not ruled out talks with Ukraine.
They have blamed the closure of diplomatic channels on Zelensky,…</span>

&quot;I think behind the scenes there are discussions,&quot; McCaskill told &quot;Morning Joe.&quot; &quot;I think everyone is very aware that it is very important for the public-facing Ukrainian effort to be without chinks, without any kind of crease that would indicate an unwillingness to prosecute this war to its fullest.

                              <span>To this point, the Russian military is losing the war in Ukraine despite overwhelming numerical superiority. Western intelligence agencies believe the Russians have suffered casualties of more than 100,000 killed or wounded and that some of the most elite and best-equipped Russian military units have been destroyed. The collective morale and will of the Russian soldiers in Ukraine — and likely of the Russian military as a whole — has been severely degraded. A significant portion of the territory that the Russians captured during their initial invasion nine or 10 months ago has since been retaken by the Ukrainians.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday denounced psychological violence and abuse of power in the Church, as the case of a prominent priest accused of exploiting his authority to sexually abuse nuns has rocked the Vatican.
The 86-year-old pope made his comments in his annual Christmas address to cardinals, bishops and other members of the Curia, the central administration of the Vatican.
Francis has often used the occasion to decry perceived flaws in the top bureaucracy, such as gossip, cliques and infighting.
After mentioning wars, the pope said: &quot;Besides the violence of arms, there is also verbal violence, psychological violence, the violence of the abuse of power, the hidden violence of gossip.&quot;

It also reported a &quot;progression&quot; of his cancer, but said Pele was not in intensive care.
Considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time, Pele was hospitalized in Sao Paulo on November 29 for what his medical team called a re-evaluation of his chemotherapy treatments, which he has been receiving since having surgery to remove a colon tumor in September 2021.

KYIV (Reuters) - As Russian cruise missiles sped towards their target this month, a Ukrainian pilot gave chase in an old Soviet MiG-29 fighter jet and locked onto two of them, but could not take the shot: they were nearing a large town and it was too risky.
He said he passed the targets on to Ukraine&#x27;s ground-based air defences which shot them down, as they have done hundreds of missiles since October, blunting the impact of a Russian air campaign that aims to destroy the country&#x27;s power grid.
&quot;Fortunately for us, they succeeded,&quot; the 29-year-old pilot, whose codename is Juice, told Reuters, describing the Dec. 5 incident.
Such skirmishes are common in the skies over Ukraine, and their outcomes have a direct bearing on the lives of millions of people who are left without h…</span>

In the latest move to restrict human rights in Afghanistan, the Taliban&#x27;s minister for higher education on Tuesday ordered all public and private universities to bar women from attending.
&quot;They expelled women from universities. Oh, the respected people, support, support. Rights for everyone or no one!&quot; chanted the protesters as they rallied in a Kabul neighborhood, footage obtained by AFP showed.
A protester at the rally told AFP &quot;some of the girls&quot; had been arrested by women police officers. Two were released, but several remained in custody, she added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Three hundred days after Russian leader Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine with hopes of swift conquest, Zelensky enjoyed a hero&#x27;s welcome on a lightning trip to Washington where President Joe Biden committed nearly $1.8 billion in military supplies including, for the first time, the Patriot missile defense system.
Zelensky -- whose media savvy and rugged demeanor have helped rally world opinion -- wore his trademark green military fatigues as he held talks at the White House and addressed Congress, where he handed over an Ukrainian flag fresh from the battlefield.

The French regulator said that after investigations it found that &quot;when users visited this site, cookies were deposited on their terminal without their consent, while these cookies were used, among others, for advertising purposes.&quot;

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States are considering staging their first large-scale joint live-fire demonstration in six years in 2023 amid North Korea&#x27;s growing military threats, Seoul&#x27;s defence ministry said on Thursday.
The drills have been floated as South Korea and the United States discuss preparations for the 70th anniversary of their alliance next year, ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha-gyu said.
&quot;Marking that occasion, we are exploring various ways to showcase our military&#x27;s presence and the alliance&#x27;s overwhelming deterrence capabilities against North Korea,&quot; Jeon told a regular briefing.
&quot;A combined joint live-fire demonstration can be one of the options.&quot;
The demonstration would be another joint display of force to be resumed following a years-long hiatus under new South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who pledged to bolster military capabilities and readiness to deter North Korea&#x27;s weapons development.
On Tuesday, the United States flew its F-22 Raptor stealth fighters for joint drills with South Korea for the first time since 2018, hours after North Korea criticised both countries and vowed more missile tests.
In September, the allies staged their first exercises with a U.S. aircraft carrier since 2018.
Such exercises were halted under Yoon&#x27;s predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who had prioritised engagement with the North, which denounced them as a rehearsal for invasion.
North Korea has tested an unprecedented number of missiles this year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) designed to strike the U.S. mainland. It has also completed preparations for what would be its first nuclear test since 2017, Seoul and Washington officials said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The U.N. Security Council adopted its first resolution on Myanmar in 74 years on Wednesday to demand an end to violence and urge the military junta to release all political prisoners, including ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Myanmar has been in crisis since the army took power from Suu Kyi&#x27;s elected government on Feb. 1, 2021, detaining her and other officials and responding to pro-democracy protests and dissent with lethal force.
&quot;Today we&#x27;ve sent a firm message to the military that they should be in no doubt - we expect this resolution to be implemented in full,&quot; Britain&#x27;s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said after the vote on the British-drafted resolution.

An art expert breaks down Just Stop Oil’s infamous climate protests.

It’s a form of nonviolent protest that’s heavily reliant on shock value and has drawn the ire of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government, who have vowed to crack down on disruptive climate protests.

Supplementary Material for the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Rulemaking, “Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review”

Why Zelenskyy made the surprising trip this week. 
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wearing fatigues, has made a wartime visit to the United States. Wednesday afternoon, he met with US President Joe Biden and his team at the White House, and in the evening, he addressed Congress at a time when lawmakers are debating tens of billions in further aid to his country.

He and Biden sat before a cozy fire in the Oval Office with portraits of past American presidents looking down on them.

— CNN International (@cnni) December 21, 2022
   Stephen Collinson, CNN: Why Zelensky’s surprise US visit is so hugely significant  
President Volodymyr Zelensky’s White House visit Wednesday will symbolically bolster America’s role as the arsenal of democracy in the bitter war for Ukraine’s survival and send a stunning public rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
The trip – Zelensky’s first outside Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February – also highlights President Joe Biden’s historic role in reviving the Western alliance that kept the Soviet Union at bay and is now countering new expansionism by Moscow in an effective proxy war between nuclear superpowers. 
Zelensky’s arrival will draw poignant echoes of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s arrival in Washington, 81 years ago on Thursday, days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That Christmas visit cemented the alliance that would win World War II and built the post-war democratic world.

Zelensky is reportedly arriving to Washington D.C. aboard a US Air Force plane, according to US officials cited in CNN, after taking a high risk train ride into Poland. White House national security communications coordinator John Kirby said of the impending visit with President Biden, &quot;The President really believes that as we approach winter, as we enter … a new phase in this war, of Mr. Putin’s aggression, that this is a good time for the two leaders to sit down face to face and talk.&quot; But this is how Reuters somewhat cynically previewed the visit:        
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy headed to Washington on Wednesday to meet President Joe Biden, address Congress and seek &quot;weapons, weapons and more weapons&quot; in his first overseas trip since Russia invaded Ukraine 300 days ago.

RT: Defense minister announces major expansion of Russian army  
Sergey Shoigu says the nation’s military should amount to 1.5 million servicemen  
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has announced the need to make a number of structural changes to the country’s armed forces in light of NATO’s attempts to bolster its presence on Russia’s border and expand its membership to Finland and Sweden. 
During a Russian Defense Ministry meeting on Wednesday, Shoigu proposed a number of measures to strengthen the security of the Russian Federation, including creating a special grouping of troops on the country’s northwestern border and expanding Russia’s armed forces to amount to 1.5 million servicemen in total, with some 695,000 of them being contract soldiers.

Washington Post: No conclusive evidence Russia is behind Nord Stream attack 
After explosions in late September severely damaged undersea pipelines built to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe, world leaders quickly blamed Moscow for a brazen and dangerous act of sabotage. With winter approaching, it appeared the Kremlin intended to strangle the flow of energy to millions across the continent, an act of “blackmail,” some leaders said, designed to threaten countries into withdrawing their financial and military support for Ukraine. 
But now, after months of investigation, numerous officials privately say that Russia may not be to blame after all for the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. 
 “There is no evidence at this point that Russia was behind the sabotage,” said one European official, echoing the assessment of 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine countries interviewed in recent weeks.

As to what is my take.
Russia&#x27;s Gazprom spent 10 years and $23 billion dollars to build these pipelines with the expectation that almost $1 trillion will be earned over the course of the lifetime of these pipelines. So yes. I will admit that I have trouble understanding the logic from those who say that Russia is the one who is responsible for blowing up their own gas pipelines. I mean .... they could have simply closed the taps.</span>

                              <span>The Biden administration wants to know how American-made microelectronics and other western components are winding up in Iranian-made drones launched by Russia into Ukraine.
Multiple officials familiar with the effort told CNN the administration has authorized a task force to investigate the potential violations of stiff export control restrictions and sanctions intended to prevent Iran from obtaining those materials, whose presence in the drones was confirmed by UK-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research.
That group examined several drones downed in Ukraine and determined that 82 percent of their components were manufactured by U.S.-based companies, including processors built by Texas Instruments and an engine built by an Austrian firm owned by Canada’s Bombardier Recreational Products.
Both companies have condemned the use of their technology for illicit purposes.</span>

Six of the deaths were recorded in Apurimac, as Boluarte&#x27;s own took a firm stand against her, marching in large numbers to demand fresh elections for a new president and Castillo&#x27;s release despite a rash of corruption allegations.

Less than 40 Bissu remain in just a few areas across South Sulawesi, according to anthropologists, and they now perform cultural and shaman-like roles to prevent their traditions from dying.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Dozens of hearses queued outside a Beijing crematorium on Wednesday, even as China reported no new COVID-19 deaths in its growing outbreak, sparking criticism of its virus accounting as the capital braces for a surge of severe cases.
Following widespread protests, the country of 1.4 billion people this month began dismantling its &quot;zero-COVID&quot; regime of lockdowns and testing that had largely kept the virus away for three years - at great economic and psychological costs.
The abrupt change of policy has caught the country&#x27;s fragile health system unprepared, with hospitals scrambling for beds and blood, pharmacies for drugs, and authorities racing to build special clinics. Experts now predict China could face more than a million COV…</span>

MEXICO CITY/LIMA (Reuters) -Peru declared Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to Lima &quot;persona non grata&quot; and ordered him to leave the country on Tuesday, Peru&#x27;s foreign minister announced, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two nations after Peru ousted Pedro Castillo as president.
The abrupt order, a severe measure in the world of diplomacy, gives Mexico&#x27;s envoy to the South American country just 72 hours to exit.
The Peruvian government&#x27;s decision came hours after Mexico&#x27;s top diplomat announced that his country had granted asylum to the family of Castillo, who faces rebellion charges from behind bars after attempting what critics have labeled a coup on Dec. 7.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fiji&#x27;s parliament has delayed its first sitting, where it had been expected a new prime minister would be sworn in to the Pacific islands nation for the first time in 16 years.
People&#x27;s Alliance leader Sitiveni Rabuka is expected to become prime minister, after three parties signed a coalition agreement on Tuesday after a hung election. The deal would dislodge Fiji First&#x27;s Frank Bainimarama, who has led Fiji since a 2006 coup.
The constitution requires lawmakers to elect the prime minister from the parliament floor if no one party has won more than 50% of seats.
Fiji parliament&#x27;s secretariat confirmed to Reuters in an email that parliament would not sit on Wednesday because Fiji&#x27;s President Wiliame Katonivere has not yet issued a procla…</span>

                              <span>RT: Explosion rocks major Russian gas pipeline 
Three people have died in the incident in Central Russia, with at least one injured, local authorities say 
An explosion has rocked a pipeline in Russia’s Chuvash Republic several hundred kilometers east of Moscow, causing a major fire, local officials said. The incident along the route, which is used to transport energy to Europe, killed at least three people and injured another one, while prompting gas prices in Europe to soar. 
The local administration’s press service said the blast occurred along the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline. It added that the operating company had been conducting maintenance work on the conduit before the fire broke out.

                              <span>Reuters: Ghana to default on most external debt as economic crisis worsens 
ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana on Monday suspended payments on most of its external debt, effectively defaulting as the country struggles to plug its cavernous balance of payments deficit. 
Its finance ministry said it will not service debts including its Eurobonds, commercial loans and most bilateral loans, calling the decision an &quot;interim emergency measure&quot;, while some bondholders criticised a lack of clarity in the decision. 
The government &quot;stands ready to engage in discussions with all of its external creditors to make Ghana&#x27;s debt sustainable&quot;, the finance ministry said. 
The suspension of debt payments reflects the parlous state of the economy, which had led the government last week to reach a $3-billion staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

North Korea’s foreign ministry calls Japan’s new $320bn security strategy ‘wrong and dangerous’, promises a response.  North Korea has condemned Japan’s planned military build-up and pledged action against what it described as Tokyo’s “wrong and dangerous choice” to bolster its defence sector. 
The statement on Tuesday from North Korea’s foreign ministry comes just days after Japan unveiled a new $320bn security strategy that outlined plans for Japan’s military to mount “counter-strike capabilities”, and to respond to the threats posed by China, Russia and North Korea.
