                              <span>Reuters: Global level of forced displacement climbs to record 110 million, UN says 
GENEVA (Reuters) - The number of people forcibly displaced around the world has climbed to a record 110 million people, the head of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said, with conflicts in Ukraine and Sudan spurring millions of people to flee their homes. 
The increase of around 19 million people to 108.4 million by the end of last year is the biggest annual jump on record, UNHCR said in a report released on Wednesday. 
That number has since risen further to 110 million, mostly due to Sudan&#x27;s eight-week-old conflict, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told journalists.
&quot;It&#x27;s quite an indictment on the state of our world to have to report that,&quot; he said at a Geneva press conference.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled the country&#x27;s first &quot;National Security Strategy.&quot; The plan envisages more coherent foreign and security policies to prevent Berlin from being wrong-footed by geopolitical events. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and members of his Cabinet on Wednesday presented Germany&#x27;s long-delayed national security strategy, with the aim of avoiding past mistakes that have left the government red-faced. 
Although Germany has had policy documents in the past covering security, it has never had a dedicated comprehensive strategy.

RT: Moscow estimates Ukraine’s counteroffensive losses

 
Some 7,500 troops have been killed or injured in failed attacks since June 4, the Russian Defense Ministry has said  
Ukraine has lost several thousand service members since launching its much-anticipated counteroffensive earlier this month, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed on Wednesday. 
In a statement, the ministry said that Kiev’s forces have suffered some 7,500 killed or wounded, with the tally only including service members on the front line, and not those struck by Russian high-precision missiles and airstrikes deeper into Ukrainian territory. 
The estimated losses encompass the period from June 4, when the Russian Defense Ministry reported it had repelled a large-scale Ukrainian offensive along five sections of the front line in Donbass. Since then, Kiev’s troops have attempted to storm Russian positions on numerous occasions, failing to gain any ground, according to Moscow.

Daily Mail: Russian threat to cut Britain off from the internet: Former president Medvedev says Moscow could &#x27;destroy our enemies&#x27; undersea cables&#x27; after report claims Western involvement in Nord Stream blast 
* Fears have been growing that Russia could target Britain&#x27;s undersea cables 
* Medvedev has previously called British officials &#x27;legitimate targets&#x27; 
Russia&#x27;s former President Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday there were no longer any &#x27;moral limits&#x27; to stop Moscow from destroying its enemies&#x27; undersea cables in a threat the United Kingdom and its allies. 
This is because of what what he said was Western complicity in the Nord Stream pipeline blasts last year, that are still officially unexplained. 
Medvedev made the threatening comments on his official channel on the Telegram messaging application early on Wednesday, amid fears that Russia could cut off cables connecting Britain to the internet causing widespread blackouts.

Belarus has already started taking delivery of Russian nukes, some of which President Alexander Lukashenko boasted are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons is Moscow&#x27;s first move of such bombs  - which could potentially be used on the battlefield - outside Russian borders since the fall of the Soviet Union. 
 &#x27;We have missiles and bombs that we have received from Russia,&#x27; Lukashenko said in an interview with the Rossiya-1 Russian state TV channel which was posted on the Belarusian Belta state news agency&#x27;s Telegram channel. 
&#x27;The bombs are three times more powerful than those (dropped on) Hiroshima and Nagasaki,&#x27; he said, speaking on a road in a forest clearing with military vehicles parked nearby and some kind of military storage facility visible in the background.

WNU Editor: From the New York Times (link here) .... 
 .... The issue of how to define Ukraine’s future in the alliance has overtaken a second question, how to come up long-term security assurances for Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s aides are telling members of Congress they want to move to something akin to what they call “the Israel model,” which has a 10-year-long security commitment with the United States. 
While Ukraine’s would almost certainly be shorter, the idea, administration officials say, would be to convince Mr. Putin that the flow of arms and training to Kyiv will not flag — and to bleed some of the politics out of episodic debates about how much aid to commit to Ukraine in the next six months or a year. 
This is the second time that the Western media is pushing out this trial balloon of an &quot;Israeli model&quot; for Ukraine. The first time was last month .... NATO Discussing Security Model for Ukraine like Israel&#x27;s – WSJ (European Pravda). 
As to what is my take. 
The U.S. security model for Israel has resulted in decades of war and conflict between Israel and its neighbors. But this model, if applied to Ukraine, will result in the utter destruction of the country. The Russians, when it comes to war, are not like the Arabs.

                              <span>Bloomberg: As Iran Emerges From Isolation, Israel Is Feeling Cornered 
(Bloomberg) -- Early this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a mock wartime meeting of his security cabinet in a bunker. Communities in northern Israel are preparing shelters for a long-term conflict. And the military is working overtime on a new laser system to intercept rockets. 
Their focus is Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
For years, Israel has considered a nuclear-armed Iran to be an existential threat, and directed its energies to confronting it and its regional proxies in Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian areas. 
But much is new in the past few months. Iran has emerged from diplomatic isolation, forging a key military alliance with Russia from which it’s seeking air defenses, restoring diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia and pushing its allies to fire missiles at Israel. It is also enriching more and more uranium, including a small amount almost to weapons grade — while denying any plans for making a bomb.

WNU Editor: The Middle East is rapidly changing. The wars that have engulfed the Middle East for the past few years appear to be ending, and Iran is restoring ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. But more importantly there is a growing perception in the Middle East that U.S. power and influence in the region is in decline, a scenario that does not favor a country like Israel that is heavily dependent on US economic and military aid.</span>

                              <span>CNN: Blinken speaks with Chinese foreign minister ahead of expected high-stakes visit to Beijing 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with China’s foreign minister by phone on Wednesday, a call that comes ahead of a highly anticipated visit by Washington’s top diplomat to Beijing as the two superpowers try to improve the dismal state of their ties. 
In his call with Qin Gang, Blinken discussed “the importance of maintaining open lines of communication” to responsibly manage US-China relations to “avoid miscalculation and conflict,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. 
Blinken also addressed a range of bilateral and global issues, and made clear “the US would continue to use diplomatic engagements to raise areas of concern as well as areas of potential cooperation,” according to the statement.

China Power: Debunking Reports of ‘Cracks’ in China’s Third Aircraft Carrier 
In recent weeks, rampant misinformation has spread online about China’s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian. In late May, netizens began posting images online that purportedly showed large cracks in the Fujian’s deck. 
On Twitter, one of these posts racked up nearly one million views, and numerous follow-on tweets have been viewed tens of thousands of times. Even more digital ink was spilled over these claims as news reports began to spread the tweets. 
These reports are false. There are no large cracks in the vessel’s deck. Commercial satellite imagery captured on May 15 shows no sign of cracks or similar markings on the deck. There are also no signs that major work has been done to those portions of the deck, which indicates no repairs were made.

CTV News/Canadian Press: Fox News shouldn&#x27;t air in Canada despite Tucker Carlson ouster, LGBTQ2S+ group argues 
TORONTO - An advocacy group that wants the CRTC to ban Fox News says the network&#x27;s &quot;abusive content&quot; extends beyond its divisive personalities such as recently fired host Tucker Carlson. 
Fox News should be banned from Canadian airwaves because it has &quot;repeatedly and regularly&quot; violated broadcasting standards with content that subjects many groups to hate, Egale Canada is arguing in its formal submission to Canada&#x27;s broadcasting regulator. 
The LGBTQ2S+ rights group is dismissing Fox&#x27;s argument that the application to remove its news network from Canadian cable TV packages is &quot;moot&quot; in the wake of prime-time host Tucker Carlson&#x27;s ousting in late April.

Update: Could Fox News be banned from Canadian airwaves? CRTC weighs call (Global News)

 
WNU Editor: This is not an idle threat. The CRTC killed the cable news channel Sun Media (Canada&#x27;s FOX News equivalent) a few years ago when it denied the company the license to expand to other regions of Canada in order to become profitable. 
On a personal note. On my cable package I have FOX News, but during its peak times (The Five for example) half of the time I cannot see it due to &quot;technical reasons&quot;. But I have no problems seeing CNN or MSNBC. I have yet to receive an explanation from my cable provider (Videotron) on why this is case.</span>

Insider: The US is sending depleted-uranium ammo to Ukraine capable of piercing Russian tank armour, report says 
* The US is set to approve depleted-uranium tank shells for Ukraine, the WSJ said. 
* The shells are capable of blowing up Russian tank armor. 
* There were doubts over providing the shells for environmental and health reasons. 
The US is sending depleted-uranium shells to Ukraine that are capable of penetrating Russian tank armor, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
For several months the Biden administration has been debating whether to provide the shells to Ukraine following concerns over their environmental and health impacts, the outlet reported. 
But an administration official said that there were now no major obstacles to providing the ammunition.

                              <span>Reuters: Russia releases video of captured German tanks, U.S. fighting vehicles in Ukraine 
Russia&#x27;s Defence Ministry released video footage on Tuesday of what it said were German-made Leopard tanks and U.S.-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles captured by Russian forces in a fierce battle with Ukrainian troops. 
 Reuters was able to confirm that the vehicles seen in the video were Leopard tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but was not able to independently verify the location or date of the footage. 
The Defence Ministry said the armoured vehicles and tanks were captured on the Zaporizhzhia front in southern Ukraine, one of the areas where Ukrainian forces have been trying to counter-attack. 
Two Leopard tanks were shown in the footage, which was released on the ministry&#x27;s official channel on the Telegram messaging application, along with two damaged Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

As to what is my take.
I still think it is too early to make any final judgements. 
But a friend of mine said something early today that I have been thinking about all morning. If Ukraine was succeeding in their counteroffensive and making great progress, we will be hearing about it non-stop from the media all day. Instead .... we are only being told that a village or two have been recaptured.</span>

Sonar 21: What Could Russia Demand to Negotiate an End to the War in Ukraine? 
I know that some in the West are suggesting that there may be a way to negotiate and end to the war in Ukraine and I think they do not understand what Russia is now likely to demand to secure such a deal. For starters, will Russia insist on securing the rights to all territory east of the Dnieper River and on a special status for Odessa? I think so. Odessa would no longer be ruled by Ukraine.
I also would expect Russia to demand (non-negotiable) the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the murder of 42 Russian speaking Ukrainians in 2014 who sought refuge in the Trade Unions House.

I also would expect that Russia will demand the dismantling of NATO Aegis missile systems in Poland and Romania and a ban on U.S. or NATO troops being posted in countries that share a border with Ukraine. In light of Russia’s stated goal of de-nazification I would not be surprised if Russia demands the laws of Ukraine be changed and that Nazi-affiliated parties and symbols be banned.

PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron warned on Monday that the Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces could last “weeks, even months.” 
“The counteroffensive has started. It’s going to be deployed for several weeks and even months. We are supporting it within the limits that we set ourselves,” Macron said alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Elysée Palace.

The French president hosted the German and Polish leaders to seek ways of helping Kyiv wrest back land from Russia. Poland&#x27;s premier pressed for a clearer roadmap for Ukraine to join the NATO defensive alliance. 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish leader Andrzej Duda, with the Polish prime minister pressing the case for Ukraine to gain NATO membership. 
The three gathered to talk about military support for Kyiv&#x27;s counteroffensive and humanitarian aid to the country after the breach of the Kherson region&#x27;s Kakhovka dam. 
 &quot;We have done everything to help it,&quot; Macron said of Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive. &quot;We have intensified the delivery of ammunition, weapons, and armored vehicles... We will continue in coming days and weeks.&quot;

Sen. Chuck Grassley said Monday that the Burisma executive who allegedly paid Joe Biden and Hunter Biden kept 17 audio recordings of his conversations with them as an &quot;insurance policy,&quot; citing the FBI FD-1023 form that the bureau briefed congressional lawmakers on. 
Grassley, R-Iowa, revealed from the Senate floor Monday what was said to be a redacted reference in the FBI-generated FD-1023 form alleging a criminal bribery scheme between then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national that involved influence over U.S. policy decisions.

The Messenger: The US Is Preparing Evacuation Plans for American Citizens in Taiwan (Exclusive)

 
Wars in Ukraine and Afghanistan hang over planning for worst-case scenarios 
The U.S. government is preparing evacuation plans for American citizens living in Taiwan, three sources told The Messenger. 
The planning has been underway for at least six months and “it’s heated up over the past two months or so,” said a senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the planning. 
 The official said a “heightened level of tension” had driven the preparations. “It’s nothing you wouldn’t read in the news,” he told The Messenger. “Forces building up. China aligning with Russia on Ukraine.”

US spy agencies are buying and selling Americans&#x27; personal data, creating a huge threat to privacy, a stunning new report revealed on Monday. 
The offerings on have grown from basic address history and demographic information to piles of data generated smartphone devices and apps, social-media platforms, automobiles and location trackers such as fitness watches, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
That detailed information can now &#x27;cause harm to an individual&#x27;s reputation, emotional well-being, or physical safety,&#x27; said a report commissioned by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.

19Fortyfive: Is Joe Biden Hiding Intelligence on China’s Assistance to Russia?

 
Any transfer of weaponry from China to Ukraine would be significant, and it would likely mean the war is nowhere near concluding. 
Give credit where credit is due: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan masterfully declassified intelligence ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in order to take the wind out of the sails of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s propaganda. Thanks to the exposure of Putin’s intentions, not only the American audience but also much of the wider world recognized Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim. This held true even in countries like Iran where, despite their government’s support for Putin, ordinary people overwhelmingly see Ukraine as the victim and draw parallels between their own experience during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and what Ukrainians experience today.

SKY News: Iran: The West cannot stop us from building nuclear weapons but a deal is possible

 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#x27;s words come at a time of high tension between Iran and Israel, with Israel&#x27;s leader already having said his country will do &quot;whatever we need to do to defend ourselves&quot;. 
The West cannot stop Iran from building nuclear weapons, the country&#x27;s supreme leader has said.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking on Sunday as tensions continue to mount over the country&#x27;s nuclear work.

In words reported by state media, he said: &quot;Talks about Tehran&#x27;s nuclear weapons is a lie and [the West] know it.
&quot;We do not want nuclear arms based on our beliefs, otherwise they would not have been able to stop it.&quot;

A deal with the West over the nuclear programme is possible, the supreme leader said, but only if Tehran can keep its nuclear infrastructure intact.

RT:  Defense Ministry reveals number of Russians volunteering for army

 
Over 13,500 servicemen have signed up for contract service in just 10 days
Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry has praised the growing “consolidation” among the population, reporting a significant increase in the number of people willing to join the army and volunteer units amid the conflict with Ukraine.
“In just ten days of the current month, 13,644 people have signed up for contract service,” Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Pankov said during a special briefing on Saturday. “This is 2.1 times more than in the same period of May this year, and 3.1 times higher than in April.” 
Last month, ex-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s National Security Council, claimed that some 117,400 people had volunteered to join the army since January.

* A PLA warning was played as the island&#x27;s leader was making a radio call to a captain stationed in the southern city of Kaohsiung 
* Taiwan says the mainland military had not hacked into her radio channel, but security specialists call for an investigation in case plans are being leaked to the PLA

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army disrupted a radio call between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the island&#x27;s air force, sparking a discussion about secure communications. 
Tsai was visiting southern Taiwan on Friday to boost morale among service personnel ahead of next week&#x27;s Dragon Boat Festival and spoke to two female officers stationed at an air defence and missile command centre in Kaohsiung.
In a video clip broadcast by local media, Tsai was seen radioing an air force captain, saying &quot;Hotel Delta, this is the president&quot;, before a PLA warning was heard in the background.

                              <span>In an all-caps rant on his Truth Social platform Monday, former President Donald Trump vowed to appoint another special counsel to prosecute President Joe Biden. It was a single word that raised the alarm for an expert in religious extremism.
&quot;NOW THAT THE &#x27;SEAL&#x27; IS BROKEN, IN ADDITION TO CLOSING THE BORDER &amp; REMOVING ALL OF THE &#x27;CRIMINAL&#x27; ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ILLEGALLY INVADED OUR COUNTRY, MAKING AMERICA ENERGY INDEPENDENT, &amp; EVEN DOMINANT AGAIN, &amp; IMMEDIATELY ENDING THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA &amp; UKRAINE, I WILL APPOINT A REAL SPECIAL &#x27;PROSECUTOR&#x27; TO GO AFTER THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA, JOE BIDEN, THE ENTIRE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY, &amp; ALL OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS, BORDERS, &amp; COUNTRY ITSELF!&quot; wrote Trump.
The use of &quot;seal&quot; may not be an accident, wrote religion reporter and extremism expert Jeff Sharlet. It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.
&quot;QAnon &amp; many fundamentalists will read this — &amp; I don’t think it’s a stretch to imagine Trump’s people are aware of that — as both the indictment &amp; 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ,&quot; wrote Sharlet.
The Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. 
This could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist — as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.
All of this comes as Trump prepares to face arraignment in Miami on Tuesday, and as authorities brace for the possibility of violence from Trump supporters in the vicinity, supported by escalating violent rhetoric on pro-Trump corners of the internet.</span>

UN Secretary General António Guterres has issued a warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence and called for the creation of a regulatory body.
&quot;Alarm bells over the latest form of artificial intelligence – generative AI – are deafening,&quot; Guterres said at a press conference in New York on Monday.
&quot;Scientists and experts have called on the world to act, declaring AI an existential threat to humanity on a par with the risk of nuclear war. We must take those warnings seriously,&quot; he said.
Guterres presented a position paper in which the United Nations makes proposals on how to deal with AI worldwide and announced plans to create a high-level advisory body on the issue.
He also said that he supported the establishment of a regulatory authority, but that it could not be set up by him alone, only in partnership with the UN member states.
He suggested that such an authority could be inspired by what the International Atomic Energy Agency is today.</span>

                              <span>-Lawyers for Ukraine at the top U.N. court on Monday rejected Russia&#x27;s account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a &quot;rambling conspiracy theory&quot;, in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
Kyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.
Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had &quot;overall control&quot; over the separatist forces.
Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine&#x27;s MH17 case was based on &quot;nonsense&quot; and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.
On Monday, Ukraine&#x27;s lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been &quot;subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory&quot; about the shooting down of MH17 which would be &quot;better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet&quot;.
Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.
Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine&#x27;s allegations on Thursday.
The World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.

The latest research from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that the nine countries currently known to be in possession of nuclear weapons had 9,576 working nukes at the beginning of 2023, up slightly from the 9,490 total in January 2022.
Just two countries—the United States and Russia—control 90% of the world&#x27;s nuclear arsenal, respectively possessing 3,708 and 4,489 working nukes, SIPRI found. Both nations have thousands of warheads deployed on military bases with operational …</span>

Among both men and women, &quot;biased gender social norms are prevalent worldwide: almost 90 percent of people have at least one bias&quot; among the seven analyzed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
These prejudices &quot;are widespread among men and women suggesting that these biases are deeply embedded and influences both men and women to similar degrees&quot;, the report says.

                              <span>BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in Colombia&#x27;s southern jungle will tell their own story about the ordeal, the father of the two youngest siblings said on Sunday.
The children, aged 1 through 13, survived a May 1 plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults and were found on Friday in Caqueta province after weeks of searching by the military and Indigenous communities.
Their ordeal began in the early hours, when the Cessna 206 aircraft carrying seven people and traveling between Araracuara airport in Caqueta and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure.
&quot;They will tell their stories and you will hear them,&quot; said Manuel Ranoque, the father of the 1-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, after visiting them at Bogota&#x27;s military hospital.
&quot;It&#x27;s not easy to ask them because the children went 40 days without eating well, so I have not been able to get information from the oldest child,&quot; Ranoque told reporters.
Ranoque also told reporters the children&#x27;s mother had survived for four days after the crash, an account disputed by another family member who also spoke to journalists. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -At least 10 people died and 25 were injured after a chartered bus carrying wedding guests rolled off a ramp at a roundabout in the Hunter region in Australia&#x27;s New South Wales (NSW) state, police said on Monday.
The accident occurred around 11:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Sunday near the town of Greta, about 180 km (112 miles) northwest of Sydney, in an area famous for its vineyards and wedding spots.
&quot;I understand they had been at a wedding together, it&#x27;s my understanding they were travelling together ... presumably for their accommodation,&quot; NSW Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Tracy Chapman said during a televised media briefing.
At this stage, it appeared to be a single-vehicle accident, Chapman said. Police were still trying to identify all the passengers, …</span>

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran&#x27;s supreme leader on Sunday said a deal with the West over Tehran&#x27;s nuclear work was possible if the country&#x27;s nuclear infrastructure remained intact, amid a stalemate between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.
Months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since September, with both sides accusing each other of making unreasonable demands.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#x27;s guarded approval comes days after both Tehran and Washington denied a report that they were nearing an interim deal under which Tehran would curb its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

COLONELGUNJ, India (Reuters) - The chief of the Wrestling Federation of India, under police investigation for suspected sexual misconduct after accusations by female athletes, held a political rally on Sunday in his first public appearance since the probe was launched in April.
Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, also a federal lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s ruling party, is the subject of a criminal case filed by seven female wrestlers who accused him of groping young athletes at training camps and tournaments.
Singh has denied all the allegations. Delhi police are investigating and will submit their findings before a trial court on Thursday.

KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - For Kherson resident Iryna Radetska, the catastrophic flooding of her city after the giant Kakhovka dam was destroyed is the latest chapter in more than a year of wartime suffering.
&quot;They say a new love kills the old one. Maybe it&#x27;s the same with tragedy,&quot; said 52-year-old Radetska, who is deputy head of a school in the southern Ukrainian city.
Few places have felt the extent of suffering that Kherson has since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Few people bore the brunt of it harder than Radetska, who said she has survived imprisonment, beatings and rockets.
The city, which had a peacetime population of 280,000, was occupied by Russian forces on March 2, 2022. It was liberated by Ukrainian troops in early November, but since then has b…</span>

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) - Honduras opened an embassy in China on Sunday, Chinese state media reported, after the Central American nation cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan earlier this year.
The embassy in Beijing was opened by foreign ministers from the two countries, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro is in China for a state visit, during which she is to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, state media have reported.
Tegucigalpa in March ended its decades-long relationship with Taipei and established diplomatic ties with Beijing.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

&quot;Counteroffensive and defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine: at which stage I will not talk in detail,&quot; Zelensky said at a joint press conference in Kyiv with Trudeau.
Zelensky commented after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv&#x27;s long-expected counteroffensive was already failing.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
