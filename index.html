                              <span>Curtin University Political Analyst Joe Siracusa says US President Joe Biden is going to have difficulties running for re-election due to “45 per cent” of the Democrat voter base not wanting him to run again.

“President Biden has problems, democrats who are recently polled … said that 45 per cent don’t want to see him run again … his age is going to be a serious problem here,” Mr Siracusa told Sky News Australia.

“Trump, his age too, puts him in difficulties.”</span>

19FortyFive: Russia’s S-500: How Putin Plans to Kill the F-22 and F-35 
The head engineer of the air defense system explained that the S-500 “neutralizes American offensive weapons.” 
Last month, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu revealed that Moscow would complete its missile defense systems modernization efforts by the end of 2023. Russia began prioritizing its aerospace defense capabilities in 2020, when the Kremlin announced its State Armament Program. Under the latest iteration of the program, dubbed GPV-2027 in Russia, the production of the new S-500 system will be accomplished. 
Russia’s latest anti-aircraft missile defense system, “Prometheus,” is expected to become a staple of the Kremlin’s aerospace defense system. The combat capabilities of the Prometheus reportedly blows its predecessor’s abilities out of the water. However, while Moscow may claim that this new system could easily take down fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 Raptor or the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, little remains confirmed about the S-500.

Less than two years after President Biden withdrew U.S. personnel from Afghanistan, the country has become a significant coordination site for the Islamic State as the terrorist group plans attacks across Europe and Asia, and conducts “aspirational plotting” against the United States, according to a classified Pentagon assessment that portrays the threat as a growing security concern. 
The attack planning, detailed in U.S. intelligence findings leaked on the Discord messaging platform and obtained by The Washington Post, reveal specific efforts to target embassies, churches, business centers and the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, which drew more than 2 million spectators last summer in Qatar. Pentagon officials were aware in December of nine such plots coordinated by ISIS leaders in Afghanistan, and the number rose to 15 by February, says the assessment, which has not been disclosed previously.

Reuters: Paris, Kyiv, Baltic States Dismayed After China Envoy Questions Ukraine Sovereignty 
PARIS (Reuters) -France, Ukraine and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania expressed dismay after China&#x27;s ambassador in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet countries like Ukraine. 
Asked about his position on whether Crimea is part of Ukraine or not, Chinese ambassador Lu Shaye said in an interview aired on French television on Friday that historically it was part of Russia and had been offered to Ukraine by former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.

Constant attacks of the Hungarian government from U.S. Democrats do little to differentiate the U.S. from the bullying superpowers it seeks to distance itself from 
The relentless criticism by the Biden administration towards the incumbent Hungarian government is entirely disproportionate and unjustified, and does little to separate the current U.S. regime from the malign superpowers it seeks to distance itself from. Hungary’s leader recognizes this and is putting his own country’s interests ahead of those of the United States, a stance that Europe would be wise to follow. 
Despite pressure from the U.S., Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said his country cannot be pushed into joining the war on the side of Ukraine.

Asia Times:  Guided and glide bombs: new feature in Ukraine war

 
Already needed are next-generation versions less vulnerable to jamming  
The Ukrainians are using US-supplied glide bombs and the Russians have their own. 
These weapons are a new feature in the Ukraine war, and so far the Russians are winning the battle of glide bombs. The Ukrainians are calling the Russian glide bombs an “extremely big threat.” 
The US has supplied Ukraine with two different types of glide bombs, the GLSDB (ground-launched small diameter bomb) produced by Boeing and Saab (Sweden), and the JDAM-ER (joint direct attack munition-extended range), manufactured by Boeing.  Over the years Boeing has produced more than 500,000 JDAMs. 
Russia has answered with two types of precision bombs, the Grom E2 and the UPAB-1500B-E. 
Surprisingly, the US-supplied weapons have not been effective and have been intercepted by the Russians.

WNU Editor: The Russian military has only recently started using guided and glide bombs, and according to all reports that I have seen, they are proving to be very effective. They are also incredibly cheap to build, and with the Russian air force dominating the skies over Ukraine, a useful, accurate, and effective weapon to use against Ukrainian positions.</span>

Every war brings in a new kind of technologies which are meant to amplify the magnitude of war and also the impact of the weapons with more precision guided and cluster munitions which can affect larger areas as well as more casualties among both civilians and military personnel. During the Russia Ukraine war which has been one of these kinds of technology demonstrator given the fact that many of the European countries have been helping Ukraine with new kind of weapons and equipment. Russia, on the other hand, has been toying with the idea of utilizing hypersonic missiles and tactical weapons to hit the strategic locations across Ukraine. Important aspect related to the new kind of technologies has been primarily missile defence, command and control, surface to air missiles, and use of hyper missiles  technologies.

Defense One: The Pentagon Is Increasingly Relying on Billionaires’ Rockets. And It’s OK with That.

 
Space Force leaders say carefully written contracts can prevent things like SpaceX’s about-face on Ukrainian satcomms. 
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado—The U.S. Space Force is not concerned about relying on mercurial billionaires to provide space capabilities, according to top service leaders. 
The service’s ability to put large satellites in space rests primarily on the shoulders of Elon Musk, whose SpaceX test-flew a new heavy-lift rocket for the first time on Thursday, and Jeff Bezos, whose Blue Origin is slated to deliver engines to United Launch Alliance. 
A potential problem is illustrated by Musk’s behavior toward Ukraine. In the months that followed Russia’s invasion, SpaceX donated some 20,000 of its satellite internet terminals and millions of dollars’ worth of service to the Ukrainian military. But in October, SpaceX wrote the Pentagon that it would cease its subsidy. Three months after that, Starlink officials said they had taken steps to hinder Ukraine’s use of the terminals on the battlefield; Musk declared, in apparent contradiction of Starlink’s work for the Pentagon, that the service was “never intended to be weaponized.” Ukrainian and Pentagon officials have said they would seek alternatives to Starlink.

The Hill: Pentagon transfers detainee to Algeria, leaving 30 at Guantanamo 
The Defense Department on Thursday announced the transfer of another Guantanamo Bay prisoner, dropping the infamous prison’s population to 30 incarcerated individuals. 
The U.S. returned Said bin Brahim bin Umran Bakush, who was captured in Pakistan in 2002, to his home country of Algeria, according to a release from the Pentagon. 
Bakush was repatriated after a board hearing last year determined his detention was no longer necessary to protect U.S. national security. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin notified Congress of his release in February.

Epoch Times: IN-DEPTH: ‘It Is Skynet’: Pentagon Envisions Robot Armies in a Decade 
The Pentagon&#x27;s quest for an AI-dominated battlefield is becoming a reality 
WASHINGTON—Robotic killing machines prowl the land, the skies, and the seas. They are fully automated, seeking out and engaging with adversarial robots across every domain of war. Their human handlers are relegated to the rearguard, overseeing the action at a distance while conflicts are fought and won by machines. 
Far from science fiction, this is the vision of Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley. 
The United States, according to Milley, is in the throes of one of the myriad revolutions in military affairs that have spanned history.

Josep Borrell wrote in an opinion piece in the Journal Du Dimanche that Taiwan “concerns us economically, commercially and technologically”.

“That’s why I call on European navies to patrol the Taiwan Strait to show Europe’s commitment to freedom of navigation in this absolutely crucial area,” he wrote.

The head of Afghanistan’s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, Shahabuddin Delawar, made the announcement following a meeting he had with representatives of the Chinese company, commonly identified as Gochin, which expressed interest in mining the national lithium reserves. 
During the meeting, the Chinese company stressed its interest in developing specific infrastructure, such as a hydroelectric dam and a new tunnel by the Salang gateway, connecting east Afghanistan with its northern gateway to Russia and China.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The U.S. military evacuated American diplomats and their families from Sudan, the country&#x27;s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said early on Sunday as fighting between rival commanders that has killed hundreds of civilians continued. 
The operation, involving six aircraft, was carried out in coordination with the RSF, it said. 
Separately, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters the U.S. military had successfully evacuated U.S. embassy personnel. 
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sudan&#x27;s top general has appeared on TV for the first time since the eruption of a deadly power struggle, promising a transition to civilian rule as the US and others made plans to evacuate diplomats and civilians from the deepening violence. 
Abdel Fattah al-Burhan spoke in a video message released to mark the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday as gunfire continued to rip through the capital Khartoum.

“We are confident that we will overcome this ordeal... allowing us to be entrusted with the safe transition to civilian rule,” he said.

Reuters: Russia announces &#x27;reciprocal&#x27; expulsion of more than 20 German diplomats, RIA reports 
MOSCOW/BERLIN (Reuters) -Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Saturday that Moscow was expelling more than 20 German diplomats, the RIA Novosti news agency said, as Berlin said some Russian diplomats had left Germany. 
A German Foreign Ministry official said Berlin and Moscow had been in contact about their respective representations in the last few weeks with the aim of reducing Russia&#x27;s intelligence presence in Germany. 
&quot;Today&#x27;s departure of Russian embassy staff is related to this,&quot; said the official. The German ministry declined to say how many Russian diplomats had left.

Taiwan’s foreign affairs minister says the island is actively trying to prepare for a military attack by China in the coming months or years, and believes it’s only a matter of time before Beijing will move in on the self-governing island. 
In an interview with Global News in Taipei, Joseph Wu said Taiwan is shoring up international support and focusing on military reforms to be “as ready as possible” for such an attack, which could come at any time as China displays increasingly “provocative and expansionist” behaviour.

“(An attack) might be in 2025, 2027 or 2035,” he said. “There’s some merit to those analyses.

Washington Post: Ukraine planned attacks on Russian forces in Syria, leaked document shows 
Ukraine’s military intelligence agency developed plans to conduct covert attacks on Russian forces in Syria using secret Kurdish help, according to a leaked top-secret U.S. intelligence document. 
The introduction of a new battlefield — thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine — appeared designed to impose costs and casualties on Russia and its Wagner paramilitary group, which is active in Syria, and possibly force Moscow to redeploy resources from Ukraine. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky directed a halt to the planning in December, but the leaked document, based on intelligence gathered as of Jan. 23, lays out in detail how the planning progressed and how such a campaign could proceed if Ukraine revived it.

Business Insider: Russian outlets are exaggerating that Ukrainian troops are stuck in the mud to cheer up Putin&#x27;s soldiers, UK intel says 
 * Russian media is exaggerating the mud&#x27;s impact on Ukrainian forces, UK intel reports. 
 * Their goal is &quot;aimed at raising Russian morale&quot; and &quot;undermining Ukraine&#x27;s supporters,&quot; intel says. 
 * One commander told RIA Novosti that Russian forces &quot;drowned&quot; a German Leopard tank in a swamp. 
Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces has slowed down thanks to thick, wet mud in the region — and Russian media outlets are likely exaggerating the impact of the mud on Kyiv&#x27;s troops in order to raise the morale of the Kremlin&#x27;s soldiers, new UK intelligence suggests. 
According to an update from the UK Ministry of Defense, &quot;soft ground conditions across most of Ukraine&quot; including &quot;severe mud&quot; is likely slowing down operations for both sides in the brutal conflict.

Russian outlets, however, appear to be &quot;exaggerating the overall impact of mud on Ukrainian forces,&quot; UK intel said.

The Pentagon documents, if they are to be believed, indicated that the offensive was planned to start on 30 April. 
In late March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were not yet ready for large-scale operations. And Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal indicated in mid-April that a counteroffensive could be expected in the summer.

An estimated 16,000 US nationals are still in the war-torn country.  
As the violent struggle for power over Sudan reaches the one-week mark, the Biden administration is sticking firmly to its warning for private citizens: don’t expect to be rescued. 
While the administration says it is working towards evacuating American embassy staff still stranded in the country, it makes no promises about other Americans who could get let behind.
&quot;It is not our standard procedure to evacuate American citizens living abroad,&quot; White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday.

TORONTO — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has told NATO officials privately that Canada will never meet the military alliance’s defense-spending target, according to a leaked secret Pentagon assessment obtained by The Washington Post. The document’s anonymous authors say Canada’s “widespread” military deficiencies are harming ties with security partners and allies. 
The document, which has not been previously reported on, says “enduring” defense shortfalls led the Canadian Armed Forces to assess in February that it “could not conduct a major operation while simultaneously maintaining its NATO battle group leadership [in Latvia] and aid to Ukraine” — and that the situation was not “likely” to change without a shift in public opinion.

* Chinese refiners purchased discounted ESPO and Urals crudes from Russia. 
* Saudi Arabia still trails Russia in crude oil supply to China despite a 30% increase in March compared to the previous year. 
China imported the highest-ever volumes of Russian crude oil in March, which kept Russia on top of Chinese crude suppliers’ list ahead of Saudi Arabia, government data from China showed on Friday. 
Russian crude arrivals to China surged to a record high of 2.26 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, up by 50% compared to 1.50 million bpd in March 2022, per data from China’s General Administration of Customs cited by Reuters.

Bloomberg: Russian arms sales to India stall due to fears over US sanctions 
NEW DELHI: Russian deliveries of military supplies to India have ground to a halt as the countries struggle to find a payment mechanism that doesn’t violate US sanctions, according to Indian officials with knowledge of the matter. 
Indian payments for weapons amounting to more than $2 billion have been stuck for about a year, and Russia has stopped supplying credit for a pipeline of about $10 billion worth of spare parts as well as two S-400 missile-defense system batteries that have yet to be delivered, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Reuters: Russian billionaires see wealth rise to over half a trillion dollars, Forbes Russia reports 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s richest people added $152 billion to their wealth over the past year, buoyed by high prices for natural resources and rebounding from the huge loss of fortunes they experienced just after the Ukraine war began, Forbes Russia said. 
Russia has 110 official billionaires in the list, up 22 from last year, according to Forbes&#x27; Russian edition, which said their total wealth increased to $505 billion from $353 billion when the 2022 list was announced. 
The list would have been longer had not five billionaires - DST Global founder Yuri Milner, Revolut founder Nikolay Storonsky, Freedom Finance founder Timur Turlov, and JetBrains co-founders Sergei Dmitriev and Valentin Kipyatkov - renounced their Russian citizenship, Forbes said.

The Group of Seven countries are considering banning almost all exports to Russia, in an extension of the sanctions regime against Moscow for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, a Japanese government source said Friday. 
Japan is set to host the G7 summit in May in Hiroshima, where discussions will take place on measures to expand support to Ukraine and strengthen sanctions on Russia among other key topics. 
The G7 countries have already stopped exports to Russia of a wide range of items, including products that can be used for military purposes and luxury goods. But the latest plan could expand the trade embargo to used cars, tires, cosmetic items and clothing, the source said.

Spooked by the threat that China might invade Taiwan, the US wants to cut its dependence on the island’s world-beating microchips. Officials in Taipei believe the Biden administration is going too far. 
In quiet conversations and back-channel warnings, Taiwanese officials have urged their American counterparts to tone down their rhetoric about the dangers of relying on chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 
The officials are particularly unhappy with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who has called US dependence on Taiwanese chips “untenable” and “unsafe.” They were also uneasy with remarks by a top Republican lawmaker, Michael McCaul, during a recent trip to Taipei. He said Taiwan’s semiconductor industry is a strategic asset that’s “very vulnerable to invasion.”

Hamada ordered the Self-Defense Forces to make necessary preparations as he could potentially &quot;order the destruction of ballistic missiles&quot;, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. 
Preparations included making arrangements to deploy troops to the southern prefecture of Okinawa to &quot;minimise damage should a ballistic missile fall.&quot; 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said preparations for the planned launch of the country&#x27;s first spy satellite should proceed to counter perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, state media reported on Wednesday.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Ukraine Pitches High Returns in Wartime Fire Sale of State Firms 
(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine is looking for investors brave enough to bet that it will beat back Russia’s invasion with a simple pitch: High risk can offer high reward. 
As it fights to defend itself in a war that has killed tens of thousands of its people and devastated the economy, the country is preparing to sell big government-run firms at distressed prices. The aim is to shore up the aid-dependent budget and end a decades-old, post-communist legacy of corruption and mismanagement that has undercut the economy.
If lawmakers agree on changes at a session slated for the start of May, Kyiv could earn more than $400 million in a best-case scenario by selling enterprises ranging from a fertilizer producer to utilities, smelters and an insulin maker. Another $190 million could come from leasing farmland, Rustem Umerov, the head of the State Property Fund, said in an interview.

WNU Editor: There is a reason why no one is buying these assets. The rule of law, specifically contract law, is being completely ignored in Ukraine. I see this attempt to sell these assets (at pennies on the dollar) as one last attempt by the powers that be in Kyiv to try and grab as much money as they can before this house of cards collapses. 
Update: Here is an easy prediction. If this money is transferred to Ukraine, it will disappear like everything else .... US Justice Department Seeks New Authority to Transfer Seized Russian Assets to Ukraine (VOA).</span>

* President Joe Biden’s approval rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey. 
* Just 24% say now is a good time to invest in stocks, also the lowest reading in the survey’s 17-year history. 
Amid persistent inflation, higher interest rates and recession worries, Americans have never been more negative about the economy, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. 
A record 69% of the public holds negative views about the economy both now and in the future, the highest percentage in the survey’s 17-year history. 
The survey of 1,000 people nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-3.1%, found that about two-thirds of Americans say their wages are falling behind inflation, and two-thirds say the nation is headed for recession or already in one. 
The fallout from these negative views is hitting President Joe Biden’s approval rating. 
His overall rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey.

Summit News: GOP Lawmakers: Endless Ukraine Aid “Will Only Prolong The Conflict”

 
&quot;There is no end in sight and no clear strategy to bring this war to a close”

Republican Senators and Representatives have penned a letter to Joe Biden demanding that aid to Ukraine be halted, charging that sending endless amounts of money and military supplies to the country without a clear strategy “will only prolong the conflict.” 
“We write to express concern regarding the U.S. response to Ukraine. Over a year ago, Russia launched an invasion that has upended decades of peace in Europe. We are deeply concerned that the trajectory of U.S. aid to the Ukrainian war effort threatens further escalation and lacks much-needed strategic clarity,” the letter signed by 19 lawmakers reads. 
It comes as the White House approved a fresh Ukraine military aid package Wednesday consisting of $325 million worth of battlefield supplies. 
“There is no end in sight and no clear strategy to bring this war to a close,” the Senators continued in the letter.

Classified US intelligence has revealed how Beijing seeks control of wartime communications, the Financial Times reported. Both Moscow and Beijing have recently made advances in satellite jamming and other tools. 
China is building hacking capabilities that will allow it to &quot;seize control&quot; of enemy satellites, the Financial Times (FT) reported Friday, citing a leaked report from the CIA. 
The revelation comes amid ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade and geopolitics, as concerns rise that China may try to invade Taiwan, a territory it considers its own.

IPOB has been blamed for numerous attacks on police, local government offices and electoral-agency buildings in the southeastern states where the group demands a separate state for Igbo people.

* One of the videos was recorded on Tuesday and shows high-res images 
* The two interceptions are part of a larger trend of Russian-US air conflict 
* Central Command has warned the war in Ukraine could spill into Syria 
US Central Command released videos Wednesday of Russian fighter jets intercepting American jets over Syria on two separate occasions, as tensions continue to escalate between the two nations. 
The videos show high-quality infrared views of a Russian Su-35 intercepting an American craft just a month after General Michael &#x27;Erik&#x27; Kurilla, head of Central Command, said he&#x27;s seen a spike in aggressive Russian activity. 
&#x27;We have seen a significant spike since about March 1 in Syria,&#x27; General Kurilla told the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 16.

MICHAEL WASIURA/NEWSWEEK 
Newsweek: Kyiv Seeks U.S. Technical Support at &#x27;Maximum Proximity to the Battlefield&#x27; 
Over the past 14 months, Western countries have pledged to provide Ukraine with more than $65 billion worth of direct military aid, most of it coming from the United States. Now, with a major Ukrainian counteroffensive looming, prominent officials in Kyiv have begun to call for those Western countries to assume a more forward role in the maintenance of that new arsenal, including the provision of technical personnel on the ground closer to the war zone. 
&quot;I am sure that our partners could hire such specialists, and we would do everything in our capacity to organize for them to come to Ukraine,&quot; Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said in response to a question from Newsweek at a briefing held on April 10 at the Ukraine Media Center in Odesa. &quot;We have been suggesting for quite a long time that our partners assist in providing maintenance at the maximum proximity to the battlefield.&quot; 
&quot;It is very complicated to send a tank all the way to Europe for repairs,&quot; Reznikov explained. &quot;If we could have specialists with access to the necessary documents come here, it would really help.&quot;

WNU Editor: This is what mission creep looks like. First send in the advisers and technical personnel, followed by combat troops. Fortunately, Ukraine&#x27;s Western allies are still lukewarm to deploying their personnel to service their equipment near the front-lines.</span>

The US will begin training Ukrainian forces on how to operate Abrams tanks next month as it seeks to get them on to the battlefield against Russia before the end of the summer. 
Thirty-one US M1A1 Abrams tanks – the size of a Ukrainian tank battalion – will be sent by mid-May to Grafenwoehr, Germany, where roughly 250 Ukrainians will undergo a 10-week training course with US troops, a US official told reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 
The tanks are a long-awaited capability for Ukraine, which has been battling Russia for more than a year.

                              <span>Just meters from a busy train station in the heart of Paris, scientists have uncovered 50 graves in an ancient necropolis which offer a rare glimpse of life in the French capital&#x27;s precursor Lutetia nearly 2000 years ago.
Somehow the buried necropolis was never stumbled upon during multiple road works over the years, as well as the construction of the Port-Royal station on the historic Left Bank in the 1970s.
However, plans for a new exit for the train station prompted an archaeological excavation.
Camille Colonna, an anthropologist at France&#x27;s National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP), told a press conference that there were already &quot;strong suspicions&quot; the site was close to Lutetia&#x27;s southern necropolis.

Diaz-Canel took over the reins in 2018 as Cuba&#x27;s first civilian leader after nearly 60 years of Castro brother hegemony, vowing to &quot;always defend the party&quot; even as he set out in pursuit of cautious economic liberalization.
In 2021, he also took over as first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) -- the country&#x27;s most powerful position, long held by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and then his brother Raul.
Now 62, Diaz-Canel&#x27;s first term was marked by the worst economic crisis in three decades and a widely criticized response to historic anti-government protests, which triggered a tightening…</span>

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India is on its way to becoming the world’s most populous nation, overtaking China with almost 3 million more people in the middle of this year, data released on Wednesday by the United Nations showed.
India’s population is estimated at 1,428.6 million, or 1.4286 billion, against 1.4257 billion for China in the United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) &quot;State of World Population Report&quot; this year.
The United States is a distant third, with an estimated population of 340 million, the data showed in a report that reflects information available until February.
Population experts using previous data from the UN have projected India would surpass China this month, but the global body&#x27;s latest report did not specify a date.

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) -The death toll rose to 29 on Wednesday from a fire at a Beijing hospital that was one of the Chinese capital&#x27;s deadliest in at least two decades, killing 26 patients and wounding dozens.
Social media showed dramatic videos of people using tied bed sheets to climb down the walls to escape smoke and flames after the fire broke out at Changfeng Hospital on Tuesday.
Broken and burned out windows could be seen at the site, where there were many police officers, some in plain clothes, Reuters witnesses said.
All but three of the 29 dead were patients, officials told a media briefing on Wednesday, with the fire having been put out in half an hour.
&quot;There was a lot of smoke, I could see it,&quot; said an elderly local resident who gave only his surname, Li. He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.
Authorities are investigating Beijing&#x27;s deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.
Initial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.
By Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.
&quot;Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening,&quot; one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.
&quot;It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification.&quot;
Early on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.

Washington (AFP) - Elon Musk promised to make Twitter the &quot;most accurate source of information about the world,&quot; but he has repeatedly used his own account to amplify false claims from some of the most notorious disinformers on the internet, according to an AFP analysis of his online activity.
The posts show Musk drawing attention to misinformation about everything from the war in Ukraine to the attack on US Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s husband. Last week, the billionaire boosted a tweet that wrongly suggested doctors misdiagnosed flu cases as Covid-19 deaths.

                              <span>A few dozen Holocaust survivors on Tuesday led a march in southern Poland to commemorate victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau, on the eve of the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
Every year, thousands of people from around the world -- both Jewish and not -- take part in the event held at the site of the former death camp built by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland.
One million European Jews died at the camp in the city of Oswiecim between 1940 and 1945 along with around 80,000 non-Jewish Poles, 25,000 Roma and 20,000 Soviet soldiers.
The camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.
The 35th edition of the March of the Living began with the doleful sound of the shofar -- a traditional Jewish ram&#x27;s horn symbolizing freedom -- at the notorious &quot;Arbeit Macht Frei&quot; (Work Will Set You Free) gate at Auschwitz.
The three-kilometre march was notably attended this year by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch.
On Wednesday, Warsaw will commemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which broke out 80 years ago on April 19, 1943.
The presidents of Israel and Germany will be in attendance and are expected to visit the site of the former Jewish district.
The Germans confined up to 450,000 Jews to an area of just over three square kilometers -- most of whom died of starvation or disease inside or were taken to a death camp to the east of Warsaw.

                              <span>A composite Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton called Trinity sold for 5.5 million Swiss francs ($6.1 million) in a rare auction on Tuesday.
The 3.9-meter (12.8-foot) high skeleton, made up of bones from three different T-rexes estimated at 65 to 67 million years old, was sold at the Koller auction house in Zurich after being shipped from the United States in nine giant crates.
The skeleton fetched a hammer price of 4.8 million Swiss francs, rising to 5.5 million with the buyer&#x27;s premium added on.
Trinity was put up for sale by an anonymous US private individual and was expected to fetch between five and eight million Swiss francs.
It was bought by a private European collector.
As its name suggests, Trinity is made up of bones from three dinosaurs -- excavated between 2008 and 2013 from the Hell C…</span>

Magar, 43, stepped on an improvised explosive device in 2010 while serving in Afghanistan with the Brigade of Gurkhas -- a unit of Nepalis recruited into the British Army.
After years of rehabilitation and training, next month he plans to summit the world&#x27;s highest mountain, an endeavor promoted on his website under the slogan &quot;no legs, no limits&quot;.
If successful, the expedition will make him the first double above-the-knee amputee to see the world from the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak.
&quot;After losing both of my legs, my aim became to see what I could do physically. It opened my mind, and I attempted everything I cou…</span>

But I&#x27;ll tell you straight up: you won&#x27;t silence me.” On the night of October 16, Moreno was shot dead by two men on a motorcycle in Montelibano, a small rural town in northern Colombia’s Cordoba department, one of the most marginalised and violent parts of the country. Moreno worked there as director of online news outlet Voces de Cordoba, in which he regularly exposed corruption, embezzlement and the activities of illegal armed groups.


	Moreno was investigating the installation of a mine on property belonging to a senator; according to him, resources were being extracted from it for public construction projects.

Forbidden Stories, an international consortium of investigative journalists offering to protect the work of colleagues under threat. Moreno told the group he wanted his investigations to be pursued and published worldwide if anything happened to him.


	For six months, a group of some 30 reporters co-ordinated by Forbidden Stories have taken over Moreno’s investigations, including journalists from FRANCE 24 and its sister service Radio France International, examining hundreds of documents and emails that Rafael had not yet made public to uncover a system of wide-scale clientelism and endemic corruption.


	The Rafael Project is sending a clear message to enemies of the free press, in Colombia and elsewhere: killing a journalist won’t kill the story.</span>

The Conservative government in London called on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) -- its historic ally -- to embrace &quot;real leadership&quot; and emulate predecessors who helped forge Northern Ireland&#x27;s 1998 peace accord.
The DUP, which supports Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK, has been boycotting the divided territory&#x27;s government at Stormont over post-Brexit trading arrangements agreed with the European Union.
But ahead of fresh local elections next month, it has been coming under sustained pressure from London, Dublin, Brussels and Washington, peaking in a visit to the island last week by US…</span>

&quot;The strength of the solidarity between the G7 foreign ministers is at a level not seen before,&quot; Japan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a press conference after hosting a meeting of the group in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
