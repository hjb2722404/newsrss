                              <span>Presidential Contender and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has put an end to Disney’s self-governing status in his state which denies major tax breaks for the theme park. 

Disney’s current regime in Florida was to collect its own taxes and fund its own emergency services – a practice in place since 1967.

“There’s a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day,” Mr DeSantis said. 

“Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end.”</span>

“The good parts of Trump without the bad,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia.

Mr Mulvaney said many conservative Republican presidential hopefuls are running as the “same thing,” which he describes as “Donald Trump without the baggage”.</span>

                              <span>China is the one country “preventing” the world from knowing the “true origin” of COVID-19, says former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. 

Beijing has recently urged “certain parties” to stop rehashing the coronavirus lab leak theory, which it claims is smearing China’s reputation.

The United States Department of Energy on Sunday changed its position on the origins of the virus, now saying it most likely came from an accidental laboratory leak.

“I think it is important to the world to know where this came from,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“Think about how the world would be treating Australia if they were as secretive as about this as China was.”</span>

   WNU Editor: This is an ominous development. For the past week there have been numerous reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense that Ukraine was positioning forces to seize Transnistria .... Russia Says Ukraine Preparing To Invade The Breakaway Region Of Transnistria In The Coming Days (February 23, 2023). And according to today&#x27;s Military Summary Channel report (link here), the Russian Ministry of Defense believes Ukraine has already completed its deployment of forces to invade the territory. 
If this Ukraine offensive operation does occur, and my gut is now telling me that it will, this Romanian deployment of air defenses will be seen by Russia as an attempt to provide air cover for Ukraine and its forces from any Russia retaliation or marine helicopter operation. 
I hope that I am wrong. But we may be on the verge of other countries (Moldova and NATO member Romania) becoming actively involved in this war. Or more to the point. Romanian air defense shooting at Russian aircraft and helicopters.</span>

American Military News: US factories ramping up weapons production to meet Ukraine demand  
The U.S. is increasing the production of weapons at some locations that were previously shut down to meet the demands of American military commitments to Ukraine. 
According to some reports, Ukrainian military forces are consuming up to 7,000 artillery rounds per day, pushing the need for new supplies.

WNU Editor: There is some confusion on how much US factories will be ramping up weapons production. 
According to Defense News, the U.S. is hoping to eventually ramp up production to roughly 90,000 shells a month .... With demand high in Ukraine, US Army ramps up artillery production (Defense News) 
According to the US Secretary of the Army, there is an expectation that artillery production will increase according to this timetable .... the U.S. will go from making 14,000 155mm shells each month to 20,000 by later this year and 40,000 by 2025 (Politico). 
I find this US weapons production to be pathetic. 
The US is hoping to produce 40,000 shells by 2025. Russia&#x27;s military is using anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 shells per day. 
As to what is happening on the Russian side for weapons production. The narrative from the Kremlin is that Russia&#x27;s defense factories are working around the clock to meet demand .... Russia&#x27;s Medvedev says defence factories meeting demand, denies missile shortage (Reuters).</span>

The Hill: Putin says Ukraine war poses existential threat to ‘Russian people’ 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a new interview that Russian people may not survive if Western countries succeed in handing a “strategic defeat” to Moscow in its war in Ukraine. 
Putin’s comments to state TV channel Russia 1 followed his decision to suspend Russia’s involvement in the last remaining arms control treaty with the United States. 
 “In today’s conditions, when all the leading NATO countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Putin said, per Reuters.
Putin accused Western countries of seeking to divide Russia in order to take control of the country’s raw materials.  “I do not even know if such an ethnic group as the Russian people will be able to survive in the form in which it exists today,” he said.  Read more ....

As to what is my take.
I disagree with Russian President Putin&#x27;s view that the war in Ukraine poses an existential threat to the Russian people.
But I am a minority of one. Everyone I know in Russia is now on board with the Kremlin&#x27;s message that this conflict is an existential threat and can only end with a Russian victory.</span>

Newsweek: Putin Says Russia Has to Take NATO &#x27;Nuclear Potential&#x27; Into Account 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow must &quot;take into account&quot; the &quot;nuclear potential&quot; of NATO countries like the U.K. and France, as well as the U.S., after freezing a key nuclear arms control agreement. 
Speaking to Russian state media channel Rossiya-1, or Russia-1, Putin said &quot;all the leading NATO countries have declared their main goal to inflict a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer.&quot; 
Putin then asked state media host Pavel Zarubin, according to a readout from state news agency Tass: &quot;Under these conditions, how can we not take into account their nuclear potential?&quot; 
On February 21, Putin announced in an annual address to lawmakers that he was suspending Russia&#x27;s participation in the new START nuclear arms reduction treaty.

Tatiana Stanovaya, Moscow Times: A Fight for Survival: What Victory Looks Like to Putin 
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state of the nation address on Feb. 21 was eagerly anticipated inside Russia, yet it shed no light on the question that is foremost on the minds of the Russian elite and public: how Putin intends to win this war. 
The address had been postponed from last year, prompting speculation that Putin didn’t know what to say amid the lack of victories at the front. It’s more likely, however, that he was just too immersed in his unsuccessful military campaign to find the time. In the end, the address was a mixture of what Putin considered it necessary to say (the geopolitical part about the “crazy” W…</span>

It sounds like something out of science fiction: A country suffering from heat, flooding or crop failures decides on its own to send out a fleet of aircraft to spray a fine, sun-blocking mist into the earth’s atmosphere, reducing temperatures and providing relief to parched populations. 
Other countries view it as a threat to their own citizens and ready a military response.   But members of the U.S. intelligence community and other national security officials were worried enough last year to plot how to avert a war triggered by this kind of climate engineering.
In a role-playing exercise, they practiced managing the tensions that would be unleashed, according to people familiar with the exercise, a sign that they see it as a credible threat in need of a strategy.

Update: Climate engineering is the greatest, most immediate threat to the human race – Dane Wigington of Geoengineering Watch (BizNews) 
WNU Editor: I understand the science and how climate engineering can lower sunlight and cool down temperatures. Major volcanic eruptions in the past where mega-tons of particulate matter were blasted into the atmosphere have always resulted in global temperature dropping for 2 to 3 years. But lowering the sunlight will also have an immediate impact on food production.
Cooler temperatures .... but shortages in food resulting in hunger and maybe famine. This climate solution has a lot of drawbacks.</span>

Boris Pistorius’ honeymoon might soon be over as he faces fights over reforms and budget for the military. 
BERLIN — Germany’s new Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has swiftly conquered the hearts and minds of the security community — and enjoys soaring polling among German citizens. Yet massive challenges, some of them deeply ingrained in his ministry’s structures, risk derailing him from his popularity path. 
Barely four weeks into his tenure, Pistorius gained a major win in almost instantly securing long-discussed German tanks for Ukraine. But he’s also garnered credibility by speaking plainly about the state of his country’s armed forces and making bold demands of his boss — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 
At the Munich Security Conference this past weekend, Pistorius earned applause by saying, “Ukraine must win this war” — a clear formulation that Scholz has yet to utter. And while Scholz reiterated his point at the conference that Germany must “permanently” spend 2 percent of its economic output on defense, Pistorius pushed boldly ahead, stating “it must be clear to everyone” that “barely 2 percent” is not enough.

Times Of Israel: Netanyahu said to huddle repeatedly with military brass over possible attack on Iran 
TV report says PM held 5 meetings with defense minister, IDF chief, Mossad head, Military Intelligence chief; he tells conference world must back up promise to thwart nuclear drive 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly held a series of secret high-level meetings with top military officials aimed at upping preparations for a possible confrontation with Iran. 
According to a Channel 12 report on Tuesday, the premier huddled five times in recent weeks with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, Mossad head David Barnea, Military Intelligence chief Aharon Haliva and other military brass to discuss readying for a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear program. 
The report, which was not attributed to any source, included few other details about the discussions, and may itself be designed to telegraph the seriousness of Israeli threats to resort to military action in order to shut down Iran’s suspected drive toward a nuclear weapon, which Netanyahu has described as an existential threat.

Israel’s new government has stepped up US-backed talks with Saudi Arabia on developing closer military and intelligence ties in light of growing concerns about Iran, according to several people familiar with the discussions. 
Officials from the two countries held exploratory meetings ahead of the recent US-Gulf Cooperation Council Working Group gathering on defense and security in Riyadh, six people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. 
Further engagement is expected to take place in Prague to coincide with the Munich Security Conference this weekend, three of the people said.  “We think that other regions integrating and beginning to sit at the same table with Israel is in the interest of stability and security in the region,” US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Dana Stroul, said in Riyadh on Monday.

Independent Pentagon panel also recommends creating national database tracking firearm purchased on Defense Department property 
An external evaluation of suicide in the U.S. military has produced a report calling for greater gun control restrictions for troops. 
The Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) was formed by the Department of Defense in March 2020 to help combat the rising rate of suicides among servicemembers. 
In the committee&#x27;s report, released Friday, the independent body recommends, &quot;On DoD property, raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition to 25 years.&quot;

WNU Editor: Firearms are used in 66% of suicides among active duty troops, 72% among reservists and 78% in the National Guard. 
Also from the report .... The suicide rate for active-duty service members in 2021, the most recent data available, was 24.3 per 100,000 people, which was down from 28.7 in 2020, the highest active-duty suicide rate since the Defense Department started tracking the data in 2011.

                              <span>Reuters: China says U.S. &#x27;endangered&#x27; peace with Taiwan Strait fly-through 
BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -China accused the United States of &quot;endangering&quot; peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait after a U.S. military plane flew through the sensitive waterway on Monday, with the U.S. Navy responding that it had been in international airspace.
Beijing has been incensed by U.S. military missions through the narrow strait, most frequently of warships but occasionally of aircraft, saying China &quot;has sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction&quot; over the waterway. 
Taiwan and the United States dispute that saying it is an international waterway. 
The Eastern Theatre Command of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army said its forces closely monitored the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance plane, which is also used for anti-submarine missions, as it flew through the strait which separates China from Taiwan.

France 24: North Korea&#x27;s Kim opens farming summit amid reports of food shortages 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has opened a key party meeting to discuss agricultural development, state media said Monday, following a report of &quot;grave&quot; food shortages in the isolated country. 
Normally such meetings are convened only once or twice a year, but the plenary comes just two months after a previous one, which also focused on agricultural issues. 
The unusual frequency of the meetings focused on agriculture has fuelled speculation that there may be serious food shortages in North Korea now.

This announcement coincided with joint military exercises hosted by the Pentagon and involving US and South Korean forces.

   Warzone/The Drive: Claims Swirl Around Supposed Strike On Russian A-50 Radar Jet In Belarus  
One of Russia’s most prized military aircraft, an A-50 Mainstay, is claimed to have been struck at its forward base in Belarus. 
There has been quite the buzz this Sunday on social media about a supposed attack on a Russian A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft that is forward deployed to Machulishchy Air Base south of Minsk, in Belarus. 
We cannot confirm that this attack actually happened or the nature of the damage, if any, to the A-50 — the type has been a staple at the base throughout the war. But if it did occur, it would be a significant loss for the Russian Air Force and, depending on how it was carried out, it could be a sign of a developing front and what&#x27;s to come in the now year-old war.

WNU Editor: There are only 9 (now 8) A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft in the Russian fleet. On social media there are reports that another Belarus air base was attacked, and that there have been clashes on the Belarus - Ukraine border where one Belarusian soldier was killed.

   EurAsian Times: ‘No Boots On Ground‘: Majority Of US Voters ‘Chicken Out’ From Sending Soldiers To Taiwan To Battle China 
In an interesting reflection of American society, a recent survey found a massive majority of likely voters backing intervention in support of Taiwan – but without boots on the ground. 
They agree that the US should militarily intervene, but with only jets and warships and not with soldiers, which entails higher casualties. 
The findings in the survey by Rasmussen Reports put the figure at 79% who would support the United States imposing economic sanctions on China for invading Taiwan, including 60% who would ‘Strongly Support’ sanctions. Only 12% would oppose sanctions if China invaded Taiwan.

WNU Editor: The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 79% of Likely U.S. Voters would support the United States imposing economic sanctions on China for invading Taiwan, including 60% who would Strongly Support sanctions. Only 12% would oppose sanctions if China invaded Taiwan.
As to sending in troops, the numbers are close. 46% say they would oppose the U.S. sending ground troops to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion by China, compared to 42% who say they would support it.

                              <span>Axios: CIA director: China has doubts whether it could accomplish invasion of Taiwan 
Chinese President Xi Jinping and his military leaders likely have some doubts as to whether China could accomplish a successful invasion of Taiwan after witnessing the trajectory of Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, CIA Director Bill Burns told CBS&#x27; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; Sunday. 
Driving the news: While U.S. intelligence indicates that Xi has instructed his country&#x27;s army to be ready for a potential invasion by 2027, Burns stressed that a decision has not yet been made. 
* &quot;I think we need to take very seriously Xi&#x27;s ambitions with regard to ultimately controlling Taiwan. That doesn&#x27;t, however, in our view, mean that a military conflict is inevitable,&quot; he added.

WNU Editor: I see no indications that Chinese President Xi or from his military leaders that they have some doubts as to whether China could accomplish a successful invasion of Taiwan after witnessing how Russia is conducting its war in Ukraine. On the opposite. I have seen China doubling down on its rhetoric and military exercises on Taiwan since the start of the year.

gCaptain/Bloomberg: Russia Sold Oil Far Above Price Cap, Researchers Say 
(Bloomberg) –Russian companies got far more money from selling the country’s oil than previously thought in the weeks that followed the imposition of a price cap on the nation’s exports, a group of academics said. 
The research weakens the idea that the price limits are crushing Moscow’s revenue to fund the war in Ukraine.
Russia’s crude fetched an average of about $74 a barrel in the four weeks that followed the cap, according to calculations by experts including from the Institute of International Finance, Columbia University and University of California. 
That’s about a quarter above the threshold — $60 a barrel — that the Group of Seven set from Dec. 5.  Their work was based on an analysis of customs’ invoice-level data for the four weeks after the cap was set for crude sales to buyers all over the world, and from all ports and pipelines.

A poll conducted by Germany&#x27;s DPA news agency suggests many Germans disapprove of arming Ukraine in its war against Russia. 
The majority of German people see their country&#x27;s arms deliveries to Ukraine as participation in the war against Russia, a recent poll suggests. 
The poll was conducted on behalf of Germany&#x27;s DPA news agency by the opinion research institute YouGov. It surveyed 2,072 Germans nationwide from February 21 until February 23, ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Fifty-one percent of the respondents thought arming Ukraine meant being part of the war, an argument that Russia has been pushing. Meanwhile, 37% disagreed with the statement. 
Germany has approved some €2.6 billion ($2.75 billion) worth of weapons and armaments since the start of the war.

Cities in ruins, millions of refugees, continued military support, and ongoing sanctions: Russia&#x27;s war on Ukraine has sent shockwaves across the globe. Here are 10 graphics calculating the effects of Russia&#x27;s invasion. 
February 24 marks one year since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. Despite counter-advances by the Ukrainian army, substantial parts of eastern Ukraine remain occupied by Russian troops. Most recently, on January 19, 2023, Ukrainian forces withdrew from the embattled city of Soledar in the Donbas region, which has since been under Russian control again.

                              <span>Russia’s lack of success in their invasion of Ukraine is giving China “some pause for thought” about their own invasion plans for Taiwan following the CIA&#x27;s latest reports, says former Liberal MP Dave Sharma.

Mr Sharma&#x27;s comments come after the CIA revealed Beijing may be reconsidering its plans to invade Taiwan in the predicted year of 2027. 

“China is seeing up hand and close the failures of the Russian military operation in Ukraine,” he told Sky News Australia.

“Which on paper is a much easier military operation than an … invasion of Taiwan.

“It’s doubtless giving them some pause for thought about their own military preparedness and readiness.”</span>

                              <span>Former Liberal MP Dave Sharma has taken aim at China&#x27;s &quot;lack of transparency&quot; following the release of a US intelligence report which suggests an accidental lab leak may have been responsible for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This speaks to a lack of transparency from China throughout this,” Mr Sharma told Sky News Australia.

“But even most recently when China was going through a very dramatic wave none of that detail was being disclosed or shared with the World Health Organisation.

“And again, there was a risk during that outbreak that a new variant would emerge which would overwhelm the rest of the world again.

“This is not how a responsible nation behaves.”</span>

Former President Donald Trump maintains a double-digit lead in a hypothetical 2024 Republican primary field, a recent McLaughlin &amp; Associates survey revealed. 
The survey asked Republican primary voters, “Thinking ahead to the 2024 Republican primary election for President, if that election were held today among the following candidates, for whom would you vote?” 
Several potential candidates were listed, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Vice President Mike Pence, and more.

   Zero Hedge: Zelensky Berates, Threatens Unsupportive Americans 
This is an example of how not to win over the American people: shame and berate them while claiming Washington&#x27;s &#x27;global leadership&#x27; is in peril. 
&quot;If they do not change their opinion…they will lose NATO, they will lose the clout of the United States, they will lose the leadership position they are enjoying in the world,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference late last week, in reference to the US public... As if the average American struggling to get by amid soaring food and cost-of-living prices stays awake at night worrying about US global &quot;clout&quot;:

Reuters: French Defence Group Thales to Recruit 12,000 Staff as Orders Boom 
PARIS (Reuters) - French defence and technology group Thales plans to hire 12,000 new staff this year as there is strong demand across its product range, CEO Patrice Caine said in an interview with French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche. 
He said that over the past eight years Thales, which has total staff of 80,000 of which 40,000 in France, had recruited 5,000 to 8,000 people per year and that last year already it had hired 11,500 new staff. 
Caine said that all the firm&#x27;s activities - defence and security, aeronautics and space, identity and digital security, were growing strongly. 
&quot;The company is a reflection of its markets, which are all seeing dynamic growth, with needs growing in all our fields of activity,&quot; he said. 
 Caine, who recently met with Ukraine&#x27;s defence minister, said that France would deliver its Ground Master 200 radar air defence system to Ukraine in May.

SCMP: China aims to launch nearly 13,000 satellites to ‘suppress’ Elon Musk’s Starlink, researchers say 
* The satellite constellation is likely to be launched quickly to prevent SpaceX from hogging &#x27;low-orbit resources&#x27;, according to PLA space scientists 
* The project, code-named &#x27;GW&#x27;, would provide internet services and could be used to spy on rival networks and carry out anti-Starlink missions, paper says 
Researchers say China plans to build a huge satellite network in near-Earth orbit to provide internet services to users around the world - and to stifle Elon Musk&#x27;s Starlink. 
The project has the code name &quot;GW&quot;, according to a team led by associate professor Xu Can with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s (PLA) Space Engineering University in Beijing. But what these letters stand for is unclear. 
The GW constellation will include 12,992 satellites owned by the newly established China Satellite Network Group Co, Xu and his colleagues said in a paper about anti-Starlink measures published in the Chinese journal Command Control and Simulation on February 15.

WNU Editor: For the past few years China has made public their concerns that Starlink could be a strategic and military threat. It now looks like they are developing plans to counter it. 
Bottom line. 
Earth&#x27;s low orbit is about to get crowded with a lot of satellites in the next few years.

Republican proposal would trim defense workforce through attrition 
The federal workers union came out swinging Thursday against a Republican proposal to reduce the size of the Pentagon’s civilian workforce. 
The American Federation of Government Employees, in a letter to congressional and administration leaders, criticized a plan to purportedly save $25 billion in each of the next five years by not filling a portion of the civilian positions at the Defense Department that are vacated each year. 
“The problem with this approach is that actual waste is not being cut while cutting the civilian workforce will hollow out the Department’s capabilities, repeating mistakes from the past,” wrote Julie N. Tippens, director of the union’s legislative department, in the letter to defense appropriators and authorizers, congressional leadership, top officials at the Pentagon and the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

The Pentagon said it is evaluating the scope and impact of the potential data exposure, as well as looking to “understand the root cause of the exposure and why [the] problem was not detected sooner.” The agency also confirmed that it was able to secure the server on Monday and will be notifying any staff members affected by the leak.
“DoD takes this matter very seriously and will incorporate all lessons learned from this event to strengthen its cybersecurity posture,” U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jessica McNulty, a Department of Defense spokesperson, told The Hill.

EurAsian Times: US Nuclear Submarine, USS Springfield, Makes Port Call In South Korea Amid Flaring Tensions With North 
On Saturday, the US 7th Fleet announced the arrival of its fast-attack submarine USS Springfield at the naval base in the South Korean port city of Busan in an apparent show of force aimed at the North. 
“The Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Springfield (SSN 761) pulled into port in Busan, February 23,” the fleet said on social media. 
Los Angeles-class submarines make routine port calls in South Korea as part of the US navy’s forward-deployed submarine force in the Indo-Pacific. 
The length of the submarine’s stay was not revealed.  USS Springfield is billed as one of the most capable ships in the entire US navy. Its home port is in Guam, in the western Pacific.

As officials in Ukraine anxiously watch evolving diplomatic overtures between Moscow and Beijing, China’s top leader will host the president of Belarus — a staunch Kremlin ally — with the pomp of a state visit next week. 
On Saturday, China announced the visit, to take place over three days starting on Tuesday, for President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, who a year ago allowed Russian forces to use his country as a staging ground for their full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The presence in Beijing of such a close partner of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is likely to increase international attention, and pressure, over China’s straddling position on the war.

The finance ministers of the Group of 20 countries wrapped up a two-day meeting Saturday in India without issuing a joint statement after China and Russia objected to references that other members wanted to make on Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine. 
With no consensus, India, which holds the G-20 presidency this year, said in what is called a “chair’s summary” that &quot;most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy.&quot; 
Stating that it is essential to uphold international law, the summary said that “the use of or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue are vital. Today’s era must not be of war.”

Boeing  Warzone/The Drive: Boeing To End F/A-18 Super Hornet Production In Two Years  
Boeing says a potential foreign contract could prolong Super Hornet production for two years, but the writing is on the wall for the line.
 Boeing says that it expects to end production of new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets in 2025. It has left open the possibility that it could still be building Super Hornets two years after that for an unspecified &quot;international customer,&quot; which is very likely a reference to a potential Indian Navy contract. No matter what, by all indications, the company is expecting to stop making new F/A-18E/F before the end of the decade. 
The company announced its timeline for shuttering the F/A-18E/F production line, which is located within its facility in St. Louis, in a press release today. As it stands now, the only orders for Super Hornets that Boeing has left to fulfill are for the U.S. Navy. These jets, as well as examples of the EA-18G Growler electronic warfare derivative, are only currently in service with the Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.

                              <span>Matt Margolis: Is Joe Biden Getting Us Into a Nuclear World War III? 
On March 11, 2022, Joe Biden said that sending tanks to Ukraine would start World War III. “The idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews — just understand, don’t kid yourself, no matter what y’all say, that’s called World War III.” 
Curiously, at the end of January, in the midst of the classified documents scandal, Joe Biden flip-flopped and decided to send 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks, eight M88 recovery vehicles, and more than 500 armored vehicles to Ukraine. 
So, World War III it is, I guess. Thanks, Joe. 
At the time of the announcement, Biden claimed that it was Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who recommended the move. However, just a week prior, both Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley expressed opposition to sending tanks to Ukraine because it would take too long to train the Ukraine military how to use them, and they had plenty of tanks already at their disposal, including captured Russian tanks. So, naturally, I have my doubts.

All of their 200 employees were accounted for, with other buildings next to the site being evacuated as a precaution.

   CBS News: CIA confirms possibility of Chinese lethal aid to Russia 
In an exclusive interview with CBS News, CIA Director Bill Burns confirmed the possibility that China may send lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine. 
&quot;We&#x27;re confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment,&quot; Burns told &quot;Face the Nation&quot; moderator Margaret Brennan on Friday. 
The revelation that China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping is mulling this escalation is a dramatic change from past Biden administration assessments. Earlier this month, Burns told students at Georgetown University that Xi had been &quot;very reluctant to provide the kind of lethal weapons to Russia to use in Ukraine that the Russians are very much interested in.&quot; 
Burns emphasized that China has not yet made the decision to transfer lethal aid to Russia, and shed light on the logic behind the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to make this intelligence public.

WNU Editor: CIA Director William Burns says China has not yet made the decision to transfer lethal aid to Russia. But even though the above twitter video is a short clip, listening to him my gut tells me that the CIA Director already knows Beijing will soon start shipping lethal weaponry and ammunition to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine. 
It is only a question of when the logistics are in place to make it happen, and if China&#x27;s roadmap to end the Russia - Ukraine war is ignored. Since the US and its European allies have already rejected China&#x27;s &quot;peace plan&quot; to end the war (link here), it looks like that decision may come sooner rather than later.</span>

VOA: US Army Officials Confident in Competition with China  
WASHINGTON — Not all branches of the U.S. military are equally worried about keeping pace with China’s military expansion. 
While U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro warned earlier this week that he needed more ships to meet the threat posed by China’s rapidly expanding naval forces, top Army officials believe U.S. ground forces still hold a critical edge over their Chinese counterparts. 
“The human dimension of the United States Army, I think, is a comparative advantage,” U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth cautioned during a breakfast in Washington on Thursday with the Defense Writers Group. “The quality of how our soldiers are trained, the kind of leaders that they have, the kind of combat experience that the force has.” 
Army Chief of Staff General James McConville added that the quality of leadership, especially that rising from the ranks of the Army’s enlisted soldiers, cannot be understated.

Washington Post: China considers sending Russia artillery shells, U.S. officials say 
China is considering sending Russia lethal military aid in the form of artillery shells as President Vladimir Putin’s army rapidly depletes its supply of ammunition a year into his invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials said, a prospect that has alarmed those in the Biden administration who believe Beijing has the ability to transform the war’s trajectory. 
There is no evidence that any weapons transfers have occurred, these officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. government’s assessment. But if China does move ahead, it would mark the first time Beijing has provide…</span>

Kadena Air Base, Japan CNN  — The US Navy reconnaissance jet flies at 21,500 feet over the South China Sea, 30 miles from the contested Paracel Islands, a group of about 130 small atolls, the biggest of which are home to Chinese military bases. 
A voice, saying it’s coming from a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) airport, crackles over the radio of the US Navy P-8 Poseidon as a CNN crew, given rare access aboard the US flight, listens in. 
“American aircraft. Chinese airspace is 12 nautical miles. Not approaching any more or you bear all responsibility,” it says. 
In a few minutes, a Chinese fighter jet armed with air-to-air missiles intercepts the US plane, nestling in just 500 feet off its port side. 
The Chinese fighter jet was so close, the CNN crew could see the pilots turning their heads to look at them – and could make out the red star on the tail fins and the missiles it was armed with.

Best Film went to &quot;The Night of the 12th&quot;, a thriller based on the true story of a young woman&#x27;s murder. 
There was a spot of Hollywood glitz thanks to a surprise cameo by Brad Pitt, presenting David Fincher (who directed him in &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot;) with a lifetime achievement award. 
But there was a lot of focus on the lack of female nominees, with no women up for best director -- indeed, none have won the award since 2000 (Tonie Marshall for &quot;Venus Beauty Institute&quot;).
The only woman filmmaker whose movie was in the running for best film was Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, sister of France&#x27;s former first lady and singer Carla…</span>

It was the first commemoration of the uprising since Marcos Jr took office in June 2022. He has praised his father&#x27;s 20-year regime, which critics describe as a dark period of human rights abuses and corruption that left the country impoverished.
As leftist rock music blared over a loudspeaker, hundreds of protesters, including survivors of the elder Marcos&#x27;s martial law crackdown that led to the killing, torture and imprisonment of thousands of political foes and critics, marched on the &quot;People Power&quot; monument in Manila in memory of the brutal era.

                              <span>US First Lady Jill Biden arrived in Kenya on Friday, kicking off a visit aimed at focusing attention on the worst drought to hit the Horn of Africa in decades.
Five straight seasons of poor rainfall have killed millions of livestock, destroyed crops and left some 22 million people at risk of hunger in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, with a sixth season also forecast to fail.
Biden travelled to Kenya from Namibia, part of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent, which has become a renewed diplomatic battleground following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine last year.
The first senior White House official to travel to the region since her husband President Joe Biden came to power, the 71-year-old community college professor&#x27;s visit will also focus on the empowerment of women and youth.

The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Biden said his country was &quot;all in&quot; on the hotly courted continent.
During her visit to Namibia, Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies.
&quot;We&#x27;re committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners,&quot; Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek on Thursday.
This is Biden&#x27;s first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

But, as Nigerians head to the polls for Saturday&#x27;s presidential election, although the aroma of spices and the cacophony of hawkers selling their wares still filled the air, there is barely a customer in sight.
&quot;There&#x27;s no business at the market. We&#x27;ve all just been sitting here since the morning,&quot; said market trader Ishola as she sat outside her stall selling beads and jewelry. &quot;There&#x27;s no people. Do you see anybody around? Nobody.&quot;

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Friday to do everything to defeat Russia this year, as the first Leopard tanks arrived in Ukraine on the anniversary of the start of Europe&#x27;s largest conflict since World War II.
Street protests against the Russian invasion were held in many European capitals to mark the anniversary, and fresh Western sanctions targeted Russia&#x27;s banks, military industry and semiconductor access.
Meanwhile, the Group of Seven industrialised nations threatened embargo busters with &quot;severe costs&quot;.
Poland sent the German-made Leopard tanks to help Ukraine repel Russian troops and deliver a &quot;clear and measurable signal of further support&quot;, said Pr…</span>

                              <span>When President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, February 20 and expressed his solidarity with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, The Lincoln Project’s Rick Wilson — a Never Trump conservative and former GOP strategist — praised Biden’s &quot;alpha move&quot; and slammed MAGA Republicans for not being on &quot;the right side of history.&quot; Wilson is a scathing critic of the MAGA movement, and the affinity that so many MAGA Republicans have for Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of the reasons why he holds Trumpism in such low regard.
It was a year ago, on February 24, 2022, that Russian forces acting on orders from Putin launched a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. That war has brought the worst fighting in Europe since World War 2, yet Putin&#x27;s admirers in the MAGA movement haven…</span>

                              <span>Taiwan&#x27;s military said it alerted aviation authorities after spotting a balloon floating in its airspace Friday, one week after the self-ruled island found remnants of what was believed to be a crashed Chinese meteorological instrument.
According to its initial analysis, the air force said the object in &quot;northern airspace&quot; on Friday afternoon was for meteorological and scientific research purposes.
&quot;As it could affect aviation safety, we have notified the aviation control units to remind air planes to beware,&quot; the air force statement said.
&quot;We will continue to monitor until the target disappears.&quot;
The statement did not say where the balloon came from or provide a more detailed location.
The sighting comes after an order by President Joe Biden to shoot down what the United States has since called a &quot;sophisticated high-altitude spying vehicle&quot; that sparked the latest row between Washington and Beijing.
US officials said it was part of a fleet allegedly floating around the globe, while China has said the balloon was an errant weather observation aircraft with no military purpose. Both sides have since accused each other of espionage.
Taiwan, a self-governed democracy claimed by China, said last week that it had found the remains of a suspected Chinese meteorological balloon and would increase patrols at military facilities.
Taiwan&#x27;s defence ministry revealed on February 14 that Chinese balloons have previously flown over the island, without providing details on the number or frequency.
At that time, the ministry said it would shoot down any targets that pose a &quot;high level of threat&quot;, but added that it had not encountered any such threats.
Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure in recent years on Taiwan, which China has vowed to seize one day, by force if necessary.</span>

                              <span>Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#x27;s presidential term, provisional data showed Friday.
Surveillance satellites had detected 209 square kilometers (80.6 square miles) of forest destroyed,, according to the INPE space research institute&#x27;s DETER monitoring system.
This is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.
The INPE report included data only up to February 17, but was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.
Last month, Amazon deforestation was down 61 percent from a year earlier, according to the same source.
But experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a &quot;reversal&quot; of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.
The February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.
Over Bolsonaro&#x27;s presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade.
Bolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.
Having previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula took office on January 1 this year with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro.
He has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.
In order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors.

                              <span>Villagers in Cramant in France&#x27;s Champagne are being treated to a rare sight: little pigs grubbing around the vines that produce the region&#x27;s famed bubbly, an alternative to chemical or mechanical means of fighting weeds and pests.
Originally from New Zealand, the &quot;kunekune&quot; pigs -- a Maori word meaning &quot;round and fat&quot; -- snuffle through the earth supporting neatly planted rows of grapevines.
Their &quot;thorough&quot; and &quot;precise&quot; work can fight weeds as well as mildew and other fungi and aerate the soil, says wine industry consultant Olivier Zebic.
First tested last year in the Bordeaux wine-growing region, the pigs may be a better choice than the other eco-friendly solution, sheep -- who &quot;just trim&quot; unwanted plants, Zebic adds.
By contrast, the kunekune turn over &quot;every clod of grass and even ea…</span>

Here, they call it &quot;yage&quot; and consume it for health and wisdom.
&quot;God once lived here on this planet&quot;, recounts Isidro Lucitante, the patriarch and shaman of nine Indigenous Cofan Avie families spread over 55,000 hectares of river and jungle along the border with Colombia.
This god &quot;pulled out one of his hairs and planted it on the Earth. Thus was born the yage, source of knowledge and wisdom,&quot; the 63-year-old, his face painted in striking animal motifs, told AFP.
Extracted from the &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; vine that has grown in the Amazon for thousands of years, ayahuasca has also gained a reputation in the outside world.

                              <span>Minutes before Afghan filmmaker Roya Sadat entered her first Seattle Opera production meeting for an adaptation of the novel &quot;A Thousand Splendid Suns,&quot; she learned that her hometown of Herat had fallen to the Taliban.
The celebrated director&#x27;s first foray into opera started out as a look back at a painful chapter in her country&#x27;s history through Khaled Hosseini&#x27;s story of two women whose lives are marked by the Taliban&#x27;s brutal and repressive rule in the 1990s.
But the surge back to power of the hardline Islamists in August 2021 brought the story roaring back to the present for Afghan women.
And it added new weight to the production, as the Taliban again placed an ever-tightening vice on women&#x27;s liberties, despite vowing a departure from their infamous first reign.

Critics said the award showed Macron really was &quot;the president of the rich&quot; as he is regularly labelled by members of the opposition.
Macron&#x27;s office on Friday confirmed a press report from a day earlier, saying Bezos had been given the Legion d&#x27;Honneur (Legion of Honour), the French republic&#x27;s highest award, in a small ceremony.
The event&#x27;s took place on February 16, the same day hundreds of thousands of people joined strikes and protests against Macron&#x27;s plan to reform the French pension system.

Three candidates, two women and a Muslim man, are vying for the position following the shock resignation of Sturgeon, the long-serving Scottish National Party (SNP) chief.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, a 32-year-old rising star in the SNP, caused controversy this week after revealing that she would have voted against same-sex marriage, had she been a member of the Scottish Parliament when the reform passed in 2014.
While she defended the stance as a matter of personal conscience, it puts Forbes strongly out of line with the SNP&#x27;s centre-left base, and four high-profile supporters immediately wit…</span>

The first exhibition in Saudi Arabia for the Pop Art giant is a tribute to the late artist&#x27;s obsession with celebrity, and his seeming ability to predict the rise of contemporary influencer culture.
At the same time, organisers have tried to draw a connection between the world Warhol embodied –- New York City half a century ago -– and Saudi Arabia today.

While many Ukrainians had not believed there would be a &quot;barbaric war&quot; by Russia, the capital had been preparing for a possible attack, he said.
&quot;Volunteers who joined the territorial defence and our military helped to protect and hold the capital.&quot;
Russian troops advanced into the suburbs of Kiev after the war began on February 24, but did not get far.
&quot;Kiev is the heart of Ukraine, Kiev was and remains a target of Russia, of the Russians and of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,&quot; Klitschko told dpa in an interview on Wednesday.
At the same time, he said he did not believe Russia could succeed in a new attack on the capital. &quot;I don&#x27;t think Russia will win.&quot;</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - The United States has transferred two brothers from the Guantanamo Bay U.S. detention facility in Cuba to Pakistan, bringing the total number of people held at Guantanamo down to 32, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
The Guantanamo camp was established by Republican President George W. Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.
It came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. &quot;war on terror&quot; because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.
There were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.
On Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.
Both were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon&#x27;s website.
&quot;The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,&quot; the Pentagon said in a statement.
A total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.

The body parts of the woman had been discovered in the Buttes-Chaumont park in the north of the French capital earlier this month.
Prosecutors told AFP that an individual had been detained in the case but warned that no further information would be made public for now.
The discovery shocked residents of the capital where the park is hugely popular with joggers and families due to its unusually hilly landscaping.
The woman, 46, had been reported missing by her husband on February 6. The pair lived in the Seine-Saint-Denis department northeast of Paris, prosecutors said.
The Le Parisien daily, which first reported his detention, said that the couple had three children and the husband had only reported her disappearance a week after she vanished.
Police investigating the disappearance had not turned up any leads until now.
Park workers found the lower torso of a woman in a plastic bag hidden under leaves and further remains, including the head, were found during a thorough search of the park by police a day later.
French channel BFMTV had reported last week that the husband had come under suspicion in the investigation after giving contradictory evidence.
Prosecutors then launched another investigation into how this information had been leaked to the channel.
Built during the major relandscaping of the French capital under Napoleon III in the 19th century, the park most recently starred as the setting for a romantic picnic in the third series of &quot;Emily in Paris&quot;.
It has also been a popular setting for classic French films ranging from Eric Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&#x27;s Wife&quot; to Gaspar Noe&#x27;s more recent film &quot;Love.&quot;

                              <span>First Lady Jill Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies, as she visited Namibia on Thursday.
Biden arrived in the southern African country on Wednesday in the first stop of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent.
&quot;We&#x27;re committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners,&quot; Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek.
In the capital the 71-year-old community college professor met with President Hage Geingob and First Lady Monica Geingos. 
Africa has become a renewed diplomatic battleground, with countries aggressively courted by Russia, China and the West. 
Biden&#x27;s trip is to focus on hunger in the Horn of Africa and the empowerment of women and youth.
On Friday, she will head to Kenya where she is to draw attention to the Horn of Africa&#x27;s worst drought in decades, which has left more than 20 million people with acute food shortages.
The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Joe Biden said his country was &quot;all in&quot; on the hotly courted continent. 
This is Biden&#x27;s first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

The legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year&#x27;s ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.
The 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.
A hyper-realistic replica of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;corpse,&quot; wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.
Spanish artist Eugenio Merino&#x27;s sensational sculpture, entitled &quot;Aquí murió Picasso&quot; (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso&#x27;s native city of Málaga.
Long queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.
Many visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.
Alongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.
There is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is &quot;The Mediterranean: A Round Sea.&quot;
A total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.</span>

                              <span>The European Commission on Thursday banned TikTok on official devices used by staff amid concerns over data protection as the EU seeks to bolster its cybersecurity.
TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is Chinese, has faced increasing Western scrutiny in recent months over fears about how much access Beijing has to user data.
The new ban also means European Commission staff cannot use the video-sharing app on personal devices including phones that have official EU communication apps installed.
Employees must remove the app as soon as possible and should do so by March 15.
EU spokeswoman Sonya Gospodinova said the corporate management board of the European Commission, the EU&#x27;s executive arm, had made the decision for security reasons.

                              <span>A six-decade archive charting pop icon David Bowie&#x27;s career will open in London in 2025, providing a &quot;new source book for the Bowies of tomorrow&quot;, a museum director said Wednesday.
Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Tristram Hunt said the &quot;incredible&quot; collection had more than 80,000 items of Bowie memorabilia.
They range from hand-written lyrics and letters to sheet music, original costumes, photography and album artwork.
A number of instruments owned by Bowie as well as music videos, set designs and awards are also due to go on display.
Bowie, originally from south London, died in 2016 at the age of 69.
The collection will be housed at the Bowie Centre for the Study of Performing Arts, a new outpost of London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum.
The museum was delighted to be become &quot;custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public&quot;, said Hunt.
&quot;Bowie&#x27;s radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style -– from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monae to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons,&quot; he added.
Bowie enjoyed an extraordinary career generating around 140 million record sales and taking in styles from glam rock to jazz, as well as stage personas such as Ziggy Stardust.
The new centre will be located at the V&amp;A East Storehouse venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.
The museum said this had been made possible through a £10 million (around $12 million) joint donation by the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.
Bowie&#x27;s estate sold the publishing rights to his &quot;entire body of work&quot; to Warner last year.
The centre meant his life&#x27;s work was now taking its &quot;rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses&quot;, said a spokesperson from the David Bowie Estate.
The behind-the-scenes access the new venue offers &quot;will mean David&#x27;s work can be shared with the public in ways that haven&#x27;t been possible before&quot;.

Iran has been rocked by citizen outrage since the September 16 death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini following her arrest for an alleged breach of dress rules for women.
&quot;Instagram has been widely used by Iranians to shed light on the protests and the brutal response to them,&quot; Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg said during a briefing.
&quot;People have also shared Instagram footage of the protests with international media outlets, many of whom can&#x27;t report directly from Iran.&quot;

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>
