                              <span>Washington Post: Blinken arrives in Beijing amid deep fissures in U.S.-China relations 
BEIJING — Antony Blinken became the first secretary of state to visit China in five years on Sunday as he arrived in the country for two days of high-stakes meetings aimed at stabilizing a relationship under historic stress. 
His hosts previewed the tense visit with multiple rebukes of the United States, accusing Washington of engaging in “irresponsible bullying” and living under the “illusion” it could deal with China from a “position of strength.” 
China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Blinken that he should “show respect” during a pre-trip phone call, and made clear his view that Washington alone was responsible for the abysmal state of relations.

Kampala, Uganda CNN  — Armed rebels attacked a school in western Uganda, killing at least 41 people, mostly students, and abducting six others, Ugandan officials have said. 
Some were hacked to death with machetes while others died when their dormitories were set on fire, military spokesman Felix Kulayigye told CNN. 
About 20 members of the ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group attacked the Lhubirira secondary school late on Friday, according to Uganda’s military. 
The school is situated along Uganda’s border with Congo in the town of Kasese, and educates children between the ages of 13 and 18. Of the dead, 39 were students and two were from the local community, local officials said.

A high-ranking Space Force officer has spoken out slamming a slew of recent anti-LGBTQ state laws, saying they have a negative impact on military families and force readiness. 
Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt made the remarks in a fiery speech at the 12th Annual DoD LGBTQ+ Pride Event in Washington DC, saying that the laws sometimes forced her to choose &#x27;less qualified&#x27; candidates for postings in those states. 
&#x27;Since January of this year, more than 400 anti-LGBTQ+ laws have been introduced at the state level,&#x27; said Burt, the Space Force&#x27;s deputy chief of space operations.

Kyiv Independent: FT: US senators to propose bill to seize and transfer Russian assets to Ukraine 
U.S. senators with bipartisan backing are reportedly planning to propose a bill that would allow President Joe Biden to seize and transfer Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on June 15. 
Western countries have frozen around $300 billion of Russia&#x27;s Central Bank assets since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The bill&#x27;s proponents argue that since Russia bears the blame for the destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, it should also bear the financial costs of reparations. 
They also likely aim to alleviate the burden of Ukraine&#x27;s support from U.S. taxpayers and allies.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Saturday that the U.S. does not support a fast-tracked process for Ukraine to join NATO at the conclusion of the war. 
Ukraine would need to meet certain criteria for NATO membership, Biden said, raising concerns about corruption in the country. 
&quot;I think it will. I think it can, but it&#x27;s not automatic,&quot; Biden told reporters as he prepared to leave for Philadelphia. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants NATO member nations to commit to accepting Ukraine into the alliance when there is a resolution to the current conflict.

                              <span>Reuters: African leaders arrive for Ukraine talks with Russia&#x27;s Putin 
(Reuters) - African leaders hoping to mediate in the Ukraine conflict were welcomed to a government palace near St Petersburg on Saturday by Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said after meeting the leaders in Kyiv on Friday that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdrew its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. 
He added that he could not understand what could be gained from the delegation meeting Putin.
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Kyiv that the leaders had come &quot;to share the African perspective&quot; and saw talks with Russia as part of the mission. 
The leaders from Senegal, Egypt, Zambia, Uganda, Congo Republic and the Comoro islands as well as South Africa were meeting Putin at the government&#x27;s 18th-century Konstantinovsky Palace, on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.

WNU Editor: Sorry that the audio is out of sync in the above video, but it gives a good summary on what transpired. 
I have visited the Konstantinovsky Palace where these talks are being held. It is an incredibly beautiful place. Check out this aerial picture of the palace and the properties around it (link here). 
Update: When these African leaders met Ukraine President Zelensky the meeting was short, formal, and businesslike (link here). Check out the difference in body language when these same leaders met President Putin the next day (see tweet below).

RT:  ‘The world will be different’ when the Ukraine conflict ends – Lavrov to RT 
Russia will trust nobody else to guarantee its security once the goals of the special military operation have been achieved, the foreign minister said 
By the time the conflict in Ukraine is resolved, Kiev will have accepted the loss of its former territories, and Western-led globalization will be dead, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RT Arabic on Friday. 
Speaking on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Lavrov described the West’s proxy war with Russia as “a geopolitical conflict,” in which the US was attempting to eliminate a powerful competitor and “preserve its hegemonic position by all means.”

Daily Mail: Vladimir Putin tells West to &#x27;go to hell&#x27;as despot confirms that nuclear weapons have been moved to Belarus as a precaution for &#x27;anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat&#x27; on Russia 
* Lukashenko said Belarus has started receiving Russian tactical nuclear weapons 
* It is Moscow&#x27;s first move of such bombs outside Russia since fall of Soviet Union 
President Putin told the West to &#x27;go to hell&#x27; on nuclear arms reduction as he confirmed he has moved nuclear weapons into Belarus, claiming it is a precautionary measure for &#x27;anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat&#x27; on Russia. 
 Speaking at Russia&#x27;s flagship economic forum in St Petersburg, Putin told those gathered that the first warheads had arrived in the country, but that this was only &#x27;the first part&#x27; of the planned delivery. 
 He added: &#x27;Just talking about this (the potential use of nuclear weapons) lowers the nuclear threshold. We have more than NATO countries and they want to reduce our numbers. Go to hell.&#x27;

WNU Editor: The Western press is saying Putin said &#x27;go to hell&#x27;. Not really. I saw the video on what he said. He said the equivalent of &#x27;f*** NATO&#x27; in Russian. This is the first time I have ever seen or heard Putin swear like this.

 Poland says racism was not a factor in its decision to refuse entry to South African presidential guards and media for more than 24 hours. 
The stand-off happened at Warsaw&#x27;s Chopin airport. The aircraft will now be held there until Sunday, an airport spokesman told the BBC. 
About 120 people were stuck on the plane, who were all on their way to a peace summit in Ukraine. 
Some of the passengers are now disembarking and going to a hotel. 
Poland&#x27;s actions have left President Cyril Ramaphosa, who travelled separately to Ukraine, without some of his security detail. 
This prompted a furious reaction from Mr Ramaphosa&#x27;s head of security, Maj Gen Wally Rhoode.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -One of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s closest aides sought legal advice for a military intervention that would have prevented the handover of power following last October&#x27;s election, federal police said on Friday.
Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid was one of Bolsonaro&#x27;s personal assistants who stayed on as an aide after he stepped down. He is under arrest over allegations that he faked Bolsonaro&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination card.
According to an analysis of Cid&#x27;s seized cell phone, a federal police report said he had &quot;gathered documents with the aim of obtaining &#x27;legal and judicial&#x27; support for the execution of a coup d&#x27;état.&quot;
Cid&#x27;s lawyer Bernardo Fenelon said in a statement that his client would only defend himself to investigators.

                              <span>After years of demonizing billionaire investor George Soros as a sinister liberal bogeyman, the Hungarian government and its allied media are taking aim at a fresh target -- his son Alexander.
Monday&#x27;s announcement that the elder Soros will hand over control of his philanthropic empire to 37-year-old Alexander, who goes by the name of Alex, prompted an object lesson in the workings of media loyal to nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The 92-year-old Soros has become a bête noire of the international far right because of the activities of his Open Society Foundations (OSF).
In Hungary, the government accuses him of wanting to &quot;flood Europe&quot; with migrants because of the OSF&#x27;s support for refugee rights advocates.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court on Friday upheld an asylum-seeker pact between Canada and the United States.
Under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement, which came into effect in 2004, asylum seekers who cross the land border between the two countries are turned around and sent back on the grounds that they should apply for asylum in the first &quot;safe&quot; country they arrived in.
Built-in safety valves mean the agreement does not violate asylum seekers&#x27; right to life, liberty and security of the person, the Supreme Court ruled. But it sent the case back to federal court for a ruling on whether the agreement breaches asylum seekers&#x27; right to equal treatment under the law.
The two countries amended the agreement earlier this year, making it apply to the l…</span>

&quot;My purpose in meeting him today was an introductory meeting, just to congratulate him on being installed as minister of defence. Of course, (I) seize every opportunity to encourage him to move forward and approve the accession of Sweden,&quot; Austin told a press conference at NATO headquarters.

KYIV (Reuters) -A delegation of African leaders began a peace mission in Kyiv on Friday, undeterred by what Ukraine said was a volley of Russian missiles intended to greet them in the capital.
At least two explosions rocked the capital but mayor Vitali Klitschko said they were caused by air defences. He reported no deaths or big damage in the city but emergency services said four people, including a child, were hurt in the Kyiv region.
The peace delegation, including leaders from South Africa, Senegal, Zambia, the Comoros and Egypt, met defence ministry representatives ahead of talks planned later on Friday with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The leaders are due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Saturday and, with Kyiv and Moscow …</span>

                              <span>Many genetically modified foods could end up unlabelled on European supermarket shelves, according to a legislative proposal by the European Commission.
This would be the result of an unpublished draft commission regulation, seen by dpa.
The draft regulation would exempt certain genetically-modified plants from the EU&#x27;s strict rules on genetic engineering.
The proposal is expected to be officially presented in July.
The planned rule changes mean that processes such as CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors would not be subject to EU genetic engineering rules if the resulting varieties could also have been created by processes such as cross breeding or natural selection.
The CRISPR/Cas9 tool allows geneticists to make precise changes in long DNA chains, to make plants more resistant to drought and pests. According to the plans, such modification would fall under the so-called category 1 of plants bred by new techniques (NGT).
Under the planned regulations the strict genetic engineering rules for organic agriculture would continue to apply.</span>

The reforms, which also clarify rape prosecution requirements and criminalize voyeurism, cleared parliament&#x27;s upper house in a unanimous vote.
Campaigners welcomed the reforms, with the Tokyo-based group Human Rights Now calling them &quot;a big step forward&quot;.
The lifting of the age of consent in particular will &quot;send a message to society that sexual violence by adults against children is unacceptable&quot;, the group said in a statement.
The age of consent -- below which sexual activity is considered statutory rape -- is 16 in Britain, 15 in France, and 14 in Germany and China.

Earlier this month, Wall Street&#x27;s regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, pressed a raft of charges against Binance, the world&#x27;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and US-based Coinbase.
Both companies, along with the now defunct FTX, were key brands in the crypto industry, helping grow what began as a secretive playground for tech geeks into a new way to invest embraced by Wall Street.
The SEC has been slowly tightening the screws on crypto since 2020.

SOUTHEASTERN UKRAINE (Reuters) - Russia announced plans on Thursday to stage elections in occupied parts of Ukraine in just three months, Moscow&#x27;s latest bid to signal it is in control even as a Ukrainian counteroffensive has pushed its forces back in some areas.
The Ukrainian assault is in its early stages, and military experts say the decisive battles still lie ahead. But corpses of Russian soldiers and burnt-out armoured vehicles lining the roadside in villages newly recaptured by Ukrainian troops attested to Kyiv&#x27;s biggest advances since last year.
&quot;Our heroic people, our troops on... the front line are facing very tough resistance,&quot; Zelenskiy told NBC News in an interview in Kyiv. &quot;Because for Russia to lose this campaign to Ukraine, I would say, actually means losin…</span>

&quot;This is the broadest cyber espionage campaign known to be conducted by a China-nexus threat actor since the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange in early 2021,&quot; said Mandiant chief technology officer Charles Carmakal.
The cyberattackers compromised the computer defenses of hundreds of organizations, in some cases stealing &quot;emails of prominent employees dealing in matters of interest to the Chinese government,&quot; Carmakal added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. rights groups plan protests next week against India Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s state visit to Washington over what they say is India&#x27;s deteriorating human rights situation.
The Indian American Muslim Council, Peace Action, Veterans for Peace and Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition plan to gather near the White House on June 22 when Modi is due to meet U.S. President Joe Biden.
Washington hopes for closer ties with the world&#x27;s largest democracy, which is sees as a counterweight to China, but rights advocates worry that geopolitics will overshadow human rights concerns. The United States has said these include government targeting of religious minorities, dissidents and journalists.

New York (AFP) - A little bit of beer, a little bit of shrooms, and some mucking around with the guitar: that&#x27;s one recipe to write a smash song, says Post Malone.
The hitmaker was speaking to AFP as a special honoree at Thursday&#x27;s gala inducting new members into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, as Cuban-American Gloria Estefan became the first Latina artist to enter the prestigious pantheon.
A who&#x27;s who of music, the institution foregoes a televised event in favor of a festive dinner and intimate concert in a Manhattan hotel ballroom.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -At least 15 people were killed in the Canadian prairie province of Manitoba on Thursday after a semi-trailer truck hit a small bus that was carrying a group of mainly elderly people, police said.
The crash is one of the most lethal road accidents in recent Canadian history.
The crash occurred at the junction of two major roads near the town of Carberry in southwestern Manitoba, 170 km (105 miles) west of Winnipeg. The bus passengers had been on their way to a casino in Carberry, CBC News reported, citing a casino spokesperson.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been able to establish that at least 15 people have been confirmed deceased as a result of this collision,&quot; said Assistant Commissioner Rob Hill, who commands the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that a loss to Russia could ultimately force the U.S. to choose between the “collapse of NATO” or going to war. 
“If Ukraine would lose, if Russia would occupy Ukraine, Russia will continue going towards Baltic countries, Poland, etcetera,” Zelensky said in an interview with NBC News. 
“And they will start war with one of the NATO countries, and at this moment, the U.S. would have to choose the collapse of NATO or go to war.”

Warzone/The Drive: Israel’s Merkava Tank Has Possible Export Customer In Europe

 
Israel is negotiating sales of Merkavas with two countries, including one in Europe, prompting speculation about a possible deal for Ukraine.  
The Israeli government says that it is in very active talks with two countries about what could be the first confirmed international sales of variants of the country&#x27;s unique Merkava main battle tank. The identities of those nations have not been disclosed, but one of them is in Europe, which has already led to speculation that Merkavas may eventually be bound for Ukraine. 
Yair Kulas, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense&#x27;s International Defense Cooperation Directorate, also known by its Hebrew acronym SIBAT, disclosed the potential foreign Merkava sales in a recent interview with the Calcalist newspaper. SIBAT work includes negotiating the sale of weapon systems and other materiel from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inventory.

Rightwing members of the Swiss parliament boycotted an address by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that called for war materiel export restrictions to be eased. 
Members of the Swiss People’s Party were absent from the parliamentary chamber in protest against perceived interference of Swiss affairs. 
Zelensky has in the past urged Switzerland to beef up sanctions against Russian oligarchs and now wants Swiss-manufactured weapons to be sent to Ukraine.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Kissinger Sees War Over Taiwan Likely Unless US, China Back Down 
 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he believes military conflict between China and Taiwan is likely if tensions continue on their current course, though he still holds out for dialogue that will lead to deescalation — as he’s been urging. 
“On the current trajectory of relations, I think some military conflict is probable,” Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, when asked about the possibility that China would invade Taiwan. “But I also think the current trajectory of relations must be altered.” 
The remarks, delivered as Kissinger looked back on his life and career soon after his 100th birthday, were some of his most downbeat about the state of relations between China and the US, which has vowed to back Taiwan in the event China attacks. Kissinger said it was up to both Washington and Beijing to step back from their standoff, which he said was at “the top of a precipice.”

Ukraine&#x27;s long-awaited attempt to take back the territories in the east and south of the country, occupied by Russia for the past 18 months, is now in full swing. 
A key figure in planning and executing this operation is Gen Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#x27;s 49-year-old commander-in-chief. 
Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Gen Zaluzhny, or &quot;our Valera&quot; as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021.

The visit would be Putin&#x27;s first to a NATO country since he ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has only rarely traveled outside Russia since the beginning of full-scale hostilities. 
 &quot;There is an invitation from the president of Turkey. Putin and Erdogan agreed that the visit will be in the near future, but we have not yet talked about a specific day, specific dates,&quot; Interfax cited Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov as saying.

                              <span>SCMP: China’s top naval scientist proposes a Star Wars-style ‘supership’ to convert nuclear energy to kinetic force weapons 
* Breakthroughs in electromagnetic launch technology pave the way for a nuclear-powered warship to carry rail gun, laser and high-powered microwave: Ma Weiming 
* Researchers do not say when the supership will be built, but say China is ready to take the idea from science fiction to the real world 
Rear Admiral Ma Weiming, who is key to the development of China&#x27;s most advanced naval technologies, has revealed the conceptual blueprint of a futuristic warship which he says is unlike any ship the world had seen. 
&quot;It will completely overturn the combat formation of naval fleets that has been in place for over a hundred years,&quot; he said in a peer-reviewed paper published in Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society journal on June 13. 
Currently, naval combat platforms around the world, aircraft carrier groups, have been made more complicated by the diversity of tasks they must perform. This makes it harder for them to coordinate their actions effectively. These vessels are also expensive to build and operate.

China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping called the partnership an &#x27;important milestone in the history of bilateral relations&#x27; 
China said Wednesday that it established a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with the Palestinian Authority during a visit to Beijing by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 
The announcement marked another step in China’s campaign to gain political and economic influence in the Middle East, where it is competing with the United States. 
China is seeking energy resources and markets for its military and civilian exports while also promoting its version of authoritarian government as part of joint challenge with Russia to the Western-led democratic world order.

                              <span>CNN: India demonstrates naval strength with dual aircraft carrier exercise, a feat China has yet to accomplish 
India’s two aircraft carriers led their battle groups in a combined operation in the Arabian Sea earlier this week, showcasing what the service calls its “formidable maritime capabilities” and ability to project power around the Indian Ocean and beyond. 
Analysts say it’s a big accomplishment and one that only the United States Navy has pulled off in recent memory. 
“This is not a small achievement and underlines that the Indian Navy is one of very few in the world that operates more than one aircraft carrier,” said Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Independent: Scholz: &#x27;We need to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine&#x27; 
According to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to seize neighboring territories, therefore, Kyiv&#x27;s partners must discuss concrete security guarantees for Ukraine, Deutsche Welle wrote on June 14. 
The chancellor added that &quot;freezing the war&quot; and thus legitimizing Russia&#x27;s invasion is not an option, because borders cannot be moved by force.

&quot;The Russian president wants to seize certain neighboring territories: he holds such plans for Ukraine, and it is obvious he has such plans for Belarus,&quot; Scholz said.

Consortium News: Suspended for Providing Balanced News on Ukraine

 
An editor at Radio New Zealand has been suspended and is under investigation for the time-honored practices of providing balanced and factual reporting, writes Tony Kevin. 
On Friday The Guardian Australia website carried a news report, with a follow-up piece on Monday, whose implications for free speech are profoundly disturbing. 
They concern a Radio New Zealand, or RNZ, broadcasting employee — unnamed, but everyone in the small New Zealand broadcasting world will soon know who it is — who has been placed on leave while their professional conduct is investigated.  Obviously, a career hangs in the balance. 
The malign ghosts of Orwell’s 1984 stalk this story.

WNU Editor: Radio New Zealand is not the only news media outlet making the decision to provide news on the Ukraine war from only one side. I would say most Western news agencies have made the decision to ban any news from the Russian side on what is happening in the war. And while there are rare occasions when major US outlets do provide a glimpse on what is actually happening on the front-lines, that coverage is very rare and it is often obscured with other news breaking stories.</span>

Reuters: Cuba, Iran presidents meet in Havana, vow to confront &#x27;Yankee imperialism&#x27; 
HAVANA (Reuters) -Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz-Canel on Thursday, his last stop on a three-nation Latin American tour aimed at shoring up support among Latin American allies saddled, like Iran, by U.S. sanctions. 
Raisi told reporters at a trade forum in Havana early on Thursday that Cuba and Iran would seek opportunities to work together in electricity generation, biotechnology, and mining, among other areas. 
&quot;The conditions and circumstances in which Cuba and Iran find themselves today have many things in common,&quot; Raisi said in a conversation with Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel. &quot;Every day our relations grow stronger.&quot;

Several US federal government agencies have been hit in a global cyberattack by Russian cybercriminals that exploits a vulnerability in widely used software, according to a top US cybersecurity agency. 
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency “is providing support to several federal agencies that have experienced intrusions affecting their MOVEit applications,” Eric Goldstein, the agency’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in a statement on Thursday to CNN, referring to the software impacted. 
“We are working urgently to understand impacts and ensure timely remediation.”

Warzone/The Drive: Ukraine’s Armor Appears To Have A Russian Attack Helicopter Problem 
Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters’ presence at the front highlights the need for highly mobile and survivable short-range air defenses. 
As Ukraine presses on with its counteroffensive in the south and east, making incremental advances in the process, there is evidence that Russia may be starting to enjoy more aerial access over critical areas near the front lines. 
As Russia continues to adapt its application of air power, after a fairly dismal start to the campaign, some of its aircraft are now able to operate in a less restricted way, or at least Russia is willing to take on more risk in doing so. Either way, this will put further pressure on the Ukrainian forces, raising questions, in particular, about the availability of mobile short-range air defense systems, or SHORAD. At the very least, as Ukraine gets away from its more entrenched and fixed air defense capabilities, the importance of SHORAD is only going to be underscored.

Jack Teixeira is accused of posting secret and sensitive military documents on social media. 
A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guard member accused of posting secret and sensitive military documents on social media, on six counts related to his retention and transmission of those documents. 
“The unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified information jeopardizes our nation’s security,” acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy said in a statement Thursday. “Individuals granted access to classified materials have a fundamental duty to safeguard the information for the safety of the United States, our active service members, its citizens and its allies. We are committed to ensuring that those entrusted with sensitive national security information adhere to the law.”

The head of the UN atomic energy agency has said the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine is “serious” and that ensuring water for cooling was a priority of his visit, adding that the station could operate safely for “some time”. 
Rafael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was inspecting the state of Europe’s largest nuclear plant following last week’s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro River. He said IAEA inspectors would remain at the site.

Washington Post: GOP senator blocks arms sale to Hungary for stalling Sweden’s NATO bid 
Sen. James E. Risch, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is halting a $735 million U.S. arms sale to Hungary as punishment for the country’s refusal to approve NATO membership for Sweden, a rare move aimed at pressuring Budapest into greenlighting the military alliance’s expansion ahead of a major summit next month. 
In a statement to The Washington Post, Risch (Idaho) said Hungary must allow Sweden into NATO if it wants the arms package, which includes 24 HIMARS rocket launcher batteries, and more than 100 rockets and pods along with associated parts and support. 
The decision to slam the brakes on new arms sales to Budapest demonstrates the growing anger toward Hungary by NATO backers like Risch, who rarely holds up arms sales to countries in any part of the world.

                              <span>New Zealand has officially entered a recession however it is seen as a necessary part of steering the economy back on a sustainable path, says ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner. 

“It’s important to note that this is the plan,” Ms Zollner told Sky News Australia.

“So this is a bit different from the typical recession where you get some kind of negative shock and monetary policy goes into overdrive to try and get the economy out of it as fast as possible.

“It’s not clear that’s going to be the plan this time.”</span>

SYDNEY (Reuters) -In 2018 Paul Wang left his home in Beijing to start a new life in Australia, investing A$1 million ($680,000) in a food processing business in the hopes of qualifying for permanent residency under the country&#x27;s investment visa scheme.
Five years on, his hopes for his family of three remain on hold as the government has put the controversial &quot;Golden Visa&quot; programme on the back burner, causing processing times to blow out, leaving wealthy migrants like Wang in limbo.
&quot;We were not expecting it would take this long,&quot; said Wang, 44. &quot;And our life is a mess because of that. We simply cannot plan ahead with all of the uncertainty.&quot;
When Australia introduced the Business Innovation and Investment Programme (BIIP) in 2012, the hope was that wealthy business owners, i…</span>

                              <span>American Family Association publicly attacked U.S. Senator Ted Cruz over the Texas Republican’s opposition to the “Kill the Gays” law in Uganda. Cruz, who is not pro-LGBTQ civil rights, called the legislation “horrific &amp; wrong” in late May.


	AFA’s Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs Jameson Taylor told attendees at the National Association of Christian Lawmakers last week, as Right Wing Watch reports, that Cruz should think back to our nation’s founding, implying he should support the death penalty for LGBTQ people.

	Taylor did not mention that in the American colonies the death penalty was also imposed for crimes including witchcraft and adultery.

A day after at least 78 people died off the southern coast of Greece in one of Europe&#x27;s worst migrant disasters, demonstrations were held in the capital Athens and in the port city of Thessaloniki.
&quot;The EU is killing people,&quot; protest banners read.
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and several left-wing student and trade union organizations had called for the protests.
The bodies of 78 people have been recovered so far, but there are fears more than 500 people perished when the fishing boat capsized.
Media reports have quoted some survivors as saying that around 100 children were in the hold at the bottom of the vessel when it went down in the Mediterranean.

The Greek coastguard arrested nine survivors of the migrant boat disaster on suspicion of people smuggling, as hope of finding the hundreds still missing faded.
The men, who come from Egypt, have been accused of forming a criminal organization, reported state radio ERT on Thursday evening. They are suspected of having organized the transport of the migrants on the boat that went down off Greece, for which survivors said they paid between €5,0…</span>

The pair attended the centuries old Trooping the Colour celebration in 2022 when it was hosted by Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September. This weekend’s jubilee will be the first to take place with Harry’s father, King Charles, seated on the throne. The event was dubbed the Queen’s Birthday Parade during Elizabeth’s reign. According to People, Harry, 38, and Markle, 41, will likely be at home in California with their young children when the festivities get unde...</span>

                              <span>Four Indigenous children rescued in the Colombian Amazon last week after surviving in the jungle for 40 days are in good health but still at &quot;high risk&quot; of infection, the military hospital treating them said Thursday.
The children&#x27;s medical evaluation was &quot;favorable,&quot; it said in a statement, and they were reacting well to a gradual increase in their food intake after weeks of surviving on just berries, fruits and roots.
Lesly (13), Soleiny (9), Tien Noriel (5) and one-year-old Cristin were the only survivors of a small plane crash in the Amazon on May 1.
All three adults on board, including their mother died.
It took nearly 200 military and Indigenous rescuers with search dogs 40 days to track down the siblings in difficult jungle conditions. They were weak and hungry when found.
&quot;From an infection point of view, they are still considered at high risk due to their nutritional deficit,&quot; the hospital statement said.
Relatives say the children managed to survived thanks to Lesly&#x27;s deep knowledge of survival in the jungle, with its many inherent dangers -- including snakes, predatory animals and armed criminal groups.
Dozens of soldiers remain on the search for Wilson, a dog that formed part of the rescue mission for the children, but went missing in the jungle.

                              <span>Stockholm&#x27;s deputy mayor donned red lipstick and bouffant hair as he glammed up in drag for a children&#x27;s story hour, part of a campaign against &quot;intolerance and populism&quot; launched this week.
Jan Jonsson, a 45-year-old member of the center-right Liberal party, is behind the campaign.
He launched it in response to the far-right Sweden Democrats&#x27; repeated criticism of drag queens hosting children&#x27;s story hours at libraries and guided tours at Stockholm&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre.
&quot;I&#x27;m using myself as a kind of canvas for the drag artists...to be able to say that we think everyone should be free to express themselves,&quot; he told AFP.
&quot;Some political parties have tried to restrict the freedoms for others and especially drag queens.
&quot;With this stance, I hope that more will be able to say, &#x27;Okay, now it&#x27;s enough. Sweden should be a free country&#x27;.&quot;
In a televised debate in early May, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson said it was &quot;insane&quot; that taxpayers&#x27; money was being used for drag queen story hours.
He took issue in particular with a drag artist known as &quot;Shameless Winehore&quot; but who goes by the name &quot;Miss Shameless&quot; for story hours.
In a video clip posted on Twitter, Jonsson is seen glammed up wearing a curly blonde wig, fake eyelashes, a sky-blue dress with red flowers and high heels.
On a chair, surrounded by children seated on the floor, Jonsson reads a passage from &quot;The Brothers Lionheart&quot; by famed Swedish children&#x27;s author Astrid Lindgren about standing up for your beliefs even if it&#x27;s dangerous.
&quot;Stories are not dangerous for kids. And drag queens aren&#x27;t either. But populism and intolerance are dangerous for kids and for adults,&quot; Jonsson says in the advert.
Jonsson has previously fronted a Liberal campaign against Sweden&#x27;s soaring gang crime, where the slender politician, clad in a floral shirt and blue blazer was dubbed the &quot;gangs&#x27; worst enemy&quot;.

BBC: Sharp decline in appetite for news in recent years, Reuters Institute says 
The number of people taking a strong interest in the news has dropped by around a quarter in the last six years, a global study suggests. 
A report by Oxford University&#x27;s Reuters Institute says 48% of people around the world are very or extremely interested in the news - down from 63% in 2017. 
In the UK, the proportion is lower than the global average at 43%. 
More than a third of people (36%) worldwide say they sometimes or often actively avoid the news. 
The authors of the institute&#x27;s report said there was evidence that audiences &quot;continue to selectively avoid important stories such as the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis as they cut back on depressing news and look to protect their mental health&quot;.

                              <span>Politico.eu: Turkey’s Erdoğan plays down Sweden’s NATO hopes 
His remarks injected a chill into the growing optimism that Sweden could get the NATO green light soon. 
Sweden has still not won Turkey’s support to join NATO ahead of the military alliance’s summit in Vilnius next month, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Wednesday — pouring cold water on rising hopes that a deal might be near. 
“Sweden’s expectations don’t mean we’ll follow them,” Erdoğan said during a trip to Azerbaijan, according to Bloomberg and Turkish media, referring to Stockholm’s aspirations of becoming a NATO member before the alliance’s annual summit in July. 
Erdoğan’s comments were conspicuously timed, coming just as senior officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland met in Ankara to discuss Turkey’s concerns over Sweden’s NATO bid.

Cable news’s on-screen graphics — known as chyrons — were originally designed to highlight the latest news to viewers in a concise way. But on Tuesday night, Fox News viewers got one that was unusually politically charged.
Just before 9 p.m., the network split the screen to present comments from President Biden at the White House simultaneously with Donald Trump’s combative remarks after pleading not guilty to federal charges of illegally retaining classified documents.

WNU Editor: The fun part of this story is that the Biden administration&#x27;s Justice Department DID arrest and charge their main political rival. Isn&#x27;t that what authoritarian governments around the world do to their political opponents?

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
