                              <span>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has wrapped up his six-day tour of Russia, triggering global concerns about weapon transfer deals between countries.

Before heading home, leader Kim Jong Un was shown military equipment used in the war against Ukraine.

He also received five explosive drones and a bulletproof vest as a farewell gift from one of Russia&#x27;s top regional governors.

Talks between Kim and Vladimir Putin are deepening fears amongst Western nations about stronger ties between both countries.

Kim began his journey back to North Korea onboard his armoured train from the Primorye region in Russia’s far east, completing his first overseas trip in more than four years.</span>

She had gotten divorced the year before and left the house in a small town in Holguín, in eastern Cuba, where she had lived with René Ferias, her husband of 22 years. 
A few days later, at dawn on Jan. 26, Ferias attacked her with a machete and killed her. “Imagine seeing your daughter hacked to pieces by a nasty man, who had not even been her husband for over a year, because he found out that she had another relationship,” said her mother, Nancy Alberteris.</span>

The paint spread to the Pariser Platz, the square at the foot of the monument, with bright footprints extending along the roadway.
Fourteen people were arrested at the site, police told AFP, without any indication of acts of violence.
The demonstrators wanted to send the message that it is &quot;time for political change&quot; in order to &quot;move away from fossil fuels&quot;, according to the statement.
&quot;We must get out of petrol, gas and coal no later than 2030. It is high time that (German Chancellor) Olaf Scholz speaks clearly,&quot; Last Generation spokesperson Marion Fabian said in the statement.
Germany wants to reach net zero targets by 2045.

To the sound of military bands and under a sunny sky, the 77-year-old monarch, clad in a sober suit and tie, enjoyed the public acclaim along with Queen Silvia, 79, wearing a canary yellow ensemble, as six horses led the royal procession.
The crowd broke into applause as they passed and waved Swedish flags to mark the milestone for Carl Gustaf, who was the world&#x27;s youngest monarch when he was crowned aged 27 in September 1973 after the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf.
The king is the longest reigning monarch in Sweden&#x27;s history and also the European monarch with the second-longest reign, behind his cousin Queen Margrethe of Denmark who took the throne…</span>

The Jazlah plant in Jubail city applies the latest technological advances in a country that first turned to desalination more than a century ago, when Ottoman-era administrators enlisted filtration machines for hajj pilgrims menaced by drought and cholera.
Lacking lakes, rivers and regular rainfall, Saudi Arabia today relies instead on dozens of facilities that transform water from the Gulf and Red Sea into something potable, supplying cities and towns that otherwise would not survive.

                              <span>A new report published by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) has revealed 125,000 migrants settled in New York between April to June 2023, higher than any city in the US. 

According to the New York Post, NYC&#x27;s taxpayers are estimated to spend $US40,000 per migrant by the end of this financial year, if it continues to receive asylum seekers at the current average rate. 

Mayor Eric Adams warned residents of a &quot;financial tsunami&quot; and said the crisis could cost the city $US12 billion over the next three years. 

The Big Apple&#x27;s expenditure on asylum seekers is already bigger than the entire budget of the city of Boston.

New York&#x27;s 1980s-era ‘right to shelter’ law, which requires the city to house and feed anyone who asks, has been blamed for the unhinged influx of migrants.</span>

                              <span>Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu has not been seen in public for more than two weeks. The disappearance of this top official close to President Xi Jinping comes two months after that of now-former foreign affairs minister Qin Gang, and follows the dismissal of a pair of influential military generals. For some observers, Li&#x27;s vanishing is likely linked to corruption, while others see it as a sign of intense political battles hidden from outside eyes.</span>

                              <span>The impeachment inquiry into president Joe Biden is less like the Donald Trump impeachments and more like today&#x27;s version of the Benghazi hearings, according to an Atlantic writer.
Kevin McCarthy recently announced an impeachment inquiry into Biden, which was cheered by right-wingers who sought to score political points or churn up more evidence. Some on the Republican side have cautioned away from jumping into the impeachment, seeking to prevent going into a political process without evidence of any presidential wrongdoing. 
Atlantic staff writer David A. Graham pointed out how similar this process is to the Benghazi scandal that helped to tank Hillary Clinton&#x27;s poll numbers.

                              <span>Comedian and YouTube personality Russell Brand is pushing back at new accusations that he sexually assaulted three women and a teenager according to the BBC.
The sexual assault report was &quot;part of a joint investigation by the Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches,&quot; with the BBC reporting, &quot;Four women are alleging sexual assaults between 2006 and 2013 ... At the time of the alleged assaults, Brand was a presenter for BBC Radio 2, Channel 4, and an actor in Hollywood films. Other claims made as part of the investigation include allegations about Brand&#x27;s controlling, abusive and predatory behaviour.&quot;
Late Friday night, Brand took to his social media platforms to defend himself, claiming his liaisons were all &quot;consensual.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

The BBC reported that Brand claimed, &quot;Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.&quot;
He continued, &quot;These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I&#x27;ve written about extensively in my books I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual.&quot;
ALSO IN THE NEWS: &#x27;He’s probably guilty, but it doesn’t matter&#x27;: Trump fans aren&#x27;t scared off by 4 criminal indictments

The report adds Brand added he believes he&#x27;s the victim of as a &quot;co-ordinated attack&quot; and will be looking into the &quot;very, very serious&quot; allegations.

Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, died a few days after her arrest by religious police for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women in force since shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Her family says she died from a blow to the head but this is disputed by Iranian authorities.
Anger over her death rapidly expanded into weeks of taboo-breaking protests which saw women tearing off their mandatory headscarves in an open challenge to the Islamic republic&#x27;s system of government under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

                              <span>A Belgian court on Friday handed out sentences ranging up to life in prison to eight men for the 2016 jihadist bombings in Brussels, ending the country&#x27;s largest-ever criminal trial.
The suicide bombings on March 22, 2016 at Brussels&#x27; main airport and on the metro system killed 32 people and were claimed by the Islamic State group.
French citizen Salah Abdeslam and Belgian-Moroccan Mohamed Abrini – already sentenced to life in jail by France for a 2015 massacre in Paris – were the highest-profile of six culprits found guilty of murder in July.
Abrini, who was one of the intended bombers but decided not to blow himself up at the last moment, was given a 30-year jail term.
The court ruled not to give Abdeslam an additional term after he was sentenced in Belgium to 20 years in 2018 over a shootout.
The attacks – near the headquarters of both NATO and the EU – were part of a wave of attacks claimed by the Islamic State group in Europe.
Hundreds of travelers and transport staff were maimed and seven years on, many victims, relatives and rescuers remain traumatized.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez, also known as &quot;El Raton&quot; or &quot;The Mouse,&quot; was indicted earlier this year on drug trafficking charges linked to the fentanyl crisis plaguing the United States.
His father was convicted in 2019 of running what was believed to be the world&#x27;s biggest narcotics syndicate and is serving life in a supermax prison in the state of Colorado.
Garland hailed the extradition as &quot;the most recent step in the Justice Department&#x27;s effort to attack every aspect of the cartel&#x27;s operations.&quot;

                              <span>Several Republican presidential hopefuls, including Mike Pence and Ron DeSantis, are set to address an influential gathering of Iowa evangelical Christians. They hope to sway support from former President Donald Trump, who is skipping the event. Trump, despite not attending such gatherings, maintains popularity among evangelical Christians and social conservatives due to his stance on issues such as abortion.</span>

Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of European unity on a bilateral level. The European Commission had temporarily banned the export of wheat, maize, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds from Ukraine due to concerns about local farmers being undercut by cheap Ukrainian grain.</span>

The St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv and the medieval center of Lviv are UNESCO World Heritage Sites that are important to Ukraine&#x27;s culture and history. While neither site has been directly targeted in the ongoing conflict with Russia, the decision to list them as endangered could help deter further attacks.</span>

                              <span>NBC News: Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges

 
The president&#x27;s son was indicted after a plea agreement on tax and gun charges fell apart in July and as House Republicans investigate his finances.  
Federal prosecutors have indicted Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, on gun charges, court documents show. 
Biden was indicted Thursday in federal court in Delaware on three counts tied to possession of a gun while using narcotics. 
Two counts accuse Biden of having completed a form indicating he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018. The third count alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic. The indictment says Biden certified on a federally mandated form &quot;that he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.”

WNU Editor: I for one would not be surprised if these charges are dismissed before trial. Robert Barnes legal and political analysis is probably correct (see tweet below).

Goal here is to tie up Hunter such that he can&#x27;t be subpoenaed to testify in any impeachment effort, and can claim the 5th. It&#x27;s not a real effort to punish. https://t.co/wranfhrVkz

Bloomberg: Kim Jong Un Tours Russia Jet Plant as Kremlin Denies Arms Deals 
North Korean leader toured a Russian factory that makes fighter jets, as the US warned he is on a visit that could support the Kremlin’s assault on Ukraine. 
Kim arrived in the eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur on Friday to see a facility that makes high-tech fighter jets and other aircraft. 
He was shown planes including the Su-35 as well as the Su-57 stealth combat fighter, according to a Russian government Telegram channel. 
Kim’s limousine was later shown on social media being loaded onto the personal armored train that took him to Russia.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China will impose sanctions against U.S. aerospace and defence firms Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin for providing weapons to Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday. 
The sanctions are being enacted under China&#x27;s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular press briefing. 
&quot;We urge the U.S. side to effectively abide by the one-China principle... cease U.S.-Taiwan military liaison and stop arming Taiwan, or else it will be subject to a resolute and forceful retaliation by the Chinese side,&quot; she said.

                              <span>President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France&#x27;s envoy to Niger is living like a hostage in the French embassy and accused military rulers of blocking food deliveries to the mission.
The ambassador is living off &quot;military rations&quot;, Macron told reporters in the eastern town of Semur-en-Auxois.
&quot;As we speak, we have an ambassador and diplomatic staff who are literally being held hostage in the French embassy,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are preventing food deliveries,&quot; he said, in an apparent reference to Niger&#x27;s new military rulers. &quot;He is eating military rations.&quot;
Niger&#x27;s military leaders told French ambassador Sylvain Itte he had to leave the country after they overthrew President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
But a 48-hour ultimatum for him to leave, issued in August, passed with him still in place as the French government refused to comply, or to recognise the military regime as legitimate.
The coup has been condemned by France and most of Niger&#x27;s neighbors.
Macron said the envoy &quot;cannot go out, he is persona non grata and he is being refused food&quot;.
Asked whether France would consider bringing him home, Macron said: &quot;I will do whatever we agree with President Bazoum because he is the legitimate authority and I speak with him every day.&quot;
France keeps about 1,500 soldiers in Niger, and said earlier this month that any redeployment could only be negotiated with Bazoum.
The country&#x27;s new leaders have torn up military cooperation agreements with France and asked the troops to leave quickly.
Macron has for weeks rejected the call to remove the French ambassador, a stance backed by the EU which has described the demand as &quot;a provocation&quot;.
Like France, said EU foreign affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali last month, the EU &quot;does not recognize&quot; the authorities that seized power in Niger.
The impoverished Sahel region south of the Sahara, has suffered what Macron has called an &quot;epidemic&quot; of coups in recent years, with military regimes replacing elected governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea as well as Niger.

Flooding of the Braskereidfoss power dam control room prevented the hatches from opening, causing a partial collapse and flooding downriver. The heavy rains provoked mudslides and swollen rivers which swept away some structures and flooded towns, requiring the evacuation of more than 3,000 people and isolating others.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
