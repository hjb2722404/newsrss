FOX News: Ukraine killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops every day, eliminates 5,000 in single battle 
Ukrainian forces are killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops every day, and they eliminated 5,000 troops in a single battle in late January, according to U.K. officials citing data from Ukraine. 
Russian troops, including the elite 155th naval infantry, stormed the Ukrainian coal mining city Vuhledar near Dontesk in late January. Ukrainian forces repelled the offensive, however, and killed, injured or captured 5,000 Russian troops. 
Meanwhile, U.K. officials say the war is exacting a heavy toll on Russia, with 824 Russian troops dying each day, according to Ukrainian updates.
&quot;The 155th brigade already had to be restaffed three times. The first time after Irpin and Bucha; the second time they were defeated near Donetsk – they recovered again,&quot; Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, a Ukrainian defense forces spokesman, told Politico. &quot;And now almost the entire brigade has already been destroyed near Vuhledar.&quot;

                              <span>Politico:  Lawmakers seize on spy balloon to inflate defense spending 
Lobbyists, meanwhile, are pitching new radars and other homeland defense systems to the Pentagon and Congress. 
Defense hawks in Congress cite many reasons to keep money flowing to the Pentagon: enemy fleets, hypersonic missiles, nuclear threats. 
Now they have a new one, and it was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean on Feb. 4. 
Lawmakers and lobbyists are pouncing on a Chinese spy balloon’s seven-day incursion over North America this month to push back against possible defense budget cuts — and make the case for even more funding — as Congress grapples with the growing threat from Beijing and doubts about the military’s ability to detect similar objects. 
“I don’t think there’s one U.S. senator who has been going to these briefings that thinks that the message out of this is less defense spending,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). His state has been at the center of two of the recent flights.

                              <span>The Hill: Half in new survey believe news organizations mislead, misinform public 
A new survey found that half of Americans believe that national news organizations intend to mislead, misinform or persuade the public. 
More than half of the Americans surveyed, 53 percent, in the Knight Foundation and Gallup poll said they held an unfavorable opinion of the media, which was down slightly from 2020 levels. 
“This study suggests that many Americans are not solely skeptical of news today — they feel distrust on an emotional level, believing news organizations intend to mislead them and are indifferent to the social and political impact of their reporting,” the report says.

   EurAsian Times: Russia Is Launching ‘Military Balloons’ With Corner Reflectors Into Ukraine To Exhaust Its Air Defenses – Kyiv 
The Pentagon informed that an F-16 shot down the object, employing the same AIM-9X Sidewinder missile as in the last three shootdowns. 
Pentagon officials assured that none of these objects shot down appeared to pose a military threat. However, there has been a proliferation of balloons being sent to the continent. 
Intriguingly, even as the United States and Canada are actively fighting the menace of UFOs, Russia has now borrowed a fig leaf from this playbook and started infiltrating Ukrainian airspace with its balloons.  Ukraine alleges that the move is aimed at tiring out Ukrainian air defenses.

OilPrice.com: The IEA Expects Global Oil Demand Hit A Record High In 2023 
* The InternationEnergy Agency has raised its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2023 by 100,000 bpd from last month. 
* The agency’s new forecast sees global oil demand increasing by 2 million barrels per day from 2022 levels. 
* China’s resurgent oil demand will account for nearly half the projected increases this year. 
Global oil demand is set to increase by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, pushed up by growth in Chinese consumption after the reopening, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday as it raised its 2023 demand growth estimate by 100,000 bpd from last month’s forecast.
This year, world oil demand is set to average a record 101.9 million bpd, up by 2 million bpd from 2022, the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report today. 
The increase is 100,000 bpd higher than the 1.9 million bpd rise the agency expected at the time of the publishing of its January report.

                              <span>FOX News: Biden to sell 26 million barrels more from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is currently at its lowest level since 1983 
The Biden administration on Monday announced another sale of oil from the Energy Department&#x27;s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with 26 million barrels set to be delivered to the market from April 1 to June 30, which will take the number of barrels in the reserve to a new low dating back to 1983. 
Unlike the largest-ever drawdown of the SPR that Biden announced in response to Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, the latest release of 26 million barrels is in response to a requirement included in two laws enacted by Congress during the Obama administration under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. 
The announcement comes ahead of a potential uptick in gas prices as the U.S. nears the summer driving season.

WNU Editor: The Biden administration is trying to keep oil prices and the inflationary impacts that it can have as low as possible. Unfortunately, this is only a short term measure. The real solution is to expand domestic oil and gas production, but this is a policy that the Biden administration has all but discouraged since taking office.

* “What we are very concerned [about] is the unexpected,” Georgieva said.

The Managing Director of the IMF warned that we need to “think of the  unthinkable,” as we live in “a more shock-prone world” impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the recent earthquake across Syria and Turkey. 
“We all have to change our mindset to be much more agile and much more oriented towards building resilience at all levels, so we can handle the shocks better,” Kristalina Georgieva said Tuesday, during a World Government Summit panel hosted by CNBC’s Hadley Gamble. 
 “What we are very concerned [about] is the unexpected,” Georgieva said.

Politico: Norway warns of growing importance of Russian nuclear ‘deterrent’ in Arctic 
‘Tactical nuclear weapons are a particularly serious threat,’ Norwegian intelligence report says. 
While war rages in Ukraine, Norway’s intelligence service is warning of the increasing importance of Russia’s nuclear “deterrent” in the Arctic waters of the far north. 
“As the importance of nuclear weapons and strategic deterrent forces increases, the Northern Fleet’s defense of the military bases in Kola, the Northern Bastion and the Barents Sea is also becoming more important,” the Norwegian Intelligence Service said in its annual report. 
When asked to clarify its assessment on the risks, the intelligence service told POLITICO: “The key part of the nuclear deterrent is on the submarines and surface ships of the Northern Fleet.”

                              <span>New York Times/DNYUZ: Three objects shot down after Chinese spy balloon may be benign, White House says 
WASHINGTON — A top White House official said three unidentified flying objects shot down in the past several days might turn out to be harmless commercial or research efforts that posed no real threat to the United States.
John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said investigators had not yet found any evidence that the three objects were connected to China’s program of balloon surveillance similar to the balloon shot down over South Carolina’s coast this month. 
But he cautioned that officials had not yet been able to find and collect the debris from the three objects after they were shot down, and that a different conclusion could be reached if the debris was found and analyzed. 
Mr. Kirby said that military and intelligence officials had also found nothing to suggest that the three objects were part of an intelligence collection effort by another country.

                              <span>Science Alert: We&#x27;ve Forgotton The Potential Horrors of What a Nuclear Winter Would Be Like 
Under the shadow of the Cold War, many in the world feared the impending prospect of a nuclear winter. According to a new report, our focus has since drifted from its horrors, leaving us with a general lack of awareness that could be dangerous for the future of humankind. 
It goes without saying that the threat of a nuclear blast is no trivial event. Decades of pop culture have left society with a relatively strong association between global calamity and atomic weapons. 
But the exact details on exactly what we might expect from such an escalating conflict have become hazy in the past few decades. 
The facts themselves are fairly clear. Besides the many millions who would be killed directly from the blasts, climate models predict the debris resulting from nuclear war would block out much of our sunlight for up to a decade. The consequences for survivors would be devastating: a decline in global temperature, followed by widespread crop failure, and then mass starvation. 
In spite of this dark threat, just a small percentage of today&#x27;s population claim to be well informed about the precise consequences of a nuclear war – and many of those people are relying on outdated information spread amid the political tensions between superpowers in the 1980s.

A pair of Dutch F-35 fighters were scrambled overnight to intercept a formation of three Russian warplanes near NATO member Poland. 
The Russian jets - one spy plane and two fighters - were met as they approached Polish airspace from the Russian-controlled enclave of Kaliningrad, and were escorted back out of NATO territory, the Netherlands&#x27; defence ministry said Monday. 
&#x27;The then unknown aircraft approached the Polish NATO area of responsibility from Kaliningrad,&#x27; according to Reuters&#x27; translation of the ministry&#x27;s statement.

Reuters: Moldova Briefly Shuts Airspace After Report of Balloon-Like Object 
CHISINAU (Reuters) -Moldova briefly closed its air space on Tuesday to investigate reports of a balloon-like object in the sky, a day after the small east European country accused Russia of plotting to bring down its government. 
Russia denied the accusation by President Maia Sandu, who has repeatedly expressed concern about Russia&#x27;s intentions towards the former Soviet republic since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. 
Moldova&#x27;s civil aviation authority said it acted after receiving a defence ministry report that a small object resembling a weather balloon had been seen over the north of the country, close to the border with Ukraine.

                              <span>Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine: NORAD: F-16s Intercept Russian Bombers and Fighters Near Alaska 
U.S. warplanes intercepted four Russian aircraft operating near Alaska, the Department of Defense announced Feb. 14. But the U.S. stressed the Russian mission was not unsafe or provocative and the aircraft did not pose a threat. 
On Feb. 13, two Russian Tu-95 Bear-H strategic bombers and two Su-35 Flanker-E fighters entered the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said in a statement. 
The Alaska ADIZ serves as an early warning buffer for North America that includes international airspace, and NORAD said that Russian aircraft did not enter American or Canadian airspace.
“This Russian activity in the North American ADIZ occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat, nor is the activity seen as provocative,” NORAD said.

Bloomberg: UAE Says Oil Supply A Bigger Issue Than Demand For 2024 
Oil supplies will pose a bigger issue than demand for global markets in 2024 as some countries struggle with production and investment, the United Arab Emirates energy minister said. 
Global oil markets are currently balanced, Suhail Al Mazrouei told Bloomberg TV in Dubai, adding to signals that the UAE and fellow OPEC+ producers will stick with current production targets this year. 
But he cautioned that, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners review plans for 2024 at the end of the year, the biggest quandary may be how the world will satisfy rising consumption.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

“We are now in an endless war.”
A French historian who accurately predicted the fall of the Soviet Union over a decade in advance says that World War III has already begun as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. 
The comments were made by Emmanuel Todd, one of France’s leading intellectuals, during an interview with the Le Figaro newspaper. 
“It is evident that the conflict, initially a limited territorial war, has evolved into a global economic confrontation between the whole West on one side, and Russia, backed by China, on the other. It has become a world war,” Todd said. 
Todd added that “the resistance of the Russian economy is pushing the U.S. imperial system toward the abyss” and that Biden must “hurry” to rescue a “fr…</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg: NATO Struggles to Meet Spending Goals as It Weighs Higher Target 
(Bloomberg) -- NATO countries may agree as soon as this summer to spend at least 2% of their economic output on defense, a slight shift from the alliance’s 10-year-old pledge to “move toward the 2% guideline.” 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the alliance’s defense ministers will begin discussing the target when they meet in Brussels for two days starting on Tuesday, with the aim to agree on a revision by the next NATO summit in Vilnius in July. 
NATO countries have pledged to spend more on defense following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, but many nations — including Luxembourg, Canada and Italy — are still struggling to comply with the old guideline. That makes it hard for NATO to significantly strengthen the target, which may lead allies instead to agree to a 2% floor, current and former officials and diplomats say.

The classified guidance will plan ways for NATO to simultaneously engage in a high-intensity so-called Article 5 conflict, where allies would have to defend each other, as well as an out out-of-area, non-Article 5 event at the same time, people familiar with the matter said.

Washington Post: U.S. warns Ukraine it faces a pivotal moment in war 
As the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears, U.S. officials are telling Ukrainian leaders they face a critical moment to change the trajectory of the war, raising the pressure on Kyiv to make significant gains on the battlefield while weapons and aid from the United States and its allies are surging. 
Despite promises to back Ukraine “as long as it takes,” Biden officials say recent aid packages from Congress and America’s allies represent Kyiv’s best chance to decisively change the course of the war. 
Many conservatives in the Republican-led House have vowed to pull back support, and Europe’s long-term appetite for funding the war effort remains unclear. 
Several officials noted the strong bipartisan support that has accompanied every Ukraine package, adding that Congress gave the White House more than it asked for, but they acknowledged that was under a Democratic-led House and Senate.

Bloomberg: These Are the $439,000 Missiles the US Is Using to Shoot Down Mystery UFOs 
(Bloomberg) -- As mysteries continue to swirl around the balloon and three other so-far-unidentified objects shot down by the US in recent days, at least one thing has been clear: the weaponry used to knock them out of the sky. 
Be it the original, alleged Chinese surveillance balloon downed off South Carolina, or the objects targeted over Alaska, Michigan and Canada, all have been shot down by the same type of missile — the AIM-9X Sidewinder. 
Here’s what you need to know about it:

WNU Editor: This is an expensive miss .... First Sidewinder Missile Targeting Object Over Lake Huron Missed At Cost Of $400,000 (Zero Hedge).   
Update: Good question (see tweet below): 

The Lake Huron &quot;balloon&quot; (octagonal object) was at just 20,000 feet. So why did our fighters use heat-seeking $400,000 sidewinder missiles to shoot it down when a few cannon rounds could have done the job? Balloons don&#x27;t have a heat signature and a missile is overkill.

Islamabad: Even as thousands of containers with essential items remain stranded at the Karachi port due the severe lack of foreign exchange reserves, Pakistan is staring at an even bigger unemployment crisis due to a lack of imports. 
Top businessmen in Pakistan have warned the government that a failure to lift the ban on imports will leave millions jobless and have urged the cash-strapped administration to allow manufacturing materials stuck at the Karachi port into the country. 
Pakistan, which is struggling with critically low dollar reserves, has imposed a ban on imports with only essential items such as food and medicines being exempt.

Three airborne objects in North American airspace were shot from the sky by the American military in the span of three days over the weekend at President Joe Biden’s direction, an unprecedented series of events that is leading to fresh questions about what exactly is transpiring high in the skies above the US.
Biden on Monday ordered a new government-wide effort to determine what precisely is happening. And in four separate locations, from the frozen waters off Alaska to the Carolina coast, work was underway to collect and analyze debris from the shot-down objects. 
But answers about what the objects were, where they were from and what they were doing remained elusive. 
During a midday briefing at the White House, the only detail of certainty was that the objects did not originate from outer space.

The Biden administration wants to ensure it has enough ATACMS for the U.S. military. 
The Biden administration has given its Ukrainian counterparts another reason for not sending them much-wanted long-range missiles: The U.S. is concerned it wouldn’t have enough for itself. 
In recent meetings at the Pentagon, U.S. officials told Kyiv’s representatives that it doesn’t have any Army Tactical Missile Systems to spare, according to four people with knowledge of the talks. Transferring ATACMS to the battlefield in eastern Europe would dwindle America’s stockpiles and harm the U.S. military’s readiness for a future fight, the people said.

News 360: France asks its citizens to leave Belarus «without delay» over Ukraine invasion 
The French Foreign Ministry on Monday asked its citizens to leave Belarus &quot;without delay&quot; for security reasons related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
&quot;In the context of the armed offensive launched by Russia against Ukraine and the closure of Belarusian airspace, any travel to Belarus is formally discouraged,&quot; begins the Foreign Ministry statement, which &quot;invites&quot; French citizens to leave that country &quot;without delay&quot; and &quot;by road.&quot; 
&quot;French nationals in Belarus are invited to leave the country without delay by road, through the control crossings with the Lithuanian, Polish or Latvian borders. If necessary, passengers arriving by air should apply for an exit visa to the services of the Belarusian Ministry of the Interior,&quot; reads the Foreign Affairs alert.

                              <span>Stars and Stripes/Washington Post: Russians abandon wartime Russia in historic exodus  
YEREVAN, Armenia — As Russian troops stormed into Ukraine last February, sending millions of Ukrainians fleeing for their lives, thousands of other Russians raced to pack their bags and leave home, fearing the Kremlin would shut the borders and impose martial law. 
Some had long opposed rising authoritarianism, and the invasion was a last straw. Others were driven by economic interest, to preserve livelihoods or escape the bite of sanctions. Then, last autumn, a military mobilization spurred hundreds of thousands of men to run. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s war has set off a historic exodus of his own people. Initial data shows that at least 500,000, and perhaps nearly 1 million, have left in the year since the invasion began — a tidal wave on scale with emigration following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991.

WNU Editor: I think the number is around 750,000 who have left Russia since last year. I helped a few to immigrate to Canada in the past few months, but no one is interested now. 
It should also be noted that while many Russians have left, many Russian - Ukrainians (about 3 million) have fled to Russia (see graph below). An inconvenient fact that the above Washington Post article is ignoring.</span>

Outwardly, it is very similar to the usual train. 
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin decided to imitate Kim Jong-in and moved from a plane to an armored train that travels inside the Russian Federation. 
This is stated in the investigation of the Dossier Center.  The Russian dictator began to make more active use of the armored train for his trips around Russia in the autumn of 2021, exactly at the time when the occupying army began to prepare for a war against Ukraine. 
Putin travels by armored train to his residences in Valdai and Sochi.

                              <span>Joe Biden delivered “a good campaign speech” at the State of the Union address last week, says former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

“He had energy, he was quick-witted, he did not look like a doddering 80-year-old man,” he told Sky News Australia.

“But it didn’t resonate with the people.”</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Europe&#x27;s spend on energy crisis nears 800 billion euros 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European countries&#x27; bill to shield households and companies from soaring energy costs has climbed to nearly 800 billion euros, researchers said on Monday, urging countries to be more targeted in their spending to tackle the energy crisis. 
European Union countries have now earmarked or allocated 681 billion euros in energy crisis spending, while Britain allocated 103 billion euros and Norway 8.1 billon euros since September 2021, according to the analysis by think-tank Bruegel. 
The 792-billion-euro total compares with 706 billion euros in Bruegel&#x27;s last assessment in November, as countries continue through winter to face the fallout from Russia cutting off most of its gas deliveries to Europe in 2022.

Maia Sandu says plan revealed by Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been confirmed 
Moldova’s president has accused Russia of plotting to overthrow the country’s pro-EU government through violent actions disguised as opposition protest. 
Maia Sandu said authorities had confirmed an alleged Russian plot to destabilise her country that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had revealed last week. 
Zelenskiy told EU leaders that Ukraine had intercepted a plan from Russian intelligence, having uncovered a document that showed “who, when and how was going to break the democracy of Moldova and establish control” over the country.

WNU Editor: Moldova is a deeply divided country due to a deepening and worsening economic crisis.

A prediction. 
By now branding her opponents as Russian saboteurs and/or a threat to the government, I can easily see the Moldovan government passing legislation where opposition leaders and opposing political parties may be banned or worse.

China&#x27;s incursions around Taiwan have become an almost daily occurrence in recent months 
Nearly two dozen Chinese military aircraft and ships were detected around Taiwan on Monday morning after the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps held joint exercises in the South China Sea over the weekend. 
Taiwan&#x27;s Defense Ministry said that 18 People&#x27;s Liberation Army aircraft were detected, 11 of which crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial buffer zone in between the island and China. 
Four vessels were also detected around Taiwan.   China&#x27;s incursions have become an almost daily occurrence in recent months, but the latest sign of aggression comes just days after the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps conducted joint drills in the South China Sea.

Reuters: Russian spy service says US grooming militants to attack Russia 
* Militants from groups affiliated with Daesh and Al-Qaeda had been recruited and were undergoing training at an American base in Syria 
MOSCOW: Russia’s foreign spy service said on Monday that it had received intelligence that the US military was grooming Islamist militants to attack targets in Russia and the former Soviet Union. 
Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, headed by an ally of President Vladimir Putin, said it had intelligence that 60 such militants from groups affiliated with Daesh and Al-Qaeda had been recruited and were undergoing training at an American base in Syria.
“They will be tasked with preparing and carrying out terrorist attacks against diplomats, civil servants, law enforcement officers and personnel of the armed forces,” said the Foreign Intelligence Service, known by the initials SVR.

WNU Editor: A part of me finds it hard to believe that Al Qaeda or Islamic State militants would want to work with the US. But I then realize that the US would use a third party just like they used the Pakistanis in the 1980s to arm the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when they were fighting against the Soviets in the 1980s. 
To say that the conflict between Russia and the U.S. is getting hotter with each passing day is an understatement.</span>

* Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has previously described NATO role as &#x27;nice job&#x27; 
* He is among those being tipped to replace the current chief Jens Stoltenberg 
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is being tipped to become NATO&#x27;s next chief after current Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed he will stand down in October. 
Officials at the military alliance this weekend dismissed claims Mr Stoltenberg could extend his term again amid the Ukraine war. 
It means the secretary-general post will become vacant in just under eight months&#x27; time, with the race now on to become his successor.

Russia&#x27;s feared new major offensive in Ukraine has already started, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said today, warning that Ukraine is using more munitions than the military alliance is producing.
&#x27;We see no sign whatsoever that [Russian] president [Vladimir] Putin is preparing for peace ... What we see is president Putin and Russia still wanting to control Ukraine&#x27;, he said, almost one year after Moscow launched the war in February 2022.
&#x27;We see how they are sending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities.&#x27;

   Zero Hedge: Ukraine Short On Ammo With Russia Gaining, Despite West&#x27;s Billions, Stoltenberg Admits 
NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg in a Monday briefing warned that the West is now locked in a race against Russia to get ammunition to the front lines in support of Ukrainian forces. He specifically affirmed that NATO countries are in a &quot;race of logistics&quot; regarding ammo and arms supplies at a crucial moment of intensified fighting. This as &quot;Russia seems to have already launched a large-scale offensive in Ukraine... sending in thousands and thousands more troops,&quot; Stoltenberg explained. 
&quot;It is clear that we are in the race of logistics. Key capabilities like ammunition . . . must reach Ukraine before Russia can seize the initiative on the battlefield.&quot; He also described dramatically that &quot;A war of attrition becomes a battle of logistics,&quot; while acknowledging that &quot;Yes, we have a challenge. Yes we have a problem . . . but we have a strategy to tackle that.&quot; In some ways, his new words are a belated admission that Russia has already seized the initiative.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic&#x27;s presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society&#x27;s political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

                              <span>Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men&#x27;s World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
&quot;Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,&quot; Murangira said.
&quot;They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.&quot;
&quot;Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.&quot;
Rwanda&#x27;s soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda&#x27;s Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men&#x27;s event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in France.

The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children&#x27;s hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.

                              <span>Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

                              <span>Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the &quot;toxicity&quot; of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, &quot;and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes&quot;, Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was &quot;now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire&quot;, Cumming said.
&quot;So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I&#x27;m now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!&quot;
The queen&#x27;s death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

                              <span>A man was crushed to death by a &quot;telescopic&quot; urinal in central London on Friday, despite the efforts of ambulance crews, an air ambulance and firefighters.
Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London&#x27;s West End, the city&#x27;s theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a &quot;telescopic urinal&quot; when he became trapped, police said.
&quot;We&#x27;re sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene,&quot; Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
&quot;Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.&quot;
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.</span>

                              <span>Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
&quot;We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,&quot; said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
&quot;Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,&quot; added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a &quot;quagmire.&quot;
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte&#x27;s removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo&#x27;s arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country&#x27;s south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru&#x27;s vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

                              <span>NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran&#x27;s government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
&quot;The victim publicized (the) Iranian government&#x27;s human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution,&quot; Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran&#x27;s head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

                              <span>A British teenager was on Friday sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for videos promoting racist violence that have been linked to two mass killings in the United States.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and a &quot;propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology&quot;.
&quot;You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you,&quot; Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

A paved road of more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) begun in 312 B.C. by Roman statesman Appius Claudius Caecus, the &quot;Via Appia&quot; is an archaeological treasure trove, where an ongoing excavation hopes to uncover the actual starting point of the road in Rome.

Sharma is the custodian of a temple dedicated to Nathuram Godse, who on January 30, 1948, gunned down a figure celebrated the world over as an apostle of non-violent struggle.
For generations, the young religious zealot -- hanged the following year -- was roundly despised as the archvillain of India&#x27;s long struggle to free itself from British colonial rule.
But since the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi nearly a decade ago, an alternate history forged in Hindu nationalist ideology has left Sharma no longer a &quot;lone warrior&quot; in worshipping the assassin.

Campaigners worked for two decades to establish an official ceremony for LGBTQ victims of the Nazis, saying their experience had long been forgotten or marginalised.
&quot;This group is important to me because it still suffers from discrimination and hostility,&quot; Baerbel Bas, president of the Bundestag lower house, told AFP.
Germany has officially marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day -- the anniversary of Auschwitz&#x27;s liberation -- since 1996 with a solemn ceremony at the Bundestag and commemorations across the country.

Dressed in beige trousers and red berets, the children stand in rows in the building&#x27;s iconic Triumphant Hall, decorated in white marble and symbols of the Red Army crushing the Nazis.
&quot;Do you swear to always be loyal to the motherland?&quot; a group leader said.
&quot;I swear!&quot; they replied in chorus.
Some parents watched as their children took the oath in the presence of officials, war veterans and local leaders of the militaristic youth group.
Daria Chertkova said her 12-year-old son Stanislav made a &quot;conscious decision&quot; to join the group by himself.

A truck-sized asteroid that suddenly loomed out of the darkness a few days ago -- with the Earth in its sights -- sailed harmlessly past us on Thursday, space scientists said.
Despite what we&#x27;ve seen in movies like &quot;Armageddon,&quot; no global mission to blow it up or knock it off course with nuclear weapons was required.
Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.
Phew.
The rock, which was spotted for the first time on Saturday by an amateur stargazer in Crimea, came closest to the southern tip of South America at around 0029 GMT Friday, according to scientists who were tracking it.
At its nearest point, the asteroid was just 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) from Earth&#x27;s surface -- just a quarter of the heigh…</span>

                              <span>Mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting fresh revelations from the US trial of former security chief Genaro Garcia Luna, accused of receiving vast sums of money to allow the notorious Sinaloa cartel to smuggle cocaine.
The trial of Garcia Luna, who was Mexico&#x27;s public security minister from 2006 to 2012, began on Monday at the same New York court that handed convicted drug lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman a life sentence in 2019.
The prosecution&#x27;s first witness, an ex-police officer who later worked for Guzman&#x27;s Sinaloa cartel, said he had witnessed former gang boss Arturo Beltran Leyva, who was killed in 2009, give bribes to Garcia Luna.
&quot;He was paid until Beltran&#x27;s last day,&quot; Sergio Villarreal Barragan said in Spanish.

                              <span>Former President Donald Trump on Thursday evening claimed he could end the war between Russian and Ukraine in a single day were he still president.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
&quot;IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS,&quot; he wrote. &quot;SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!&quot;
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

&quot;FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!&quot;
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a &quot;genius&quot; at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.</span>

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved its Doomsday Clock forward to 90 seconds before midnight.
The clock has been maintained since 1947 and is used as a metaphor for the likelihood that we&#x27;ll blow ourselves up. Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, &quot;It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.&quot;
In 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. Today it&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
&quot;Before encountering Earth, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth&#x27;s orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun,&quot; NASA said in a statement. &quot;After its encounter, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth&#x27;s and Mars&#x27; orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.&quot;
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world&#x27;s telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.</span>

The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt&#x27;s former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, &quot;decorated with scenes of daily life,&quot; belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.
It was found in the pyramid complex of Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty, who reigned some 4,30…</span>

                              <span>“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…</span>

                              <span>The Danish government&#x27;s plan to abolish a public holiday to help fund the defense budget amid the war in Ukraine is putting Denmark&#x27;s cherished welfare model at risk, the country&#x27;s biggest trade union warned.
&quot;It&#x27;s a big threat to the Danish model&quot;, said Lizette Risgaard, the head of the FH union which has 1.3 million members in a country of 5.9 million inhabitants.
&quot;Politicians should stay out of labour market issues. If they go through with this they&#x27;ll be imposing their will and violate our agreements&quot;, she thundered in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.
The left-right government coalition in power since December, headed by Social Democratic Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, plans to scrap the religious holiday known as &quot;Great Prayer Day&quot;, observed since the 17th century.
