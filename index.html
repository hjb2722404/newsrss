Mr Jordan said what happens concerning Australia’s position in the Solomons Island has “enormous ramifications” for Australia and western nations. 

“Once you let them in there, they’re going to establish police force,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“It’s going to be ever more difficult politically and diplomatically to kick them out…but that does pose a long-term threat to Australian security as well as other allied nations in the region.”</span>

                              <span>Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese says the Biden administration wanted Labor to be briefed on the bipartisan support for the AUKUS agreement. 

Mr Albanese said the Biden administration sought reassurance from the Morrison government on consulting the Opposition. 

“It is extraordinary that the Prime Minister broke that faith and trust with our most important ally by not briefing Australian Labor n these issues,” he said. 

“The fact that the United States had made a request to Australia that was ignored for four and half months shows that this is a Prime Minister who always plays short-term politics.”</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]   ‘Planet Leadership Series’ is a pioneering thought leadership programme organised by Yew Chung Yew Wah (YCYW) Education Network. The series is open to both members within the YCYW Education Network, as well as online participants across the globe, providing a platform for all parents and students to engage in cutting-edge issues of the modern age. By inviting outstanding leaders across diverse fields to share their insights and stories through presentations, interviews, and roundtable discussions, the programme aims to enlighten the community and illuminate the way to a brighter future.   YCYW has always been committed to aligning with science and technology, and is renowned for its progressive use of education technology to break down silos and foster effective learning. In keeping with YCYW’s dedication to science and technology, the second session of the ‘Planet Leadership Series’ is centred on the topic ‘The future is at your doorstep: Human vs Technology’. It examined the opportunities and challenges presented by technology, as well as how students can successfully navigate a future of accelerating technological change.    The event kickstarted with an address by Dr Betty Chan Po-king, CEO and School Supervisor of YCYW Education Network.

As such, she views the marriage of technology and education as an exciting proposition that dovetails with YCYW’s mission of aligning with science and technology.  As the keynote speaker, Mr Vic Lee, founder of Catalyst Education Lab and co-founder of Tencent, shared his insights on the relationship between humans and technology.

Speaking of the five countries that automatically enter the final – Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Great Britain – he joked: “I have a boyfriend in every country.”  He was also a host last year.
Eurovision has always “had a big LGBTQ element to its fandom,” said Catherine Baker, a historian at the University of Hull who has written about the contest.

                              <span>The daughter of a GM die-maker, Ms Barra, 60, grew up in Royal Oak, Michigan, and started working at a GM plant as an intern at 18 while studying electrical engineering at technical college of business, now called Kettering University.  Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a master’s degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.
In January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.
In a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.
Removing loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years “helped change the mindset,” she said.  “The whole company kind of said, ‘Well, it’s a new day.  “”
GM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.
Along the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.

                              <span>WASHINGTON — Maritime traffic to and from Russia has remained relatively heavy in recent months as companies rush to fulfill contracts to purchase energy and other assets before the full force of global sanctions does not come into force.
With the European Union about to introduce a ban on Russian oil in the coming months, this situation could change significantly.  But the data so far shows that while trade with Russia has been reduced in many cases, it has not yet been crippled.
Crude and petroleum product volumes shipped from Russian ports, for example, soared to 25 million metric tons in April, according to data from shipping tracker Refinitiv, from around 24 million metric tons in December, January, February and March, and mostly above the levels of the past two years.

                              <span>This includes using observational data and two sets of computer simulations, one that models the world as it is, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than it is. was before widespread emissions began in the late 19th century, and a hypothetical world in which global warming never occurred.
The conclusion that the likelihood of such an extreme rain event has increased with global warming is consistent with many other studies of individual events and larger trends.  One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.
The study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.
Among these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.
The researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durban’s population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.
“Once again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,” said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.

First, in a pre-dawn tweet, Mr Musk said the deal was on hold.  He said he wanted more details about the volume of spam and fake accounts on the platform. 
Then, about two hours later, Mr. Musk tweeted again.  He was “still committed” to the acquisition, he said, without giving further details. 
The seemingly conflicting messages left many wondering if Mr. Musk had cold feet, was trying to drive down the acquisition price, or was looking for some attention.  Maybe it was a combination of all three.  Twitter shares yo-yoed in response to his posts.

                              <span>Dr Özel said the new image’s similarity to that of 2019 demonstrated that the previous image was no coincidence.  In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  “The similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,” said Dr Galison.
At Thursday’s press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, “This is an extraordinary verification of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. “
Einstein’s Bad Dream
Black holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.
Einstein’s insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.
Einstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.
But there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still don’t understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.
Paradoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials – gas, dust, jagged stars – falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.

The Hill: Defense &amp; National Security — Pentagon chief addresses deaths on Navy ships  
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at a congressional hearing on Wednesday acknowledged that there’s a “problem” in terms of how Navy sailors are housed aboard ships in need of repair, such as the USS George Washington. 
Austin’s remarks were his first about living conditions on the USS George Washington, where seven sailors have died in the past year. 
The Pentagon chief was pressed about the living conditions during questioning from Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) at a hearing of the House Appropriations subcommittee on the Defense Department.

(CNN)US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his Russian counterpart for the first time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon announced on Friday. 
The call lasted approximately an hour and was at the request of Austin, who used the first call between the two in 84 days to urge Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to implement an &quot;immediate ceasefire,&quot; according to a brief readout of the call. 
The two last spoke on February 18, a week before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.  It ends an extended period in which Russia&#x27;s top military leaders repeatedly refused to speak with their American counterparts.

ABC News Australia: Defence Minister Peter Dutton says a Chinese spy ship has been seen near secretive naval facility off Western Australia  
A high-tech Chinese surveillance ship has been tracked off the West Australian coast, close to a secretive naval communications base that supports American and other allied submarines. 
Defence Minister Peter Dutton has revealed the auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) vessel was closely monitored by the ADF as it sailed past the Harold E Holt naval station at Exmouth. 
Mr Dutton said Australia had been tracking the spy ship in the past &quot;week or so&quot; but didn&#x27;t put an exact date on the surveillance. 
&quot;Its intent, of course, is to collect intelligence right along the coastline,&quot; he said.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. State Department last week changed the wording on its U.S.-Taiwan relations page to delete reference to Taiwan as being part of China and removed a statement disavowing Taiwan independence. 
According to the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine, as recently as May 3, the U.S. State Department fact sheet on bilateral relations with Taiwan stated that like the 1972 Shanghai Communique, the 1979 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communique severing ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, acknowledged the &quot;Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.&quot; 
The fact sheet was dated Aug. 31, 2018 during the Trump administration.

Washington (CNN)The US intelligence community is carrying out a sweeping internal review of how it assesses the fighting power of foreign militaries amid mounting pressure from key lawmakers on Capitol Hill who say officials have failed twice in one year on the two major foreign policy crises faced by the Biden administration in Ukraine and Afghanistan. 
 The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday sent a classified letter to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Department and the CIA pointing out that the agencies broadly underestimated how long the Ukrainian military would be able to fend off Russian forces and overestimated how long Afghan fighters would hold out against the Taliban last summer after the US withdrawal from the country, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. They questioned the methodology behind the intelligence community&#x27;s assessments, and the underlying assumptions behind them, the sources said.

* NATO ascension for a new member state requires consensus approval from all existing members. 
* Turkey joined NATO in 1952, and has the second-largest military in the 30-member alliance after the United States. 
* Finland&#x27;s leaders on Thursday called for NATO membership &quot;without delay&quot; and neighboring Sweden is expected to follow suit. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has thrown Sweden and Finland&#x27;s potential NATO membership into doubt, just as both countries are on the cusp of applying to join the alliance in the wake of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 
&quot;We are following the developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don&#x27;t hold positive views,&quot; Erdogan told press in Istanbul on Friday.

After a short lull in early May, the Ukrainian Army is expelling the Russians from northern Kharkiv Oblast, thus threatening the rear of the Izium Russian group of occupiers, which is attacking Sloviansk and Barvinkove ​​from the north. This can be seen on the general map of hostilities.

WNU Editor: I am not sure about the first two encirclement plans for the Donbas (see above map). I always felt the priority of the Russian and DPR military in April was to secure a land-bridge from the Donbas to Crimea. 
As for encirclement #3. That military operation is definitely in play right now.</span>

Kremlin press secretary says Helsinki’s move ‘threatens Russia’s security.’ 
Russia will respond to Finland joining NATO with “military-technical” retaliatory measures, Moscow warned Thursday. 
“Finland’s accession to NATO will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations,” the Russian foreign ministry wrote in a statement. The warning came in response to Finland’s leaders on Thursday officially endorsing the idea of their country joining NATO, a historic move that sets the stage for a membership application in the coming days. 
“Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security that arise in this regard,” the Russian foreign ministry said.

Reuters: EU seeks bigger role in Asia&#x27;s &#x27;theatre of tensions&#x27;, warns on China  
TOKYO (Reuters) -European Union leaders said on Thursday that the EU wants to become a bigger actor in Asia, which they termed a &quot;theatre of tensions&quot;, warning of an increasingly assertive China even as they called on Beijing to defend the multilateral global order. 
The call came in a joint news conference in Tokyo after an EU-Japan summit featuring European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. 
It also came a day after Beijing warned the summit not to &quot;speak ill&quot; of China.   The trio said they would keep up talks on ways to maximise their partnership to tackle Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, in areas such as energy as well as aid, joining in a statement to call for the immediate cessation of hostilities.

When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, the stock prices of many of the world&#x27;s biggest arms manufacturers spiked. 
As the first Russian tanks rolled across the border, investors flocked to companies, including Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Thales, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. 
However, the demand created by the war has yet to translate into big increases in revenue for the major defence contractors.

                              <span>CNN: New White House Covid projection puzzles experts and catches some Biden officials off guard 
(CNN)It was a stern and startling warning from the White House&#x27;s new Covid response coordinator: In the fall and winter, the US could potentially see 100 million new Covid-19 infections if Congress doesn&#x27;t approve federal funding to fight the pandemic. 
That warning from Dr. Ashish Jha, who said the projection was based on a range of internal and external models, jolted some public health experts and even came a surprise to some top Biden administration officials, with sources telling CNN that the grim forecast -- and details of where exactly that 100 million number had been derived from -- was not discussed with some key officials intimately involved in the administration&#x27;s work to fight Covid before Jha&#x27;s TV interview over the weekend.

                              <span>VOA: North Korea&#x27;s Kim Orders Lockdown as First COVID-19 Outbreak Is Confirmed 
Seoul — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a nationwide lockdown Thursday to try to contain a highly transmissible variant of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which was confirmed in the country this week for the first time. 
The official Korean Central News Agency said genetic sequencing analysis of samples collected from a group of people on Sunday in Pyongyang had identified the BA.2 strain, also known as the “stealth omicron” for its relative difficulty of detection. 
While calling the situation a “most critical emergency,” the report did not say how many infections had been confirmed nor how many people had been tested. 
North Korea has maintained a strict border closure since February 2020 and instituted its own quarantine measures amid the pandemic, which have now officially been breached.

North Korea has tested-launched another ballistic missile, South Korea has said, making it the 16th weapon tested so-far this year. 
The rocket was fired towards the sea off North Korea&#x27;s east coast on Thursday, Seoul announced, and said it is analysing the launch to work out exactly what was tested. 
It is the latest in a flurry of weapons tests as Kim Jong Un attempts to restart a missile programme that paused during nuclear negotiations with Donald Trump that ultimately came to nothing.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates warned earlier this week that their spare energy capacity is decreasing in all energy sectors as key producers reduce investment in fossil fuels, pushing oil,  diesel, and natural gas to trade at near-record highs. 
Brent oil was trading at around $102 a barrel as they spoke.      
&quot;I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,” said Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to Bloomberg on May 10, at an OPEC conference in Abu Dhabi. 
The prince was referring to the surge in prices for refined oil products, in particular in the United States, where gas and diesel prices are hitting a record high, causing problems for the Biden administration.       
&quot;The world needs to wake up to an existing reality. The world is running out of energy capacity at all levels,” said the Saudi minister.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the two countries to reconsider NATO membership.
 Finland and Sweden are on the verge of seeking membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a historic shift for two traditionally non-aligned countries and a major expansion of the Western alliance as war wages in Europe.
On Thursday, Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin strongly backed Finland’s NATO membership. “NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security,” they said in a joint statement. “As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense al…</span>

As the United States approached a tragic milestone – one million american lives lost to virus – the fear of another deadly variant weighed heavily on the president Second Covid-19 World Summit, a virtual gathering co-hosted by Belize, Germany, Indonesia and Senegal.  Some countries were notably absent.  China did not participate.  Russia was not invited.

Luckily for Hines, the Club for Growth Action, the group’s super PAC arm, said it plans to spend $1.3 million support him in the primary.  That’s a huge sum for a house race.
Before settling in the 13th arrondissement, Hines had searched for a suitable perch.  He announced plans to challenge Rep. Virginia Foxx, a longtime Republican in the west of the state, before redistricting alters those plans.  In April, he and his wife moved to a house in Fuquay-Varinaa town in southern Wake County, the most densely populated part of the district.
Some Republicans in the dark red county of Johnston, a fast-growing rural community, criticized Hines for, in the words of the leader of a local group, “Coming in, just trying to pick a district he can win.” And Hines’ main adversary, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former State House majority leader, attacked him as a baggage handler.
The Hines campaign, which declined to make him available for an interview but answered a series of detailed questions about his candidacy, notes his upbringing in Charlotte and his time at NC State, which is in Raleigh, just north of the district line.
Daughtry has spent more than $2.5 million on the race so far, while contributing nearly $3 million of its own money.  She has also caught in heat for his past donations to Democratsincluding Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee, and Josh Stein, the state attorney general.
Several people with access to private polls said Hines appeared to be ahead of Daughtry by a few percentage points, with everyone else trailing far behind.  In North Carolina, if no candidate wins at least 30% of the vote, the first two qualify for a second round.

The two women collapsed on a nearby wooden bench next to strangers who understood better than anyone what had just happened.  Their sons had all disappeared behind those same walls.
After a record weekend of gang killings in March, the Salvadorian government declared a state of emergency and suspended constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties.  The ensuing campaign of mass arrests led to the imprisonment of more than 25,000 people in about a month and a half.

                              <span>HARTFORD, Conn.  — There has always been a certain fluidity in our appreciation of American modernist maverick Milton Avery (1885-1965).  And it’s not just because of the light, airy, boldly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea and sky that characterized his last decade.  Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of any particular group or movement, meaning the general awareness of his work fluctuated greatly.  It is always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the opportunity to do so has been too rare.
Now one of those rare moments has arrived, with much of Avery’s work featured in exhibitions in New York and Hartford, Connecticut. Wadsworth Atheneum Art Museum in Hartford presents “Milton Avery”, a sumptuous study of almost 70 paintings (org…</span>

He was due to hold his first-ever event in Ukraine in March.  Larissa Saveliev, co-founder of the organization and former Bolshoi dancer, said that when the war in Russia started, she sent an email to the 50 or so dancers who had signed up to say: “If you want help, let me know”.

                              <span>BRUSSELS — As Brussels’ biggest performing arts festival kicked off last weekend, there were few traditional stages in sight.  Instead, spectators gathered at colonial-era monuments, a disused railway museum and even the Belgian Senate’s debating chamber.
There are practical reasons for the flurry of site-specific performances at the month-long event, called Kunstenfestivaldesarts, said Daniel Blanca Gubbay, one of its directors, during a break between performances.  After two years of pandemic upheaval, many performance venues in Brussels have been booked with shows rescheduled this year.
The constraints have led to creative programming, showcasing areas of the city that even frequent visitors may not necessarily know.  To see “The Weeping Woods and the Okapi Resistance”, a family puppet …</span>

                              <span>In the cleverly reimagined “Montana Story” genre, the American flag doesn’t just wave and flutter, it also sends a warning.  He looks so modest.  Clean and neat, with no frayed edges or faded colors, it flies from a tall pole planted in front of a beautiful two-story house.  There, on 200 acres in southwestern Montana, in a glorious region surrounded by mountains known as Paradise Valley, nature invites and soothes.  It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.
Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel don’t dwell on the flag.  Instead, they gently immerse you in a classic Western setting while simultaneously drawing you into a simmering family melodrama about two grappling adult children and their terminally ill father.

                              <span>As demonstrated in movies as diverse as “Monterey Pop,” “Woodstock” and “Summer of Soul,” music festivals can’t help but derive some of their vibe from their sets.  As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,” directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the city’s annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.
The film’s opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is – thankfully – a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.


Exploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you “like a freight train.”


Entrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianist’s work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.
The seething history – which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festival’s appeal – turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.

Rivian, the electric vehicle maker that went public last year with big ambitions to take on Tesla and others, said Wednesday that supply chain issues had hampered it in the first quarter, but it maintained its production forecast for this year.
The company’s shares have fallen more than 80% this year as investors grew nervous about its prospects.  The price rose 7% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, with quarterly results broadly in line with expectations.
Rivian detailed ongoing problems in obtaining semiconductors and other parts.  And since the end of March, the company said, shortages have forced it “to stop production for longer periods than planned, resulting in the loss of ab…</span>

                              <span>Central bankers are hoping their policies will temper economic growth without driving up unemployment or plunging America into a recession – creating what they often call a “soft landing”.
“I really want this to be the outcome, but I recognize that it won’t be easy to do,” Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview Monday.
Officials have clearly recognized that let the economy down gently will be difficult, and some have hinted that they would be willing to inflict economic pain if that was what it took to fight high inflation.
If the economy gets to a point where unemployment starts to climb but inflation remains “unacceptably high”, Mr Bostic said, price hikes will be “the threat we have to address”.
A challenge for policymakers – and even more so for families – is that price increases are surfacing in basic necessities. The cost of food has increased 0.9% in April from the previous month, the 17th consecutive monthly increase, according to Wednesday’s report.
The increase was led by dairy products, soft drinks and a 10.3% monthly rise in the cost of eggs as bird flu decimated poultry flocks.  Such inflation tends to particularly affect the poor, who spend more of their budget on necessities such as groceries and gasoline.
But while Americans are seeing strong job gains and strong wage growth — although not strong enough to fully counter inflation — many are managing to weather rising costs for now, keeping aggregate demand strong.
“Consumers seem willing to accept the higher menu prices, especially as inflation runs wide,” George Holm, chief executive of food retailer and restaurant supplier Performance Food Group, said on a call on Wednesday. to the results.  “Nevertheless, it’s something to watch closely over the coming months and quarters.”

On Wednesday, it only said it was “increasing production and deliveries.”  On the call with analysts, Scaringe said he expected pickup trucks to make up about a third of the 25,000 vehicles in the 2022 production forecast.
In many ways, Rivian epitomizes the stock market’s sharp downward turn this year.
In November, investors crowded into its initial public offering, in which the company raised $13.5 billion, and its shares then soared, briefly giving Rivian a market value almost as large as Ford’s. Motor and General Motors combined.
But the stock plunged this year after the company slashed production targets.  The 80% drop in Rivian shares is much steeper than a 31% drop in Tesla shares over the sa…</span>

Lucas, 37 years old, bought his first house at the beginning of the year in the trendy district of Hampden.  To catch it, he had to pay the asking price of $330,000.  
But for the veteran of the hit Bravo series – currently in its ninth season – his journey to find that perfect home wasn’t all sunshine and roses. 
“The goal has always been to settle down, put down roots, buy a house,” Lucas told the Post.  “But it’s been difficult to be able to try to do that and for a lot of people my age and my generation, with housing prices the way they are, student loan debt at an all-time high, it’s difficult. .”

                              <span>On Thursday, TechCrunch reported that Congress is asking major social media platforms to archive content showing evidence of Russian war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.
Four representatives sent letters making the request to Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.
&quot;As TikTok booms in popularity and surpasses 1 billion users, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too,&quot; reported Amanda Silberling. &quot;These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable.&quot;

&quot;In particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes,&quot; said the report.
The Russian army has been accused of repeated war crimes as part of the Ukraine invasion, from the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol to the butchering of unarmed civilians in Bucha.
Russia has denied all accusations, claiming that they are only going after military targets and sticking to their discredited story they are trying to &quot;denazify&quot; the country.</span>

                              <span>The lack of military funding in Russia is now apparently impacting soldiers who are being forced to buy their own body armor. There have been allegations of corruption by foes of President Vladimir Putin that cash was siphoned off, leaving the military unable to buy necessary equipment. 
The Daily Beast reported Thursday that one soldier&#x27;s mother was on a tapped call that was shared by Ukraine&#x27;s Security Service (SB). &quot;How much do you need?&quot; the mom asked. &quot;And what kind of equipment?&quot;
She later asked, &quot;And you have to buy that with your own money?&quot; 
The frustration isn&#x27;t unheard of, when it was discovered that Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan were buying their own body armor in 2004. A March 7, 2005, story in the New York Times by reporter Michael Moss revealed that shortly after the Ira…</span>

According to CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger, one of the lawmakers subpoenaed, Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, &quot;might actually be willing to testify.&quot; 
According to Borger, Brooks spoke at the infamous &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot, only to later be passed over by former President Donald Trump for an endorsement in his reelection race. 
Borger also pointed out that Brooks has already publicly revealed that Trump asked him to help &quot;rescind&quot; the 2020 election. 
&quot;If he&#x27;s already said it publicly, why not say it to the committee?&quot; Borger said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s government cited &quot;the need to protect national security&quot; for withholding the advice it received about granting a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev.
Opposition parties have demanded more transparency over the role Johnson played in appointing his friend Lebedev -- whose father was a KGB officer -- to the House of Lords.
MPs earlier this year approved a motion seeking to force ministers to release sensitive documents related to the nomination to the upper house of parliament.
But in response the government released only a handful -- including the blank form Lebedev needed to com…</span>

The United States, European Union and United Nations have backed calls for a full investigation into what Al Jazeera labelled a deliberate killing &quot;in cold blood&quot;, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) has rejected holding a joint probe with Israel.

                              <span>What started out as a battle between a top campaign adviser to the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and his daughter has become an exposé about the way that Russia has allegedly managed to make its way into influencing the Republican Party over the past two decades. 
Speaking to the Kyiv Post, former McCain advisor Steve Schmidt outlined the dominating influence of Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Davis over the GOP. 
&quot;Let’s look at some past presidential campaigns: In ’96 Senator Bob Dole was an insider; in 2000 Senator George W. Bush was an outsider; in 2004 we had Bush’s re-election and in 2008 Senator John McCain was an insider. If you take a look at those campaigns, you can see that one firm, in particular, had an inside track. It was a Washington DC firm that had represented R…</span>

Ignatova famously vanished in 2017 and has not been seen since.
&quot;Five years after going on the run, police have appealed for the arrest of Dr Ruja Ignatova, founder of OneCoin, a cryptocurrency that sold itself as an alternative to Bitcoin but was instead a pyramid-style scam which relieved people from 175 countries of at least £4 billion,&quot; reported Max Daly. &quot;The scam, one of the biggest frauds in history, which could have reaped as much as £12.7 billion from investors, was the subject of the BBC’s &#x27;The Missing Cryptoqueen&#x27; podcast.&quot;

                              <span>Russia is paying a heavy price for its invasion of Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson warned on CNN Thursday that the conflict is far from over.
While discussing Russia&#x27;s stalled efforts to take over the eastern part of Ukraine, Anderson also touched on Finland&#x27;s decision to apply for NATO membership, which he said showed that the military alliance of Western powers is growing stronger in the face of Russian aggression.
&quot;I would submit to you, we&#x27;re heading back to a Cold War, I think,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there will be a stalemate in the Ukraine. Get ready for Cold War II.&quot;
Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, did not join NATO during the first Cold War, although Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has dramatically changed the calculus in Helsinki, as Finland&#x27;s president and prime minister both came out in favor of joining on Thursday.

Addressing the conflict in Ukraine, Anderson said that it appeared Russia&#x27;s strategic options in eastern Ukraine appear limited even though they have a significantly larger military than the Ukrainians do.
&quot;They&#x27;re using artillery to blow the hell out of everything in their way, that&#x27;s their only play,&quot; he said of the Russian military. &quot;But they&#x27;re really failing... their strategy is flawed in that they&#x27;re devoting too many resources to smaller salients and they&#x27;re not concentrated in one area. And we already have seen significant counterattacks up here by the Ukrainians.&quot;

                              <span>Activists from the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) unfurled two large banners on the Acropolis in Athens on Thursday in protest at Greece&#x27;s indirect participation in the war in Ukraine through its membership of NATO.
The banners in both Greek and English read: &quot;No to War - No Involvement - No to the Bases of Death&quot; in large letters visible from a considerable distance.
The protest came ahead of a vote in parliament on Thursday evening on extending for a further five years an agreement on military cooperation with the United States. At the end of the period, the agreement is set to become permanent, if neither party withdraws.
Ratification is seen as a formality, as Greece&#x27;s conservative government has the necessary majority. The government sees the agreement as enhancing stability and Greece&#x27;s role in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The US already has a large naval and air base at Souda on Crete, from where its planes can cover the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The US also operates two military bases in central Greece and a naval base in the port of Alexandroupolis in the north-east of the country.
The KKE, which holds 15 seats in the 300-seat parliament, has for decades demanded that Greece should withdraw from both NATO and the European Union.</span>

Retired cardinal Joseph Zen, one of the most senior Catholic clerics in Asia, was among a group of veteran democracy advocates arrested Wednesday on a charge of &quot;colluding with foreign forces&quot;.
Cantonese pop singer Denise Ho, veteran barrister Margaret Ng and prominent cultural studies scholar Hui Po-keung were also arrested, the latter at the airport as he attempted to travel to Europe to take up an academic post.
The four were detained for their involvement in a now-disbanded defense fund that helped pay legal and medical costs for those arrested in the huge and sometimes violent democracy …</span>

                              <span>The Rock, the biggest white diamond ever auctioned, sold for 21.7 million Swiss francs ($21.9 million) on Wednesday, far short of the record for such a jewel.
The 228.31-carat stone, larger than a golf ball, was sold in Geneva by Christie&#x27;s auction house.
There had been high hopes that The Rock would smash the world record for a white diamond, which stands at $33.7 million, a sum fetched in Geneva in 2017 for a 163.41-carat gem.
But the bidding, which started at 14 million Swiss francs, ground to a halt after two minutes at 18.6 million, with the price rising to 21.7 million once the buyer&#x27;s premium was added on.
The pre-sale estimate had been 19-30 million Swiss francs.
The Rock, a perfectly symmetrical pear-shaped diamond, was sold by an unnamed owner from North America. It was bought by…</span>

                              <span>With their infectious musical fusion of roots and rhythm, Ukrainian folk hiphop band Kalush Orchestra is riding a wave of goodwill at the Eurovision Song Contest this year -- while eyeing the contest&#x27;s top prize.
Tapping traditional Ukrainian folk music but mashing up an invigorating hiphop beat with a haunting, lullaby refrain, &quot;Stefania&quot; was written last year by the band&#x27;s frontman, 27-year-old rapper Oleh Psiuk, as a tribute to his mother.
But the song selected to represent Ukraine at Eurovision -- just days before Russia&#x27;s invasion -- has taken on outsized meaning for a country nearing its third month of war. It contains nostalgic lyrics such as &quot;I&#x27;ll always find my way home even if all the roads are destroyed&quot; and celebrates cultural identity and the motherland.

International tourist arrivals worldwide have more than doubled, up 130 percent in January 2022 on the same period last year, according to the latest UN World Tourism Organization figures.
Travelers are regaining confidence, and Europe and the Americas are leading the resurgence.
Worldwide, there have been 18 million additional visitors, the UNWTO said, &quot;equivalent to the total increase recorded over the whole of 2021&quot;.
In 2019, global tourism revenues reached $1.48 trillion. That figure dropped by almost two thirds due to the pandemic the following year.

                              <span>In yet another major blow for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Finland&#x27;s president and prime minister have now said that their country intends to apply for NATO membership.
In a joint statement released Thursday, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö and Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said that they believe NATO membership is essential to ensuring their nation&#x27;s security in the wake of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
&quot;As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.&quot;
Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, has traditionally stayed away from NATO membership in the interest of maintaining a diplomatic balance between Russia and other Western European nations.

Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon comments that the decision by Finland to apply for NATO membership now can only be seen as &quot;yet more blowback from Moscow’s war in Ukraine,&quot; which has also resulted in an unprecedented number of crippling sanctions that internal Kremlin forecasts show could led to a 12 percent contraction of gross domestic product this year alone.
Now that Finland is applying for NATO membership, the next question will be whether Sweden, which has also traditionally tried to remain militarily neutral between Russia and Western Europe, will follow suit.</span>

Finland joining NATO would pose a threat to Russia and will not help make the world any more secure, warns Moscow 
Moscow has warned that Finland joining NATO would pose a direct threat to Russia’s security and its acceptance to the military alliance would prompt Russia to develop measures to ensure its safety. 
That’s after Finnish officials confirmed on Thursday their commitment to join the US-led bloc and announced plans to pen a formal application later this week.   
&quot;There is a current instruction from the president to develop a list of measures to strengthen our western flanks in connection with the strengthening of NATO’s eastern flanks,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov during a daily press briefing on Thursday, adding that the expansion of NATO towards Russia’s borders will not make the world or the Eurasian continent any more secure.

   CNBC: Finland’s leaders say country should apply for NATO membership ‘without delay’ 
* Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Thursday that the country should apply to join NATO “without delay.” 
* Membership would be historic for the Nordic country, which has had a decadeslong policy of military neutrality. 
Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Thursday that the country should apply to join NATO “without delay.” 
The announcement is the strongest sign yet that Finland will make a formal application to join NATO. 
Membership would be historic for the Nordic country, which has had a decadeslong policy of military neutrality.  “Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.” the leaders said in a joint statement, adding that they hoped that “the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.”

NATO military support for Ukraine risks sparking nuclear war with Russia, Putin ally and ex-president Dmitry Medvedev warned. 
In a fiery post to nearly one million Telegram users this morning, Medvedev wrote:  &#x27;NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia. 
&#x27;Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war.&#x27;

OilPrice.com: The EU Has A Major Problem With Securing Non-Russian Gas 
* The EU is determined to wean itself off Russian gas, and its current replacement plan involves building new LNG terminals and importing gas from elsewhere. 
* This replacement plan has one major flaw, the LNG market is currently a seller&#x27;s market and importers will have to commit to long-term contracts. 
* Germany’s struggle to negotiate deliveries of LNG with Qatar is just one example of this problem, and the EU will have to alter its priorities in order to secure the gas. 
Germany has been negotiating deliveries of liquefied natural gas with Qatar as part of plans to wean itself off Russian gas, on which it is heavily dependent. 
The negotiations, reportedly, ran into a wall this week. And this wall may be what’s standing in the way of other EU gas buyers as well. 
According to unnamed sources cited by Reuters, Germany and Qatar have serious differences on issues such as the length of the contract and whether or not Germany could re-sell the gas to other European countries once it had been received.

RFE: Moscow Puts Sanctions On European Gazprom Units In Countries That Have Imposed Sanctions On Russia 
Russia has imposed sanctions against units of Gazprom Germania and dozens of other companies based in countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. 
 Under the sanctions, the 31 companies listed on May 11 by the Russian government are banned from conducting transactions and entering Russian ports. 
But it notably includes local subsidiaries of Gazprom, which supplies more than a third of European gas.

WNU Editor: Why should Russia ship natural gas to European Gasprom companies/units that were seized last month by European governments who took these institutions without compensation? 
The shock from the Western media and governments over these reciprocal sanctions being imposed on them is a sight to see. My guess is that they never expected it, and they never made the calculation on what would be the consequences if they impose sanctions on a country like Russia. 
Bottom line. 
The sanctions that the West have imposed on the Kremlin is hurting the Russian economy, but it looks like these reciprocal sanctions are probably hurting the EU even more.

Ukraine will only restart gas flows from Russia to Europe via the Sokhranivka point—which were stopped earlier this week—only when Kyiv regains full control over its gas pipelines, the head of the Ukrainian gas system operator told Reuters on Thursday. 
&quot;We won&#x27;t open. Until full control over the asset,&quot; Sergiy Makogon, head of the Ukrainian Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSOU), wrote to Reuters. 
On Tuesday, GTSOU said it would no longer be able to accept gas transit from Russia via the Sokhranivka entry point, through which nearly one-third of the Russian gas headed through Ukraine goes. 
The GTSOU said in a statement  that it could not operate at its Novopskov gas compressor station in the Russia-controlled Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine due to &quot;the interference of the occupying forces in the technical processes.&quot;

 WION: Despite sanctions, Russian ruble is the world&#x27;s top performing currency in 2022 
The ruble has recovered the majority of its losses, and Russia&#x27;s capital controls have made it the best-performing currency in the world this year, while just a few people will benefit from the boom. 
The ruble rose against the dollar again on Wednesday, as the Moscow Exchange reopened after a two-day holiday.   It has gained more than 11% versus the US dollar since the beginning of the year, surpassing the real&#x27;s 9% rise to become the biggest gainer among Bloomberg&#x27;s 31 major currencies. The offshore rate has risen considerably more, by roughly 12%.

gCaptain/Blooomberg: Greek Shipowners Kill EU’s Russian Oil Tanker Ban 
(Bloomberg) The European Union is set to soften its sanctions package on Russian oil exports after a weekend of wrangling, though it aims to keep a key shipping provision that will hinder Moscow’s ability to export its crude. 
The bloc will drop a proposed ban on EU-owned vessels transporting Russian oil to third countries, according to documents seen by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. 
Critically, a prohibition on insurance is still in the works and would remain a significant impediment to exports.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised by this development. Europe needs Russian oil one way or another. 
A prediction. 
These oil tankers will still pick up Russian oil at Russian sea ports. Make a beeline to a European port with their cargo, and while in transit this oil will be sold and resold and resold (all at a premium) to mask where this oil is coming from and to satisfy insurance requirements. In the end this Russian oil will end up in Europe, albeit at a very high cost for the European consumers. 
The big winners will be Russian oil companies, the Kremlin, and the Greek/Maltese/etc. shipping oligarchs.

USNI News: Great Wall of Naval Targets Discovered in Chinese Desert 
China has been honing its ship-killing skills for potential future conflicts on new targets in a remote desert, according to new satellite photos reviewed by USNI News. New analysis shows the People’s Liberation Army is testing the ability to hit ships in port with long-range ballistic missiles. 
Since USNI News reported China has been building aircraft carrier targets in the Takmalakan Desert, other target sites have emerged forming a string of large-scale target ranges running along the eastern edge of the desert, according to new satellite photos. Several of these are naval and two have layouts that appear to be modeled on ships in port.

Washington Times: Rumors swirl that China’s Xi Jinping will step down amid harsh COVID lockdowns  
Experts doubt reports of coup, but also see signs of discontent 
Rumors circulating in China and among overseas Chinese social media are claiming Chinese President Xi Jinping, under fire for draconian COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere, will step down from power. 
The rumors followed a meeting last week of the Party Politburo Standing Committee, the collective leadership group that rules China. They were traced in part to a Chinese-language YouTube video May 4 by Canadian-based blogger appearing under the persona “Lao Deng.” Details of the video quickly spread to social media outlets in China but were quickly censored.

The 69-year-old Russian president was seen deep in conversation during the country&#x27;s Victory Parade for an extended period of time with Dmitry Kovalev, a 36-year-old member of the Presidential Administration.

While there is little factual evidence to back up the online rumours, it does indicate attention has turned to who will take over at the Kremlin once Putin is gone.</span>

                              <span>The last thing Australia needs is for both government and opposition to be &quot;closing down options&quot; with China rather than keeping them open, says University of Melbourne’s Professor Michael Wesley.

&quot;Both sides are now sort of burnishing their national security credentials, burnishing their toughness – and what that does is remove creative possibilities for taking the relationship forward pragmatically,&quot; Prof Wesley told Sky News Australia.

He said he was not optimistic about the trajectory of Australia&#x27;s relationship with China.

&quot;We&#x27;ve needlessly blown out of proportion the significance of the China-Solomon Islands agreement – it&#x27;s very hard to walk back from that now.

&quot;I do worry that if not locked into this level of antagonism, there will certainly be a sort of a cold relationship between Australia and its major trading partner for awhile yet.&quot;</span>

The case was first published by Canada&#x27;s CTV News and has attracted condemnation from many Canadians.

   Antiwar.com: Sen. Tuberville Says US Risks War With Russia by ‘Poking the Bear’ in Ukraine 
Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) warned Tuesday that the US is risking war with Russia by “poking the bear” in Ukraine.  Tuberville made the comments during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier.
Tuberville told Haines and Berrier the US is risking escalating the war by bragging about intelligence sharing with Ukraine. 
In recent weeks, US officials claimed to the media that US intelligence has helped Ukrainian forces shoot down a plane carrying Russian troops, kill Russian generals, and sink a Russian warship.

WNU Editor: I hope Director of National Intelligence Avril Hainestell understands what the mood in Russia is right now. I know among my friends, contacts, and family members in Russia .... most of them believe Russia is now involved in a war against the U.S., and all of them there is a very good chance that with time this conflict spread outside of Ukraine.</span>

                              <span>Politico: EU tensions grow over Russian oil ban as Hungary demands exemption  
Diplomats object to plan to send cash to Hungary while Budapest says pipeline deliveries must continue. 
The European Commission is facing a backlash against plans to send funding to Hungary as part of an effort to persuade Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to agree to EU sanctions on Russian oil. 
At a meeting of senior diplomats in Brussels on Wednesday, several EU countries raised concerns about a plan to offer Hungary compensation — first reported by POLITICO — as part of a forthcoming energy strategy, diplomats said. 
The dispute reflects the increasing difficulties confronting officials in Brussels as they seek to ratchet up pressure on Moscow over the war in Ukraine.

* Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned Tuesday that the world is &quot;running out of energy capacity at all levels.&quot; 
* &quot;I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,&quot; he said at a conference. 
* A UAE official also warned that more investment is needed in the energy sector for OPEC+ to deliver sufficient supplies. 
The amount of unused capacity that the world can tap to produce more energy products is running out, warned top oil ministers.

                              <span>CNBC: Natural gas prices in Europe jump after Ukraine blocks Russian flows 
* Gas TSO of Ukraine (GTSOU) on Tuesday announced force majeure – unforeseeable circumstances that prevent the fulfilment of a contract – the first declaration of its kind since the Russian invasion. 
* It will not accept through its Sokhranivka entry point, which delivers Russian gas to Europe, from Wednesday. 
* TTF European natural gas prices were up more than 6.4% by around 9:15 a.m. London time on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv data. 
European natural gas prices jumped after Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator suspended Russian flows through a key entry point.

Newsweek: Russia Says They Will Use Nuclear Weapons on These Conditions 
The conditions for a potential nuclear strike by Russia are written in the country&#x27;s military doctrine, Russia&#x27;s Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Russia&#x27;s state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. 
Grushko had responded to a question about the likelihood of Russia using nuclear weapons against its enemies by saying that the answer was written &quot;in black and white.&quot; 
&quot;We have a military doctrine, everything is written there. It does not give any other interpretation, except for what is there in black and white,&quot; he said.

Lufthansa&#x27;s boss apologized on Wednesday for an incident in which a group of Jews was removed from a plane because of a dispute with a few individuals who failed to follow rules about wearing masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.
The apology relates to a May 4 incident. After a flight from New York to Frankfurt, during which some individuals did not comply with rules regarding masks, the airline had all members of a tour group of Orthodox Jews removed from a continuing flight to Budapest.
The airline had already issued a statement of apology on Tuesday, noting it was unfortunate that the entire group was removed when the dispute had only been with certain individuals.
&quot;We apologize to all guests, not just because they couldn&#x27;t travel further, but because their personal feelings were hurt,&quot; read the Tuesday statement.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr on Wednesday apologized to a representative of the Jewish community in Berlin, according to Lufthansa. That followed a company meeting in which Spohr told employees that such incidents cannot happen.
&quot;Anti-Semitism has no place at Lufthansa. The incidences of last Wednesday should never have happened and have to be cleared up comprehensively.&quot;</span>

But behind the scenes, things haven&#x27;t been going well. Even loyalists of Vladimir Putin are admitting that the Russian military isn&#x27;t as strong as the president thought. 
It was reported Wednesday that some Russian soldiers in Ukraine are in retreat. While it isn&#x27;t expected to last long, those soldiers who backed away left behind information that gives a guide for Putin&#x27;s ultimate goal. 
The Daily Beast reported that amid the rubble of the Ukrainian town of Trostyanets in Sumy Oblast, forces found documents showing the details about why Russia is focusing so much on attacks of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Sweden and Finland are pondering whether to join NATO following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Johnson is later expected to make a similar defense commitment to Finland, where he will meet with President Sauli Niinisto.
The agreement will “fortify northern Europe’s defenses, in the face of renewed threats,” Johnson said in a statement, adding it “is a symbol of the everlasting assurance between our nations.&quot;

During a panel discussion on CNN, host Kate Bolduan asked Anderson what he made of reports that Russia is moving more troops toward the city of Kharkiv, where the Ukrainians have had success in pushing back Russian forces who previously believed they&#x27;d had the city secured.
&quot;It suggests that to me, Kate, they&#x27;re losing and they know it,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#x27;re having to reposition their forces. They&#x27;ve been trying for six weeks now to cross the rivers and to get down to Kramatorsk. They&#x27;ve been trying to get down there but unable to do it.&quot;

&quot;They are destroying your future. They are doing it deliberately. They have been doing that for decades.&quot;
Research shared exclusively with The Guardian ahead of its formal publication identifies at least 195 &quot;carbon bombs&quot; that are either in the process of being built or already in place across the globe as scientists warn that fossil fuel use must be quickly phased out to prevent catastrophic climate outcomes.

In their third televised election debate, characterized as the &quot;final showdown&quot; before 17 million Australians cast their compulsory votes, Morrison and Labor&#x27;s Anthony Albanese got personal.
At the outset of the campaign last month, Albanese forgot both the unemployment rate and the main lending rate. More recently, he apparently had difficulty explaining his party&#x27;s disability policy.
&quot;He&#x27;s a loose unit when it comes to the economy. He makes things up as he goes along,&quot; said Morrison using a slang term for someone who is unreliable.

&quot;In a Tuesday tweet, the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management said he had dinner with a number of startup CEOs who had complained about the work ethic of young American engineers,&quot; reported Khaleda Rahman. &quot;He suggested that employers should instead look to hiring people from Ukraine as Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country continues.&quot;
But — Ackman was careful to note — companies shouldn&#x27;t go through all the trouble of bringing Ukrainians out of their war-torn country to come to the U.S. to take those jobs, but simply have them work remotely.

To be clear, I recommend hiring Ukrainian engineers virtually, not recruiting them to the US, which takes time and will drain talent from @Ukraine. We should find Ukrainians work and dignity now so they can provide for their families and country.https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1523852028241457152\u00a0\u2026

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has devastated huge sections of the country and created a massive refugee crisis, as Russian forces commit horrifying war crimes in occupied territory.

The Biden administration has committed to admitting in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, with 6,000 already approved for entry into the U.S.
Ackman&#x27;s comments also come as U.S. businesses are facing a sharp uptick in workers resigning to pursue other job opportunities, a trend known as the &quot;Great Resignation&quot; as a labor shortage causes workers to start questioning the value of working lower-pay, less-secure jobs.</span>

                              <span>The unprecedented economic sanctions leveled against Russia haven&#x27;t stopped the country from continuing its war in Ukraine -- but they have succeeded in crushing its economy.
Bloomberg reports that leaked economic forecasts from Russia&#x27;s Finance Ministry project that the Russian economy will shrink by as much as 12 percent this year as crippling economic sanctions wipe out roughly an entire decade&#x27;s worth of economic growth.
This would also mark the worst economic crisis for Russia since the 1990s when the collapse of the Soviet Union sent the country&#x27;s economy spiraling downward.
Natalia Lavrova, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, tells Bloomberg that there is no easy fix for Russia going forward.

“The main negatives are the oil embargo, the EU giving up Russian gas, along with more departures among foreign companies,” she explained. “All that will probably expand gradually, with a lot of negative carrying over in to 2023.”
Major Western nations launched sanctions against Russia earlier this year after the country launched an unprovoked war against neighboring Ukraine.
Although many intelligence experts believed Russia would be able to quickly overrun Ukraine militarily, Russia has failed to achieve its objective of taking over the capital of Kyiv and has also faced significant setbacks in its efforts to take over the eastern region of the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett however said it was &quot;likely&quot; that Palestinian gunfire killed her. 
Another Al Jazeera journalist, producer Ali al-Samudi, was wounded in the incident, the broadcaster added.
An AFP photographer said Abu Akleh was wearing a press flak jacket when she was shot. The photographer reported that Israeli forces were firing in the area and then saw Abu Akleh&#x27;s body lying on the ground.

                              <span>Tokyo will begin recognizing same-sex partnerships from November after revising current rules, officials said Wednesday, becoming the largest city in Japan to do so.
Japan is the only nation of the Group of Seven countries that does not recognize same-sex unions, and its constitution stipulates that &quot;marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes&quot;.

But in recent years, local authorities across the country have made moves to recognize same-sex partnerships, although such recognition does not carry the same rights as marriage under the law.
&quot;We collected opinions from the public for the past two months and we heard opinions (from same-sex couples) who said they want to be recognized as partners,&quot; a Tokyo government spokesman told AFP.
The metropolitan government plans to ask legislators to approve revising a local ordinance next month, and will then begin accepting applications for the certificates in October and issuing them in November.
The city is considering offering various services currently only available to married couples to those with the partnership certificate, including applying for city-administered apartments, the spokesman said.
Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya district in 2015 became the first place in Japan to begin issuing symbolic &quot;partnership&quot; certificates to same-sex couples.
Many areas have followed suit, with activists saying more than 200 municipalities now recognize same-sex partnerships, granting couples rights including the ability to visit a partner in hospital and rent property together.
In a landmark ruling last year, a court in northern Sapporo said Japan&#x27;s failure to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a verdict hailed by campaigners as a major victory.
But Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been cautious on the possibility of any legislative changes at the national level to recognize same-sex unions.
Taiwan is currently the only place in Asia with marriage equality, having taken the unprecedented step of legalizing same-sex unions in 2019.

Paraguay&#x27;s president denounced the crime as a &quot;cowardly murder&quot; and a fellow prosecutor said the modus operandi was reminiscent of &quot;the mafia.&quot;
Pecci, 45, was felled by two shots while relaxing on a beach on the idyllic tourist island of Baru, according to his wife, Paraguayan journalist Claudia Aguilera.
The couple got married on April 30 in the nearby city of Cartagena.
&quot;Two men attacked Marcelo. They came (by sea) in a small boat, or on a jet ski, the truth is I did not see well,&quot; Aguilera told the El Tiempo newspaper.

                              <span>A Hong Kong court ruled on Wednesday that prosecutors could label organizers of the city&#x27;s annual Tiananmen vigil &quot;foreign agents&quot; without having to reveal who the group is accused of working for.
The decision was made on national security grounds but those being prosecuted argue that the precedent-setting ruling makes it harder to prepare their defense ahead of trial.
For three decades, the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance held vigils commemorating victims of China&#x27;s deadly 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters in Beijing&#x27;s Tiananmen Square.
Those commemorations have been driven underground since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong following democracy protests three years ago.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka&#x27;s president urged people on Wednesday to reject what he called attempts to foment racial and religious disharmony, as clashes broke out in many parts of the country over the government&#x27;s handling of a devastating economic crisis.
Violent street protests killed eight people this week and even the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa&#x27;s elder brother as prime minister and a curfew have failed to douse public anger. The government has ordered troops to shoot at anyone damaging public property or threatening lives.
Sri Lankans have blamed the Rajapaksa dynasty for the economic meltdown that has left the country with only about $50 million in reserves, stalling most imports and leading to massive shortages of fuel, cookin…</span>

The defense, humanitarian and economic funding passed the House of Representatives by 368 votes to 57, with the two parties&#x27; leaders having already reached an agreement on the details. It will likely pass the Senate by the end of the week or next week.

                              <span>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will overhaul its espionage laws in the face of threats to national security ranging from cyber-attacks to pernicious lobbying that could undermine its economy, the country&#x27;s interior minister said on Wednesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the reforms would include the creation of a new Foreign Influence Registration Scheme, similar to ones in the United States and Australia, to reduce the risk of foreign governments damaging Britain&#x27;s interests.

Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian entry for this year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest, has made it into Saturday&#x27;s grand final in Turin.
Kalush Orchestra advanced in the first semi-final late Tuesday along with nine other countries.
The musicians from western Ukraine and their song &quot;Stefania&quot; are the favourites for overall victory at this year&#x27;s Grand Prix in the northern Italian city.
Artists from a total of 17 countries took part in the first semi- final on Tuesday.
The band has been vocal in expressing its support for Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion on social media since the armed conflict began.
Russia has been excluded from this year&#x27;s Eurovision, as has its neighbour and close ally Belarus.

                              <span>In his new tell-all book, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper criticized Ric Grenell, who became Donald Trump&#x27;s acting director of national intelligence (DNI) for a few months in 2020. 
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told members of the House Intelligence Committee Russia was already trying to interfere with the 2020 election. Trump swiftly fired Maguire and replaced him with Grenell. 
According to Esper, &quot;there were a number of people in the administration who would willingly do Trump’s bidding, and probably even his more extreme dictates, and it deeply concerned me.&quot; Grenell, he explained, was one of them. 
Trump would brag about Grenell like it was a grand strategy to force the hand of the Senate Republicans.

                              <span>Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended his invasion of Ukraine, saying it was a necessary blow against NATO. His remarks came during Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9 marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, are increasingly describing the fighting in Ukraine as a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia. We speak with the Quincy Institute’s Anatol Lieven, who says the war can only end through negotiations, and aggressive U.S. rhetoric risks prolonging the fighting. “That is a recipe for this war going on essentially forever, with colossal suffering for Ukraine,” says Lieven.

According to the British Foreign Office, UK, US and EU cyber security experts have met to assess new intelligence linking the February attack directly to the Russian state.
&quot;This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe,&quot; UK foreign minister Liz Truss said.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, confirming the US intelligence assessment of the attack, said that Russia aimed to disrupt Ukrainian command and control.

                              <span>When Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to invade Ukraine more than two months ago, he no doubt expected an easy victory from a lightning-fast assault intended to crush the smaller opposing force. This spectacular victory was meant to advance the Russian president&#x27;s vision of a new manifest destiny, bringing his country closer to re-establishing itself as an imperial power on the global stage. But Putin&#x27;s gambit failed in grand fashion. Instead of celebrating a victory on May 9 — the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II — the Russian military is trying to reorganize itself after a series of stunning defeats and great losses in both materiel and personnel.
