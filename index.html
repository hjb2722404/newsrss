RFI: &#x27;Petrodollar&#x27; at risk as TotalEnergies sells LNG to China in yuan 
Chinese and French energy companies this week finalised the first-ever deal on liquified natural gas (LNG) in China settled in the renminbi yuan currency. The trade, involving 65,000 tons of LNG imported from the United Arab Emirates, marks a major step in Beijing&#x27;s attempts to undermine the US dollar as universal &quot;petrodollar&quot; for gas and oil trade. 
Yu Jin, the general manager of the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC,) which closed the deal with TotalEnergies, says global resource procurement based on the yuan could &quot;promote the globalisation of energy trading and build a more diversified ecology.&quot;

                              <span>Fortune: One of the world’s richest men knows why Silicon Valley Bank really failed: ‘People on iPhones’ 
Since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, experts and market watchers have openly worried that the collapse of that institution, along with Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, could lead to a contagion that would spread to the rest of the financial sector. 
But the CEO of a top private equity group doesn’t think that will happen because of the specific tech-based frenzy around SVB.

“This crisis was caused by people on iPhones and other devices, hearing on social media that some bank might be in trouble,” Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman said in an interview with Bloomberg in Tokyo on Thursday. “They responded with huge withdrawals in a very short period of time, collapsing the bank.” 
Schwarzman, whose company manages $975 billion worth of assets, added that the current banking turmoil was unlike a “conventional crisis.” In SVB’s case, rather than holding risky assets, they had an imbalance of otherwise very secure bond assets that matured on a longer timeline. As the Fed hiked interest rates, the value of those bonds dipped, but would have been repaid in time if not for the bank run.

The Pentagon has ruled out the possibility of providing long-range missiles to war-hit Ukraine, citing a small stockpile as the reason. 
The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff ruled out the possibility of the Pentagon providing long-range missiles to war-hit Ukraine, citing a small stockpile as the reason. In a virtual conversation with the Defence One outlet, General Mark Milley was asked if Washington was considering to offer ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) missiles to Kyiv. The missiles have a strike range of up to 300 kilometers, according to TASS.

Russia has taken the presidency of the UN Security Council despite Ukraine urging members to block the move. 
Each of the council&#x27;s 15 members takes up the presidency for a month, on a rotating pattern. 
The last time Russia had the presidency, February 2022, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
It means the Security Council is being led by a country whose president is subject to an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes. 
The International Criminal Court - which is not a UN institution - issued the warrant for Vladimir Putin last month.

Defense One: Ukraine Victory Unlikely This Year, Milley Says 
“I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be done. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s a very difficult task,” says top U.S. general. 
Ukraine is unlikely to expel all Russian forces from its territory this year, the top U.S. officer said Friday, giving a grim reality check to the expressed goal and hopeful ambitions of policymakers, diplomats, and defense leaders from Washington to Kyiv. 
“I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely to be done in the near term for this year,” Gen. Mark Milley said Friday in an interview with Defense One. 
“Zelenskyy has publicly stated many times that the Ukrainian objective is to kick every Russian out of Russian occupied Ukraine. And that is a significant military task. Very, very difficult military task. You&#x27;re looking at a couple hundred thousand Russians who are still in Russian-occupied Ukraine. I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be done. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s a very difficult task,” the Joint Chiefs chairman said. “But that is their objective. They certainly have a right to that, that is their country. And they are on the moral high ground here.”

(Reuters) - President Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday that Russia, which has already decided to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, could if necessary put intercontinental nuclear missiles there too. 
In an annual address to lawmakers and government officials, Lukashenko said Moscow&#x27;s plans to station nuclear arms on the territory of its close ally would help protect Belarus, which he said was under threat from the West. 
&quot;I am not trying to intimidate or blackmail anyone. I want to safeguard the Belarusian state and ensure peace for the Belarusian people,&quot; Lukashenko said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Russia’s ambassadors to Latvia and Estonia, the corresponding orders have been posted on the state law website. 
Mikhail Vanin is no longer the Ambassador to Latvia, while Vladimir Lipaev was released from his post in Estonia. 
In January, Russia announced downgrading the level of diplomatic relations with Estonia. The formal reason behind this move was said to be “reduction in the size of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn”, as per the Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement. The ministry stated that Estonia’s Ambassador to Russia Margus Laidre was to leave the country by 7 February 2023.

Newsweek: Europe Close to Deciding on Peacekeeping Troops in Ukraine—Viktor Orbán 
European leaders are close to discussing whether the European Union can send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was quoted as saying on Friday. 
Orbán, a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was speaking to local radio station Kossuth Rádió on Friday morning about Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, media outlet Mandiner reported. 
Earlier in March, the Russian government mentioned Hungary as being in a group of foreign states that it said had committed &quot;unfriendly actions against Russia, its companies and citizens,&quot; despite a longstanding amicable relationship between Orbán and Putin.

&quot;Me? I&#x27;m young,&quot; she says with a smile.
&quot;Age is not something I&#x27;m interested in. There are people who are forever young, amazed by everything, and then there are people who don&#x27;t care about anything and never loved anything, even their man -- can you imagine?&quot; she adds.

(Reuters) -Twitter on Friday made public parts of the computer code that decides how the social media site recommends content, with its owner Elon Musk adding that the entirety of the code will be available in the next few weeks.
The announcement will allow users and programmers a peek into its workings and the ability to suggest modifications to the algorithm.
&quot;In the coming weeks, we will open source literally everything that contributes to showing a tweet,&quot; Musk said in a tweet on Saturday.
The company said in a blog post it had uploaded the code in two repositories on code-sharing platform Github. They include the source code for many parts of Twitter, including the recommendations algorithm which controls the tweets that users see on their timeline.

                              <span>ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis left hospital to return to the Vatican on Saturday after being treated for bronchitis, waving to wellwishers and the waiting media as he was driven away.
&quot;I wasn&#x27;t frightened, I&#x27;m still alive,&quot; he told reporters in a light-hearted comment outside the hospital before he left.
The pope, 86, was taken to Rome&#x27;s Gemelli hospital three days ago after complaining of breathing difficulties. He has responded well to an infusion of antibiotics, his medical team has said.
The pope, who marked the 10th anniversary of his pontificate in March, has suffered a number of ailments in recent years.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed on Friday that Francis was expected to take part in this weekend&#x27;s service for Palm Sunday - a major event in the Church calendar that kicks off Easter week celebrations.
Holy Week, as it is known, includes a busy schedule of rituals and ceremonies that can be physically exhausting, including a Good Friday nighttime procession by Rome&#x27;s Colosseum.
The dean of the college of cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, has said a cardinal would help the pope during the week&#x27;s celebrations and take care of altar duties.
A similar arrangement was put in place last year, when the pope sat to one side during some Easter events due to persistent knee pain, leaving it to senior cardinals to lead the Masses.

One of the charges thrown at Governor DeSantis by his opponents is rising cost of housing in Florida.  Even though Florida housing prices are a bargain compared to my former home state of California, the cost of housing (both rent and purchase), indeed, has been steadily rising over last two years. 
Frustration of longtime residents with rising costs is understandable.  Influx of wealthy people from California and New York makes Florida housing market extremely competitive.  While high tech layoffs and decreasing job opportunities brought California real estate market to a virtual standstill, Florida market is booming.

Ukrainian military officials said the renewed attacks on civilians is a sign that Russia is not doing well on the battlefield.
&quot;Having failed to achieve the desired results on the battlefield, the enemy continues to cynically terrorize the civilian population of our country,&quot; the Ukrainian General Staff&#x27;s situation report said on Friday.
Similarly Zelensky said Russia&#x27;s intended stationing of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is a sign that the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and China&#x27;s head of state Xi Jinping was not successful.

                              <span>Romanian police have arrested the leader of an American white supremacist group wanted in the United States in connection with rioting, they said Friday.
The 33-year-old was arrested on Wednesday in Bucharest, police said without identifying him.
Local media named him as Robert Rundo, who co-founded and led the Rise Above Movement.
Rundo, together with several others of the California-based group, has been accused of inciting riots at far-right political rallies, including the deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
A Bucharest court on Thursday ordered the detention of the arrested man, who faces extradition, the police statement said.
The American is &quot;wanted by the US justice for having committed crimes of conspiracy to riot and rioting activities,&quot; it added.
He &quot;allegedly conspired with other people to go to rallies of a political nature and use combative tactics and commit physical violence against individuals and groups who did not support their ideology&quot;, it said.
Romania and the United States have a reciprocal extradition treaty since 2008.
The &quot;Unite the Right&quot; march in mid-August 2017 in Charlottesville culminated in a man driving a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring 19 others.
Then president Donald Trump infamously took 48 hours to respond only to blame &quot;both sides&quot; despite overwhelming evidence that neo-Nazis were the principal source of violence.

                              <span>The work of French author Alexandre Dumas has attracted stars since the birth of cinema, through silent-era hero Douglas Fairbanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, not forgetting a certain Volodymyr Zelensky and -- almost -- The Beatles.
The 19th century writer&#x27;s popularity shows no signs of dimming -- a flashy new version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; hits French screens next week, while &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; starts filming this summer.
There have been more than 250 adaptations of his books, including popular takes on &quot;Queen Margot&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, which gave a starring role to DiCaprio in 1998.
But it is the plume-hatted musketeers that have been the most popular, stretching back to the first film version in Britain in 1898.

                              <span>By Phil Noble
HAMBURG, Germany (Reuters) - King Charles laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the allied bombing in World War Two during a visit to Hamburg&#x27;s St Nikolai memorial, the remains of a church in Germany&#x27;s northern port city severely damaged by the air raids.
The gesture comes on the last day of Charles&#x27; three-day tour of Germany, his first overseas state trip since ascending the British throne last year designed to strengthen bilateral and European ties.
It comes shortly before the 80th anniversary of the allied bombing of Hamburg in July known as &quot;Operation Gomorrah&quot; that killed some 40,000 people and destroyed swathes of the city.
In response to Nazi air raids on civilian targets in Poland and later London, the Allies dropped about 1.9 million tonnes of bombs on Germany in…</span>

Dozens of worshippers celebrating a major religious holiday on Thursday plunged into the stepwell — a stair-lined communal water source — after the floor covering it collapsed in the central city of Indore.
&quot;Thirty-five people are dead. One person is still missing. Rescue operations are on,&quot; Indore district magistrate Ilayaraja T. told AFP by phone.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday he was &quot;extremely pained&quot; by news of the accident.

President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s proposal to raise the minimum retirement age to 64 has triggered the biggest demonstrations in a generation and a fierce backlash against the government and politicians in general.

The 7.8-magnitude quake on February 6, and its aftershocks, killed more than 55,000 people and left many more in dire conditions.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said initial assessments in Turkey revealed &quot;severe damage to agriculture, including crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, as well as rural infrastructure in affected areas&quot;.
&quot;The earthquake severely impacted 11 key agricultural provinces affecting 15.73 million people and more than 20 percent of the country&#x27;s food production,&quot; it said in a statement.

The proposed law, known as the Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2023, is ready to be sent to President Yoweri Museveni, who is facing calls from the United Nations and the United States to reject it.
The bill was passed in a chaotic parliamentary session with many amendments, and neither lawmakers nor analysts are clear about what exactly the legislation dictates.
If Museveni gives his assent, anyone who engages in same-sex activity could face life imprisonment while repeat offenders could be sentenced to death, according to activists.

AFP journalists on April 2 last year discovered the bodies of at least 20 people in civilian clothing, some with their hands tied behind their backs, lying in a street of the suburb.
Zelensky said Bucha had become &quot;a symbol of the atrocities&quot; committed by Russian forces, who have been linked to the extra-judicial killings of unarmed civilians in Bucha.

NEW YORK/TAIPEI (Reuters) -The U.S. and Taiwan are closer than ever, Taiwan&#x27;s President Tsai Ing-wen told supporters during a stopover in New York that so far, according to Taipei and Washington, has not triggered unusual military actions by China.
Tsai arrived in New York on Wednesday on her way to Central America, and on her way back to Taipei next week will stop in Los Angeles where she is expected to meet U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, an interaction China has warned could lead to a &quot;serious confrontation&quot; in U.S.-China relations.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russia charged an American journalist with spying while NATO moved closer to adding Finland as a member, deepening Moscow&#x27;s tensions with the West as the war in Ukraine reached its 400th day on Friday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke in his Thursday evening video address of the &quot;tremendous path&quot; his country had taken in 400 days of resistance since Russia&#x27;s invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.
&quot;Ukraine will win at the front ... we will not leave a single trace of Russia on our land, and we will not leave any enemy unpunished either. We are preparing news about this,&quot; he said. He did not give details, but the Ukrainian military has been planning a counteroffensive.

They met a writer, a street vendor and a food importer, as well as residents trying to flee abroad.</span>

EurAsian Times: Russia To Deploy S-500 ‘Prometheus’ Air Defense Missiles To Defend Moscow As Ukrainian Strikes Become Frequent 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced earlier this month that the country would finish modernizing the missile defense systems pressed into duty to protect the capital, Moscow, by the end of this year. 
The nation will establish an air defense division and brigade, a special-purpose air and missile defense brigade, an anti-aircraft regiment with the S-350 surface-to-air missile complex, a space monitoring radar station Razvyazka and a special operations brigade for air and missile defense by 2023 end, Shoigu said. 
Starting in 2020, a significant part of Russia’s State Armament Program has focused on developing aerospace defense capabilities. Over 3.4 trillion Rubles (roughly US$44.3 billion) have been invested in the initiative since it began in 2011, with the air defense upgrade making up about 17.5% of that total.

Asia Times:  Russia to power China’s nuclear weapon ambitions

 
‘No limits’ partnership means Russia will provide China the tech and fuel it needs to tip the prevailing global nuclear bomb balance 
Russia plans to provide fast breeder nuclear reactor technology to China, an agreement that could allow Beijing to significantly grow its nuclear arsenal and tip the prevailing global balance of nuclear weapons. 
This month, Bloomberg reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping announced a long-term agreement to continue developing fast breeder nuclear reactors optimized for plutonium production for nuclear weapons. 
The report notes that in December 2022, Russia’s-state owned Rosatom nuclear power company finished transferring 25 tons of highly-enriched uranium to China’s CFR-600 nuclear reactor, which analysts say has the capacity to produce 50 nuclear warheads a year.

FOX News: Brazil, China strike trade deal agreement to ditch US dollar 
Brazil and China have reportedly struck a deal to ditch the U.S. dollar in favor of their own currencies in trade transactions. 
The deal, announced Wednesday, will enable China and Brazil to carry out trade and financial transactions directly, exchanging yuan for reais – or vice versa – rather than first converting their currencies to the U.S. dollar. 
Brazil-China

The Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil) said the new arrangement is expected to &quot;reduce costs&quot; and &quot;promote even greater bilateral trade and facilitate investment.&quot;

 Foreign Affairs: Xi Jinping Says He Is Preparing China for War

 
The World Should Take Him Seriously 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping says he is preparing for war. At the annual meeting of China’s parliament and its top political advisory body in March, Xi wove the theme of war readiness through four separate speeches, in one instance telling his generals to “dare to fight.” His government also announced a 7.2 percent increase in China’s defense budget, which has doubled over the last decade, as well as plans to make the country less dependent on foreign grain imports. And in recent months, Beijing has unveiled new military readiness laws, new air-raid shelters in cities across the strait from Taiwan, and new “National Defense Mobilization” offices countrywide. 
It is too early to say for certain what these developments mean. Conflict is not certain or imminent. But something has changed in Beijing that policymakers and business leaders worldwide cannot afford to ignore. If Xi says he is readying for war, it would be foolish not to take him at his word.

WNU Editor: To be fair. Chinese President Xi has been telling China to prepare for war for a very long time. From 2021 .... Xi Jinping orders China’s military to be ready for war ‘at any time’ (American Military News). 
But the mood in China is different this time. The U.S. and China have always had their differences, but House Speaker Pelosi&#x27;s trip to Taiwan last year was IMHO the straw that &quot;broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;. And what is worse is that I sense the lines of communication between Beijing and Washington are now being shut down, and the rhetoric only becoming more hostile and confrontational.</span>

More than 20 far-right Austrian MPs walked out of parliament during a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
The politicians from the Freedom Party (FPO) argued Mr Zelensky&#x27;s speech violated Austria&#x27;s neutrality. 
They warned ahead of the speech they would hold some form of protest against the address. 
Austria has previously said it cannot help Ukraine&#x27;s defence militarily, but does support Kyiv politically. 
In a video address, Mr Zelensky thanked Austria for its humanitarian assistance and help clearing land mines. 
He was speaking on the 400th day of Russian invasion.

He also invited MPs to travel to Ukraine for themselves and see the destruction caused.

&quot;Any U.S. citizen residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately as stated in our latest travel advisory. Those who require assistance in departing Russia should contact the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for assistance.&quot; 
A Moscow court ruled that U.S. national, and journalist for the Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich should be detained for nearly two months on suspicion of spying. 
It is believed to be the first criminal case for espionage against a foreign journalist in post-Soviet Russia, a crime punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment.

BBC: Turkey approves Finland Nato membership bid 
Finland will become the 31st member of Nato after Turkey&#x27;s parliament voted to approve its application. 
Turkey had delayed Finland&#x27;s bid to join the West&#x27;s defensive alliance for months - complaining the Nordic nation was supporting &quot;terrorists&quot;. 
Sweden, which applied to join Nato at the same time last year, is still being blocked by Ankara over similar complaints. 
Any Nato expansion needs the support of all its members. 
Finland will now be formally admitted into Nato at its next summit, taking place in July in Lithuania. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave his approval to Finland&#x27;s bid earlier in March, praising the country&#x27;s &quot;authentic and concrete steps&quot; on Turkish security.

The charges, arising from an investigation led by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, could reshape the 2024 presidential race. 
Trump previously said he would continue campaigning for the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination if charged with a crime. 
The specific charges are not yet known and the indictment will likely be announced in the coming days, the New York Times reported. Trump will have to travel to Manhattan for fingerprinting and other processing at that point.

* Trump leads DeSantis 54% to 24% in new Fox News poll 
* That is double from last month     * Pollster says voters showing their support to Trump amid indictment reports 
Donald Trump has doubled his lead in the Republican presidential primary amid reports he&#x27;ll be indicted by the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office, a new poll finds. 
Voters see the case as politically motivating, pollster Daron Shaw said, and it&#x27;s bringing them back to Trump&#x27;s corner. 
The Fox News poll found Trump has doubled his lead since February and is up by 30 points over Ron DeSantis, 54% to the Florida governor&#x27;s 24%.  Last month, Trump led DeSantis by 15 points: 43% to 28%.

Al Jazeera: Colombian rebels kill nine soldiers in blow to peace talks  
Preliminary military assessment has identified the left-wing ELN as responsible for the attack in a northern province. 
An attack by the Colombian rebel group known as the National Liberation Army (ELN) has allegedly killed nine government soldiers, in a blow to the government’s efforts to negotiate a truce with armed groups and curb violence in the country. 
The attack, one of the deadliest to occur in the last several months, took place on Wednesday in the rural state of Norte de Santander, near the border with Venezuela. It came more than two weeks after the government and the ELN held a second round of ceasefire negotiations in Mexico City.

                              <span>The United States on Thursday condemned Russia&#x27;s detention of an American journalist writing for The Wall Street Journal and said it was seeking consular access.
US officials said they were in touch with the family of detained journalist Evan Gershkovich as well as the newspaper and that the State Department had contacted Russia.
&quot;The targeting of American citizens by the Russian government is unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the strongest terms,&quot; White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
&quot;I want to strongly reiterate that Americans should heed the US government&#x27;s warning to not travel to Russia. US citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately.&quot;

                              <span>new video posted to his Truth Social platform on Thursday, former President Donald Trump went after Gov. Ron DeSantis for being purportedly disrespectful to Russian despot Vladimir Putin.
&quot;Calling Russia &#x27;a gas station with a bunch of nuclear weapons&#x27; or calling Putin a, quote, &#x27;authoritarian gas station attendant with some legacy of nuclear weapons from the old Soviet Union&#x27; is exactly the kind of simple-minded thinking that has produced decades of failed diplomacy and war,&quot; said Trump. &quot;Where is that war going? Those such as Mitt Romney and Ron DeSantis ... who insist on arrogantly treating Russia as deeply inferior to the other nations of the world, with no history or culture or pride, are not only ignorant and foolish, but that attitude makes it impossible to negotiate peace, absolutely impossible.&quot;
Trump went on to accuse DeSantis of &quot;rude&quot; treatment of Putin, even while claiming that his administration was &quot;tougher on Russia than any administration before.&quot;
&quot;This kind of neocon rhetoric mocking Russia&#x27;s nuclear weapons, along with implying that Putin must be tried and presumably executed as a war criminal, only increases the risk of deadly, nuclear escalation,&quot; said Trump, parroting a frequent Kremlin talking point.

In fact, it is Russia that has made unprovoked threats of nuclear war, in response to the lack of progress in their assault on Ukraine.
This comes after DeSantis, who came under fire from fellow Florida Republicans for dismissing the Ukraine invasion as a &quot;territorial dispute&quot; the United States can&#x27;t be perpetually involved in, backpedaled and put out a statement fiercely criticizing Putin.</span>

                              <span>JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon will testify about his bank allegedly profiting from Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, Law&amp;Crime reported. 
According to the Virgin Islands government, Dimon knew about Epstein’s crimes by at least 2008, which was the year Epstein was convicted. JPMorgan has insisted that Dimon is “not relevant” to the lawsuit, saying that he wasn’t involved in any decisions related to Epstein’s account.
Senior U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has denied the bank&#x27;s motions to dismiss the case, saying there&#x27;s sufficient evidence that JPMorgan knew Epstein was sex trafficking minors while they were doing business with him.
&quot;Since being sued, JPMorgan filed a third-party lawsuit against their former senior executive Jes Staley, who later became the CEO of Barclays Bank. Staley has been under pressure after British regulators scrutinized the 1,200 emails that were exchanged with Epstein from 2008 through 2012,&quot; Law&amp;Crime&#x27;s report stated. &quot;The communications showed that Staley appeared to visit Epstein’s island Little St. James, while Epstein was still incarcerated. Epstein sent Staley multiple emails with photographs of a young woman, and regulators say he sent transfers of money to women with Eastern European surnames timed around Staley’s visits to his properties.&quot;

The Virgin Islands government argues that JPMorgan can’t make Staley the scapegoat for everything. 
“If Staley is a rogue employee, why isn’t Jamie Dimon?” Virgin Islands attorney general’s private counsel Mimi Liu asked on March 16, saying the key question in the litigation isn’t “whether or not Mr. Staley raped any young women in the Virgin Islands.”
“The question is: What did he know?” Liu continued. “And Jamie Dimon knew in 2008 that his billionaire client was a child sex trafficker. Staley knew, Dimon knew, JPMorgan knew.”

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
