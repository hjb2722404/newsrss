“Part of the problem is that the country is so polarised,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“Republican voters by and large are fervently pro-gun that it does prevent any kind of action like this from happening … it took an enormous amount of arm-twisting just to get the sixty votes in the senate.”</span>

DW: Russia targets EU, cutting off Kazakhstan&#x27;s oil exports 
This week, Moscow halted crude oil exports from Kazakhstan via a Black Sea port. Kazakhstan is the EU&#x27;s fifth-largest supplier and this effectively reduces oil imports. 
The search is now on for alternative routes.  In a telephone conversation on July 4, Kazakhstan&#x27;s president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev assured EU Council President Charles Michel of his country&#x27;s support in helping the 27-nation bloc overcome its current energy crisis. 
Only a day later, a district court in Novorossiysk — Russia&#x27;s biggest Black Sea port — ordered a pipeline coming from Kazakhstan and exporting oil to Europe shut for a month.

NASA has issued a fierce condemnation of the Russian space agency after three cosmonauts displayed anti-Ukraine propaganda aboard the International Space Station. 
The trio were seen holding flags of the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic — two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine that are only recognised as independent states by Moscow and Syria. 
They also said the capture of the region was &#x27;a liberation day to celebrate both on Earth and in space.&#x27;

Reuters: Taiwan slams &#x27;provocative&#x27; China for sending fighters across Taiwan Strait 
TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese fighter jets crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday in what the island&#x27;s government slammed as a provocation, as a senior U.S. senator visited Taipei for a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen that China condemned. 
China claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up military and political pressure to try and force the island to accept Chinese rule. 
Taiwan&#x27;s Defence Ministry said the Chinese aircraft &quot;intentionally crossed the median line of the strait in a provocative move, which has seriously damaged regional peace and stability&quot;.

RT: Kremlin clarifies Putin’s remark on Ukraine  
Russia is using ‘only a fraction’ of its military capability in the neighboring country, spokesman said  
President Vladimir Putin’s observation that Russian troops in Ukraine “haven’t even really started anything yet” simply states that Moscow is far superior in its military strength, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified on Friday. 
On Thursday, Putin dared Western leaders who seek Russia’s defeat on the battlefield in Ukraine to deliver on the threat. “Let them try. We haven’t even really started anything yet,” he claimed. 
The president “simply reminded [his audience] that the military potentials [of Ukraine and Russia] were incommensurable,” Peskov said. 
“Russian strength is so vast that only a small fraction of it is engaged in the special military operation,” the official said.  Western expectations that Ukraine can defeat Russia militarily are “absurd and only add to the suffering of the Ukrainian people,” he added.

The US wants to launch attacks from Poland and the Baltic states, military intelligence chief claimed  
The US is making plans for a direct war against Russia and its ally Belarus, the head of Belarusian military intelligence warned on Thursday. The scenario is becoming more likely as the proxy war in Ukraine and other ways to hurt the two nations are failing, he claimed. 
“The territory of Poland as well as the Baltic states is being turned into a staging ground, from which the US plans to unleash a new bloody conflict in Europe, targeting the Russian Federation and its allies,” 
Major General Ruslan Kosygin said.

 On Wednesday, Reuters revealed that more than 5 million barrels of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves were sent overseas as part of President Joe Biden’s latest release initiated in March. 
Some of that oil went to India, some to the Netherlands, and some was sent to China where the president’s son has engaged in years of potentially criminal business activity embroiling the Biden White House in scandal since the 2020 campaign.

CNN: Biden will rescind Afghanistan’s designation as a major non-NATO ally 
CNN — President Joe Biden in a letter to Congress on Wednesday said that he will officially rescind Afghanistan’s designation as a major non‑NATO ally. 
In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the President wrote: “In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent to rescind the designation of Afghanistan as a Major Non‑NATO Ally.” 
In 2012, the United States named Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally, which cleared the way for the two countries to maintain a defense and economic relationship. Then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the designation during a visit to Kabul.

Members of Canada&#x27;s military will soon be soldiering under much less strict dress rules as the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) introduces updated regulations on personal grooming. 
Under the new rules — which were released Tuesday and go into effect in September — CAF will allow military personnel to, among other things, colour their hair and grow it to any length, and to sport face tattoos.
&quot;The bottom line is, the Canadian Forces Dress Instructions are about fifty years old and so the policy as a whole was overdue for revision,&quot; says a Department of National Defence (DND) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page detailing the update.

Abe, 67, was perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history. He left the PM job in 2020 but remained highly influential. https://t.co/0UDzNS6Go4 pic.twitter.com/ZEBcld9LGh

                              <span>National Interest: Did Russia Take Out Ukrainian HIMARS Missile Launchers? 
Ukrainian military officials rejected Russia’s claims as “fake.”  The Russian military claimed on Wednesday that it destroyed two High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) missile launchers in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region.
“In the area of the village of Malotaranovka, high-precision air-launched missiles destroyed two US-made HIMARS multiple missile launchers and two ammunition depots for them,” announced Russia’s Defense Ministry, according to Russian news outlet RIA Novosti. 
The Defense Ministry reportedly added that a radar station for a Ukrainian S-300 missile system was destroyed in southern Ukraine. Malotaranovka is located to the south of Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region that sits on the path of Russia’s ongoing offensive in the Donbass region.

WNU Editor: I do not know if these HIMARS systems have been destroyed. The Russian Ministry of Defense has posted what appears to be a Ukrainian HIMARS system and support vehicles being wiped out, but the video was taken from a distance and it is hard to determine what exactly is being destroyed (link here). 
But I would not be surprised if these systems will be knocked out very quickly. I have been told by a regular reader of this blog that these HIMARS launch a very unique missile, and when they are fired they can be quickly spotted by the Russian military.

The launch was intended to test the Mk21A reentry vehicle that will carry the Mk87-1 nuclear warhead on the Minuteman III ICBM’s replacement.  
Late last night an unarmed test of the Air Force’s new Mk 21A intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) reentry vehicle quickly ended with an explosion 11 seconds after launch at Vandenberg Space Force base in California. 
Nobody was injured, but the failure is a setback for the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM program that is intended to replace the aging LGM-30 Minuteman III.

The president cautioned Russia’s rivals against attempting to defeat it on the battlefield  
Russia is ready to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, warning that those who reject such prospects should realize that prolonging the ongoing conflict would only make such talks more difficult. 
“We do not refuse to negotiate peace, but those who refuse should know that the longer they do, the more difficult it will be to negotiate,” Putin said, issuing a warning to those who might think Russia has already exhausted its capabilities amid the conflict.

Daily Mail: Royal Navy reveals it seized Iranian missiles after high-speed pursuit of smugglers&#x27; speedboats in Wildcat helicopters 
* Weapons confiscated in the operation include missiles which breach UN Security Council resolution 2216 
* One of these missiles has a range of over 600m/s and is of the same variety used in the deadly attack on Abu Dhabi  in January 2022 which killed three civilians 
* This is the first time a British Naval ship has intercepted vessels carrying such sophisticated and advanced weaponry from Iran 
* The weapons were thought to be on their way to Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen 
The Royal Navy has revealed one of its warships, the HMS Montrose, seized a stash of deadly weapons off the Iranian coast earlier this year. 
The first-of-its-kind raid took place after helicopter crews noticed smuggler vessels acting suspiciously while on patrol in international waters. 
A number of the weapons seized from the hoard violate a UN Security Council resolution namely surface-to-air-missiles and engines for land attack cruise missiles. 
It is thought the weapons were being transported to Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen.

                              <span>Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham says Trade Minister Don Farrell’s suggestion of “compromises” with Chinese trade demands is “erroneous”. 

Mr Birmingham said he was concerned about Mr Farrell suggesting compromises with China concerning trade demands. 

“Talk of compromise by Senator Farrell was erroneous language on his part,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“What we should be expecting to see is that all of the terms of the Australia-China free trade agreement are upheld in letter and in spirit.”</span>

                              <span>CNN Reporter Bianca Nobilo says Tory Party leadership contests are “always notoriously unpredictable”. 

The Conservative party is preparing to replace the British Prime Minister after he resigned from leadership. 

“One of the most captivating and exciting things about the leadership race is it’s wide open,” she told Sky News Australia.  

“This time, the field is quite varied. We have people from the far right of the party who are Brexiteers to former defence ministers who took part in reality TV shows about diving here in the United Kingdom. 

“There’s no way to say at this point who’s going to be filling Boris Johnson’s shoes in a few months.”</span>

The meetings will be between ministers of foreign affairs, defence, finance, and climate change.  

“I don&#x27;t underestimate the value and importance and signal of the fact that we have brought the climate portfolio into those annual bilateral exchanges,” she said during a media conference on Friday.  

“Because it&#x27;s so obvious to us that there are ways that we can work together, not only between New Zealand and Australia but together in the work that we want to do within our own region of the Pacific to play our part and step up our role.”</span>

Mr Wood said there was no “run-away favourite” to succeed Mr Johnson. 

“Perhaps what the conservatives need is a safe pair of hands,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That is the anti-thesis of what Boris Johnson has brought.”</span>

The Guardian: Ukraine summons Turkish envoy after ‘stolen’ grain ship allowed to leave port  
Kyiv protests over ‘unacceptable situation’ as Russian-flagged ship sails from Karasu, where it had been impounded 
Ukraine has summoned the Turkish ambassador after it said Turkey had allowed a Russian-flagged ship carrying what it has claimed was thousands of tonnes of stolen Ukrainian grain to leave the port of Karasu. 
“We regret that Russia’s ship Zhibek Zholy, which was full of stolen Ukrainian grain, was allowed to leave Karasu port despite criminal evidence presented to the Turkish authorities,” said the foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko. “Turkey’s ambassador in Kyiv will be invited to Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs to clarify this unacceptable situation.”

* She told the judge: &#x27;I&#x27;d like to plead guilty, your honor. But there was no intent. I didn&#x27;t want to break the law&#x27; 
* Griner&#x27;s legal plea could be a defense strategy. Russian criminal trials are notoriously difficult for defendants, and experts have speculated that Griner could face retribution from authorities if she were to plead innocent

   Newsweek: White House Says Economy is Strongest in History 
The White House said the U.S. economy is the strongest it has ever been, even as Americans struggle to keep up with rising food and gas costs. 
During Thursday&#x27;s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden &quot;understands what the American people are going through&quot; amid inflation and high prices. 
Fox News&#x27;s Peter Doocy asked about a recent poll that found 88 percent of people think the U.S. is &quot;on the wrong track.&quot; 
Jean-Pierre responded that the White House knows the American people are &quot;feeling&quot; the high costs, but assured reporters that the U.S. economy is doing well. 
&quot;We stronger economically than we have been in history,&quot; she said, pointing to decreasing unemployment numbers and new jobs creation.

                              <span>Reuters: War Looms Large Over G20 Event as Russia Meets Rivals in Bali 
NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - G20 foreign ministers head to a joint summit on Friday that will put some of the staunchest critics of Russia invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, in the first such meeting since the war started in February. 
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Europe, the United States and Australia stressing there will be no &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum, without saying what that might entail. 
Russia&#x27;s invasion has cast a cloud over Indonesia&#x27;s presidency of the Group of 20 largest economies this year, with speculation of boycotts from some members and a walkout in April at a finance ministers&#x27; meeting in Washington.

                              <span>Reuters: Oil from U.S. reserves sent overseas as gasoline prices stay high 
HOUSTON (Reuters) -More than 5 million barrels of oil that were part of a historic U.S. emergency reserves release to lower domestic fuel prices were exported to Europe and Asia last month, according to data and sources, even as U.S. gasoline and diesel prices hit record highs. 
The export of crude and fuel is blunting the impact of the moves by U.S. President Joe Biden to lower record pump prices. 
Biden on Saturday renewed a call for gasoline suppliers to cut their prices, drawing criticism from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Global Times: ‘Chinese espionage’ remarks by US and UK intelligence officials pure shadow chasing: embassy 
The spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the UK stated on Thursday that China strongly condemns and firmly disapproves of the fictitious allegations created against China by US and UK intelligence officials.
The so-called cases they listed, including &quot;stealing&quot; Western technology and interfering and interfering in a congressional election in the US, are pure shadow chasing as well as the typical example of a thief crying &quot;catch thief,&quot; the spokesperson added.

                              <span>The resignation of Boris Johnson as Tory leader after ministers and MPs made clear his position was untenable has led to much discussion over who could replace him. Bookmakers are currently making Rishi Sunak - who quit as Chancellor only two days ago - and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab joint favourites at 4/1. But there are a series of other potential frontrunners to replace Mr Johnson as Prime Minister, such as Penny Mordaunt and Ben Wallace who are both at 5/1. Others on the list include Sajid Javid - the most experienced candidate having served as Home Secretary and Chancellor - and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss at 7/1. Also in the running is Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi at 8/1 and Jeremy Hunt at 10/1. It comes as a YouGov survey of 716 Tory party members shows a diverse field in the ra…</span>

* Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov hit out at pro-Ukraine Boris Johnson 
* He pleaded for a replacement who can &#x27;make decisions through dialogue&#x27; 
* Tycoon Oleg Deripaska said it was an &#x27;inglorious end&#x27; for a &#x27;stupid clown&#x27; 
* EU&#x27;s Guy Verhofstadt rejoiced, saying the PM&#x27;s reign &#x27;ends in disgrace&#x27; 
World leaders and bureaucrats have started to gloat at the demise of Boris Johnson, with the Kremlin declaring today: &#x27;He doesn&#x27;t like us, we don&#x27;t like him either.&#x27; 
The prime minister, who announced his resignation this afternoon, has made a number of enemies during his time in government, especially in the EU as a leading Brexiteer and in Russia due to his staunch support for Ukraine. 
This morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: &#x27;We would like to hope that some day in Great Britain more professional people who can make decisions through dialogue will come to power.

The temptation to use them against a Ukraine base or command center in the event that the Kremlin&#x27;s military objectives are stalled or being pushed back on the ground will be overwhelming for Putin to authorize. 
Bottom line.
The risk is very low, but it is not zero.</span>

Euronews: Euro sculpture in Frankfurt to be auctioned off amid vandalism and high maintenance costs 
The iconic euro sculpture outside the former European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters in Frankfurt will be auctioned after owners said it has become too expensive to maintain. 
Some 14-metres tall, the big blue sculpture currently belongs to the non-profit association Frankfurter Kultur Komitee (FraKK), but will now be sold off to the highest bidder later in the year. 
 In a statement, FraKK said financing from private sponsors was &quot;no longer sufficient&quot; for the 50-tonne steel sculpture to be kept in a &quot;safe condition&quot;.

Ukraine says confiscated Russian assets should pay for Kyiv recovery plan 
Ukraine on Monday announced a $750 billion plan to rebuild the war-torn nation and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the international community to join &quot;the greatest contribution to the maintenance of global peace.&quot; 
Zelenskyy argued that Ukraine’s recovery was vital for not only Ukrainians but for the preservation of democracies worldwide. 
 &quot;The reconstruction of Ukraine is not a local project, is not a project of one nation, but a common task of the entire democratic world — all countries, all countries who can say they are civilized,&quot; he said during the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. &quot;Restoring Ukraine means restoring the principles of life, restoring the space of life, restoring everything that makes humans human.&quot;

WNU Editor: $750 billion !?!?!?!?!? 
But it gets better.  Kyiv says it needs $65 billion now on top of the $750 billion .... Ukraine Puts Its Immediate Funding Needs at Up to $65 Billion (Bloomberg). 
Here is an easy prediction.
If the West does pony-up $750 billion, only a small portion will actually be used to rebuild the country. The rest will be laundered away.</span>

Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin had a furious telephone bust-up just four days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, a bombshell recording has revealed. 
The French president blasted his counterpart over suggestions he should negotiate with pro-Russian separatists, exclaiming at one point: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know where your lawyers learned the law!&#x27; 
The tense exchange ended with Putin declaring he is in the gym about to play ice hockey after brushing off requests to hold a meeting with Joe Biden.

Tenth of world’s population now chronically undernourished, with spectre of widespread famine drawing ever closer, warns report 
The number of people going hungry in the world has risen by 150 million since the start of the Covid pandemic, the UN has said, warning that the food crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks pushing the worst-hit countries into famine. 
Globally, the number suffering from chronic undernourishment rose to as many as 828 million last year, a rise of about 46 million on the previous year, and three times that increase if measured since the world shut down due to Covid, a report has found.

Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN)Sri Lanka is &quot;bankrupt,&quot; Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Tuesday, as the country suffers its worst financial crisis in decades, leaving millions struggling to buy food, medicine and fuel. 
Wickremesinghe told lawmakers that negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revive the country&#x27;s &quot;collapsed&quot; economy are &quot;difficult,&quot; because the South Asian nation of 22 million has entered the talks as a bankrupt country, rather than a developing one. 
&quot;We are now participating in the negotiations as a bankrupt country. Therefore, we have to face a more difficult and complicated situation than previous negotiations,&quot; Wickremesinghe said in parliament.

The heads of UK and US security services have made an unprecedented joint appearance to warn of the threat from China. 
FBI director Christopher Wray said China was the &quot;biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security&quot; and had interfered in politics, including recent elections. 
MI5 head Ken McCallum said his service had more than doubled its work against Chinese activity in the last three years and would be doubling it again. 
MI5 is now running seven times as many investigations related to activities of the Chinese Communist Party compared to 2018, he added.

Russian forces took a key region in eastern Ukraine over the weekend, thanks in part to Moscow stepping up its coordination and war planning, according to a British intelligence assessment released on Tuesday. 
This change in Russian forces’ approach to fighting in Eastern Ukraine could be the early signs of a brand new—and worrying—phase in Russia’s devastating war in Ukraine. 
While Ukrainian officials first denied that they had lost Lysychansk, one of the last strongholds in Eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk, Ukrainian forces confirmed Sunday they withdrew from the area. 
Russian forces took over Sunday and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared victory on Monday.

It led foreign policy experts to fear that the invasion was part of a larger war of genocide.
By the end of May, Russian state TV was threatening to invade Poland. Now that the war has been going on for 131 days, a Daily Beast report cited Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hinted that the next war will be against Europe as a whole. 
“The time has come for the forgetful Europe to give itself a moral cleansing,” Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state television&#x27;s BelTA.
Lukashenko talked about fighting Nazis in World War II, known to Russians as the “Great Patriotic War,” and said that their efforts aren&#x27;t over.

                              <span>While the United States Catholic bishops continue a debate over whether politicians should get communion, another group of bishops is working on making desperate deals with drug traffickers, Vice News said citing Mexican newspaper Milenio. 
“There is a need for a social pact,” said Bishop Sigifredo Noriega. “A pact where even the bad guys could have a say.”
The &quot;bad guys&quot; he&#x27;s talking about are organized crime groups that have been increasing decades-long violence in Mexico. The Catholic church is estimated to have multiple billions of dollars but they&#x27;re not about to use it for a holy war against the drug cartels in Central America. 
Two priests were killed last month in church and they are searching for solutions. The assumption seems to be that giving them &quot;a say&quot; might persuade the narcos to work cooperatively within the community to traffick their drugs without so many murders.

&quot;The bishop of Zacatecas suggested &#x27;directly speaking&#x27; with members of organized crime,&quot; said the report. It explained, &quot;Zacatecas is one of Mexico’s states most affected by violence related to drug trafficking, and is leading in the ranking on murders this year.&quot;

Father Javier Campos was 79 years old when he was murdered and Father Joaquín Mora was 80. Their deaths are said to be a result of drug boss José Noriel Portillo “El Chueco” (of the Sinaloa Cartel) chased a tourist guide into the church. The priests tried to protect the man but they were all three killed, said Chihuahua state authorities. They were then dumped two days later about 125 miles from the church. 
&quot;The murder of the Jesuit priests reinforces the call to examine the security strategy in Mexico, as we are experiencing a wave of historical violence: the number of murders so far this six-year term exceeds 122,000 people,&quot; the Archdiocese of Mexico said in an editorial.

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s finance and health ministers resigned on Tuesday, in what looked to be the final blow for Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s premiership after he had tried to apologize for the latest scandal to dog his administration.
Both finance minister Rishi Sunak and health minister Sajid Javid resigned in what appeared to be a choreographed release of letters to the prime minister, in which both took aim at his ability to run an administration that adhered to standards.
The resignations came as Johnson was apologising for what he said was a mistake for not realizing that a former minister in charge of pastoral care was unsuitable for a job in government after complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him.
Both had formerly publicly supported Johnson during months of scandal over his administration&#x27;s conduct and a damning report into parties at his Downing Street office and residence that broke strict COVID-19 lockdown rules.
Sunak, who had reportedly clashed with the prime minister in private about spending, said: &quot;For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly.&quot;
&quot;However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognize this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.&quot;
Javid said many lawmakers and the public had lost confidence in Johnson&#x27;s ability to govern in the national interest.
&quot;I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too,&quot; Javid said in a letter to Johnson.

                              <span>Russian state TV host Olga Skabeeva has in the past signaled that she wants to see former President Donald Trump back in the White House in 2024 -- but now she&#x27;s apparently having second thoughts.
The Daily Beast&#x27;s Julia Davis has posted new video showing Skabeeva taking a more critical eye toward Trump because he is apparently no longer so eager to heap slavish praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
&quot;The other day, Trump promised to destroy the Russian Federation, to destroy Putin&#x27;s hegemony, as he put it,&quot; she said. &quot;Now we have to think whether to re-install him again as the American president! We haven&#x27;t decided yet.&quot;
This is quite the tone shift from earlier in the year when Skabeeva openly called on Trump to run for president again and promised he would once again receive help from Russia&#x27;s government, just as he did in 2016 when Russian spies hacked into the Democratic National Committee and leaked tranches of emails timed to deal damage to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign.

&quot;Donald already declared that he will become the 47th president of America and will figure things out with Russia and Putin,&quot; she said this past January. &quot;Donald, we&#x27;re waiting for you and are ready to elect you again.&quot;
At the start of Russia&#x27;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine this past February, Trump praised Putin&#x27;s military strategy as &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;very savvy&quot; despite the fact that it has led to tens of thousand Russian army casualties, a massive contraction of the Russian economy, and the expansion of NATO to Sweden and Finland.

                              <span>German police believe a home-made bomb could have caused an explosion at the offices of the hard-left Die Linke political party in western Germany, according to dpa sources.
Police in the city of Oberhausen found evidence of a home-made explosive device that was built using &quot;flash explosives&quot; like those contained in fireworks, the sources said.
An explosion at around 3:20 am (0120 GMT) destroyed the windows of the Die Linke party office. It also partially destroyed the interiors of the shops including a hairdressers and a travel agent.
Yusuf Karacelik, parliamentary group leader of the party in Oberhausen, said in a written statement on Tuesday that he assumed it was a &quot;targeted attack from the right.&quot;
Speaking to dpa, Karacelik called it a &quot;right-wing terrorist attack.&quot;
National party leader Janine Wissler also said she believed there could be a right-wing political motive behind the blast.
There are currently no indications of who carried out the suspected bombing. A police spokesperson said that they were investigating all possible leads and that a political motivation could not be ruled out.

                              <span>In response to growing tension with Israel over its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has ordered the Jewish Agency to cease all operations in the country, The Jerusalem Post reports. 
The move could greatly undermine the ability of Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel, of which thousands have already secured the paperwork to do so, but the sanctions on Russia have caused most international airlines to stop flying to the country.
Sources in Russia&#x27;s Jewish community told the Post that &quot;people from the Jewish community have been feeling the Iron Curtain setting on them and they fear they won&#x27;t be able to escape the country&quot; and that &quot;a number of Jews have said that the Russian authorities are trying to arrest them and that they fear for their lives.&quot;
The Jewish Agency works to facilitate aliyah from Jewish communities around the world. If the organization is blocked in Russia, it will be the first time in the past 30 years that aliyah efforts are banned in the country.

&quot;I was updated this morning regarding the decision of the Russian Ministry of Justice. As is well known, the Jewish Agency is a central arm of the government and the ministry for the assistance of the immigration of Jews from all over the world to the State of Israel,&quot; Aliyah and Integration Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata said in response to the move. 
&quot;We must ensure that their scope of operation is maintained as it has been throughout the years. I appealed to the Prime Minister to work with the Moscow administration to resolve the problem and I want to strengthen the Jewish community in Russia, which must be worried at this time about the consequences of the decision. Aliyah is a basic right for the Jews of Russia and we will make sure that it is preserved as such.&quot;</span>

                              <span>President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered Russian troops to press their offensive deeper into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine after Moscow&#x27;s forces seized the strategic city of Lysychansk.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin at a meeting that Moscow&#x27;s forces were now in full control of the Lugansk region.
In a sign there would be no let-up in the fighting and that Russia now had its eyes on the entire Donetsk region, Putin told Shoigu that troops stationed there must continue their operations.
&quot;Military units, including the East group and the West group, must carry out their tasks according to previously approved plans,&quot; Putin said.
&quot;I hope that everything will continue in their direction as has happened in Lugansk so far.&quot;

                              <span>A hacker claiming to have stolen personal data from hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens is now selling the information online.
A sample of 750,000 entries posted online by the hacker showed citizens&#x27; names, mobile phone numbers, national ID numbers, addresses, birthdays and police reports they had filed.
AFP and cybersecurity experts have verified some of the citizen data in the sample as authentic, but the scope of the entire database is hard to determine.
Advertised on a forum late last month but only picked up by cybersecurity experts this week, the 23-terabyte database -- which the hacker claims contains the records of a billion Chinese citizens -- is being sold for 10 bitcoin (approximately $200,000).

                              <span>Rain-swollen rivers spilled mud-brown waters across swathes of Sydney on Tuesday, swamping homes and roads while forcing thousands to flee.
Emergency services have now instructed about 50,000 people to evacuate or to prepare to escape the rising waters in New South Wales, officials said.
Emergency workers carried out 22 flood rescues in Sydney overnight, they said, with the support of 100 army troops deployed to the state.
The floods, heavy rain and powerful winds led to power cuts for 19,000 homes, officials said.
Australia has been at the sharp end of climate change, with droughts, deadly bushfires, bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef and floods becoming more common and intense as global weather patterns change.

One fresh-faced young man is smartly dressed in a bow tie and Trilby hat. A woman, perhaps his wife or sister, stands to his right looking sideways at the camera.
Nervous anticipation is written over both their faces.
But the identity of the well-dressed people on the platform at London&#x27;s Waterloo station, waiting for their new lives to begin, has been a mystery.
Now, a search has been launched to identify the young couple and others who arrived that day in 1962.

                              <span>Italy declared a state of emergency in five northern regions and announced emergency funds on Monday over a worsening drought that has plagued the Po Valley in recent weeks.
The cabinet approved a state of emergency in five regions—Friuli-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Piedmont and Veneto—until December 31, the government said in a statement that also announced a 36.5 million-euro ($39.5 million) fund to help those affected.
Italy is facing an unusually early heatwave and a lack of rainfall, particularly in the northern agricultural Po Valley, which has been hit by its worst drought in 70 years.
The state of emergency provides “extraordinary means and powers” to help guarantee public safety, compensation for losses while seeking to guarantee normal living conditions for those in the area.
According to the country’s largest agricultural union, Coldiretti, the drought threatens more than 30 percent of national agricultural production, and half of the farms in the Po Valley, where Parma ham is produced.
Lakes Maggiore and Garda were also hit by lower than normal water levels for this time of year, while further south the Tiber River, which runs through Rome, also dropped.
The Po represents the peninsula’s largest water reservoir, much of which is used by farmers.
In recent days, several municipalities have announced restrictions.

Verona, a city of a quarter of a million people, has rationed the use of drinking water, while Milan has announced the closure of its decorative fountains.
Another consequence of the drought is that hydroelectric power production has fallen sharply.
Hydroelectric plants, mostly in the mountainous north of the country, account for nearly 20 percent of national energy production.
The announcement comes a day after at least seven people died after a glacier collapsed in the Italian Alps which Prime Minister Mario Draghi said was “without doubt” linked to global warming.

As the Kremlin presses ahead with its military intervention in the pro-Western country, more and more Russians are turning to astrologers.
In Russia&#x27;s second city of Saint Petersburg, bespectacled Elena Korolyova receives clients in her apartment, where two cats prowl between piles of books.
&quot;People want to know what will become of Russia, cut off from the rest of world,&quot; the 63-year-old told AFP.
Astrologers, psychics and mediums have for years been popular in Russia, and particularly turbulent years have seen demand for their services increase.
As the country reels from a barrage of unprecedented sanctions over Ukraine, more and more Russians are turning to astrology as they peer into the future.

The largely French-speaking province is working to set up the world&#x27;s first specialized court for cases of sexual violence and domestic abuse, which experts hope will help build confidence that the legal system is not turning a blind eye to such incidents.
&quot;Today, women are afraid they will not be believed. They are afraid of the questions they will face, and the curt nature of the attorneys interrogating them,&quot; says Julie Desrosiers, the co-chair of a committee of experts tasked with looking at the issue.

                              <span>The future of Team USA, regardless of what happens in Mexico, remains a bit of an incomplete picture.  Morgan, who scored twice on Monday, and Megan Rapinoe both received their first call-ups to the squad since October for the Concacaf event.  But Morgan, 33, is already defending his position against rising stars like Catarino Macario, who is currently out with a knee injury.  And young forwards like Mallory Pugh, Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman all play in the same position as Rapinoe, who turned 37 on Tuesday.
“It’s not easy being a striker in the United States right now,” Andonovski said when he announced his Concacaf Championship roster.  “Obviously it’s great, but it’s not easy because the competition is getting bigger and bigger.
Similar battles are playing out on the pitch at every position, in every roster decision, as the United States go from a roster that has taken them to two consecutive World Cup titles to one that could take it to one. third against regional rivals like Canada, the reigning Olympic gold medalistand European contenders like Sweden, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and England – among others – who contest the European championship this month.
The Americans’ remaining group stage schedule includes matches against Jamaica (Thursday) and Mexico (Monday).  Canada leads Group B, which includes Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Panama.  The final will take place on July 18.
To achieve this, Andonovski will rely on a mix of experience, talent and generations at his disposal: of the 23 players in the American squad, seven are in their thirties but eight are 25 or younger.  And so far, he hasn’t made any promises to anyone.
“It doesn’t mean that all these players who have done well in the past are just going to come back here at the next camp because they did well a year or two years ago,” Andonovski said in February, when a the previous list also omitted several accomplished veterans.

In its week of July 4 Onchain reportGlassnode analysts said June saw Bitcoin have one of its worst performing months in 11 years, with a loss of 37.9%.  He added that activity on the Bitcoin network is at levels concurrent with the deepest part of the bear market in 2018 and 2019, writing:

“The Bitcoin network is approaching a state where nearly all speculative entities and market tourists have been completely purged from the asset.”

However, despite the almost complete purge of “tourists”, Glassnode noted significant levels of hoarding, saying the prawn sales – those holding less than 1 BTC, and whales –…</span>

                              <span>California, which once updated its cumulative case and death counts every weekday, now does so only twice a week.  In Florida, case and death data are released only once every two weeks.  As recently as last week, many other public testing sites shut down Alaska, Colorado and Rhode Island;  Iowa is closing many sites by the end of next week.
Recent virus numbers have wobbled during holidays like Memorial Day and Juneteenth, during which many states often pause reporting and then restart tracking afterwards, a trend that is sure to continue this week. after the 4th of July holiday weekend.
“Tracking the daily test tally is less informative than it used to be,” Dr Adalja said, citing the strong link between cases and hospitalizations in the past.  Today’s numbers shouldn’t be treated like checking a sports team’s daily standings or scores, he added.
“I think testing plays a different role,” he said.  “Even when testing was at a different stage, it was always an underestimate.”
To get localized insight into the evolution of the virus, Dr Adjala said he had come to rely on hospitalizations as a percentage of his capacity.  It also checks the CDC community level monitoring, which includes new hospital admissions and the number of beds used.  He urges focusing on serious illnesses, rather than following “booms and busts of cases”.
Hospitalizations increased slightly throughout June, although they remain low.  Just over 33,000 people are in US hospitals with the coronavirus on average, and fewer than 4,000 are in intensive care.  Reports of new deaths remain below 400 a day, down from the country’s daily peak of more than 3,300 deaths in January 2021.

morning edition host Steve Inskeep usually celebrates the 4th of July with an annual reading of the Declaration of Independence to its loyal listeners on NPR.  For Independence Day 2022, however, that 33-year tradition came to an end, and instead an 11-minute segment that examined “what equality meant in this document” as described by the co- animator Leila Fadel by Twitter.
Why is this day different from previous July 14 in the eyes of NPR producers?  Well frequent NPR listeners morning edition know that there has been great and understandable concern about the Supreme Court Justice’s decision to to spill the landmark 1973 decision on reproductive rights, Roe v. Wade,  which immediately made abortion procedures illegal in more than a dozen states.

                              <span>In April, Judge Neil Gorsuch asked his colleagues to the Supreme Court if they would “wither today because of a social media campaign.”  The case was Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, in which the State of Oklahoma asserted that it had jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes committed against Indian citizens on Indian reservations.  This claim was unsupported by law or history, violating legal precedents, established practices in other states, and the clear intent and authority of Congress.

This week, Gorsuch got his answer: Yes, the court would wither and side with an aggressively political media campaign against the rule of law.  The tribes have once again seen another broken promise – despite our best hopes, the court sent a message that the word of the United States is meaningless when it c…</span>

                              <span>The attack during the July 4 parade in Highland Park was the largest and most publicized shooting, but far from the only one, over the holiday weekend.
It was one of two mass shootings in the Chicago area alone on Monday.  Less than 12 hours earlier, five people were injured in a shooting in Chicago’s South End.
The Highland Park shooting was notable for its scale (at least three dozen injured), its fatality (at least six killed) and its location, an affluent suburb that doesn’t often see such violence.  But it was part of a pattern: the brutal pervasiveness of gun violence in a nation with more guns than people.


By early Monday morning, at least 57 people had been shot in Chicago over the July 4 weekend, nine of them fatally, according to NBC Chicago.  This did not include the toll from…</span>

Wade, a question lurks between court opinions and news reports: why are pregnancy risks so rarely discussed anywhere, even though this information is relevant not only to individual decisions, but also to policies regarding abortion, pregnancy and health care for women?
With the wave of abortion bans unfolding across US states, these risks are going to come into greater focus – figuring both in women’s decisions to risk getting pregnant if they live in a state that has banned abortions, and arguments that will occur in state legislative chambers about the degree of threat to a mother’s health that must be present to permit an abortion under untested and rapidly changing state laws.

I was visiting the pyramids of Giza, Egypt, in the company of Mark Lehner, a renowned Egyptologist, when suddenly a series of voices broke out and echoed throughout the site.  Our small group turned to face the commotion, wondering what had happened – and if something was wrong.
Instead, we saw the happy faces of an approaching group of men running barefoot through the sand, some of them with bags and other gear in tow.  Their faces were sweaty under the sun and their loads heavy, but their frequent screams gave the scene a festive feeling.


It turns out that their jovial entrance coincided with our own arrival at Dr. Lehner’s dig site, where the archaeologist and his team at Ancient Egypt Research Associates, or AERA, uncover the The lost city of the py…</span>

KYIV (Reuters) - Though Russia can claim a prize with its capture of Ukraine&#x27;s eastern Luhansk region, it is far from Moscow&#x27;s ambitious early war aims and does not deal Kyiv a decisive military blow.
The Russian assault will now switch its focus to the rest of the Donbas industrial heartland, but Kyiv will find it easier to defend fortified positions in Donetsk region and the battles that will shape the war&#x27;s course still lie ahead, military analysts said.
&quot;I think it&#x27;s a tactical victory for Russia but at an enormous cost within the context of redefined military goals,&quot; said Neil Melvin, a London-based RUSI think tank analyst.
Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated his troops on Monday for &quot;liberating&quot; Luhansk region, promising medals for heroism and saying that …</span>

                              <span>Campaigners in Northern Ireland are closely watching US moves to restrict abortion, particularly concerns that women will now have to travel across states for terminations.
Abortion was only decriminalized in the British province in 2019 -- 42 years after terminations were made legal up to 24 weeks in most circumstances in the rest of the UK.
But despite legislation, lack of government funding and political wrangling have meant women are still having to travel to the British mainland for abortions.
Currently, there are still no surgical abortion services available in Northern Ireland and no options for abortion after 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Last year, 161 women crossed the Irish Sea to England and Wales for an abortion, according to UK government statistics published last month.

The show features traditional artifacts, artworks and pop culture about the afterlife in different Asian cultures, with much of the display borrowed from a French museum.

                              <span>Tropical Storm Bonnie was upgraded to a category one hurricane on Sunday as it swept towards Mexico after killing three people in El Salvador and Nicaragua, the US National Hurricane Center said.
The hurricane, the third of the season off Mexico&#x27;s coast, is carrying maximum sustained winds of 80 miles (125 kilometers) per hour &quot;with higher gusts,&quot; the NHC said, citing satellite images.
&quot;The core of Bonnie is expected to remain south of, but move parallel to, the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days,&quot; the center said in its latest advisory.
Before moving towards Mexico, the storm caused damage to property in the Central American countries of El Salvador and Nicaragua, felling trees and flooding rivers, streets and hospitals.
A 24-year-old woman died in El Salvador, emergency services said, while in Nicaragua the army said a 40-year-old man was swept away trying to cross a river and a 38-year-old man died trying to rescue passengers from a bus.
Rescuers in El Salvador were still searching Sunday evening for a missing man and the search efforts will continue on Monday, the country&#x27;s civil protection agency said.
&quot;Bonnie generated very heavy rains and thunderstorms in the coastal area, the volcanic mountain range and the San Salvador metropolitan area, with strong gusty winds and hail in some areas,&quot; the environment ministry said.
El Salvador&#x27;s President Nayib Bukele said all classes would be suspended Monday.
Bonnie, which made landfall in Nicaragua overnight Friday to Saturday, is set to drench southern Mexico with heavy rain, the NHC said.
Swells caused by the hurricane are to &quot;cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,&quot; its advisory said.

Danish police said Monday that the suspect in a weekend shooting at a Copenhagen mall that left three dead, including two teenagers, was known to mental health services.
&quot;Our suspect is also known among psychiatric services, beyond that I do not wish to comment,&quot; Copenhagen police chief Soren Thomassen told a press conference.
Thomassen added that the victims appeared to have been randomly targeted and there was nothing to indicate it was an act of terror.
&quot;Our assessment is that the victims were random, that it isn&#x27;t motivated by gender or something else,&quot; Thomass…</span>

Russia has intensified its restrictions on independent media since attacking its neighbor in February, with journalists under threat of prosecution for criticizing the invasion or for even referring to it as a war.
The US government-backed Open Technology Fund is paying out money to a handful of American firms providing virtual private networks (VPNs) free of charge to millions of Russians, who can then use them to visit websites blocked by censors.

The Ukrainian withdrawal followed weeks of fierce fighting and marked a decisive breakthrough for Moscow&#x27;s forces more than four months after their invasion and after turning their focus away from the capital Kyiv.
Leaders from dozens of countries and international organizations will meet Monday in Switzerland to map out a &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; to rebuild Ukraine -- aimed to begin even as Russia&#x27;s war efforts continue to rage.

KUZNICA, Poland (Reuters) - Poland&#x27;s 5.5-metre tall steel barrier, built on its border with Belarus, was meant to be a European version of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s wall, protecting the European Union&#x27;s eastern frontier from illegal migration.
But the wall, stretching about 187 kms (116 miles) and set to be equipped with motion sensors and cameras, may not be enough to halt the steady flow of people trying to cross into Poland in the hope of a better life.
Hungary&#x27;s nationalist government built its own border fence after the 2015 migration crisis to stem migration from Serbia. Thousands of migrants still get through, with the help of people smugglers.

Daily numbers of locally transmitted infections in mainland China increased to more than 300 over the weekend compared with a few dozens in late June. While tiny by global standards, local officials have still closed some businesses and locked down more than a million people.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Fresh evacuation orders were issued for tens of thousands of Sydney residents on Monday after relentless rains flooded several suburbs, with officials warning of more wild weather to come.
An intense low-pressure system off Australia&#x27;s east coast is forecast to bring heavy rain through Monday across New South Wales after several places in the state were hit with about a month&#x27;s worth over the weekend.
Since Sunday, about 30,000 residents in New South Wales state have been told to either evacuate or warned they might receive evacuation orders.
Frustration swelled in several suburbs in the west of Australia&#x27;s largest city after floods submerged homes, farms and bridges there, some for the third time this year.

                              <span>By Tom Balmforth and Max Hunder KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine&#x27;s forces have withdrawn from the bombed-out city of Lysychansk, prompting Russia to claim full control of the eastern Luhansk region, a key Kremlin war goal, but President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to regain the lost territory.

Chinese authorities have not released details of the charges against financier Xiao Jianhua.  The Canadian Embassy in Beijing said in an emailed statement that it was aware of Monday’s trial and was following the case closely.

I had reserved a room for us Ojai Valley Innpartly so that we could park under the resort’s 200-year-old oak tree and have a commanding view of Chief Peak, part of the Topatopa Mountains, which are known, under the right conditions, to glow with a transcendent hue of coral.

Soren Thomassen, a Copenhagen police inspector, said Monday morning local time that the dead included a man in his 40s and two youths.  He did not say how many people in total were injured, but said three were in critical condition.
He said police arrested a 22-year-old Dane in connection with the shooting, which happened around 6 p.m. local time.  Authorities have not provided any information on a possible motive, but believe the man was acting alone.
