A report by The Australian suggests 41 asylum seekers are due to be flown from Christmas Island back to Colombo. 

After being granted bail by a Sri Lankan court, one woman said she decided to make the journey after being told by people smugglers the new Australian government would allow them to stay, according to The Australian. 

Food shortages due to the ongoing economic crisis have caused an influx of people trying to leave Sri Lanka.</span>

Reuters: U.S. drone sale to Ukraine hits snag - sources 
ST LOUIS, Missouri (Reuters) - The Biden administration&#x27;s plan to sell four large, armable drones to Ukraine has been paused on the fear its sophisticated surveillance equipment might fall into enemy hands, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The technical objection to the sale was raised during a deeper review by the Pentagon&#x27;s Defense Technology Security Administration charged with keeping high value technology safe from enemy hands. Previously the plan, which has been circulating since March, had been approved by the White House, three people said. 
The plan to sell Ukraine four MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones that can be armed with Hellfire missiles for battlefield use against Russia was first reported by Reuters earlier in June.

NBC: The Navy has fired a dozen leaders but won&#x27;t explain why  
A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including five in one week, the Navy said.
 The Navy has fired nearly a dozen officers in leadership positions in less than three months, including five in one week, due to a “loss of confidence” in their ability to command — an unusual string of terminations across land, air and sea teams, experts said.  At least nine commanding officers and two senior advisers have been relieved of their duties since April, when a cluster of suicides on the USS George Washington warship sparked widespread concerns of a mental health crisis.  A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including 12 in the Navy and one in the Marine Corps, the Navy said. Most recently, four Naval commanding officers and a top leader were ousted from June 8 to June 14.

                              <span>RFE: Lithuania Bans Transit Of Sanctioned Russian Goods To Kaliningrad 
Lithuania has begun a ban on the rail transit of goods subject to European Union sanctions to the Russian far-western exclave of Kaliningrad, transport authorities in the Baltic nation said on June 18. 
The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials, and advanced technology. 
Anton Alikhanov, the governor of the Russian oblast, said the ban would cover around 50 percent of the items that Kaliningrad imports. 
Alikhanov said the region, which has an ice-free port on the Baltic Sea, will call on Russian federal authorities to take tit-for-tat measures against the EU country for imposing the ban. He said he would also seek to have more goods sent by ship to the oblast.

                              <span>Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - The U.S. Is Moving Towards Escalation 
The catastrophic economic consequences of the &#x27;western&#x27; proxy war with Russia are setting in. As a result the high inflation, caused by supply side constrains due to sanctions and far too much spending, will ruin the middle classes of many countries. 
To those who did not wear blinders and who knew of the real economies of the &#x27;west&#x27; and Russia this was very predictable and predicted:   
The U.S. is pushing its European &#x27;allies&#x27; to commit economic suicide by sanctioning everything Russia. The U.S. should be more careful. It is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil and its aircraft industry depends on titanium from Russia. Russia surely knows who is trying to hurt it the most and it surely knows how, and has the means to, hurt back. 
The hurt has not at all reached its peak. This winter will be very difficult for Europe. Poor countries are even worse off. Many will experience hunger crises and riots.

WNU Editor: I have a different point of view. Many of America&#x27;s adversaries see a very weak White House, and they are taking advantage of the situation. The US is not in charge, and they are now mostly reacting to ongoing events rather than shaping them.</span>

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Visualizing The Coming Shift In Global Economic Power (2006-2036)&#x60; 
As the post-pandemic recovery chugs along, the global economy is set to see major changes in the coming decades. Most significantly, China is forecast to pass the United States to become the largest economy globally. 
The world’s economic center has long been drifting from Europe and North America over to Asia. This global shift was kickstarted by lowered trade barriers and greater economic freedom, which attracted foreign direct investment (FDI). Another major driving factor was the improvements in infrastructure and communications, and a general increase in economic complexity in the region.

What Are Anti-Satellite Weapons? 
At any given moment, there are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth for commercial, civil, strategic, and military reasons. 
Due to the importance of certain satellites for national security, countries have developed anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons that can be used to incapacitate or destroy satellites in orbit. 
While some ASAT weapons use non-destructive means like cyberattacks or lasers to impair satellites, the destructive types often rely on high-speed physical collision to shatter satellites, creating negative repercussions for the space environment.

                              <span>Ivo Daalder, Politico: The deteriorating nuclear order  
We’re returning to a time when nuclear threats were the norm — and the world flirted with Armageddon. 
“A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” 
So said the leaders of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States for the very first time, just five months ago. Today, however, the prospect of nuclear weapons use is perhaps greater than any time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. 
Just weeks after co-signing the joint statement on preventing nuclear war, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a war of aggression against a neighbor that had given up its nuclear weapons in return for Russia’s explicit assurance “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine [and] refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine.”

CNBC: China’s Xi says trade with Russia expected to hit new records in the coming months 
* “Today our cooperation between Russia and China are rising,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to an official English translation carried by Russian state broadcaster RT. 
* “Trade over the first half of this year has been [in the tens of billions of U.S. dollars] and we can expect new records in upcoming months, which is a testament to the great cooperation between our two nations,” Xi said. 
* The Chinese leader was speaking via video at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum’s plenary session, which Russian President Vladimir Putin opened with a speech over an hour long. 
BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday emphasized his country’s commitment to trading with Russia, despite Western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. 
“Today our cooperation between Russia and China [is] rising,” Xi said, according to an official English translation carried by Russian state broadcaster RT. He cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Beijing in early February. 
“Trade over the first half of this year has been [in the tens of billions of U.S. dollars] and we can expect new records in upcoming months, which is a testament to the great cooperation between our two nations,” Xi said.

Influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose movement won 73 seats in parliament, announced the resignation of his bloc&#x27;s members last week. The move has left many Iraqis uncertain about what the future holds for the powerful movement; many ask if it is even possible to form a government without it. FRANCE 24 correspondent Lucille Wasserman speaks to Iraqis about Sadr&#x27;s latest move.</span>
