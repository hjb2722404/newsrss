What better way to pay homage to tolerance and love in the Arab World than an evening celebrating the revolutionary Vogue dance (the origins of voguing was in the 1980s by the black and Latinx queer communities) from NYC?  Are we really free to love wherever we are in the world? To often the answer is “no”. It is frequently even more difficult when you live in an Arab-Muslim country. FRANCE 24 went along to celebrate, but we also found out that it is as political as ever.</span>

A video showing Greta seeming to pose for photographers while being held by police officers garnered more than ten million views in two days and fed accusations that the arrest was staged. However, the video that has been circulating online is just a clip and the full video tells a different story. Moreover, a journalist who witnessed the incident said the incident was real, as did the German police.</span>

                              <span>VOA: US, NATO Balk on Battle Tanks for Ukraine 
No Leopard tanks will be given to Ukraine by Germany at this time, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark A. Milley said on Friday, at a briefing at Germany&#x27;s U.S. Ramstein Air Base following an international conference on Ukraine support. 
The international meeting comes amid Kyiv&#x27;s frustration with the dissent over sending tanks to Ukraine as the full-scale invasion reaches the 11-month mark. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made direct pleas for tanks at the meeting. 
Later Friday, in his evening address, Zelenskyy said Ukraine will have to fight to secure a supply of modern heavy armor.  &quot;Every day we make it more obvious that there is no alternative to taking a decision about tanks,&quot; he said.

Washington Post: Former Navy SEAL killed fighting in Ukraine 
A former Navy SEAL was killed in Ukraine this week, the Navy said Friday, the latest American combat fatality in a war that has drawn legions of international fighters. 
Daniel Swift died Wednesday, the Navy said in a brief statement accompanying the release of his official military records.
He enlisted in 2005, earning awards that suggested combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, though officials declined to describe those operations. 
Navy SEALs and other elite Special Operations troops conduct some of the U.S. military’s most secretive and sensitive missions, and the government seldom discloses what those tasks entail.

CNN: US to designate Russia’s Wagner mercenary group as a ‘transnational criminal organization’ 
The US Treasury Department will designate the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group as a “transnational criminal organization” and will impose additional sanctions next week against the group and its support network across the world, the White House said on Friday.
“These actions recognize the transcontinental threat that Wagner poses, including through its ongoing pattern of serious criminal activity,” National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told reporters on Friday, ahead of the Treasury Department announcement. 
Along with the new sanctions, the US has released newly declassified photos of Russian railcars traveling from Russia to North Korea and back in November, in what the US believes was the initial delivery of infantry rockets and missiles for use by the mercenary organization Wagner Group in Ukraine.

Military.com: The Army Forced to Change the Name of Its New Rifle 
The Army is changing the name of its new rifle after accidentally taking a name from an unrelated existing weapon, the service announced Wednesday. 
The service&#x27;s upcoming M5 from Sig Sauer will now be called the M7 after it was discovered Colt Industries also makes a weapon called the M5. The light machine gun set to replace the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, or SAW, the M250, will not change. 
&quot;The Army originally chose the designation XM5 as the name of the new rifle in March,&quot; a service spokesperson said in a statement. &quot;Since then, the service learned that the M5 name is used by Colt Industries for one of its 5.56mm carbines.&quot;

Demand is soaring for oil storage tanks in Singapore, in a sign that a flood of Russian fuel is being blended and re-exported globally. 
Tank space in the city state is being snapped up due to a rise in interest and profits from mixing cheap fuel supplies from Russia with shipments from other sources, according to an executive from a tank operator and a consultant who advises traders on the matter. That process can help to obscure the cargoes’ origins, they said. 
Singapore hasn’t banned the import of Russian oil or petroleum products, although financial institutions based in the island state are prohibited from financing or dealing with Russian goods and companies. Singapore government agencies referred to past statements on the ban and price cap policy, without additional comments.

Daily Dot: EXCLUSIVE: U.S. airline accidentally exposes ‘No Fly List’ on unsecured server 
One of the most sensitive U.S. government documents was left online. 
An unsecured server discovered by a security researcher last week contained the identities of hundreds of thousands of individuals from the U.S. government’s Terrorist Screening Database and “No Fly List.” 
Located by the Swiss hacker known as maia arson crimew, the server, run by the U.S. national airline CommuteAir, was left exposed on the public internet. It revealed a vast amount of company data, including private information on almost 1,000 CommuteAir employees. 
Analysis of the server resulted in the discovery of a text file named “NoFly.csv,” a reference to the subset of individuals in the Terrorist Screening Database who have been barred from air travel due to having suspected or known ties to terrorist organizations. 
The list, according to crimew, appeared to have more than 1.5 million entries in total. The data included names as well as birth dates. It also included multiple aliases, placing the number of unique individuals at far less than 1.5 million.

Axios: U.S. sends Israel-stored weapons to Ukraine 
The U.S. has in recent months transferred hundreds of thousands of artillery shells from its ammunition stockpiles in Israel to Ukraine, three current and former Israeli officials told Axios.   
Why it matters: The ammunition that was transferred to Ukraine was part of a U.S. weapons stockpile that is pre-positioned in warehouses on Israeli soil as part of an agreement between the countries. 
* The warehouses are locked and only U.S. military personnel has access to them. 
But according to the agreement between the countries, Israel can use this ammunition in a war scenario in short order under U.S. approval.   
Of note: Israel was granted access to the ammunition during the war with Lebanon in 2006 and also during the 2014 Gaza conflict.   
The big picture: The move was part of a wider effort by the Pentagon to resupply the Ukrainian army, which needs tens of thousands of artillery shells every month for its war against Russia in which artillery fire is a key component.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp reaffirmed his commitment to supporting the values of the West via his company’s algorithmic intelligence software on Wednesday, telling any current or prospective employees who don’t support that mission: “Don’t work here.” 
Asked by David Rubenstein, co-chairman of private equity firm the Carlyle Group, during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, about the tension many major tech companies face from “left-leaning” employees when working with the U.S. military and others, Karp stood firmly by Palantir’s mission to support the West from adversaries, whether that’s terrorist cells or developed nations like Russia and China who threaten democracy. 
“We are not everyone’s cup of tea. We may not be your cup of tea,” Karp said. “To make society work, there are basic functions that have to work, one of which is the reduction of terrorism, pushing back on, in my view, human rights abuses largely done by adversaries to the West. You may not agree with that, and bless you. Don’t work here.”

Washington Free Beacon:  How Russia&#x27;s War Against Ukraine Has Negatively Impacted Europeans&#x27; Views of China  
Europeans&#x27; view of China worsens as alliance with Russia grows 
China’s support for Russia in its war against Ukraine is having a dramatic—and negative—impact on Europeans’ views of the Communist country, according to a poll published Wednesday. 
China’s partnership with Russia has fueled a shift in public opinion, with a majority of those polled across 13 European countries saying their attitude toward the CCP has worsened during the past year as a result of this relationship. Of the 34 percent of those polled who said they have an unfavorable view of the Communist country, 66 percent attributed that position to the growing Beijing-Moscow alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is unsure who is making decisions in Russia as part of potential negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. 
Zelensky said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he does not “quite understand” who he should be talking to and about what, the Russian newspaper Pravda reported. He added that he is unsure of the role Russian President Vladimir Putin has in decisionmaking and what “circle of people” is involved in deciding the actions Russia takes. 
“I don’t know the proper place to reach,” he said.

Anna Nemtsova, Daily Beast: Putin’s Secret Attack Plan Would Be Ukrainian Nightmare 
KYIV—Ukraine is braced for a major new offensive that could begin within weeks. One of President Zelensky’s key insiders told The Daily Beast that they expect a looming Russian move to encircle the country with a simultaneous attack on three fronts. 
Rustem Umerov, a member of the team negotiating with Russia, said the Kremlin was preparing for a fresh advance which could begin as soon as February. The assault would come from the north, over the Belarusian border, from the Russian strongholds in the east of Ukraine, and from the south, where the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was seized by Vladimir Putin’s forces in 2014 and nearby …</span>

Reuters: EU Parliament calls for more sanctions against Iranian regime 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European lawmakers adopted a resolution on Thursday calling for more sanctions against all Iranian individuals and entities responsible for human right violations and also voted for the Revolutionary Guard Corps to be designated as a terrorist entity. 
&quot;Iranian authorities must end crackdown on their own citizens (...) Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Ebrahim Raisi should be added to the sanctions list,&quot; the European Parliament said in a statement. 
Anti-government demonstrations erupted in Iran in September after the death in custody of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who had been detained by morality police enforcing the Islamic Republic&#x27;s mandatory dress code for women.

The Daily Beast: Kremlin Threatens ‘Whole New Level’ of War Over Western Weapons 
Russia is on edge as American and European leaders meet in Europe to discuss delivering more weapons and military aid packages to Ukraine, with the Kremlin warning that more deliveries of weaponry to Kyiv will bring the conflict to a “new level.” 
“This will mean taking the conflict to a whole new level, which certainly will not bode well in terms of global European security,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to TASS. “Naturally, the very discussion of the acceptability of supplying Ukraine with arms which would allow strikes to be delivered on Russian soil… is potentially extremely dangerous.” 
The threat comes days after Ukrainian troops arrived at Fort Sill in Oklahoma for training on Patriot missile systems. It also comes on the eve of a meeting between U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley, and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Friday at Ramstein Air Base this week to discuss military aid packages for Ukraine aimed at thwarting an expected Russian offensive in 2023.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: U.S. Warms to Helping Ukraine Target Crimea 
WASHINGTON — For years, the United States has insisted that Crimea is still part of Ukraine. Yet the Biden administration has held to a hard line since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, refusing to provide Kyiv with the weapons it needs to target the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia has been using as a base for launching devastating strikes. 
Now that line is starting to soften. 
After months of discussions with Ukrainian officials, the Biden administration is finally starting to concede that Kyiv may need the power to strike the Russian sanctuary, even if such a move increases the risk of escalation, according to several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive debate. Crimea, between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, is home to around 70,000 dug-in Russian troops and numerous Russian military bases.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia will remain a threat to NATO even if its forces are defeated in Ukraine, a top military official in the Western alliance said on Thursday. 
&quot;Whatever the outcome of the war, the Russians will most likely have similar ambitions ... therefore the threat does not go away,&quot; Admiral Rob Bauer, the chairman of NATO&#x27;s military committee, told reporters at the alliance&#x27;s Brussels headquarters. 
While Russian forces, equipment and ammunition have all been depleted by the war, NATO countries expect Moscow will try to rebuild and even strengthen its military capacity, Bauer said.

Washington Post: CIA director holds secret meeting with Zelensky on Russia’s next steps 
CIA Director William J. Burns traveled in secret to Ukraine’s capital at the end of last week to brief President Volodymyr Zelensky on his expectations for what Russia is planning militarily in the coming weeks and months, said a U.S. official and other people familiar with the visit.   Burns’s travel comes at a critical juncture in the 11-month war. 
Russian forces are mounting a massive assault near the eastern city of Bakhmut that is causing many casualties on both sides and forcing Ukraine to weigh its resources there as it prepares a major counteroffensive elsewhere in the country.

(Bloomberg) -- NATO allies are likely to invest in air defense capabilities and deeper stocks of ammunition in the coming years in response to lessons it learned from Russia’s war in Ukraine, the alliance’s military chief said.  
Russia’s invasion shows the North Atlantic Treaty Organization needs to be prepared to fight World War One-style trench warfare and artillery barrages, while at the same time countering attacks and surveillance from armed drones, the chairman of the alliance’s military committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.  
“We have to prepare for the future, but we also have still to be able to fight the war of the past,” Bauer said, pointing to the decisive role of land forces, as well as missile and air power attacks, in Ukraine.

Tons of snow and ice collapsed onto the mouth of the tunnel on Tuesday evening, trapping drivers in their vehicles. Authorities say some 1,000 rescuers and dozens of emergency vehicles have taken part in the effort, with the central government&#x27;s Ministry of Emergency Management sending a team to assist.</span>

                              <span>Thousands of Indigenous and other Peruvians descended on the capital Lima on Wednesday to demand the resignation of unelected President Dina Boluarte, show support for imprisoned former leftist leader Pedro Castillo, and condemn government forces for killing dozens of protesters over the past six weeks.
The demonstrators—who include Aymara and Quecha people from Andean regions, trade unionists, and other activists—traveled to the coastal capital in caravans during the second week of a general strike as part of a new &quot;March from the Four Corners.&quot; The first such march took place in 2000 against then-President Alberto Fujimori, a U.S.-backed right-wing autocrat.

In 2009, Miss California, Carrie Prejean, gained national attention for her response to a question by a gay blogger at the Miss USA Pageant about same-sex marriage.
What followed were repeated efforts to capitalize on her anti-LGBTQ fame, including a short stint as a spokesperson for NOM, the National Organization For Marriage, an anti-LGBTQ organization that aggressively attempted to prevent same-sex couples from gaining the legal right to marriage.

                              <span>The streets of France filled with outraged workers on Thursday as rail employees, teachers, and others walked off the job to protest President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s deeply unpopular plan to overhaul the nation&#x27;s pension system by raising the official retirement age from 62 to 64.
The union-led demonstrations—which ground significant portions of the country, including many schools and transportation systems, to a halt—come as Macron is attempting to steamroll far-reaching opposition to his pension overhaul, declaring that &quot;we must work longer.&quot;
Macron&#x27;s government formally presented its draft law last week, the first step in the process of enacting a reform that would force French citizens to work longer to qualify for a full pension.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thursday&#x27;s shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world&#x27;s youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the punishing demands faced by women in power.
Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old politician said she had next to nothing left &quot;in the tank&quot; and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office.
&quot;Politicians are human,&quot; she said. &quot;We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it&#x27;s time. And for me, it&#x27;s time.&quot;
But the remarks that followed were more revealing, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand&#x27;s University of Canterbury.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday made a shock announcement she had &quot;no more in the tank&quot; to continue leading the country and would step down no later than early February and not seek re-election.
Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside.
&quot;This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term - because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that,&quot; Ardern, 42, told a news conference.

                              <span>Politico: Davos struggles to get used to a world without Russia  
Behind the scenes, global CEOs and leaders question how long the West can ignore Moscow and still find new markets for energy, metals and food. 
DAVOS, Switzerland — For the second year in a row, Western sanctions have prevented Russian officials and oligarchs from attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Swiss ski-resort town that hosts the annual confab of the ultra-rich. 
That’s welcome news for many — including Western officials who’ve spent the past 11 months trying to persuade the international community to shun Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. And it is a win for the Ukrainians attending this year’s conference as they ratchet up their calls for more weapons from allies. 
But it’s also forcing the world’s CEOs to grapple with the new reality of how to operate in a world where working with Russia is off the table.

   WNU Editor: The Pantsir missile system is a self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery system. It provides point air defence of military, industrial and administrative installations against aircraft, helicopters, precision munitions, cruise missiles and UAVs (link here). 
 I am not surprised that these systems are being deployed. There has been a lot of chatter on Ukrainian social media sites recently that Ukraine should start launching attacks against targets in Moscow.</span>

A nationwide strike is taking place in France on Thursday in response to plans by President Emmanuel Macron’s government to reform the pension system and raise the retirement age. Strikes may continue beyond January 19 as France’s largest trade union has described Thursday as only a starting point. 
 Strikes have been happening in the UK, too. Nurses went on strike in England in December 2022 for the first time in 106 years. Rail workers have been on strike in recent weeks, and teachers and health workers are planning to strike in February.  Strikes are a significant part of the culture of working life in Europe. People in several EU member states including Spain and Germany went on strike recently, primarily asking for better pay and working conditions.

Almost 12,000 police officers are preparing to guard the Peruvian capital Lima as the country braces for massive protests on Thursday. 
A heavy police and military presence could be observed in the heart of city early Thursday, with key locations such as the parliament, the prosecutor’s office and the army headquarters receiving extra protection. 
Peru is seeing some of its worst violence in decades, which erupted last month following the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo, as protesters who oppose the current government call for political change.

                              <span>Reuters: French workers strike nationwide, saying &#x27;non&#x27; to Macron&#x27;s pension reform 
PARIS (Reuters) -French workers went on strike and joined marches across the country on Thursday, halting trains and cutting electricity production in protest against government plans to raise the retirement age by two years to 64. 
The stoppages are a major test for President Emmanuel Macron, who said on Thursday that his pension reform plan, which opinion polls show is hugely unpopular, was &quot;just and responsible&quot; and had to be carried out.  Protesters disagreed. 
&quot;It&#x27;s salaries and pensions that must be increased, not the retirement age,&quot; read one large banner carried by workers that opened the protest march in Tours, in western France.
&quot;I&#x27;ll have to prepare my walking frame if the reform goes through,&quot; said Isabelle, 53, a social worker, saying her job was too tough to add two more years.

The US Coast Guard says it is tracking a suspected Russian spy ship off the coast of Hawaii in international waters as heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow remain over Russian’s war in Ukraine. 
 “In recent weeks, the U.S. Coast Guard has continued to monitor a Russian vessel, believed to be an intelligence gathering ship, off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands,” the USCG said in a news release.

OilPrice.com: IEA Sees Global Oil Demand Hitting A Record High In 2023 
* The International Energy Agency believes global oil demand will hit a record high of 101.7 million barrels per day this year. 
* The IEA raised its demand estimate by 200,000 bpd, with the agency saying China will drive nearly half of global demand growth. 
* Oil prices continued to rally early on Wednesday morning on IEA estimates that oil markets are set to tighten in 2023. 
China’s reopening is set to drive global oil demand to a record high of 101.7 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up by 1.9 million bpd from 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday, raising its demand growth estimate for 2023 by 200,000 bpd from 1.7 million bpd growth expected in December. 
Almost half of the oil demand growth this year will come from China after Beijing lifted its Covid restrictions, the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report (OMR) for January.   At the same time, world oil supply growth in 2023 is set to slow to 1 million bpd, following last year’s OPEC+ led growth of 4.7 million bpd.

On a background-check application dated July 2018, Hunter Biden claimed that he paid $49,910 per month in rent and that his “current residence” at that time was 1209 Barley Mill Road in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a document found on Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop.

Reuters: Putin ally warns NATO of nuclear war if Russia is defeated in Ukraine 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -An ally of President Vladimir Putin warned NATO on Thursday that a defeat of Russia in Ukraine could trigger a nuclear war, while the head of the Russian Orthodox Church said the world would end if the West tried to destroy Russia. 
Such apocalyptic rhetoric is intended to deter the U.S.-led NATO military alliance from getting even more involved in the war, on the eve of a meeting of Ukraine&#x27;s allies to discuss sending Kyiv more weapons. 
But the explicit recognition that Russia might lose on the battlefield marked a rare moment of public doubt from a prominent member of Putin&#x27;s inner circle. 
&quot;The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war,&quot; former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Putin&#x27;s powerful security council, said in a post on Telegram.

                              <span>Reuters: U.S. government touches debt limit 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government was due to hit its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit on Thursday, amid a standoff between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Joe Biden&#x27;s Democrats that could lead to a fiscal crisis in a few months. 
Republicans, with a newly won House majority, aim to use the congressionally mandated federal debt ceiling to exact spending cuts from Biden and the Democratic-led Senate. 
Thursday&#x27;s deadline will have little immediate effect, because Treasury officials are prepared to begin employing emergency cash management measures to stave off default. More serious risks will emerge closer to June, when the government approaches the so-called X date, beyond which the Treasury would run out of emergency maneuvers. 
Ahead of that deadline, there was no sign that either side was willing to bend.

Euronews: EU sets up first stockpile to respond to chemical and nuclear emergencies in Finland 
The European Union is ramping up its preparedness for possible chemical and nuclear emergencies as Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine nears the one-year mark with a stockpile of items to be set up in Finland, it was announced on Tuesday. 
A total of €242 million has been allocated to Finland by the European Commission to create the bloc&#x27;s first strategic reserve against chemical, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats for use by all member states. 
 &quot;Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has confirmed the need to strengthen EU CBRN preparedness,&quot; Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, said.

According to a report released here on Wednesday by the World Economic Forum at its Annual Meeting 2023, half of the companies surveyed feel the current landscape is making them re-evaluate the countries in which their organisation does business.

Evaluation of alliance&#x27;s support to Ukraine tops agenda 
A two-day meeting of NATO military chiefs to discuss a variety of issues, including the alliance&#x27;s support to Ukraine, started in Brussels on Wednesday. 
The session, which began after opening remarks by Adm. Rob Bauer, chair of the NATO Military Committee, and Mircea Geoana, NATO deputy secretary general, will be chaired by Bauer and attended by the allied military chiefs as well as their counterparts from invitees Finland and Sweden. 
&quot;Unfortunately, we are seeing the dawn of a new era of collective defense. However, it is an era that NATO is ready for,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;We have shown the world that we are capable of quickly scaling up our presence whenever and wherever necessary.&quot;

Update: NATO Chiefs of Defence meet in Brussels (NATO)   
WNU Editor: When this two-day meeting of NATO military chiefs is over later today (i.e. Thursday), the next big meeting will be a day later at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany .... Trans-Atlantic Rush of Meetings Ahead of Jan. 20 Ramstein Global NATO Defense Contact Group Summit (EIR). 
The main stream media is not giving the coverage of this meeting of NATO military chiefs that it deserves. You do not have this type of summit to discuss sending a few dozen tanks to Ukraine. You have this type of meeting to discuss waging war on a massive level. 
I hope I am wrong, but this Friday could be an inflection point for NATO&#x27;s direct involvement in the Russia - Ukraine war. Their rhetoric certainly tells me that they are ready .... NATO warns of extended war in Ukraine, vows to be ready (AP).</span>

Jacinda Ardern has choked back tears as she announced her resignation as New Zealand Prime Minister in an emotional press conference. 
Her resignation comes into effect on Sunday if the Labour Party can elect her replacement in a two-thirds vote on that day, or on February 7 if the process is drawn out. 
Ms Ardern said she hoped to find the energy and heart during the Christmas break to stay in the job, &#x27;but I have not been able to do that&#x27;.

                              <span>This Thursday, much of France is grinding to a halt due to a nationwide general strike over pension reform. It begs the question: is striking typically French? Although French people arguably have striking down to a fine art, on closer inspection, the figures debunk the myth. So why is the stereotype of a nation on strike so hard to shake off?

Months of trench warfare under heavy bombardment, combined with the loss of comrades, are taking a heavy toll on the men and women of the military, many of whom had little previous military experience. Tens of thousands are likely to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD, a condition for which only a few medical establishments in Ukraine are able to offer modern treatments. The most prominent among them, Forest Glade just outside Kyiv, launched a programme on Thursday to help share its expertise. FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg reports.</span>

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Messina Denaro, a brutal Sicilian Mafia boss who was Italy&#x27;s most wanted criminal before his capture on Monday, had been on the run for 30 years. Here are some key facts about his arrest and what it means:
WHY IS THE ARREST SO IMPORTANT?
Messina Denaro, 60, was the last runaway member of a generation of mobsters who masterminded a string of bombings and murders that terrorised Italy in the early 1990s.
His arrest finally brings closure to that dark era, shatters a symbol of resistance to the Italian state and could reveal Mafia secrets in the unlikely event that Messina Denaro agrees to talk to investigators.
He was involved in dozens of killings, including of top prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the adolescent son of a Mafia…</span>

Anatoly Legkodymov, 40, a Russian living in Shenzhen, China, appeared in handcuffs and leg shackles in a Miami courtroom on money laundering charges, and was denied bail by a judge who deemed him a flight risk.

Washington (AFP) - The United States is not currently prepared to provide advanced Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said Wednesday, citing difficulties in maintenance and training.
Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for modern Western tanks to help battle Russia&#x27;s invasion, and Germany has reportedly linked its decision on whether to do so to Washington&#x27;s willingness to provide Abrams.
&quot;I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet,&quot; US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told journalists when asked about providing Abrams to Ukraine, though he did not completely close the door on a shift in the future.

                              <span>Brazil&#x27;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.
Just days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.
He ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was &quot;convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors.&quot;
In a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil&#x27;s presidents live.
Leftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.
As he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.

The president said last week that any &quot;radical bolsonarista&quot; found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.
&quot;How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?&quot; asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.
Bolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula&#x27;s inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.
He has denied any link to the riots.
In a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed &quot;regret&quot; over the events, which he described as &quot;unbelievable&quot;.

&quot;Under the proposals, same-sex couples would still not be able to get married in a Church of England church,&quot; the church said in a statement.
They can instead &quot;come to church to give thanks for their civil marriage or civil partnership and receive God&#x27;s blessing,&quot; it added.
Bishops met on Tuesday to finalize recommendations, which will affirm the church&#x27;s teaching that Holy Matrimony exists between one man and one woman for life.

                              <span>Notorious drug lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman has appealed to Mexico&#x27;s president for help due to alleged &quot;psychological torment&quot; he is suffering in a US prison, his lawyer said Tuesday.
&quot;In the six years that Joaquin has been in the United States, he has not seen the sun,&quot; said Jose Refugio Rodriguez, a Mexico-based legal representative of the Sinaloa cartel founder.
The message, described as &quot;an SOS,&quot; was transmitted via one of Guzman&#x27;s lawyers in the United States as well as his family, Rodriguez said.
Guzman is only allowed outside three times a week to a small area where he &quot;doesn&#x27;t get the sun,&quot; and has fewer visits or phone calls than other inmates, the lawyer said in an interview with Radio Formula.
&quot;He is suffering psychological torment,&quot; he said, adding that the lack of sunshine was also bad for the convicted drug trafficker&#x27;s physical health.
Guzman wants President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address alleged procedural violations during his extradition in 2017 under the former government, Rodriguez added.
The Mexican embassy in Washington confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that it received an email from Rodríguez on January 10. 
Without referring to the content of the email, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard downplayed the chance of any government intercession in favor of the notorious drug trafficker. 
&quot;He is serving a sentence there, he has a sentence,&quot; he told journalists. &quot;So, frankly I don&#x27;t see any possibilities for him, but I&#x27;m going to review it with the prosecutor&#x27;s office.&quot; 
El Chapo is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in 2019 of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.
One of his sons, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested by Mexican security forces this month in an operation that left 29 people dead and sparked a dramatic shootout at an airport in the city of Culiacan.

Brovary (Ukraine) (AFP) - Eighteen people, including Ukraine´s interior minister and three children, were killed in a helicopter crash near a kindergarten outside Kyiv on Wednesday.
The helicopter slammed down next to the kindergarten and a residential building in Brovary, a commuter town for the capital Kyiv that was the scene of fierce fighting early in Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
Amateur footage circulating on social media showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the aircraft mixed with debris from nearby buildings and a car crushed by large shards of metal. Cries could be heard at the scene which was consumed by a fire.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When dozens of defense ministers meet at an airbase in Germany on Friday, all eyes will be set on what Berlin is - and is not - willing to provide Ukraine.
Defense leaders from roughly 50 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will confer at Ramstein Air Base, the latest in a series of meetings since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago.
The focus is expected to be not on what the United States will provide, but on whether Germany will send its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve their transfer from third countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Katherine Swidan, whose son Mark has been imprisoned in China for over 10 years, has not seen even a photograph of him over the last decade. The last time she heard his voice was in 2018.
She and the families of other Americans, who according to the U.S. government are wrongfully held in China, are hoping that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken can push the Chinese authorities for the release of their loved ones as he visits Beijing next month.
&quot;My message for Blinken is: say their names,&quot; said Katherine Swidan in a phone interview from her home in Luling, Texas. &quot;They&#x27;re American citizens. They&#x27;ve been wrongfully detained. Enough is enough.&quot;

    Summit News: Joe Rogan on Biden: “They’re Trying to Get Rid of Him”  
Top Dems sabotaging president to prevent 2024 run. 
During a discussion on his podcast, Joe Rogan suggested the latest scandals surrounding Joe Biden suggested that top Democrats are “trying to get rid of him.” 
The president has been embroiled in more controversy after it was revealed that at least 20 classified documents relating to his time as vice-president were found at Biden’s home. 
Biden is now being investigated by a special counsel appointed by the US Department of Justice, having previously called Donald Trump “irresponsible” after his home was raided by the FBI for similar reasons. 
According to Joe Rogan, the scandal is part of a Democrat subversion campaign to ensure Biden doesn’t try to run for office again in 2024. 
“I don’t know jack shit about politics, but if I had to guess — they’re trying to get rid of him. My guess would be they’re trying to get rid of him,” said the podcast host.

Thunberg has been in Germany for several days to support protests against the demolition of Luetzerath, which have become a symbol of resistance against fossil fuels.
Images showed the activist, dressed in black, being picked up by police officers wearing helmets and then escorted to a waiting bus.
A police spokeswoman said a group of activists were in custody after having &quot;broken away from the demonstration&quot;, and run towards the edge of an open pit.
Officials were working to identify the protesters in custody, and a decision would be made later about what further action to take, she said.

                              <span>France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.
The suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.
The industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France&#x27;s unions are united.
&quot;It&#x27;ll be a hellish Thursday,&quot; Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.
Paris public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.
Services would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.
Elsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.
Most slow trains between cities would be halted.
Up to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.
Opinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.
The 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s population may have shot up beyond eight billion for the first time recently, but some countries including the most populous, China, are seeing their populations shrink.
And the decline is set to continue as factors including rising living costs, more women entering the workforce and having children later mean people in some countries are having fewer babies.
China&#x27;s population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, official data showed Tuesday, and it is expected to be overtaken by India this year as the most populous nation.
Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to UN figures published last July which forecast how the world&#x27;s population will develop between now and 2100.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.
Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum &quot;for having had &#x27;le palle&#x27; (the balls) to invite me tonight&quot;, according to Deadline and Variety reports.
The museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as &quot;unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation&quot;.
Its &quot;Stella della Mole&quot; award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film &quot;American Beauty&quot; and drama series &quot;House of Cards&quot; -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.
Spacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
His stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.
The actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.
Last summer he appeared at London&#x27;s Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.
Now on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, &quot;deepfake&quot; video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.
Cave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.
The chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.
The Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave&#x27;s website, asked the tool to produce a song &quot;in the style of Nick Cave&quot;.
One of the AI-created verses runs: &quot;I&#x27;m the king of the abyss, I&#x27;m the ruler of the dark / I&#x27;m the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark.&quot;
&quot;This song sucks,&quot; wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT&#x27;s work &quot;replication as travesty&quot;.
He followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn&#x27;t, describing the process of writing as &quot;an act of self-murder&quot;.
&quot;Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don&#x27;t feel,&quot; he wrote.
He added: &quot;Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit.&quot;
Cave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- &quot;I&#x27;ve got the fire of hell in my eyes.&quot;
&quot;I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it&#x27;s ChatGPT,&quot; he concluded.
