He said he wishes to see China take a “stronger response” to the war. 

“What the world would no doubt love to see in relation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is for China to show leadership,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia. 

&quot;It would be an enormous opportunity for China to do so and one that I’m sure everyone would encourage them to do.”</span>

He said people are seeing “broad national outrage” and voters are looking for leadership that will rein in sales of assault weapons. 

“This is not just something that should be shrugged off as part of our culture, it’s a systemic failure and it needs to be addressed with serious policy initiative,” Mr Smith told Sky News Australia.</span>

                              <span>&quot;This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,&quot; he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv&#x27;s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy&#x27;s predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an &quot;offended liver sausage&quot; when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

                              <span>Reuters: U.S. to send $400 million in weapons to Ukraine, including more HIMARS  
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden signed a new weapons package worth up to $400 million for Ukraine on Friday, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and more ammunition. 
The new U.S. aid is meant to bolster Ukraine as it confronts heavy pounding by Russian artillery.
Since the Feb. 24 invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a big chunk of territory across Ukraine&#x27;s southern flank above Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Russia is slowly pushing Ukrainian forces out of two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine which it has recognized as independent states. 
A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the additional HIMARS would bring the total number of these systems to 12.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine&#x27;s ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia&#x27;s attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of &quot;distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.&quot;
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. &quot;Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,&quot; Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations &quot;absurd.&quot;
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.</span>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms. There have been some cases in recent years where people illicitly made weapons themselves in Japan. But still, gun crime is very rare in Japan: last year th...</span>

                              <span>Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister is not just a portentous political event. His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.
Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…</span>

                              <span>Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the &quot;stoning of the devil&quot; ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year&#x27;s expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham&#x27;s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God&#x27;s order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world&#x27;s largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…</span>

                              <span>A day after the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, a steady stream of mourners, many in tears, arrived at the scene of his murder in western Japan to offer flowers and prayers.
People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
&quot;I&#x27;m just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers,&quot; the company worker told AFP.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president&#x27;s offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president&#x27;s office said.

Daily Mail: Retired three-star Army general is suspended from mentoring job for mocking Jill Biden tweet slamming end of Roe v. Wade by replying: &#x27;Glad to see you finally know what a woman is&#x27;

CBC: Canada caught between allies as Germany presses for return of Russian turbine  
The Trudeau government must decide whether to upset NATO ally Germany or wartime ally Ukraine 
Canada faces a tough choice this weekend between angering Germany and offending Ukraine as it ponders the fate of a large turbine that has been undergoing repairs in the workshops of Siemens Energy Canada. 
The turbine normally drives gas through the Nord Stream One pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany. Last month, while undergoing scheduled maintenance at a Siemens Energy facility in Montreal, the turbine was caught up in sanctions the Trudeau government brought against its owner, Russian oil and gas giant Gazprom.

                              <span>PJ Media: Is He Running? Trump Plane Gets a Fresh Coat of Paint 
In 2016, Donald Trump loved to stunt on his political opponents by landing his massive, branded jet behind them just as they were giving speeches during campaign stops at airports. 
Now, a new video documents “Trump Force One” getting a fresh coat of paint, leaving the gleaming Boeing 757 resplendent with a waving American flag on the tail. 
Trump linked the video in a post on his Truth Social media platform, writing, “During my four years in the White House, I didn’t use everybody’s favorite airplane, the Boeing 757 we campaigned on for our big 2016 WIN. Now it has been completely modernized and renovated, and looks GREAT, all done in the Great State of Louisiana, and coming back to the skies in the Fall of 2022, or maybe sooner. Get ready!”

Daily Mail: Fury as left-wing activists ShutDownDC offer $200 bounties for intel on locations of SCOTUS judges who overturned Roe v Wade after targeting Brett Kavanaugh during steakhouse dinner 
* A left-wing activist group is encouraging social media users to tweet the location of any of the conservative Supreme Court Justices are spotted out and about 
* ShutDownDC is promising a bounty of $50 for anyone who shares a &#x27;confirmed sighting&#x27; and a further $200 if they are still in that location half an hour later 
* The tweet specifically targets Justices Kavanaugh, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Coney Barrett or Roberts 
* Twitter forbids users encouraging others to harass individuals or groups 
* Earlier this week Brett Kavanaugh was eating dinner when activists showed up at the steakhouse where he was forcing him to leave via the back door 
* Incident comes less than a month after a man was charged with turning up at his home and threatening to kill him 
A left-wing activist group is encouraging users on social media to tweet the location of any of the conservative Supreme Court Justices in exchange for money. 
The justices were the majority who voted to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision last month. 
Since then, pro-abortion activists have repeatedly protested outside the justices&#x27; homes and, in some cases, confronted them in public.

Warzone/The Drive: China Acquiring New Weapons Five Times Faster Than U.S. Warns Top Official 
&quot;In purchasing power parity, they spend about one dollar to our 20 dollars to get to the same capability.” 
The Air Force officer responsible for all aspects of contracting for the service has issued a stark warning about China’s rapid gains in defense acquisition, with the result that its military is now getting its hands on new equipment “five to six times” faster than the United States. This is the latest sobering evidence from a U.S. defense official suggesting that the Pentagon needs to urgently overhaul the way it goes about fielding new weapons, while China increasingly appears to be jockeying for the lead in the development of all kinds of high-end military technologies as part of its broader drive to become a preeminent strategic power.

Space.com: Satellites spot construction of Russian anti-satellite laser facility: report  
Anti-satellite technologies are on the rise as space becomes an increasingly vital domain for military activities. 
Recent Google Earth images reveal construction at what appears to be a sophisticated laser system at a Russian space facility designed to blind adversary satellites. 
The construction is taking place at the Russian Ministry of Defense&#x27;s Krona space facility near Zelenchukskaya in Russia&#x27;s far southwest, home of the massive RATAN-600 radio telescope. The existence of this new complex was brought to light in an in-depth open source investigation (opens in new tab) published by The Space Review that analyzed public satellite imagery, solicitation documents from Russian industrial contractors and Russian financial documents.

Severe recruiting shortages in all branches of the service are too serious to ignore. 
Enlisted bonuses as high as $50,000 have not helped much. And the Army has met only 40 percent of its 2022 goal, so it reduced end strength by 22,000 soldiers. 
Traditional, patriotic families are the prime “market” for military recruiting. Pentagon officials and professional marketers, therefore, should objectively consider whether woke Defense Department policies have alienated that core constituency.

Americans&#x27; confidence in newspapers and television news has plummeted to an all-time low, according to the latest annual Gallup survey of trust in U.S. institutions. 
Why it matters: The erosion of trust in media is one of the most significant signs of deepening polarization in America. 
* Political party affiliation has become the primary driver of opinions about the media&#x27;s trustworthiness, as Gallup has noted. 
* A 2021 poll from Pew Research Center found that Republicans are far less likely to trust media sources that are considered &quot;mainstream.&quot;

LANGLEY, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday thanked staff at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency for warning the world about Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s plans to invade Ukraine, and hailed what he called the &quot;quiet bravery&quot; of America&#x27;s spies. 
Marking the CIA&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Biden said he had been involved with the agency for 52 of those years, first as a junior senator on a 1975 committee set up to investigate mind control experiments and other abuses by the agency.

TORONTO/OTTAWA — A major network outage at one of Canada’s biggest telecom operators shut banking, transport and government access for millions on Friday, drawing outrage from customers and adding to criticism over Rogers Telecommunications’ industry dominance. 
Nearly every facet of life was disrupted. Canadians who typically work from home crowded into cafes and public libraries that still offered internet access and hovered outside hotels to catch a signal. 
Canada’s border services agency said its mobile app for incoming travelers was affected. Retailers’ cashless pay systems went down, while banks reported issues with ATM services.

The last episodes of the last season of “stranger thingswhich debuted Friday on Netflix, included several tragic send-offs.  One of the most powerful was the farewell between Millie Bobby Brown’s Eleven and her “Daddy”, the white-haired mad scientist Dr. Martin Brenner, played by Hollywood veteran Matthew Modine.
Brenner, who helped Eleven hone her telekinetic powers at the infamous Hawkins National Laboratory, was the show’s main (human) villain until he was mauled by a Demogorgon at the end of Season 1. But he made a surprise return this season, and Modine brought his unique sense of intellectual menace to the flashbacks that filled the origin stories of Eleven and the villainous Vecna ​​(Jamie Campbell B…</span>

New aerodynamic regulations were introduced at the start of the year, intended to allow cars to follow more closely and to make overtaking easier, making racing more exciting.
A side effect is porpoising, a violent up and down motion caused by airflow blockage under cars, which can also be affected by bouncing when they hit the ground repeatedly.
It was difficult for the drivers.  AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly said he feared “finding himself with a cane at 30” if changes were not made.


“It’s not healthy, that’s for sure,” he said.  “With literally no suspension it goes through your spine. Ultimately my team says we can compromise the setup or compromise my health for the performance.

The reason, he said, was an ongoing disagreement over the number of spam bot accounts on the platform.  Now, the question of what constitutes a spam bot account, and how many currently exist on Twitter, is likely to be at the heart of legal battles between Mr Musk and Twitter over the difficult settlement.
What are spambots?
Although sometimes referred to as “bots”, “spam” or “fake accounts”, all refer to inauthentic accounts that mimic the way people use Twitter.  Some spam accounts are automated, but others are managed by people, which makes them difficult to detect.
Bots can tweet about people, share tweets, follow and be followed by other people, among other things.

Wade, President Biden issued an executive order on Friday aimed at ensuring access to abortion drugs and emergency contraception while preparing for legal battles ahead.
But the order is vague on how the president hopes to achieve those goals, leaving the details largely to Xavier Becerra, his health and human services secretary, who said the administration has “no quick fixwhich can restore access to abortion.

My young self new to New York had a simple but profitable cooking strategy for weeknights: buy the same ingredients every week (pasta, spinach, tomatoes, feta, frozen dumplings, sausage, yogurt), throw in a surprise item (sweet potatoes! cookie butter ice cream! an avocado!) in the cart and everything worked with the rest of my pantry. 
Meals were mundane at times, but hey, I ate, I saved, and I didn’t waste anything.  My fridge is fuller now.

                              <span>Former NHL general manager and scout Craig Button compared Bedard to Steve Yzerman, the Hall of Famer who captained the Detroit Red Wings to the Stanley Cup three times.  “Connor has all the skills, but what impresses me is his intensity like Stevie Y, a killer instinct,” said Button, who follows the entry draft and junior hockey for the TSN network. in Canada.
Such talk could easily turn a 16-year-old’s head, but Bedard seems to be used to it.  He’s been hearing it at least since he was 12, the first year he started skating with NHL players in their off-season practices.  “I skated with them once that summer and I was that annoying little boy there,” he said.  “When I was 14 I skated with them regularly, almost every day they had ice.”
Soon, Vancouver-based pros like Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins of Edmonton, the 2011 first overall pick, would be texting Bedard when rounding up players for practices and scrimmages.  Those sessions gave Bedard a sense of the skill and speed of NHL play, but the business side of the league, especially pre-draft interviews, stresses out a lot of talented teenagers.
Thus, Newport Sports Management, the agency representing Bedard, organized for its client interviews with three general managers of the NHL: Don Sweeney of the Boston Bruins, Kyle Davidson of the Chicago Blackhawks and Yzerman, now at the front office of the Red Wings. .
For Bedard, the most intense was a one-on-one interview with Yzerman.  “We talked for 45 minutes and he asked a lot of questions,” Bedard said.  “In the end it probably became more of a conversation than an interview. I asked him a few questions and he gave me advice on the game and the league.

“Part of the problem is that the country is so polarised,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“Republican voters by and large are fervently pro-gun that it does prevent any kind of action like this from happening … it took an enormous amount of arm-twisting just to get the sixty votes in the senate.”</span>

&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,&quot; Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…</span>

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s main opposition Labour party on Friday threatened to call a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get him to quit immediately, after he was forced to resign by a cabinet revolt.
Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy in the interim.

                              <span>Friday&#x27;s shocking assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stunned the world and drew immediate condemnation, with world leaders praising Abe&#x27;s &quot;global leadership&quot; and slamming a &quot;cowardly attack&quot;.
Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
&quot;Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world&quot;, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France&#x27;s condolences to the Japanese people.

                              <span>TOKYO (Reuters) - Shinzo Abe, Japan&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, who sought to lift the economy out of chronic deflation with his bold &quot;Abenomics&quot; policies, beef up the military and counter China&#x27;s growing clout, has died at 67.
Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called &quot;absolutely unforgivable&quot;.
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
&quot;We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this,&quot; he said.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia&#x27;s largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney&#x27;s west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia&#x27;s east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
&quot;The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,&quot; state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia&#x27;s most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
&quot;We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,&quot; Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia&#x27;s annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia&#x27;s east coast weather for a second straight year.

DW: Russia targets EU, cutting off Kazakhstan&#x27;s oil exports 
This week, Moscow halted crude oil exports from Kazakhstan via a Black Sea port. Kazakhstan is the EU&#x27;s fifth-largest supplier and this effectively reduces oil imports. 
The search is now on for alternative routes.  In a telephone conversation on July 4, Kazakhstan&#x27;s president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev assured EU Council President Charles Michel of his country&#x27;s support in helping the 27-nation bloc overcome its current energy crisis. 
Only a day later, a district court in Novorossiysk — Russia&#x27;s biggest Black Sea port — ordered a pipeline coming from Kazakhstan and exporting oil to Europe shut for a month.

NASA has issued a fierce condemnation of the Russian space agency after three cosmonauts displayed anti-Ukraine propaganda aboard the International Space Station. 
The trio were seen holding flags of the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic — two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine that are only recognised as independent states by Moscow and Syria. 
They also said the capture of the region was &#x27;a liberation day to celebrate both on Earth and in space.&#x27;

Reuters: Taiwan slams &#x27;provocative&#x27; China for sending fighters across Taiwan Strait 
TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese fighter jets crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday in what the island&#x27;s government slammed as a provocation, as a senior U.S. senator visited Taipei for a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen that China condemned. 
China claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up military and political pressure to try and force the island to accept Chinese rule. 
Taiwan&#x27;s Defence Ministry said the Chinese aircraft &quot;intentionally crossed the median line of the strait in a provocative move, which has seriously damaged regional peace and stability&quot;.

RT: Kremlin clarifies Putin’s remark on Ukraine  
Russia is using ‘only a fraction’ of its military capability in the neighboring country, spokesman said  
President Vladimir Putin’s observation that Russian troops in Ukraine “haven’t even really started anything yet” simply states that Moscow is far superior in its military strength, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified on Friday. 
On Thursday, Putin dared Western leaders who seek Russia’s defeat on the battlefield in Ukraine to deliver on the threat. “Let them try. We haven’t even really started anything yet,” he claimed. 
The president “simply reminded [his audience] that the military potentials [of Ukraine and Russia] were incommensurable,” Peskov said. 
“Russian strength is so vast that only a small fraction of it is engaged in the special military operation,” the official said.  Western expectations that Ukraine can defeat Russia militarily are “absurd and only add to the suffering of the Ukrainian people,” he added.

The US wants to launch attacks from Poland and the Baltic states, military intelligence chief claimed  
The US is making plans for a direct war against Russia and its ally Belarus, the head of Belarusian military intelligence warned on Thursday. The scenario is becoming more likely as the proxy war in Ukraine and other ways to hurt the two nations are failing, he claimed. 
“The territory of Poland as well as the Baltic states is being turned into a staging ground, from which the US plans to unleash a new bloody conflict in Europe, targeting the Russian Federation and its allies,” 
Major General Ruslan Kosygin said.

CNN: Biden will rescind Afghanistan’s designation as a major non-NATO ally 
CNN — President Joe Biden in a letter to Congress on Wednesday said that he will officially rescind Afghanistan’s designation as a major non‑NATO ally. 
In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the President wrote: “In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent to rescind the designation of Afghanistan as a Major Non‑NATO Ally.” 
In 2012, the United States named Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally, which cleared the way for the two countries to maintain a defense and economic relationship. Then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the designation during a visit to Kabul.

Members of Canada&#x27;s military will soon be soldiering under much less strict dress rules as the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) introduces updated regulations on personal grooming. 
Under the new rules — which were released Tuesday and go into effect in September — CAF will allow military personnel to, among other things, colour their hair and grow it to any length, and to sport face tattoos.
&quot;The bottom line is, the Canadian Forces Dress Instructions are about fifty years old and so the policy as a whole was overdue for revision,&quot; says a Department of National Defence (DND) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page detailing the update.

                              <span>National Interest: Did Russia Take Out Ukrainian HIMARS Missile Launchers? 
Ukrainian military officials rejected Russia’s claims as “fake.”  The Russian military claimed on Wednesday that it destroyed two High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) missile launchers in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region.
“In the area of the village of Malotaranovka, high-precision air-launched missiles destroyed two US-made HIMARS multiple missile launchers and two ammunition depots for them,” announced Russia’s Defense Ministry, according to Russian news outlet RIA Novosti. 
The Defense Ministry reportedly added that a radar station for a Ukrainian S-300 missile system was destroyed in southern Ukraine. Malotaranovka is located to the south of Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region that sits on the path of Russia’s ongoing offensive in the Donbass region.

WNU Editor: I do not know if these HIMARS systems have been destroyed. The Russian Ministry of Defense has posted what appears to be a Ukrainian HIMARS system and support vehicles being wiped out, but the video was taken from a distance and it is hard to determine what exactly is being destroyed (link here). 
But I would not be surprised if these systems will be knocked out very quickly. I have been told by a regular reader of this blog that these HIMARS launch a very unique missile, and when they are fired they can be quickly spotted by the Russian military.

The launch was intended to test the Mk21A reentry vehicle that will carry the Mk87-1 nuclear warhead on the Minuteman III ICBM’s replacement.  
Late last night an unarmed test of the Air Force’s new Mk 21A intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) reentry vehicle quickly ended with an explosion 11 seconds after launch at Vandenberg Space Force base in California. 
Nobody was injured, but the failure is a setback for the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM program that is intended to replace the aging LGM-30 Minuteman III.

The president cautioned Russia’s rivals against attempting to defeat it on the battlefield  
Russia is ready to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, warning that those who reject such prospects should realize that prolonging the ongoing conflict would only make such talks more difficult. 
“We do not refuse to negotiate peace, but those who refuse should know that the longer they do, the more difficult it will be to negotiate,” Putin said, issuing a warning to those who might think Russia has already exhausted its capabilities amid the conflict.

Daily Mail: Royal Navy reveals it seized Iranian missiles after high-speed pursuit of smugglers&#x27; speedboats in Wildcat helicopters 
* Weapons confiscated in the operation include missiles which breach UN Security Council resolution 2216 
* One of these missiles has a range of over 600m/s and is of the same variety used in the deadly attack on Abu Dhabi  in January 2022 which killed three civilians 
* This is the first time a British Naval ship has intercepted vessels carrying such sophisticated and advanced weaponry from Iran 
* The weapons were thought to be on their way to Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen 
The Royal Navy has revealed one of its warships, the HMS Montrose, seized a stash of deadly weapons off the Iranian coast earlier this year. 
The first-of-its-kind raid took place after helicopter crews noticed smuggler vessels acting suspiciously while on patrol in international waters. 
A number of the weapons seized from the hoard violate a UN Security Council resolution namely surface-to-air-missiles and engines for land attack cruise missiles. 
It is thought the weapons were being transported to Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen.

The deadline for submitting data for the rankings is Friday, and a university spokesperson said officials needed more time to analyze the data and respond to criticisms raised by Professor Michael Thaddeus.

Footage circulating on social media showed Mr Abe, 67, collapsed and bleeding to the ground in the city of Nara, near Kyoto.  Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said Mr Abe was shot in the right neck and left chest.

Police said they arrested a suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami,  charged with attempted murder.  The suspect had used “firearm-like equipment”, which was recovered from the scene, a police spokesman said.

The mainstream press spends a lot of time talking about the dangers of misinformation and their fight against misinformation and the need to control and correct these things.  Not so much when it’s theirs, though, like falsely attributing a viewpoint to a Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas.
Politico a posted a correction to an article they published last week with the title “Clarence Thomas suggests that Covid vaccines are being developed using cells from aborted children”.
The story moved very quickly, amid a flurry of negative press directed at Judge Thomas, and not only had a huge social media presence, but was quickly picked up by other news outlets.  The correction?  Not that much.

I guess that was a funny way of saying it, but I was dead serious.  I have always understood that misogyny and homophobia work in tandem.  One informs the other, so if the right has spent decades plotting and plotting to overturn Roe v.  Wade and outlawing abortion, one has to assume that other rights — especially any related to the LGBTQ community — will be next.

As frustrating as it was to read the Supreme Court’s decision last Friday, at least Justice Clarence Thomas didn’t bother to argue otherwise.

In a separate concurring opinion, Thomas challenged a number of previous court rulings    including Obergefell v.  Hodges, which established marriage equality after giving same-sex co…</span>

Boris Johnson will step down as Prime Minister
Standing alone at a desk outside 10 Downing Street, Boris Johnson announced that he resigns after three years as British Prime Ministerthe result of a massive cabinet rebellion, a wave of government resignations and a devastating loss of party support caused by recent scandals. 
Johnson has tried to keep his job in recent days.  But a dizzying 48 hours, during which two of his most senior ministers resigned, left him with little chance of retaining his support in parliament.  “Most prime ministers would have gotten the message sooner,” said Andrew Gimson, one of Johnson’s biographers.

These cells are the largest bacteria ever observed, thousands of times larger than more familiar bacteria like Escherichia coli.  “It would be like meeting another human the size of Mount Everest,” said Jean-Marie Volland, a microbiologist at the Joint Genome Institute in Berkeley, California.
Dr. Volland and his colleagues published their study of the bacteria, called Thiomargarita magnifica, Thursday in the journal Science.

The Conservative party is preparing to replace the British Prime Minister after he resigned from leadership. 

“One of the most captivating and exciting things about the leadership race is it’s wide open,” she told Sky News Australia.  

“This time, the field is quite varied. We have people from the far right of the party who are Brexiteers to former defence ministers who took part in reality TV shows about diving here in the United Kingdom.

                              <span>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the people now have the commitment from the Australian and New Zealand governments that the two nations will hold annual formal bilateral engagements. 

The meetings will be between ministers of foreign affairs, defence, finance, and climate change.  

“I don&#x27;t underestimate the value and importance and signal of the fact that we have brought the climate portfolio into those annual bilateral exchanges,” she said during a media conference on Friday.  

“Because it&#x27;s so obvious to us that there are ways that we can work together, not only between New Zealand and Australia but together in the work that we want to do within our own region of the Pacific to play our part and step up our role.”</span>

                              <span>Journalist and author Ian Woods says the Conservatives in the United Kingdom need a “safe pair of hands” following the resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 

Mr Wood said there was no “run-away favourite” to succeed Mr Johnson. 

“Perhaps what the conservatives need is a safe pair of hands,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That is the anti-thesis of what Boris Johnson has brought.”</span>

The Guardian: Ukraine summons Turkish envoy after ‘stolen’ grain ship allowed to leave port  
Kyiv protests over ‘unacceptable situation’ as Russian-flagged ship sails from Karasu, where it had been impounded 
Ukraine has summoned the Turkish ambassador after it said Turkey had allowed a Russian-flagged ship carrying what it has claimed was thousands of tonnes of stolen Ukrainian grain to leave the port of Karasu. 
“We regret that Russia’s ship Zhibek Zholy, which was full of stolen Ukrainian grain, was allowed to leave Karasu port despite criminal evidence presented to the Turkish authorities,” said the foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko. “Turkey’s ambassador in Kyiv will be invited to Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs to clarify this unacceptable situation.”

* WNBA star Brittney Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges and now faces up to 10 years in a Russian prison 
* She told the judge: &#x27;I&#x27;d like to plead guilty, your honor. But there was no intent. I didn&#x27;t want to break the law&#x27; 
* Griner&#x27;s legal plea could be a defense strategy. Russian criminal trials are notoriously difficult for defendants, and experts have speculated that Griner could face retribution from authorities if she were to plead innocent

   Newsweek: White House Says Economy is Strongest in History 
The White House said the U.S. economy is the strongest it has ever been, even as Americans struggle to keep up with rising food and gas costs. 
During Thursday&#x27;s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden &quot;understands what the American people are going through&quot; amid inflation and high prices. 
Fox News&#x27;s Peter Doocy asked about a recent poll that found 88 percent of people think the U.S. is &quot;on the wrong track.&quot; 
Jean-Pierre responded that the White House knows the American people are &quot;feeling&quot; the high costs, but assured reporters that the U.S. economy is doing well. 
&quot;We stronger economically than we have been in history,&quot; she said, pointing to decreasing unemployment numbers and new jobs creation.

                              <span>Reuters: War Looms Large Over G20 Event as Russia Meets Rivals in Bali 
NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - G20 foreign ministers head to a joint summit on Friday that will put some of the staunchest critics of Russia invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, in the first such meeting since the war started in February. 
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Europe, the United States and Australia stressing there will be no &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum, without saying what that might entail. 
Russia&#x27;s invasion has cast a cloud over Indonesia&#x27;s presidency of the Group of 20 largest economies this year, with speculation of boycotts from some members and a walkout in April at a finance ministers&#x27; meeting in Washington.

                              <span>Reuters: Oil from U.S. reserves sent overseas as gasoline prices stay high 
HOUSTON (Reuters) -More than 5 million barrels of oil that were part of a historic U.S. emergency reserves release to lower domestic fuel prices were exported to Europe and Asia last month, according to data and sources, even as U.S. gasoline and diesel prices hit record highs. 
The export of crude and fuel is blunting the impact of the moves by U.S. President Joe Biden to lower record pump prices. 
Biden on Saturday renewed a call for gasoline suppliers to cut their prices, drawing criticism from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

The spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the UK stated on Thursday that China strongly condemns and firmly disapproves of the fictitious allegations created against China by US and UK intelligence officials.
The so-called cases they listed, including &quot;stealing&quot; Western technology and interfering and interfering in a congressional election in the US, are pure shadow chasing as well as the typical example of a thief crying &quot;catch thief,&quot; the spokesperson added.

                              <span>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com &quot;Love Actually,&quot; asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist&#x27;s ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 &quot;Morning @snb19692,&quot; tweeted Grant. &quot;Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?&quot;
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
&quot;Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being &#x27;lynched,&#x27; as they put it, by the January 6 Committee,&quot; reported Julia Davis. &quot;Appearing on Tuesday’s…</span>
