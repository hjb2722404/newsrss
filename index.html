                              <span>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the destruction of homes in Ukraine is “devastating” as he visited three towns where Russia has allegedly committed atrocities against civilians.

Russia has denied the accusations but Mr Albanese said he witnessed the aftermath of war crimes.

“The fact that you had such a significant force, you can see the use of tanks, missiles, heavy artillery being used in a civilian area – it’s just devastating,” Mr Albanese said.</span>

                              <span>Amber Heard&#x27;s legal team has requested that the verdict made by jurors in the defamation lawsuit filed by Johnny Depp be dismissed or redone.

Lawyers for the Aquaman star claimed in a 43-page motion that the jury’s verdict should be thrown out on the grounds that it was unsupported by evidence.

A Virginia jury on Wednesday June 1 found the actress liable for defaming her ex-husband in a 2018 Washington Post opinion article in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”.

Ms Heard was ordered to pay Mr Depp more than $US10 million in damages.</span>

* Drones were hailed as a wonder weapon for Ukrainian forces in the early stages of Russia&#x27;s invasion.

* Russia is jamming and shooting downing Ukrainian drones, while developing its own capabilities.

Stories of the success dominated the news cycle, played out on multiple video clips widely distributed on social media, and showed Ukraine&#x27;s drones decimating the chaotic Russian advances. 
Ukraine&#x27;s ad-hoc drone airforce, from small consumer drones typically used for surveillance to the famed Turkish-designed Bayraktar TB2 drones, were credited with eviscerating Putin&#x27;s tanks and armor.

Daily Mail: Disturbing new footage shows moment US Osprey helicopter crashed into USS Green Bay in 2017, killing three young Marines after suffering fatal technical issue 
* Footage released this weekend showed the horrific August 2017 Osprey smash that killed three Marines 
* It was completing a day of practice missions in Australia when it struck the deck of the USS Green Bay and plunged 30 feet into the Pacific 
* The chopper&#x27;s co-pilot, 1st Lt. Benjamin Cross, died in the subsequent crash, as did Pfc Ruben Velasco, 19, and Cpl Nathaniel Ordway, 26 
* Another 23 Marines who were on board the chopper at the time of the smash were rescued 
* A subsequent investigation cleared Cross and his unnamed co-pilot of any wrongdoing, and said technical issues had caused the crash 
* Last month, five decorated Marines were killed in an Osprey crash in California, with some branding the accident-plagued choppers flying death-traps 
Newly-unearthed footage shows the moment a MV-22 Osprey helicopter crashed over the side of a US warship in 2017, killing three Marines who were on board. 
The clip, first posted online Saturday, shows the sophisticated helicopter - which can fly like a plane and hover like a chopper -  trying to land on the deck of the US Green Bay of the coast of Queensland, Australia, on August 5, 2017. 
But the chopper - which has been plagued by fatal accidents that have killed 51 service personnel since its first flight in 1989 - suddenly drops unexpectedly.

                              <span>Bloomberg: JPMorgan Sees ‘Stratospheric’ $380 Oil on Worst-Case Russian Cut 
(Bloomberg) -- Global oil prices could reach a “stratospheric” $380 a barrel if US and European penalties prompt Russia to inflict retaliatory crude-output cuts, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts warned. 
The Group of Seven nations are hammering out a complicated mechanism to cap the price fetched by Russian oil in a bid to tighten the screws on Vladimir Putin’s war machine in Ukraine. 
But given Moscow’s robust fiscal position, the nation can afford to slash daily crude production by 5 million barrels without excessively damaging the economy, JPMorgan analysts including Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note to clients. 
 For much of the rest of the world, however, the results could be disastrous. 
A 3 million-barrel cut to daily supplies would push benchmark London crude prices to $190, while the worst-case scenario of 5 million could mean “stratospheric” $380 crude, the analysts wrote.

Fortune: ‘From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU’: Lavrov says a new Iron Curtain is coming down between Russia and the West 
Back to the Cold War it is, then.  A new Iron Curtain is descending between Russia and the West, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday. 
“From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU,” Lavrov said at a press conference after talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Vladimir Makei. 
“We will do everything necessary not to depend on them in critically important industries.”  Lavrov was concurring with comments made by Makei, regarding the appearance of a new Iron Curtain that was “being erected by Westerners themselves.” In echoing the Belarusian diplomat, Lavrov warned Western countries to “behave carefully.”

* Bulgaria’s expulsion decision was announced by acting Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who took a strong stance against Russia after it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
 * On Friday, Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova issued Bulgaria an ultimatum to reverse its decision and threatened that Moscow would fully sever diplomatic ties. 
Two Russian airplanes were set to depart Bulgaria on Sunday with scores of Russian diplomatic staff and their families amid a mass expulsion that has sent tensions soaring between the historically close nations, a Russian diplomat said. 
Filip Voskresenski, a high-ranking Russian diplomat, told journalists at the airport in Bulgaria’s capital Sofia he was among the 70 Russian diplomatic staff declared “persona non grata” last week and ordered to leave the country before Monday.

“The ship is currently standing at the entrance to the port. It has been detained by the customs authorities of Turkey.&quot;  Turkish officials did not immediately comment.

Tashkent, Uzbekistan — Uzbekistan announced a monthlong state of emergency Saturday in an autonomous republic where rare protests prompted President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to back down on constitutional changes. 
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev&#x27;s press secretary Sherzod Asadov wrote on Telegram that the state of emergency in the Republic of Karakalpakstan would run from just after midnight on Sunday to August 2.  The measure was being taken to &quot;ensure the safety of citizens, protect their rights and freedoms (and) restore law and order&quot; in the territory, the statement added.

Russia has taken control of Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine that was still under Ukrainian control. 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the military had taken over Lysychansk and a number of nearby settlements on Sunday, according to the country’s Ministry of Defense. 
Ukraine’s military announced Sunday that it had been “forced to withdraw” from the critical city.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has accused Ukraine of firing missiles at military facilities on his country’s territory. 
He said the missiles were intercepted by Belarusian air defense systems earlier this week. 
Without providing any evidence of the alleged attack, Lukashenko – a close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin – called the act a “provocation”. 
“Thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Lukashenko said in comments that appeared on his presidential website on Saturday and were also published by state-run news agency Belta. 
He added that there were no soldiers from Belarus currently fighting in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Lukashenko’s claims.

                              <span>The SUN: RED DAWN How US could lose war with China in a WEEK as every ‘simulation’ shows it being crushed over Taiwan 
AMERICA faces defeat by China in a war over Taiwan in just a week and needs to “urgently” up its preparations, a leading expert has said. 
The chilling warning from Oriana Skylar Mastro, an authority on China’s military and US Air Force strategist, comes after years of simulations showing crushing defeats for America. 
China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed unification with the mainland, by force if necessary, while Joe Biden recently promised the US will defend the island. 
Taiwan is effectively an independent country, though not recognised by the internationally, but any moves towards full independence will almost certainly lead to war.

WNU Editor: This is one of many war simulations over Taiwan. But what I find striking about these war scenarios on Taiwan is that most (if not all of them) end with a Chinese victory, including the one above.</span>

A Chinese attack on Taiwan is not imminent, the top US general says, but the US is watching &quot;very closely&quot;.
China is clearly developing the capability to attack at some point, but deciding to do so would be a political choice, Gen Mark Milley told the BBC. 
China says Taiwan is a breakaway province that must be re-unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. 
It has accused the US of supporting Taiwan&#x27;s independence, and vowed to &quot;resolutely crush&quot; any such attempt. 
There has been a marked escalation recently between China and the US - Taiwan&#x27;s most powerful ally.

                              <span>LVIV, Ukraine – Some information is so dark and absurd that it seems to have been conceived in the distorted imagination of bored satirists.  Like the headline from Belarus a few weeks ago, reporting that 10th graders were learning to aim rifles – using shovels.
“What do you think of that?”  asks comedian Vadym Dziunko.
Dziunko is on stage with two other actors and a well-known singer.  All are seated and holding microphones, valiantly trying to find humor in a place and time where the tragic outweighs the funny by a dramatic margin.
It’s a recent Saturday night at Cult Comedy Hall, a comedy club in downtown Lviv, near Ukraine’s relatively peaceful western border.  About 100 people spent about $13 each to eat, drink and listen to comics telling whatever came to mind, which is often the lat…</span>

                              <span>The auto industry is facing troubling signs across the horizon, including rising interest rates and fears of a recession.
But the biggest problem still seems to be making enough cars.
General Motors said Friday its second-quarter U.S. new-vehicle shipments were down 15% from a year earlier, while Toyota Motor reported a 23% drop in U.S. sales.  The obstacle continues to be the inability to obtain enough computer chips to complete the vehicles.
For now, at least, consumers are still eager to buy.  Manufacturers are selling virtually every car or truck they make and have seen no signs of inventory building up at dealerships, even as new vehicle prices hit record highs.


“It tells me that vehicles are always on the move, and that’s probably the number 1 thing I look at,” Paul Jacobson, Gener…</span>

As of Saturday evening, nearly 650 flights in the United States had been canceled and more than 5,200 flights within, to or from the country had been delayed, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.
While the number of problem flights was higher than on a typical travel day, travel demand was also higher. According to the Transportation Security Administration, the number of travelers over the July 4 holiday weekend had reached pre-pandemic levels.  Demand for travel over the same holiday weekend last year had recovered significantly from pandemic lows, but was still below this year’s levels.

Walmart, Darden Restaurants, McDonald’s, Home Depot, Hilton, Dollar General and FedEx, which together employ millions of people across the country, did not say whether they would cover travel for abortions outside of the country. State.  A spokeswoman for Walmart, which has 1.7 million employees in the United States, said the company regularly reviews its benefits based on employee demand, and that the company is “now reviewing the evolution federal and state landscape” when considering its offerings.  The rest of the companies listed did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“We are working thoughtfully and diligently to find the best path forward, guided by our desire to support our associates, all of our associates,” Doug McMillon, Walmart chief executive, wrote in a memo to staff Friday.
Amazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer after Walmart, said it would cover out-of-state abortion travel for its employees, most of whom are hourly workers.  But that perk applies to employees of its healthcare plan, not the contractors who make up a substantial part of its workforce, like its vast network of delivery drivers.
As the list of companies covering abortion-related travel grows, some workers wonder why their employers won’t do the same.  Isabela Burrows, 19, who works at a PetSmart in Howell, Michigan, learned that Roe v.  Wade had been knocked down by a client last week and was frustrated that her company had said nothing.  Michigan has an abortion ban that has been blocked in court and which Democratic leaders have said they will not enforce.

By law, the Department of the Interior is required to publish a plan for new oil and gas leases in federal waters every five years.  This new one, which establishes where the government can sell oil and gas leases from 2022 to 2027, comes at a difficult time for President Biden.
He wants to cut drilling to fight climate change as gas prices rise, allowing his Republican critics to blame his climate policies for the pain at the pump.  In fact, according to most energy experts, the spike in oil price…</span>

The panel’s vote clears the way for the FDA to push manufacturers to make reformulated boosters in time for the Biden administration to offer them later this year, ahead of an expected winter surge of the virus.
The decision came after a day of thinking about where the virus is heading and how best to tackle it.  A senior FDA official called it “science at its toughest.”  One committee member described the data as “uncomfortably sparse”.

                              <span>The leader of the free world Joe Biden has once again shown the great leadership that is keeping western democracies so safe and secure, says Sky News host Rowan Dean.

US President Joe Biden appeared confused as to who was responsible to open up proceedings during a virtual meeting with governors on reproductive rights on Saturday.

&quot;They forgot to give him his notes,&quot; Mr Dean said.

&quot;The bumbling covers an awful lot of sinister stuff that&#x27;s going on in the background.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The Australian’s Environment Editor Graham Lloyd says Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s trip to Madrid for the NATO Summit was successful and significant.

“Australia is all in on the NATO project,” he told Sky News Australia.

“The significance there is NATO is expanding its focus to our part of the world, (and) extremely concerned about the new relationship with no limits that’s been formed between Russia and China.”

Mr Lloyd said Australia is “fully engaged” and recognises the impact of the Ukraine conflict on Europe and Africa.

“We’ve agreed to do what we can to help supply agricultural products and energy into markets that desperately need it,” he said.</span>

The company posted a photo on Twitter of one of its badges including an employee’s pronouns. 

The bank stated if people disagree with the company’s values they are “welcome” to close their accounts. 

“That&#x27;s a brave new way of doing business – telling your customers to take a hike if they don&#x27;t embrace your divisive politicking,” Ms Panahi said.</span>

Ms Panahi said the United States has &quot;completely lost control&quot; of its southern border under Biden&#x27;s administration while &quot;border czar&quot; Kamala Harris has done nothing to stem the tide.

&quot;Record numbers are crossing illegally and tragically many people are being brutalised, raped and even killed due to the evil people smuggling trade,&quot; Ms Panahi said.

&quot;The cost of gross incompetence, the cost of losing control of your borders and allowing the most evil trade to prosper. That is the legacy that Kamala Harris shares with Joe Biden.&quot;</span>

“Obama and then Biden had both talked a very big game on climate action, but neither had the support of Congress to actually get meaningful reforms through,” he told Sky News Australia.

“These sort of things with such sweeping impacts need to be decided by Congress and Biden is just unable to deliver that.

“In the bigger world of climate politics, really this is history repeating itself and Biden’s agenda is pretty much a lame duck.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Q: I’m a retiree with no income but ample cash, and wondering how someone without a traditional source of income can qualify for an apartment when landlords generally require tenants to prove they earn 40 times the rent monthly.  I have to believe that mine is not an uncommon situation.  What other ways can I prove to a future landlord that I can pay the rent?
A: Landlords have enormous discretion when choosing tenants, as long as they don’t discriminate.  In a competitive rental market like this, tenants with non-traditional assets — including retirees, recent graduates, students, and the self-employed — are at a disadvantage simply because the vetting process is more competitive.
The open days are full and bidding wars are rampant.  Some would-be tenants are even bribing brokers and land…</span>

Tesla sells more electric cars than any other company and until recently was growing rapidly in China, Europe and the United States as rising gas prices increased battery appeal.  The company continues to weather supply chain turmoil better than competitors like General Motors and Toyotaboth of which reported a sharp drop in sales on Friday.
Demand for cars, especially electric cars, is plentiful, but shortages of semiconductors and other key components are forcing buyers to wait several months for deliveries.

He was scratching a frozen wall of earth.  Suddenly a big chunk came out.  With him was the body of a baby woolly mammoth, frozen and preserved with its hair and skin.
“I thought it was a baby buffalo at first,” said Mudry, 31, from Alberta.  “And then I came out, and I was inspecting it, and there was a trunk, so I had no words.”


The mammoth was dark and shiny, Mr. Mudry said, with short legs and deep, pronounced eye sockets.  It had a lean, wrinkled trunk and a stub of tail.  He quickly waved to a colleague and called his boss, Brian McCaughan, the co-founder of a family-owned gold mining business called T…</span>

                              <span>This month will mark a new chapter in the search for extraterrestrial life, when the most powerful space telescope ever built begins to spy on planets that orbit other stars.  Astronomers hope the James Webb Space Telescope will reveal whether any of these planets harbor atmospheres that could support life.
Identifying an atmosphere in another solar system would be quite remarkable.  But there’s even a chance, albeit a tiny one, that one of these atmospheres offers what’s called a biosignature: a signal from life itself.
“I think we can find planets that we think are interesting – you know, good possibilities for life,” said Megan Mansfield, an astronomer at the University of Arizona.  “But we won’t necessarily be able to identify life immediately.”

The storm, something of a surprise, formed hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall in Nicaragua.
Hake was expected moving slowly through the Carolinas over the weekend and dissipating early Monday.


On Saturday morning, heavy rain and high winds continued along the coast.  Maximum sustained winds remained near 40 miles per hour.


Forecasters warned that tropical storm conditions were expected in North Carolina from Saturday morning through Sunday.  Heavy rain was expected, with some areas expected to receive up to four inches.

However, as evidenced by the inherent correlation of digital assets with the Nasdaq 100, most people fail to conceptualize blockchain as anything other than an extension of the traditional tech economy.  While blockchain proponents praise its virtues and potential, they have been unable to present a full case for blockchain to ordinary people.

Many crypto natives anticipate “decoupling,” in which digital assets become financially independent from traditional tech stocks.  But without a clear action plan on how to differentiate decentralized crypto technology, industry independence will not be achieved.  Those of …</span>

This game plan probably sounds familiar to many of you, because it is the living legacy of white supremacy and oppression embedded in the social, economic, and political systems of the United States.  The same strategy used on Indigenous peoples has been used on Black, Brown, Asian and Pacific Islander communities, immigrants, refugees and undocumented people, and other intersectional identities who, like us, remain targets.

By Friday, the storm had strengthened slightly and moved into the southwest Caribbean Sea.  Bonnie strengthened further before making landfall Friday evening near the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border, where tropical storm warnings were in effect, according to the National Hurricane Center.  The storm, which was moving at 16 mph, was expected to pass through the region on Saturday.
While the system was expected to weaken as it crossed Central America, it was expected to strengthen once it reached the warmer waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean on Saturday.

                              <span>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — At least three people were killed by an earthquake in southern Iran early Saturday morning, state television reported.
“Unfortunately, so far we have had three fatalities and eight injuries,” Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of emergency management for Hormozgan province on Iran’s Persian Gulf coast, said in the report.
Iranian media said the quake had a magnitude of 6.1, while the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Center put it at 6.0.  The quake struck at a depth of 10 kilometers, or just over six miles, the European monitoring group said.  Tremors were felt in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.


Major geological faults crisscross Iran, which has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years.

At a nighttime happening, young women danced in tunics made of polyurethane birch logs and ponchos studded with foam rocks resembling riverbeds.  Like elves of nature, the dancers frolicked on “nature carpets”, foam carpets made by the Turin artist Piero Gilardi.  Guests sipped their Camparis lying on mock cabbage patches.
In the radical sass of a forest glade-like nightclub, Gilardi delivered a serious message, embodying the ecological lesson of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.”” wrote a few years ago: Chemicals were poisoning the earth.  Nature begins at home.  Live with it, respect it, protect it.

Military says one UAV downed by F16 fighter jet, the other two by missiles launched from ship; terror group has warned it will attack site; Lebanon claims field is disputed  The Israel Defenses Forces said Saturday it successfully intercepted three drones flown by the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group that were heading for the Karish gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast.  Tensions have risen over the site in recent weeks, after a gas production vessel arrived in Israel to launch extraction operations in the offshore field, drawing condemnation from Lebanon, which had laid claim to parts of it.

Protesters stormed Libya&#x27;s parliament building in the eastern city of Tobruk on Friday, demonstrating against deteriorating living conditions and political deadlock, Libyan media reported. 
Several television channels said that protesters had managed to penetrate the building and committed acts of vandalism, while media outlets showed images of thick columns of black smoke coming from its perimeter as angry young protesters burned tyres. 
Other media reports said part of the building had been burned.  The parliament building was empty as Friday falls on the weekend in Libya.

Breaking Defense:  DoD agency wants to put weapons monitors on the ground in Ukraine 
“Once we have more people in country, we should be in a position to actually go do more physical validation [and] verification, going forward,” said Jed Royal, deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. 
WASHINGTON:  The Defense Department agency responsible for overseeing foreign arms sales would like to have a presence on the ground to monitor the use of US weapons in Ukraine, but when that will happen is still unclear, its deputy director said Thursday. 
“We do think that over time, we would like to be able to extend our insights with a greater presence on the ground going forward,” Jed Royal, deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, told reporters during a roundtable. 
During peacetime, DSCA sends personnel to a foreign nation to open warehouses and arms bunkers to examine equipment and check the serial numbers of high-value weapon systems, Royal said. “Right now, in Ukraine, that’s just not available to us as a tool.”

* The survey, which polled a pool of 1,000 US voters, was conducted by the University of Chicago&#x27;s Institute of Politics in May 
* Thirty-seven percent who supported armed insurrection against the government currently own guns, the poll found 
* The survey found that overall, 49 per cent of Americans agreed that they &#x27;more and more feel like a stranger in my own country&#x27; 
More than quarter of Americans - 28 per cent - said that it might &#x27;soon be necessary to take up arms&#x27; against the US government, according to a new poll released Thursday. 
Of those who felt that way, 37 per cent currently own guns, the poll found. 
The poll also showed that a majority of Americans - liberal and conservative both - felt that their government was &#x27;corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me.&#x27;

A referendum is expected to be held on July 25 to decide the document’s fate, and, according to some, the fate of the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings. Tunisia’s 2014 constitution established a representative republic based on a parliamentary system, but Saied’s draft, if accepted by voters, would derail it.</span>

With his one-year-old daughter on his shoulders and his pregnant wife beside him, he crossed the Rio Grande from the Mexican city of Piedras Negras into Eagle Pass, Texas -- a dangerous journey that thousands of migrants undertake every year seeking a better future.
&quot;I was afraid for my daughter in the river. I feel tired, defeated, but with the dream of working if the immigration services listen to us with their hearts,&quot; says the 30-year-old Guatemalan.
The family left their home in Honduras because of crime and a lack of work, and made the long trip by train and on foot to get here.
He and his wife, walking with a painful gait and eyes half-closed, make their way over to the border patrol waiting for them under one of the bridges that link Mexico and the Unite…</span>

&quot;Greater ambition is required at all levels to address the dire state of the ocean,&quot; the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon said in its final declaration.
The meeting in the Portuguese capital -- attended by government officials, experts and advocates from 140 countries -- is not a negotiating forum.
But it sets the agenda for final international negotiations in August on a treaty to protect the high seas -- those international waters beyond national jurisdiction.

                              <span>A series of strong earthquakes rocked southern Iran on Saturday, killing at least five people and causing damage to dozens of buildings, state media reported.
The quakes, including two of magnitude 6.0, struck west of the major port city of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan province, the US Geological Survey said.
The first rattled an area north of the town of Dezhgan shortly after 2:00 am (2130 GMT), before a 5.7 tremor hit two hours later followed quickly by the second 6.0 magnitude quake, said the USGS.
Hormozgan governor Mehdi Dousti said five people were killed, as cited by the official news agency IRNA.
Dousti said most of the damage occurred in the village of Sayeh Khosh, close to the epicenter.

                              <span>Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon reached a record level during the first half of 2022, the INPE national space agency said Friday.
The world&#x27;s largest tropical rainforest lost 3,750 square kilometers (1,450 square miles) of jungle since the beginning of the year, the worst numbers for that period since record-keeping began in 2016.
The previous worst figure of 3,605 square kilometers was set last year.
The new figure does not even include the final six days of June.
This year has seen the worst June in 15 years for forest fires.
Monthly records were also beaten in January and February, when deforestation is usually lower, and in April.
INPE satellites identified more than 2,500 fires in the Amazon last month, the largest number since more than 3,500 were recorded in June 2007, and an 11 percent increase over June 2021.
More than 7,500 fires have been recorded since the start of the year, another 17 percent increase on 2021 and the worst numbers since 2010.
&quot;The dry season has barely begun in the Amazon and already we&#x27;re beating environmental destruction records,&quot; said Cristiane Mazzetti, from Greenpeace Brazil.
Environmentalists and opposition figures accuse the government of President Jair Bolsonaro of implementing policies that encourage big businesses to damage the environment.
&quot;The impact of this negligence will be the increasing loss of the resilience of these surroundings, not to mention the damage done to local communities and health,&quot; said Mariana Napolitano, of the Brazilian World Wildlife Fund.
Bolsonaro has encouraged mining and farming activity in protected areas.
Critics also accuse him of supporting impunity for gold prospectors, farmers and logging traffickers involved in illegal deforestation.
Last year, the main government environmental protection body spent only 41 percent of its surveillance budget, according to the Climate Observatory NGO.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Tropical storm Bonnie made landfall near the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border on Friday evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Heavy rainfall is expected across Nicaragua and Costa Rica
through Saturday, along with life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, the center added.
The storm is likely to weaken as it crosses land, only to re-intensify over the eastern Pacific on Saturday night and Sunday, the center added.
The storm packed maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts before it made landfall, the NHC said.

                              <span>Tuesday&#x27;s breathtaking testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson before the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol is a turning point in how Donald Trump is viewed by Republicans, a former GOP governor explained on CNN.
Wolf Blitzer interviewed former two-term Ohio Gov. John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Kasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.
&quot;Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?&quot; Blitzer asked.
 &quot;Oh yeah. he&#x27;s taking on water,&quot; Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.
&quot;And he&#x27;s shrinking,&quot; he continued. &quot;You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting.&quot;
&quot;And I feel that he&#x27;s melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, &#x27;You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.&#x27; The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman&#x27;s testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath,&quot; he said. &quot;If they don&#x27;t agree with her story, with what she&#x27;s been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath.&quot;
&quot;The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe in our country we would&#x27;ve had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much. I never felt he was fit for the office and it&#x27;s all proven out to be true, unfortunately,&quot; he said.

                              <span>The sovereign citizen movement is expanding rapidly, and can now be found in at least 26 countries.

The movement is anti-government in nature, and its followers believe they’re immune from the laws of their government. They also have a proclivity for violence, as demonstrated by a number of high-profile incidents, including an armed standoff in Massachusetts in July 2021.
As a behavioural scientist and researcher of this movement, I have been monitoring Romana Didulo, a conspiracy influencer based in British Columbia, who has proclaimed herself “Queen of Canada,” “commander-in-chief,” “Head of State and Government” and “president and national Indigenous chief of the Kingdom of Canada.” 
Recently, Didulo has promoted herself to “Queen of the World.”

Located at the confluence of Hellenistic and Indian cultures, Mes Aynak -- believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old -- was once a vast city organised around the extraction and trade of copper.
Archaeologists have uncovered Buddhist monasteries, stupas, fortresses, administrative buildings and dwellings, while hundreds of statues, frescoes, ceramics, coins and manuscripts have also been unearthed.
Despite looting at the beginning of the century, Mes Aynak is &quot;one of the most beautiful archaeological sites&quot; in the world, says Bastien Varoutsikos, an archaeologist for the French company Iconem,…</span>

Beneath a sparkling chandelier in a mirrored salon, and with a dozen or so close friends and family in attendance, the couple exchanged touching words recalling their years together and love for each other.
&quot;You are a wonderful person,&quot; said Aline, looking into Laure&#x27;s eyes.

                              <span>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States, as supporters denounced the British government.
Assange, who turns 51 on Sunday, has been held in a high-security prison since 2019.
On Friday his wife Stella was among dozens of people who demonstrated outside Britain&#x27;s interior ministry to demand his release.
Home Secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition last month, but court officials confirmed to AFP an application to appeal had been received on Friday.
&quot;We&#x27;re not at the end of the road here,&quot; Stella Assange, who married the Australian publisher earlier this year, told reporters when Patel announced her decision.
&quot;We&#x27;re going to fight this. We&#x27;re going to use every appeal avenue.&quot; 
Assange is wanted to face trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010, related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could face decades in jail if found guilty, but supporters portray him as a martyr to press freedom after he was taken into UK custody following a years-long stay in Ecuador&#x27;s embassy.
&quot;He&#x27;s been in prison for telling the truth,&quot; supporter Gloria Wildman, 79, told AFP at Friday&#x27;s protest.
&quot;If Julian Assange is not free, neither are we, none of us is free,&quot; she said.</span>

                              <span>The UN&#x27;s cultural agency on Friday inscribed the culture surrounding beetroot soup known as borscht  in Ukraine on its list of endangered cultural heritage, a recognition sought urgently by Kviv after its invasion by neighboring Russia.
Ukraine prizes borscht , a nourishing soup with beetroot as its base, as a national dish even though it is also widely enjoyed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland.
The Ukrainian culture of borscht  cooking &quot;was today inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding,&quot; by a UNESCO committee, it said.
The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and the &quot;negative impact on this tradition&quot; caused by the war, the agency said.

                              <span>The trial of US basketball star Brittney Griner, detained in Russia since February, opened on Friday as tensions rage over Moscow&#x27;s offensive in Ukraine.
&quot;The trial has started,&quot; Polina Vdovtsova, the spokeswoman for the court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow, told reporters.
Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist and WNBA champion, faces up to 10 years in prison on charges of drug smuggling. 
The trial was partially closed, with a limited media presence, which Vdovtsova said was &quot;on the request of the defence, the request of Griner herself&quot;.
The six-foot-nine star was brought into court in handcuffs. She wore a white T-shirt with US music icon Jimi Hendrix on it.
The 31-year-old came to Russia in February to play there during the US off-season, and was detained at a Moscow airport …</span>

The Chinese Communist Party places great importance on anniversaries, and the trip presented Xi with an opportunity to emphasize China&#x27;s authority over Hong Kong after three years of political upheaval there.
&quot;Xi&#x27;s speech and language reiterated the political message to Hong Kong since the national security law,&quot; political scientist Kenneth Chan from Hong Kong Baptist University told AFP.

Bachman, who wrote the original &quot;American Woman&quot; with his band The Guess Who, was in Tokyo for the emotional handover on Friday -- 46 years after his cherished orange Gretsch was snatched from a Toronto hotel.
&quot;Wow,&quot; a stunned Bachman said, holding the guitar lovingly and tuning it up on stage before playing in a special concert at the Canadian Embassy.
The 78-year-old told AFP he had been &quot;pretty much devastated&quot; by the theft.
&quot;With that guitar, I wrote many million-selling songs... it was like my magical guitar. And then when it&#x27;s suddenly gone, the magic i…</span>

Moscow has expanded the list of commodities that must be paid for in Russian currency  
The Russian government has added grain, sunflower oil and extracted meal to the list of exports that must be paid for in rubles. 
A resolution giving effect to the decision was adopted on Friday and published on the official portal of legal information.   It also provides for a one-year extension of duties to be paid in the national currency in respect of exported sunflower oil and sunflower meal until August 31, 2023.

Business Insider: Oil shippers are hiding Russian cargoes by paying in Chinese yuan, exchanging weapons for crude, and &#x27;going dark&#x27;
* Oil shippers are using several tactics to hide that they&#x27;re carrying Russian crude exports, the Guardian reported. 
* Using China&#x27;s yuan instead of the dollar in trading and exchanging weapons or food for supplies are just two. 
* Russian oil exports bought by India and then re-exported may end up in European gas stations, analysts say. 
Oil shippers are using several tactics to conceal that their crude cargoes are from Russia, sources told the Guardian, as Europe and the US try to stem imports. 
At the same time, concerns are growing that India, which has snapped up Russian oil at discounted prices, has the potential to be used as a &quot;back door&quot; for those supplies to enter Europe, the Guardian reported Sunday.
