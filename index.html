DW: Spike in German troop numbers asking not to be sent to war 
It&#x27;s fewer than 1,000 troops, but nevertheless, the number of German Bundeswehr soldiers who asked to be exempted from serving in war zones rose markedly in 2022. This option dates back to the era of national service. 
Almost 1,000 German military personnel applied for an exemption from serving in combat zones in 2022, a sharp rise on 2021&#x27;s figures, according to a report published on Friday. 
A spokesperson for the German ministry responsible for processing the applications told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland group of newspapers that 951 Bundeswehr soldiers had applied for the exemption. 
 &quot;In 2021, 201 applications for exemption from combat service were received, in 2022 it was a total of 951 applications,&quot; the spokesperson for the Ministry for Family and Civil Affairs told the newspapers.  
The Bundeswehr has roughly 183,000 serving personnel, meaning far fewer than 1% of troops applied for the status in all.

Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - The Big Push To End The War 
Over Christmas I had a short talk with a relative about the war in Ukraine. He asked me who would win and was astonished when I said: &quot;Ukraine has zero chance to win.&quot; That person reads some German mainstream news sites and watches the public TV networks. With those sources of &#x27;information&#x27; he was made to believe that Ukraine was winning the war. 
One may excuse that with him never having been in a military and not being politically engaged. But still there are some basic numbers that let one conclude from the beginning that Russia, the much bigger, richer and more industrialized country, had clearly all advan…</span>

Reuters: World food prices hit record high in 2022 
PARIS (Reuters) -A surge in the cost of most food commodities last year, as the disruption caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of shortages, sent the U.N. food agency&#x27;s average price index to the highest level on record. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 143.7 points in 2022, up 14.3% from 2021, and the highest since records started in 1990, the agency said on Friday. 
The index had already gained 28% in 2021 from the previous year as the world economy recovered from the impact of the pandemic. 
Food prices surged after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February last year on fears of disruptions to Black Sea trade. T
hey have pared some of their gains since, in part because of a U.N.-backed grain export channel from Ukraine and the prospect of improved supplies in producing countries.

In a recent interview, the head of Ukraine&#x27;s military intelligence hinted at a possible end date for his country&#x27;s war with Russia. 
Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, told ABC News in an interview shared by the outlet on Wednesday that he expects the &quot;hottest&quot; fighting between Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s forces to occur in March. 
Budanov added that he expects Ukraine&#x27;s military to make a large push against the invading Russians in the spring. According to him, those efforts could lead to what Ukraine feels would be an end to the war. 
&quot;This is [when we will see more] liberation of territories and dealing the final defeats to the Russian Federation,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;This will happen throughout Ukraine, from Crimea to the Donbas.&quot;

* Russia&#x27;s 36-hour ceasefire to allow for Orthodox Christmas celebrations was set to begin at midday, after it was ordered by Vladimir Putin on Thursday evening 
* But outgoing and incoming shelling could still be heard in eastern Ukraine 
* Ukrainian officials said the city of Kramatorsk was hit, as was Kherson 
Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its positions as Vladimir Putin&#x27;s unilateral 36-hour &#x27;truce&#x27; gets under today, with Ukraine blaming Moscow for the strikes. 
The ceasefire - proposed by the Russian despot on Thursday to run from from 12pm, January 6 to midnight on January 8 - was rejected Thursday  by Ukraine as a Moscow sham, with analysts suggesting it was an attempt to allow Putin&#x27;s forces to regroup. 
Just hours after the 36-hour truce was set to begin, rockets slammed into a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk close to Bakhmut and on the eastern frontline, damaging 14 homes but with no casualties, the mayor said.

Breaking Defense: F-35 program pauses engine acceptance as crash investigation continues  
The news comes just a few days after prime contractor Lockheed Martin reached an agreement with the government on a $30 billion contract for hundreds more F-35s. 
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has temporarily stopped accepting engines for the F-35 joint strike fighter while it investigates the cause of a mid-December crash of an F-35B jet. 
“Currently, acceptance of new engines has been suspended,” JPO spokesman Chief Petty Officer Matthew Olay said in a statement. “That pause began Tuesday, Dec. 27. The length of the pause is currently to be determined, and it is hard to say how long it will last given the current investigation of what specifically would allow deliveries to resume. The root cause analysis and accident investigation need to be completed first.”

Armed men took hostages, burned vehicles and stormed an airport in northern Mexico on Thursday after federal forces captured Ovidio Guzmán, one of the world&#x27;s most wanted cartel leaders and the son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. 
The 33-year-old drug boss was arrested after a predawn gunfight in a town north of the city of Culiacán, a stronghold of the Guzmáns’ Sinaloa cartel. 
Even as the cartel mounted attacks across the state, the air force was able to fly the younger Guzmán to Mexico City, said Mexican Secretary of Defense Luis Cresencio Sandoval González.

Zero Hedge: Shots Fired In Tense Greece-Turkey Patrol Boat Ramming Incident 
Turkish media is confirming a major incident between a Turkish coast guard vessel and a Greek coast guard patrol boat on Thursday, describing that the Greek patrol was harassing Turkish fishing boats before Turkish coast guard authorities intervened. But Athens has countered that it was the Turkish side harassing Greek vessels. 
Both sides are saying warning shots were fired and are attributing acts of aggression to the other side: &quot;A Greek coast guard patrol boat’s crew fired warning shots early Thursday to deter a Turkish coast guard vessel that was trying to ram them in the eastern Aegean Sea, authorities in Athens said, as tensions between the two neighbors remain high,&quot; the Associated Press reports.

Air Force Times: Bombers Necessary To Deter And Defeat 
Freedom-loving nations are threatened on multiple fronts by authoritarian regimes in an increasingly dangerous and unpredictable world. The bungled U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan set off a domino effect that emboldened totalitarian leaders across the globe. When America projects weakness, our adversaries will seek to capitalize. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s continued military aggression towards Taiwan, and Iran’s threats against our partners in the Middle East put America at center stage to prove once again why it’s the world’s most dominant and indispensable power. To keep rogue actors at bay and the chaos they unleash on security, America must be resolute in projecting strength and, if necessary, utilizing lethal force. A healthy and capable U.S. bomber fleet is vital to achieving these goals.

Defense News/AP: Drone advances in Ukraine could bring new age of warfare 
KYIV, Ukraine — Drone advances in Ukraine have accelerated a long-anticipated technology trend that could soon bring the world’s first fully autonomous fighting robots to the battlefield, inaugurating a new age of warfare. 
The longer the war lasts, the more likely it becomes that drones will be used to identify, select and attack targets without help from humans, according to military analysts, combatants and artificial intelligence researchers. 
That would mark a revolution in military technology as profound as the introduction of the machine gun. Ukraine already has semi-autonomous attack drones and counter-drone weapons endowed with AI. Russia also claims to possess AI weaponry, though the claims are unproven. But there are no confirmed instances of a nation putting into combat robots that have killed entirely on their own.

Navy XQ-58As loaded with sensors and weapons will help demonstrate autonomous drone capabilities able to penetrate enemy air defenses.  
The U.S. Navy is set to become the newest operator of Kratos&#x27; XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, at least that we know about. The service recently awarded the company a contract for the purchase of two of these stealthy low-cost uncrewed aircraft as part of a previously unknown program called the Penetrating Affordable Autonomous Collaborative Killer. The U.S. Air Force, the only currently known user of the XQ-58A, has been using its Valkyries for various test purposes, including projects that are feeding into the classified Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. 
The Pentagon announced that the Navy had finalized a deal to buy the pair of XQ-58As in a daily contracting notice on December 30, 2022. The contract, which came through Naval Air Systems Command&#x27;s (NAVAIR) Naval Air Warfare Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) and is valued at $15,515,343, covers the production and delivery of the drones, as well as unspecified &quot;sensor and weapon system payloads.&quot;

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Cold War estimates of deaths in nuclear conflict 
Apprehension about Russia’s war against Ukraine has produced speculation about the possibility of limited Russian nuclear strikes against targets in that country. Especially worrisome is the danger of a local conflict escalating quickly into a major nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States and other NATO countries. However unlikely that prospect, a large-scale nuclear war involving countries with strategic nuclear forces could cause huge numbers of fatalities and injuries in addition to the losses produced by climactic impacts. A recent study in the journal Nature projects a catastrophic 5 billion deaths.

Russia to introduce new multi-warhead nuclear missiles in invasion of Ukraine  Russia is bolstering its strategic nuclear forces in 2023 with further deployment of multi-warhead nuclear missiles and further modernization of its long-range strategic bomber division, the Russian Defense Ministry announced this week. 
The Strategic Rocket Forces branch of the Russian military is set to complete the replacement of the older Topol-M missile system with the RS-24 Yars among its mobile grouping, the ministry said on Tuesday. 
The Yars mobile ground missile system is a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV), which contains several thermonuclear warheads, each of which can hit different targets.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday warned the United States that hypersonic missiles would soon be close to NATO&#x27;s shores after the U.S. embassy said in a video it stood in solidarity with Russians who opposed the war in Ukraine. 
Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the most deadly wars in Europe since World War Two and the deepest crisis in Moscow&#x27;s relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. 
&quot;The main gift for the New Year with an ammunition package of Zircon missiles left yesterday for the shores of NATO countries,&quot; Medvedev said, referring to President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s deployment of a warship with hypersonic cruise missiles to the Atlantic. 
Medvedev said the missiles could be placed 100 miles (160 km) off the U.S. coast, adding: &quot;So rejoice! It will bring to their senses anyone who poses a direct threat to Russia and our allies.&quot;

RT: Serbia issues grim prediction for 2023  
President Aleksandar Vucic has warned of food and energy shortages due to anti-Russia sanctions 
The US, EU and China face serious economic struggles in 2023, which is shaping up to be more difficult than the previous year, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic warned on Wednesday. 
Belgrade is trying to stock up on basic food supplies, as the world is likely to face shortages soon, he added.  “I expect 2023 to be much more difficult than 2022,” Vucic told reporters in Belgrade. 
The US federal reserve has raised interest rates, “China’s growth rate has slowed, the EU is approaching a recession,” he added. “We’re a part of that chain, so that will impact us as well.”
Serbia has taken precautions to stock up on natural gas and coal, and should have some left over by the spring, Vucic said, but he is working with Hungary to “secure supplies right away for the next winter, which will be worse.”

The Independent: Russian politician sends piece of shrapnel to Macron after he survives being hit by French-made howitzer 
The former head of Russia’s space agency, who was hit by a French-made howitzer during a Ukrainian attack on Donetsk last month, has sent Emmanuel Macron a piece of the shrapnel that was removed from his body. 
Dmitry Rogozin, who has also served as Russia’s deputy prime minister, was injured when a Ukrainian shelling attack hit the restaurant outside Donetsk where he was celebrating his birthday, according to the independent Russian outlet SOTA. 
Mr Rogozin, 59, was visiting Ukraine and giving military advice to Russian troops in two regions that were annexed by Russia in December.

CNN: China’s new supercarrier will soon undergo first sea trials, officer says 
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — The Chinese navy’s massive new aircraft carrier, the CNS Fujian, is expected to head to sea for the first time this year, the ship’s executive officer said in an interview with state media. 
In a report on the interview published Tuesday by state-run China Daily, Senior Capt. Qian Shumin did not give an exact date for when the aircraft carrier will undergo its first sea excursions, saying only that “the trials will contribute to the realization of the centenary goals of the People’s Liberation Army.”
That centenary, which comes in 2027, was referenced by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in October as a deadline for the PLA to meet its modernization goals. 
The Fujian is the largest warship China has ever built and bringing it into operation is a key component in the PLA Navy’s objectives.

The Taliban’s signing of an international oil deal with the Chinese was televised on Thursday--its first international agreement since it took over Afghanistan in August 2021, according to the Diplomat. 
The Taliban struck a 25-year deal with China-based Xinjiang central Asia Petroleum and Gas Co (CAPEIC) for the Amu Darya oil project.
Under the terms of the deal, CAPEIC will invest $150 million per year over the next three years in Afghanistan, then $540 million per year for the next 22 years. The Taliban will carry a 20% share in the project but will have the option to increase its stake to 75%.

South Korean officials now admit they failed to stop a North Korean drone flying close to the presidential office in the capital.  
A North Korean drone last week entered a no-fly zone around the office of the South Korean president, military officials in Seoul have confirmed. 
The North Korean unmanned aerial vehicle was one of five that crossed the border on December 26, in the first incident of its kind in five years, which you can read about in our previous coverage here. 
While various South Korean military aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drones, none were shot down, leading to growing criticism about the ability of Seoul’s air defenses to tackle these kinds of threats.

First Lady Rosangela &quot;Janja&quot; da Silva gave Brazil&#x27;s biggest broadcaster, TV Globo, a tour of the Alvorada Palace, the presidential residence in Brasilia, to highlight what she described as its shoddy condition at the end of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s four-year tenancy.
Da Silva, who married newly inaugurated leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in May, said important parts of the iconic modernist building were left in &quot;deteriorated&quot; condition.
She showed the camera crew torn rugs, damaged floors, a broken window, a ceiling stained by water leaks, a massive banquet …</span>

Iconic product failures put on display at the CES consumer electronics show included a skin-toning face mask reminiscent of a horror film; eyewear embedded with therapeutic magnets and a model of failed 80s sports car DeLorean.
&quot;Many founders have this bias where they think they&#x27;re geniuses and everything that they are doing is super right,&quot; the gallery of failures organizer, Prelaunch founder Narek Vardanyan told AFP.

                              <span>reported that a passenger on an Air India flight was detained after drunkenly urinating on an empty seat and another passenger&#x27;s blanket.


	&quot;Officers from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), an Indian federal police force, detained the man when the flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Fortune reported,&quot; the story continued. &quot;The man and the other passenger discussed the incident came to an &#x27;understanding,&#x27; an airline representative said. He gave the passenger a written apology, and she did not want the airline to file a police report. The man was then allowed to leave the airport.&quot;

similar incident happened last month, when a business class passenger urinated on an elderly woman. According to The Hindu, &quot;The airline not only failed to hand him over to security personnel but also forced the woman to sit in the urine-soaked seat for a part of her journey.&quot;

This comes after a number of U.S. airlines went through years of elevated incidents on flights, spurred in part by passengers enraged over mask rules during the COVID-19 pandemic — something which the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately cracked down on with stiff fines, penalties, and criminal referrals in the most severe cases.
In one highly-publicized incident, an intoxicated American Airlines passenger on a flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City screamed racist threats at an Asian woman who had gotten up to stretch her back, then snarled and gnawed on his mask like an animal.</span>

                              <span>Kenyan police are investigating the killing of an LGBTQ rights activist whose body was discovered stuffed in a metal trunk in a killing that has sparked national outrage.
Edwin Chiloba, a 25-year-old fashion designer and model, was found dead by the roadside Wednesday some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the Rift Valley town of Eldoret, media reports said.
Police spokesperson Resila Onyango told Kenya&#x27;s The Star newspaper that the motive of the killing was still unknown.
&quot;Experts are handling the matter,&quot; Onyango said.
Rights activists have called for speedy investigations into attacks on LGBTQ people who face a precarious existence in the predominantly conservative Christian nation.
Homosexuality is taboo in Kenya and across much of Africa, and gays often face discrimination or persecution.
Attempts to overturn British colonial-era laws banning homosexuality in Kenya have proven unsuccessful, and gay sex remains a punishable crime with penalties that include imprisonment of up to 14 years.
&quot;It is truly worrisome that we continue to witness escalation in violence targeting LGBTQ+ Kenyans,&quot; the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Friday.
&quot;Everyday, the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons are being violated with little consequence for perpetrators,&quot; it added, urging the police &quot;to conduct swift investigations and ensure the killers are apprehended and prosecuted&quot;.
The Kenya LGBTQ Feminist Forum in western Kenya where Chiloba lived, said he had used &quot;fashion to deconstruct gender and advocate for the rights of the marginalized group&quot;.
&quot;We want to know as a community as Kenyans, what happened to Edwin, why he was murdered and who dropped his body at the scene,&quot; the group&#x27;s programs director Becky Mududa said.
The death of Chiloba comes after another LGBTQ activist was found murdered in April last year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican security forces captured on Thursday drug cartel leader Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed kingpin Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman, ahead of a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden next week.
Coming three years after a failed operation to detain Ovidio ended in humiliation for the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the arrest triggered a wave of violence that forced authorities to shutter airports and schools in the city of Culiacan.
Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told a news conference that security forces had captured the 32-year-old senior member of the Sinaloa Cartel. Ovidio, a fugitive since the previous arrest attempt, was now being held in the capital Mexico City, Sandoval said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - &quot;That&#x27;s an attack plane, Dad,&quot; said one of David Tellez&#x27;s young children as they spotted Mexican military aircraft touching down alongside their Aeromexico passenger plane early on Thursday.
Then the gunfire began.
&quot;As we were accelerating for take-off, we heard gunshots very close to the plane, and that&#x27;s when we all threw ourselves to the floor,&quot; Tellez said after the incident in the northern city of Culiacan.
Violence broke out on Thursday throughout Culiacan after the arrest of Ovidio Guzman, the son of the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo, and a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel.
Aeromexico said nobody on Tellez&#x27;s flight had been hurt. The Culiacan airport closed shortly after, as security forces patrolled the city, which was strewn with…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Thursday, part of what the U.S. military calls routine activity but which riles China.
In recent years, U.S. warships, and on occasion those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada, have sailed through the strait, drawing the ire of China, which claims Taiwan against the objections of its democratically elected government.
In a statement, the U.S. military said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Chung-Hoon carried out the transit.
&quot;Chung-Hoon’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,&quot; the statement added.
Taiwan&#x27;s Defense Ministry said the ship sailed in a northerly direction through the strait, that its forces had monitored its passage and observed nothing out of the ordinary.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
China has never ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing&#x27;s sovereignty claims are void as the People&#x27;s Republic of China has never governed the island.
A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.

                              <span>ANU Political Scientist Dr Charles Miller says it is “imperative” for the US Republican Party to unite as they remain divided over Kevin McCarthy’s bid for House speaker amid his tenth ballot loss.

“The Republican party is divided between individuals like Mr McCarthy who try and talk the Trumpist populist talk, versus people like Boebert or Gatez who at least appear to be true believers in the Trumpist creed,” Dr Miller told Sky News Australia.

“If the Republicans keep behaving like this, then it will hurt them with the election, they do appear chaotic and unable to do the most basic things when they are in power.

“If things continue in this vein we could be in for a bumpy ride, especially when we’re talking about things that matter for the rest of the world.”</span>

“One of the biggest global trends post-pandemic is people’s deep desire to get out in the great outdoors and wide open spaces,” Ms Osmond told Sky News Australia. 

“We need more international carriers coming in and out of Australia again.”</span>

 Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a 36-hour unilateral ceasefire in Ukraine, timed for the Orthodox Christmas, a move that at least one Ukrainian official derided as a “propaganda gesture” that will likely do little to foster real negotiations or otherwise change the trajectory of the war. 
Putin ordered the Russian military to obey a temporary ceasefire “along the entire line of contact between the parties in Ukraine,” according to a statement from the Kremlin. The halt in Russian fighting i…</span>

Agreement on arms control is getting harder, but it still really matters.
 UNITED NATIONS, Geneva — There was a stretch in December’s late-stage negotiations that seemed pretty bleak. Russia was mad, mostly that no one would entertain its made-up claims of a US-funded bioweapons program in Ukraine. Iran was mad, apparently about sanctions. And everyone was haggling over language in the final review document for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC), the nearly 50-year-old international treaty that prohibits states from developing or deploying biological weapons. 
Diplomats, delegations, and experts feared this is where the review conference (or “RevCon,” as it’s known) might stall out. The review, which takes …</span>

President Biden said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s call for a temporary, Christmas cease-fire is an effort to “find some oxygen,” dismissing that the Kremlin is serious about finding an off ramp for its assault against Ukraine.   
The president said he was “reluctant to respond to anything Putin says,” but characterized the Kremlin as cynically attacking civilians over the December holidays.

                              <span>BBC: Ukraine war: Kyiv rejects Putin&#x27;s &#x27;trivial&#x27; Christmas truce 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to impose a 36-hour ceasefire on the Ukrainian frontline, beginning on Friday. 
The ceasefire, scheduled to start at 12:00 Moscow time (09:00 GMT), will coincide with the Russian Orthodox Christmas. 
Mr Putin asked Ukraine to reciprocate, but Kyiv quickly rejected the request. Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said the truce was an attempt to stop his country&#x27;s military advances. 
The Kremlin statement appeared to stress that President Putin ordered his troops to stop fighting not because he was de-escalating - Putin never de-escalates - but because he had listened to an appeal from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
Patriarch Kirill had, earlier in the day, called for a Christmas truce to allow believers to attend church services for Orthodox Christmas.

WNU Editor: Cannot say that I am surprised by this rejection from the Ukraine government. In a way this ceasefire call was a trap. The optics of rejecting a Christmas truce is never good.

Russia President Vladimir Putin on Thursday allegedly called on Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to order a ceasefire in Ukraine in observation of Orthodox Christmas. 
&quot;Given the appeal of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill, I instruct the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation to introduce a ceasefire regime along the entire line of contact between the parties in Ukraine from 12:00 on January 6 to 24:00 on January 7,&quot; a statement from the Kremlin chief said according to Russian media outlet RIA.

Reuters: Putin tells Erdogan: Ukraine must accept loss of territories for there to be dialogue 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin told Turkey&#x27;s Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday that Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine but that Kyiv would have to accept the loss of territories claimed by Russia, the Kremlin said.
&quot;Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia&#x27;s openness to a serious dialogue, provided that the Kiev authorities fulfill the well–known and repeatedly voiced requirements and take into account the new territorial realities,&quot; the Kremlin said. 
Putin also &quot;acknowledged the destructive role of the West, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance,&quot; the Kremlin said.

Politico:  Why China’s new foreign minister could be a problem for Biden 
Qin Gang’s cooperation could decide the outcome of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s looming China trip. 
The Biden administration shut out outgoing Chinese ambassador Qin Gang for much of his more than 500-day tenure in Washington, D.C.  But that all changed last week when Chinese leader Xi Jinping appointed Qin as the country’s new foreign minister, creating a headache for the administration at a time of high tension between Washington and Beijing. 
The problems will be front and center in the coming weeks when Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits China as the countries clash over trade, Chinese military intimidation of Taiwan and access to technology. 
“I think that there are probably those within the administration that feel chagrined that they did not extend the courtesies [to Qin] that normally would be extended to an ambassador,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.

WNU Editor: How Chinese ambassador Qin Gang was treated by the West does not surprise me. I have seen this type of treatment directed at Chinese officials and diplomats by Western officials and politicians for decades. 
What is a shame. The Chinese look to establish long term relations, especially long term personal relationships. 
The Washington DC elite should be kicking themselves. They lost a golden opportunity.</span>

Members of the division told CBS in October that they were prepared to enter Ukraine if given the order 
About 4,000 members of the US Army’s 101st Airborne Division are still deployed in Romania as part of a military buildup in Eastern Europe that President Biden ordered last year, as the Pentagon is still deciding whether to maintain current troop levels. 
The New York Times reported Tuesday that some 101st soldiers are stationed at a base near the Romanian city of Constanta on the Black Sea while others are further north, just a few miles from the Ukrainian border, and are simulating fighting Russia in Ukraine.

Taiwan News: Swiss firm sends Taiwan&#x27;s &#x27;carrier killer&#x27; devices to China for repairs 
Concerns arise after theodolites used with Hsiung Feng III were sent to China for repairs by Leica Geosystems 
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Concerns have been voiced by Taiwanese media that information could have been leaked after devices used with Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; missiles were sent to China for repairs. 
Amid growing Chinese military threat, Taiwan&#x27;s National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) has developed the Hsiung-Feng III (雄風三型) anti-ship missile, which has been nicknamed the &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; due to its supersonic speed, range of up to 400 km, and 225 kg warhead. However, Mirror Media on Wednesday (Jan. 4), cited sources as saying theodolites used to calibrate the missiles were sent by a Swiss company to China to make repairs due to malfunctions, potentially exposing sensitive data from missile tests and endangering Taiwan&#x27;s national security.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Germany Open to Seizing Russian Assets to Help Ukraine Rebuild 
(Bloomberg) -- Germany is open to using billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild as long as legal issues can be resolved and allies follow suit. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government supports Ukraine’s demand for war reparations but hasn’t yet taken an official position on seizing assets from the Russian state. The issue is complex and some parts of the ruling coalition are more ardent than others, according to people familiar with the discussions. 
The internal tensions reflect the international community’s broader struggle to forge a common position. If Berlin can resolve its own issues, it could provide fresh momentum for discussions in the European Union and put pressure on the US to seize assets, such as central bank reserves, that have been frozen in retaliation over Russia’s invasion.

The Diplomat:  Philippines, China Agree on Measures to Manage Maritime Disputes 
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Xi Jinping agreed to restart joint oil and gas exploration and set up a direct channel of communication on South China Sea issues. 
China is ready to manage its maritime issues with the Philippines “cordially,” China President Xi Jinping reportedly said yesterday, after meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Beijing. 
Citing Chinese state media, Reuters reported today that Xi also told Marcos that China is willing to resume negotiations over the joint exploration of oil and gas resources in non-disputed areas of the South China Sea, cooperate with the Philippines on solar and wind energy, and increase imports of Philippine fishery products.

WNU Editor: This summit is producing some surprising results. For example. I did not expect both sides to come to an agreement where they will work together on joint oil and gas exploration projects in the South China Sea. 
But like everything else when it comes to China. What they say and what they do can sometimes be two different things.

 Barry R. Posen, Foreign Affairs: Russia’s Rebound  
How Moscow Has Partly Recovered From Its Military Setbacks “
All the dumb Russians are dead.” So said Ukrainian officials in July 2022 as they sought to explain why the Russian army had abandoned the overambitious strategy and amateurish tactics that defined its conduct in the early weeks of the war. It was probably too early to make this quip. The Russians continued to do many dumb things and indeed still do. But broadly speaking, the Ukrainians’ intuition in the summer now appears correct: when it comes to overall military strategy, Moscow seems to have gotten smarter. 
Russian strategic decisions are finally starting to make military sense. The …</span>

Reuters: Ukraine to get more armoured vehicles but presses for tanks to fight Russia 
KYIV (Reuters) -Western allies moved toward supplying armoured battle vehicles to Ukraine but not the heavier tanks it has requested to fight Russia, while Washington predicted intense combat would continue for months on the eastern frontline. 
French President Emmanuel Macron told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help its war effort, a French official said on Wednesday after a phone call between them. 
While the official said these would be the first Western armoured vehicles delivered to Ukraine, Australia said in October that it had given Kyiv 90 of its Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles, an armoured unit that is hardened against landmines, small arms fire and other threats.

   Newsweek: Belarus Sign Calls For &#x27;All Male Citizens&#x27; To Attend Enlistment Office 
A video of an electronic announcement at a bus terminal in Belarus calling for males of military age to go to an enlistment center has led to speculation over whether mobilization could take place in the country whose leader is Vladimir Putin&#x27;s close ally. 
The appeal appears on digital signage hanging on the first-floor balcony of the waiting room at the transport hub in the city of Barysau (Barysaw), located in the Minsk region, around 45 miles northeast of the capital city.

WNU Editor: Belarus has been undergoing a number of exercises in the past few months. They have also been telling all males to register at a recruitment office on where they live, how they can be contacted, etc.. I think (and hope) this is what this message is all about.

A Covid strain spreading rapidly in the US is the &#x27;most transmissible subvariant that has been detected yet&#x27;, according to the World Health Organization. 
But XBB.1.5 appears to be just as mild as its ancestor Omicron strains, with hotspots in Northeast America yet to record an uptick in hospital admissions. 
The new subvariant - another spinoff of Omicron -  is behind roughly 70 percent of new infections in the worst affected parts of the US and four in 10 nationally.

Quartz: This chart explains why the US is running low on missiles  
American defense contractors can&#x27;t keep pace as Ukraine drains stockpile. 
 It’s boom times for US defense contractors—and they can’t keep up with demand.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and China’s military build-up have US lawmakers shelling out billions to buy new missiles, aircraft, tanks and helicopters to support allies and prepare for future conflict. Including the most recent tranche of funding passed in December, Congress has enacted about $110 billion in aid to Ukraine, about $40 billion of which will go toward weapons transfers and purchases. 
That’s putting stress on the makers of modern weaponry. Consider that some 1,600 Stinger missiles, used by individual soldiers to attack aircraft, were sent to Ukraine from American stockpiles, but the US stopped making them in 2003. Raytheon, its manufacturer, has restarted production, but doesn’t expect to deliver the weapons in large numbers for a year or more.

DW: North Korean arms development puts Asia on edge in 2023 
The regime in Pyongyang has started 2023 by threatening South Korea and announcing plans for more capable ballistic missiles and a larger nuclear arsenal. 
North Korea has begun 2023 with a series of missile launches and leader Kim Jong Un vowing to increase production of nuclear weapons and develop improved intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), according to statements carried by state-run news agency KCNA. 
Kim has also declared that South Korea is the North&#x27;s &quot;undoubted enemy&quot; and &quot;hell-bent on an impudent and dangerous arms build-up.&quot; 
South Korea has lived in the shadow of aggression from its northern neighbor since the 1950s. However, analysts have said the current threats and provocations emerging from Pyongyang should be a cause for deep concern.

Grey Zone Ethics: A Practitioners Guide to Making Ethically Difficult Decisions
A new book from Small Wars Journal contributor, Dan Pace.  It is a followup to his journal article &quot;A House Divided: A Look at SOF Values&quot;
The special operations community has an ethics problem. While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn&#x27;t preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community&#x27;s treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set.  Grey Zone Ethics provides an accessible and realistic solution to this problem.

                              <span>Aid groups are warning of a dire situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban&#x27;s banning of female NGO workers. Many major international aid groups have suspended their operations, including the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). We spoke to the NRC&#x27;s Afghanistan director, Neil Turner, who said that organisations like his need female employees in order to access the women they serve. He called on the Taliban to live up to their promises, and warned that if the ban is not reversed the effects will be devastating, with millions losing access to food, safe drinking water and vital protection services. &quot;This is a red line for us. We will not resume [our operations] without our female employees,&quot; he told us in Perspective.</span>

                              <span>Intense gunfire rocked a cartel heartland in northwestern Mexico on Thursday after security forces launched an operation in which a son of jailed drug kingpin Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman was reportedly arrested.
Vehicles were set on fire and shooting shook several areas of Culiacan -- the state capital of the Guzmans&#x27; bastion, Sinaloa -- including the city&#x27;s airport, an AFP reporter said.
A security source who did not want to be named told AFP that the violence had broken out after an operation to capture Ovidio Guzman, but did not confirm reports by Milenio TV and other media that he had been captured.
The drug lord&#x27;s son has allegedly helped to run the notorious Sinaloa Cartel since his father was extradited to the United States in 2017.
His capture would be a high-profile win in the war on drugs as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to welcome US President Joe Biden next week for a North America leaders&#x27; summit.
The Sinaloa state government urged people to stay at home on Thursday as the unrest sparked panic among residents seeking shelter.
Lopez Obrador told reporters that his government would announce the result of the operation later in the day.
&quot;El Chapo&quot; is serving a life prison sentence in the United States for trafficking hundreds of tons of drugs into the US over the course of 25 years.
However, his cartel remains one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Ovidio Guzman was captured briefly once before in 2019, but security forces freed him after his cartel waged an all-out war in response in the streets of Culiacan.

Arturo Carlos Murillo Prijic, 59, admitted as part of his plea agreement in Miami federal court that he received at least $532,000 in bribe payments from a Broward-based company so it could land a $5.6 million contract to supply tear gas and other non-lethal equipment to the Bolivian ...</span>

                              <span>Russian President Vladimir Putin on January 5 ordered a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine on Orthodox Christmas, celebrated this week by both countries, according to the Kremlin
This is the first time Russia introduced a full ceasefire in Ukraine since the launch of the offensive in February 2022.
Hypocrisy, says Ukraine
Reacting to the Russiam declaration, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said, Russia “must leave the occupied territories — only then will it have a ‘temporary truce’.” Mr. Podolyak further tweeted: “Keep hypocrisy to yourself.”
The announcement comes following a request for a ceasefire during the religious holiday from Russia’s 76-year-old Orthodox leader Patriarch Kirill.

                              <span>On Thursday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Greater Vancouver Zoo is being sued after a toddler was attacked by bears into whose enclosure she had reached.
&quot;The notice of civil claim filed in British Columbia Supreme Court by the girl’s guardian, Richard Hanson, says the August, 2019, incident left her with a fractured wrist, and one of her fingers was partially amputated,&quot; said the report. &quot;The lawsuit filed last month alleges the zoo and K-Bros Developments Corporation, which owns the property in Langley, B.C., owed a duty of care to the child, who was two years old at the time, given their control of the premises and the bears.&quot;
&quot;It says the girl had reached through an &#x27;unguarded chain link fence&#x27; at the zoo’s black bear exhibit and a &#x27;group&#x27; of the animals &#x27;attacked and mauled&#x27; her arm,&quot; said the report. &quot;BC Emergency Health Services issued a statement shortly after the incident, saying a patient had been airlifted from the zoo in serious condition. Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court.&quot;
The lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being &quot;vicious&quot;, but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.
&quot;The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide &#x27;any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions&#x27; on the premises,&quot; said the report. &quot;It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl.&quot;
Zoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of &quot;petting or feeding&quot; the animals.</span>

                              <span>France should be in a strong position as Europe reels from the energy crisis, drawing on the renowned nuclear industry that supplies the lion’s share of its power. But France’s nuclear sector has been going through a tricky time, as a significant proportion of its reactors have had to close for maintenance. Analysts blame a mixture of bad luck and the consequences of a political deal from a decade ago.
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Europe’s energy crisis and climate change racks the world, you could expect France to be congratulating itself on its vast fleet of nuclear power stations. After all, nuclear energy produces barely any CO2 and does not leave countries relying on Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States plans to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela under a program paired with expulsions of people from those countries caught at the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. and Mexican officials said.
The expanded humanitarian program would build on a policy launched in October that allowed thousands of Venezuelans to enter by air if they applied from abroad and could demonstrate they had a U.S. sponsor, two U.S. and one Mexican official said on Wednesday.
The details on the planned program come as U.S. President Joe Biden plans to give a border security-themed speech on Thursday and intends to visit the U.S.-Mexico border next week, addressing an issue that has challenged the Dem…</span>

By early evening, there were no reports of clashes with police, who closed off access to Congress, though transport authorities reported 35 blockade points across the country.
Almost two dozen died in protests across the country last month.
On Wednesday, protesters marched in Lima and Arequipa, many carrying the country&#x27;s red-and-white flag, and demanded the resignation of current President Dina Boluarte, closure of Congress, changes to the constitution and Castillo&#x27;s release.

Protesters used stones and burning tires to barricade main routes in the southern regions of Puno, Cusco, Apurimac and Arequipa, as well as Junin in the center, chanting for Boluarte to leave.
She took over on December 7 as the South American country&#x27;s first woman president following the impeachment and arrest of Pedro Castillo after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Castillo, a leftist former rural school teacher and union leader, faced vehement opposition from Congress during his 18 months in office, and had been the subject of numerous criminal investigations…</span>

                              <span>Unknown vandals desecrated a Protestant cemetery in Jerusalem, damaging more than 30 gravestones, according to Israeli media reports.

Israeli radio reported considerable damage to the Zion cemetery on Wednesday, with gravestones damaged and crosses broken.
The Jerusalem Post, citing Jerusalem University College, reported that the perpetrators were two Jewish teenagers, saying the damage amounted to the equivalent of $99,700.
An Israeli police spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that an investigation was under way, but did not comment on the identity of the suspects.
A video shared on social media showed two figures throwing large stones at graves and overturning a cross.
The incident reportedly occurred on Sunday.
The cemetery, founded in 1848, also serves as a burial place for Jerusalem&#x27;s German-speaking Protestant community. The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, spoke on Twitter of &quot;contemptible criminal behaviour&quot; by the perpetrators. &quot;I hope the police will investigate, find these guys and bring them to justice.&quot;
The desecrated graves included those of three Palestinian police officers and members of various Protestant congregations, according to media reports, including bishop Samuel Gobat, Jerusalem&#x27;s second Protestant bishop. He had bought the land for the cemetery.
The cemetery has been desecrated before and there have been previous incidents of hostility towards Christians in Jerusalem.
