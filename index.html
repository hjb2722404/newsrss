Space.com: SpaceX launches Israeli reconnaissance satellite, lands rocket in final flight of 2022  
The launch and landing marked SpaceX&#x27;s 61st flight in 2022. 
SpaceX rang out 2022 a few days early with a brilliant nighttime launch from California to haul an Israeli reconnaissance satellite into orbit.  
A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched the Israeli Earth-imaging satellite EROS C-3 into orbit from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California late Thursday night (Dec. 29), releasing the payload into orbit about 15 minutes after leaving Earth. 
Liftoff occurred at 11:38 p.m. PST at the launch site (2:38 a.m. EST/0738 GMT), with the Falcon 9&#x27;s first stage returning to land at a nearby SpaceX pad about 8 minutes into the flight.

Middle East Eye: Jordan&#x27;s protests could be the second wave of an &#x27;Arab Spring  
Recent protests sweeping the country amid record fuel prices and national debt could signal another revolution, as much of the Middle East faces an unprecedented economic crisis 
Jordan is witnessing escalating popular protests whose violent turn has ushered in an important, sensitive, and dangerous period in the country&#x27;s history. 
But what is happening in Jordan cannot be isolated from current conditions and growing tensions in the entire region, signalling what may be a prelude to a second wave of the Arab Spring. 
The latest wave of demonstrations in Jordan began with the announcement of truck drivers on strike, in which other public transport workers soon participated, to protest against the rise of fuel prices.

The Hill: Esper: Taiwan ‘not prepared enough’ for conflict with China  
Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper says Taiwan is “not prepared enough” for a potential Chinese invasion, though he is optimistic the island will get to that point. 
Esper, who traveled to Taiwan in July, said this week he met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and “outlined a number of things that I thought they needed to do,” including dramatically increasing the island’s defense budget, increasing the length of conscription for at least a year and stockpiling food and weapons.

Global Times: China appoints Qin Gang as new foreign minister 
Qin Gang, incumbent Chinese Ambassador to the US, was appointed as the new Chinese foreign minister, according to a decision made by the 13th National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee on Friday. 
Wang Yi, who is a Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor, no longer serves as the Chinese foreign minister, China&#x27;s Central Television reported on Friday.

WNU Editor: Qin Gang is viewed as one of China&#x27;s &quot;wolf-warrior&#x27; diplomats. His appointment tells me that China is expecting a number of international confrontations in the future, and they have appointed a hardcore and blunt diplomat to present their case to an international audience.

Moscow’s top diplomat has said the “collective West,” led by the US, is already at war with Russia   Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has alleged that up to “hundreds” of American servicemen are deployed to Ukraine. 
Lavrov claimed that US soldiers, military advisers, and intelligence officers have long been direct participants in the conflict. 
Sitting down with Russia’s Channel One for an interview on Wednesday, Lavrov spoke at length about Washington’s deep involvement in the hostilities in Ukraine, which has steadily grown despite repeated assurances from American leaders that US personnel would have no role in the fighting.

The Kremlin has clarified its position on being &#x27;open&#x27; to peace negotiations with Ukraine, after over the weekend Ukraine&#x27;s leadership floated a proposal to enter into UN-brokered ceasefire negotiations in February.  
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said any future &quot;peace plan&quot; must involve formal recognition that the annexed eastern territories have joined the Russian Federation.

                              <span>New York Times: In Nord Stream Mystery, Baltic Seabed Provides a Nearly Ideal Crime Scene 
More than 15 years ago, when the Nord Stream gas pipeline between Russia and Germany was little more than an idea, a Swedish government study warned of the risks inherent in running a critical piece of energy infrastructure along the Baltic Sea floor. 
The pipeline would be vulnerable to even the most rudimentary form of sabotage, analysts wrote, and underwater surveillance would be nearly impossible. The 2007 study, written by the Swedish Defense Research Agency, even posited a scenario: 
“One diver would be enough to set an explosive device.” 
Today, European investigators face almost exactly that scenario. The Swedish authorities leading a criminal investigation have concluded that a state actor was most likely responsible for a September blast that ripped through the gas pipes. Officials and experts say that explosives were probably dropped from ships or — just as the Swedish report warned — planted on the seafloor using submarines or divers.

 WNU Editor: I love the mental gymnastics that the New York Times goes through to try and blame Russia for destroying a pipeline that it spent 10 years to plan and $23 billion to build with the expectation of receiving almost a trillion in revenues over the course of its lifetime. 
But we all know who was to gain (and is gaining) from this attack.

Moscow Times: Putin Oversees Launch of New Russian Submarine and Warships 
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday oversaw the commissioning of several new warships and a nuclear-powered submarine as he vowed to further strengthen Russia&#x27;s navy. 
Putin, who has largely avoided public engagements since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, gave the green light for Russian flags to be hoisted on the new vessels via video link. 
Among the newly commissioned vessels were a corvette, a minesweeper, and the Generalissimus Suvorov nuclear-powered submarine that is capable of launching ballistic missiles.

The Russian Defense Ministry has received a new batch of Su-57 ‘Felon’ fighter jets from the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aviation Plant (owned by the United Aircraft Corporation).   The press service of UAC announced on December 28. 
In addition to the fifth-generation fighter aircraft, the company also delivered a batch of the Su-35S for the Russian Aerospace Forces.  “KnAAZ manufactured and transferred to the Russian Defense Ministry another batch of serial fifth-generation Su-57 aircraft as part of the supply program of this year,” UAC said.  
Yuri Slyusar, the corporation’s general director, stated that the aircraft plant had fulfilled the current year’s production schedule for the Su-57 and multipurpose Su-35S fighters for the Russian Aerospace Forces.

WNU Editor: It&#x27;s believed 6 to 15 Su-57s are already operational. Over the next five years, Russia plans for 76 Su-57 fighters. Production is slow, and the tweet below explains why Russia has production problems when it comes to its fighter planes: 

This comparison of the Su-57 production line versus the F-35 production line really sums up the most important difference between these aircraft.

US News and World Report: China Sails Warships Near Guam in Warning to U.S. Over Taiwan  
The Chinese deployment of its aircraft carrier Liaoning, which Japanese officials confirmed, capped a year of tensions with the U.S., particularly over Taiwan. 
China has sailed one of its three aircraft carriers near the U.S. territory of Guam, Japanese officials confirmed, ending an already combative year with a rare move that Beijing signaled as a clear warning to the Biden administration over Taiwan. 
The Chinese fleet, led by the aircraft carrier Liaoning, had already spurred several clashes with U.S. allies in the region with its tour of the western Pacific, most recently by conducting roughly 260 takeoff and landing drills near the Japanese island of Okinawa, home to a major U.S. military presence. The operations prompted the Japanese air force to scramble fighter jets and helicopters, as well as a destroyer and other elements of its self-defense forces.

Earlier this month, the Royal Navy announced that its warships had spent nearly 10,000 hours – roughly 60 weeks in total – on NATO operations in 2022. The UK also led the alliance’s most important naval force. From the freezing Arctic and Baltic to the endless grey of the North Atlantic and azure waters of the Mediterranean, the Royal Navy’s warships, submarines, and aircraft successfully operated side by side with allies and partners, supporting peace and prosperity in Europe following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

The Guardian: No 10 ‘concerned’ MPs engaged in ‘sex and heavy drinking’ on trips abroad  
Downing Street says reports of raucous behaviour of all-party trips are a matter for parliament 
No 10 has said it is “very concerning” that MPs were reportedly met by sex workers in their hotel rooms and engaged in raucous drinking while on parliamentary trips abroad. 
The prime minister’s deputy official spokesperson said the oversight of trips taken by all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) was a matter for parliament but expressed concern about some of the behaviour reported by Politico and the Times. 
“We have seen some of the reports and some of the behaviour reported is clearly very concerning,” he said.

GAO has up to 100 days to rule in a bid protest, but the congressional watchdog agency strives to resolve cases as quickly as possible. 
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky and teammate Boeing today formally protested the Army’s choice of Bell Textron’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor in the coveted Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition, asking the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the decision. 
“Based on a thorough review of the information and feedback provided by the Army, Lockheed Martin Sikorsky, on behalf of Team DEFIANT, is challenging the FLRAA decision. The data and discussions lead us to believe the proposals were not consistently evaluated to deliver the best value in the interest of the Army, our Soldiers and American taxpayers,” the two companies declared in a statement.

In September 2020, the China Academy of Electronics and Information Technology (CAEIT) released a video of the same system. It showed three drones being launched from a box array of 48 tubular launchers from the back of a Dongfeng Mengshi vehicle.

                              <span>William Gallo, VOA: Under New Defense Plan, Japan May Become ‘Normal’ World Power 
Seoul, South Korea — Japan this month took a major step toward loosening its postwar military restraints, unveiling new policies that will allow the Asian giant to play a much bigger role in regional and global security affairs. 
Under a new National Security Strategy (NSS) and two other documents released in mid-December, Japan will roughly double defense spending over the next five years and for the first time deploy missiles that can hit military targets in other countries. 
The policies smash through decades-old taboos in Japan, which has embraced a relatively restrained defense posture under its technically pacifist constitution drafted by the United States following Tokyo’s defeat in World War II.

Reuters: South Korea&#x27;s Yoon orders revamp of response to violations of country&#x27;s air space 
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea&#x27;s President Yoon Suk-yeol ordered a revamp of the military&#x27;s response to objects violating its airspace, his office said on Thursday, after an intrusion by North Korean drones exposed its difficulty in shooting down small aircraft. 
Five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea on Monday, prompting South Korea&#x27;s military to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, though it failed to bring down the drones, which flew over South Korea for hours. 
Amid criticism over South Korea&#x27;s air defences at a time of North Korea&#x27;s growing nuclear and missile threats, Yoon visited the state-run Agency for Defence Development to check the country&#x27;s reconnaissance and interception capabilities and called for an overhaul of the response system against &quot;all flying objects&quot;.

VOA: Australia Approves Extradition to US of Ex-Marine Pilot 
Sydney — Australia has approved a request to extradite former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan to the United States where he faces charges of money laundering and breaking U.S. arms control laws, the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department said on Thursday. 
Duggan, who was arrested in Australia in October and remains in custody, is accused of breaking U.S. arms control laws by training Chinese military pilots to land on aircraft carriers, according to a 2017 indictment unsealed by a U.S. court in December.

   Reuters: Russia Says It Shot Down Drone Near Engels Air Base 
(Reuters) - A Russian regional governor said on Thursday that air defences had shot down a drone near the Engels air force base, home to long-range strategic bombers. 
Russia says Ukraine has already tried to attack the base twice this month, killing at least six Russian servicemen, although it said there was only slight damage to two aircraft. 
The base is located near Saratov, 730 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow and hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines in Ukraine.

                              <span>China&#x27;s hospitals have been struggling to keep up amid soaring coronavirus cases after the Chinese Communist Party abruptly reversed its stringent &quot;zero Covid&quot; policy while the country&#x27;s vaccination rate remains low. FRANCE 24 correspondents Lou Kisiela, Antoine Morel, Yan Chen and Yena Lee report from a hospital in Shanghai.

This hospital is considered one of the best in China, but it is overwhelmed as Covid cases soar. Stretchers and oxygen tanks pile up in the lobby as ambulance after ambulance arrives, day and night. “I am very worried. I feel powerless. It’s very crowded,” said the daughter-in-law of an elderly patient whose condition was alarming. “The hospital is doing its best […] but they are understaffed. The doctors don’t have time to answer our questions.”

Meanwhile, patients with less serious symptoms were waiting for rationed fever medication. Pharmacies have run out of stock, and this hospital can prescribe it at the rate of one dose per person, per day.

“We could’ve stocked up on drugs before lifting all the restrictions. It’s the government’s fault,” said one patient. “Either we are strictly locked down.. or all the measures disappear at once!”</span>

Reuters: Putin and Xi to speak by video link on Friday 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping via video link on Friday to discuss a host of bilateral and regional issues. 
&quot;First of all, they will talk about bilateral Russian-Chinese relations,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. 
&quot;And, of course, it will be very important to exchange views on more acute regional problems - those that are closer to us, Russia, and those that are closer to China,&quot; Peskov added, without providing specific details.

                              <span>Reuters: Chinese jet came within 10 feet of U.S. military aircraft, U.S. says 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 metres) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last week and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace, the U.S. military said on Thursday. 
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft. 
The incident, which involved a Chinese Navy J-11 fighter jet and a U.S. air force RC-135 aircraft, took place on Dec. 21, the U.S. military said in a statement.
&quot;We expect all countries in the Indo-Pacific region to use international airspace safely and in accordance with international law,&quot; it added. 
A U.S. military spokesperson said the Chinese jet came within 10 feet of the plane&#x27;s wing, but 20 feet from its nose, which caused the U.S. aircraft to take evasive maneuvers.

Kiev’s plan for settling the conflict with Moscow is a non-starter, the Russian foreign minister has said 
Russia is not about to engage with Ukraine based on the ‘peace formula’ put forward by President Vladimir Zelensky, as it deems the terms unacceptable, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday. 
He reiterated, however, that Moscow has not refused to engage in talks in general.  Speaking to RIA Novosti, the foreign minister stated that “obviously, Kiev is not ready for dialogue.”

Fighting in Ukraine is currently at a deadlock as neither Ukraine nor Russia can make significant advances, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence agency has said, while Kyiv waits for more advanced weapons from Western allies. 
&quot;The situation is just stuck,&quot; Kyrylo Budanov told the BBC in an interview. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t move.&quot; 
After Ukrainian troops recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, most of the fiercest battles have been around Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region. Elsewhere, Russian forces appear to be on the defensive while winter has slowed down the pace of Ukraine&#x27;s ground operations across the 1,000km (620-mile) front line.

WNU Editor: If you look at the current state of the war where the territory is not being captured/recaptured on a daily basis, one can say that the war is currently stalemated. But if you look at the war from an attrition point of view, this war is anything but deadlocked. 
I have been reading reports that Ukraine is currently losing up to two battalions of soldiers per day (wounded/killed/missing). And on the Russia side I would not be surprised if the casualties are just as high. Bottom line. It is only a matter of time before one side loses the capability to continue to fight.</span>

Minsk claimed that a Soviet-era air defense missile was fired from Ukraine and landed in Belarus after Ukraine was hit by a barrage of Russian missiles. 
Belarusian and Russian media reported on Thursday that a Ukrainian missile had crossed into Belarus&#x27; territory.  
The reports came shortly after Russia launched one of its largest missile attacks against Ukraine since the war started in February, with Kyiv saying more than 60 missiles had been fired on Ukrainian cities. 
Minsk&#x27;s key ally Moscow is reportedly sending officials to investigate the incident. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.

Russia fired scores of missiles into Ukraine early on Thursday, targeting the capital Kyiv and other cities including Lviv and Odesa in the west, in one of its largest aerial bombardments that sent people rushing to shelters and knocked out power.

Incoming coalition has pledged to hobble the High Court, consider West Bank annexation, and further centralize Orthodox control over state Jewish services 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore in Israel’s 37th government on Thursday, promising that his right-religious coalition will deliver political stability after five bumpy back-to-back elections since 2019. 
Confidence in the government was confirmed by 63 of the 64 coalition members, constituting a relatively solid and cohesive majority in the 120-seat Knesset.

 Daily Mail: China&#x27;s &#x27;elite are stockpiling Pfizer&#x27;s Covid drug&#x27; as country battles huge wave of fresh infections that has left hospitals overflowing with patients after abandoning Zero Covid 
* Basic medicines and Paxlovid Covid treatment are extremely difficult to obtain 
* Hospitals in densely populated Chinese city&#x27;s are inundated with Covid patients 
* Rural areas are quickly ramping up medical facilities ahead of New Year holiday 
* Countries around the globe are implementing testing for Chinese travellers 
China&#x27;s abrupt lifting of many of its tough pandemic restrictions earlier this month has allowed the virus to spread rapidly in a country where most people have little access to treatment.  
Spiraling infections have led to shortages of cold medicine, long lines at fever clinics, and at-capacity emergency rooms turning away patients.   
Beijing city authorities plan to distribute the oral Covid drug Paxlovid at local hospitals and community clinics, but the drug - a combination of antivirals nirmatrelvir and ritonavir produced by Pfizer - remains extremely difficult to obtain for ordinary people.

MITROVICA, Kosovo (Reuters) - Kosovo re-opened its biggest border crossing with Serbia on Thursday, hours after protesting Serbs in its north promised to remove roadblocks, easing a surge in tensions that has alarmed world powers. 
Both the European Union and the United States have been pressing Kosovo and Serbia to step back from a mounting confrontation that has seen Serbia put its army on the highest combat alert. 
Serbs in northern Kosovo, who have been erecting roadblocks since Dec. 10 in protest at the arrest of a former Serb policeman - the latest in a long series of flashpoints - agreed to start taking them down after he was moved to house arrest.

                              <span>Business Insider: Taiwan&#x27;s remote islands are on the frontline with China — sometimes only a few hundred yards from Chinese troops 
* Taiwan is roughly 100 miles from mainland China, but some Taiwanese islands are much closer. 
* Amid rising tensions, those islands are increasingly vulnerable to attack from China&#x27;s military. 
* Taiwan&#x27;s outlying islands would stand little chance against China, but they wouldn&#x27;t be easy to take. 
October marked the 73rd anniversary of the Battle of Guningtou, when Chinese Nationalist forces defeated an attempt by Chinese Communist forces to capture Kinmen, an offshore island that was seen as a stepping-stone toward Taiwan. 
While celebrated, this year&#x27;s anniversary was also a reminder of Taiwan&#x27;s islands&#x27; growing vulnerability to Chinese attack. 
In addition to the main island of Taiwan, Taipei controls five islands or island chains: Kinmen, the Mastu Islands, and the Penghu archipelago in the Taiwan Strait, and the Pratas Islands, also known as the Dongsha Islands, and Itu Aba, also known as Taiping Island, both in the South China Sea.

Reuters: U.S. approves potential sale of anti-tank systems to Taiwan for $180 mln 
The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of Volcano anti-tank mine-laying systems to Taiwan for an estimated $180 million, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. 
Northrop Grumman and Oshkosh Corporation are the prime contractors for the potential sale.  U.S. law requires the executive branch to notify Congress of potential arms sales that are over a certain amount. 
But these notifications are usually not made unless lawmakers have given the State Department and Pentagon informal approval to move ahead.

AFP: The end is nigh? Climate, nuclear crises spark fears of worst 
For thousands of years, predictions of apocalypse have come and gone. But with dangers rising from nuclear war and climate change, does the planet need to at least begin contemplating the worst? 
When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia&#x27;s threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine. 
&quot;We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis&quot; in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.

Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s gifts to his allies sparked a barrage of jokes and comparisons to the Lord of the Rings series. 
Putin, who has faced rebuke from the West over his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, gifted rings to the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a coalition of former Soviet republics, in St. Petersburg on Monday, according to a report from The Moscow Times, an independent Russian news outlet. 
During the summit, in which Putin reaffirmed cooperation between the member states despite some tensions, the Russian president gave the leaders a gold ring engraved with New Year&#x27;s greetings, according to the Times.

(Bloomberg) -- Italian health authorities will begin testing all arrivals from China for Covid after almost half of the passengers on two flights to Milan were found to have the virus. 
They are also sequencing the Milan tests to see if there are new variants, the Health Ministry said in a statement. 
If a new strain is found, officials may impose stricter curbs on travel from the country.  China has seen outbreaks of the virus since the government there abandoned its strict zero-Covid policies. Uncertainty over the scale of the spread has prompted countries, including the US, to consider new restrictions on entry.

Benjamin Netanyahu’s incoming hardline government put West Bank settlement expansion at the top of its list of priorities on Wednesday, vowing to legalise dozens of illegally built outposts and annex the occupied territory as part of its coalition deal with its ultranational allies. 
The coalition agreements, released a day before the government is to be sworn into office, also included language endorsing discrimination against LGBTQ+ people on religious grounds, as well as generous stipends for ultra-Orthodox men who prefer to study instead of work.

Global Times: Nearly 80% find current global economic order unfair: GT poll 
The Global Times released the second part of the annual survey that covered participants from 33 countries on Wednesday, which showed that most participants from Western countries are unsatisfied with the current development of their countries while those from China and many non-Western countries or emerging economies are more satisfied and optimistic about their future, and many participants, especially the ones from non-Western world, believe that China could be a role model for development and able to play a leadership role to guide global development.

WNU Editor: This is a Chinese state media poll. But what I found interesting about it is that the countries that were the most satisfied with the current global economic order were from China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.    
Update: Here is another Global Times poll .... GT survey: over 60% participants believe China’s global influence rising; world concern war, energy &amp; foods crises more than pandemic (Global Times).</span>

Jack Murphy: The CIA is using a European NATO ally’s spy service to conduct a covert sabotage campaign inside Russia under the agency’s direction, according to former U.S. intelligence and military officials. 
The campaign involves long standing sleeper cells that the allied spy service has activated to hinder Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine by waging a secret war behind Russian lines. 
 Years in the planning, the campaign is responsible for many of the unexplained explosions and other mishaps that have befallen the Russian military industrial complex since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, according to three former U.S. intelligence officials, two former U.S. military officials and a U.S. person who has been briefed on the campaign. The former officials declined to identify specific targets for the CIA-directed campaign, but railway bridges, fuel depots and power plants in Russia have all been damaged in unexplained incidents since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.

Update: Report: The CIA Is Directing Sabotage Attacks Inside Russia (Antiwar.com)   
WNU Editor: The Nord Stream pipeline attack was the wake-up call for everyone on what was (and is) happening. What concerns me is when is the blow-back going to happen. You can take this to the bank. The Kremlin is going to retailiate.

And as to who is that NATO ally that the CIA is using to conduct this covert sabotage campaign. I agree with Jeffrey Kaye (see tweet below) that it is probably Poland.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: South Koreans’ Steely Nerves Are Shaken by North Korean Drones 
SEOUL — When Washington and Seoul warned earlier this year that North Korea was planning its seventh nuclear weapons test, most South Koreans hardly batted an eye.
Many in the South have grown so used to North Korean saber rattling that they often dismiss the country’s frequent military provocations as predictable attempts to garner attention.  But this week, North Korea was able to shake the steely nerves of many South Koreans using a weapon much cheaper and less sophisticated than a nuclear warhead.

A 97-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has filed an appeal against the guilty verdict she was given for her role in the deaths that took place at her place of work during World War II.
The appeal means that Germany&#x27;s highest criminal court, the Federal Court of Justice, has to examine whether a procedural error was made.
&quot;The verdict is thus not legally binding,&quot; the lower court in Itzehoe in northern Germany said on Wednesday.
Identified only as Irmgard F under German privacy laws, she was found guilty on December 20 of complicity in more than 10,500 cases of murder and given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in northern Germany.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is &quot;very sick&quot;, his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis&#x27; announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden &quot;worsening&quot; of his health.
&quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church,&quot; Francis said in Wednesday&#x27;s surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, according to the fire brigade and local authorities.

Its promoters reckon it is revolutionizing human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.
Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
The European Union is likely to pass legislation next year -- the AI Act -- aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
Looming large in the debates has been China&#x27;s use of biometric data, facial recognition and other technology to build a powerful system of control.

Uruguay, a country where horses are not considered food but companions, has seen a rise in equine meat exports, prompting efforts to rescue horses destined for slaughter.
In 2020, the small South American nation was the seventh-largest exporter of horse meat, according to the OEC economic data site, with Belgium, Russia, France and Japan among the top importers.
Most of Uruguay&#x27;s tens of thousands of race, sports and work horses end up on someone&#x27;s plate somewhere else in the world after they become injured, old, or their owners simply cannot care for them anymore.

Yellow-band disease -- named for the colour it turns corals before destroying them -- was first spotted decades ago and has caused widespread damage to reefs in the Caribbean. There is no known cure.
But it was detected for the first time off Thailand&#x27;s eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.
&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything like this before,&quot; said marine scientist Lalita Putchim, of Thailand&#x27;s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources.

&quot;I can confirm that in the last few hours there has been a deterioration due to advancing age. The situation at the moment remains under control, monitored continually by doctors,&quot; spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.
This came after Pope Francis said in a surprise announcement in Italian at the end of his weekly general audience: &quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church.&quot;

In early 2022, he joined thousands of Cubans whose migration has amounted to the largest exodus in the Caribbean nation&#x27;s history.
Gonzalez, a 34-year-old barber, said he could no longer bear the hardships of a country going through its worst economic crisis since the 1990s, or the communist regime he had never embraced.
In Cuba, &quot;you lose hope,&quot; he told AFP from Miami, Florida, which he reached after a weeks-long odyssey across multiple countries.
That hopelessness, shared by many young people in Cuba, has pushed emigration to the United States to the highest levels on record.

                              <span>Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#x27;s inauguration will be secured by &quot;100 percent&quot; of the capital district&#x27;s police force, an official said Tuesday amid widespread fears of violence.
Over the weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly placing explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia&#x27;s airport, hoping to sow &quot;chaos&quot; ahead of the inauguration Sunday.
The suspect was a supporter of Brazil&#x27;s outgoing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and told authorities he wanted to &quot;prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil&quot; under leftist Lula.
The device did not explode.
On Sunday &quot;there will be a mobilization of 100 percent of the police forces of the Federal District (of Brasilia) to ensure the safety not only of the president, but also of foreign delegations and the public,&quot; Lula&#x27;s future security minister Flavio Dino told reporters.
Lula backers have expressed fear on social media of riots or attacks on inauguration day, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend events in Brasilia.
But Dino sought to give assurances the event will be &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;peaceful,&quot; encouraging Brazilians to turn out to celebrate.
He added there had been &quot;no change&quot; to plans for the ceremony, in response to speculation that Lula might do his inauguration parade in a closed car instead of the traditional vintage convertible.
After Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9 percent of the vote in a runoff election in October, supporters of the vanquished president blocked roads and demonstrated outside military barracks demanding the armed forces prevent Lula&#x27;s inauguration.
On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators clashed with the police and set fire to buses and cars in Brasilia.
&quot;Small terrorist and extremist groups will not put the institutions of Brazilian democracy up against a wall,&quot; said Dino.
Bolsonaro, who has limited his public appearances after the defeat, has not confirmed that he will follow the tradition of handing over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday&#x27;s ceremony.

Russia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe 
Early in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion. But Russia meets a tougher resistance than expected. And after a failed attempt to take the capital Kyiv, the Russian …</span>

                              <span>Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. 
A friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov&#x27;s death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov&#x27;s friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have &quot;consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.&quot;
Antov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. 
From the BBC: &quot;Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov&#x27;s account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: &#x27;It&#x27;s extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.&#x27; The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a &#x27;patriot of my country&#x27; and backed the war.&quot;

                              <span>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday that his government is aiming to hold a &quot;peace summit&quot; in February with the goal of ending Russia&#x27;s assault, which is now in its 10th month.
&quot;Every war ends in a diplomatic way,&quot; Kuleba said in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&quot;
Kuleba suggested the summit could be mediated by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, a vocal advocate of diplomatic talks to end an invasion that has killed thousands of civilians, devastated Ukraine&#x27;s infrastructure, and sparked a massive humanitarian crisis.
&quot;The United Nations could be the best venue for holding this summit, because this is not about making a favor to a certain country,&quot; the f…</span>

More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago -- they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 -- before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding program, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as &quot;vulnerable&quot;, with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild -- with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand&#x27;s wild wetlands.
But since 2011, more than 150 captivity-bred birds …</span>

Ron DeSantis
Will Donald Trump&#x27;s former apprentice, popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis, turn on his one-time mentor by challenging him for the Republican nomination for president?
Trump is already gearing up for a potential battle with his MAGA (Make America Great Again) disciple, whose stock has soared among Republicans.
DeSantis won a landslide re-election in November&#x27;s midterms, in which Trump loyalists fared badly. The property mogul has coined a nickname for the self-styled anti-woke warrior: &quot;Ron de Sanctimonious&quot;.

When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia&#x27;s threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine.
&quot;We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis&quot; in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.

For the last 18 months, researchers from the French firm Urgo have been working towards achieving this Holy Grail of wound treatment, which would save serious burn victims from the painful and repeated skin grafts they currently endure.
The 100-million-euro ($106,000-million) &quot;Genesis&quot; project hopes to have a product ready by 2030.
Guirec Le Lous, the president of Urgo&#x27;s medical arm, told AFP that it is a &quot;crazy&quot; project.

Musk said, &quot;approaching 100 starlinks active in Iran&quot;, in a tweet on Monday.
The billionaire had said in September that he would activate Starlink in Iran as part of a U.S.-backed effort &quot;to advance internet freedom and the free flow of information&quot; to Iranians.
The satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the government&#x27;s restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms amid protests around the country.
The Islamic Republic has been engulfed in protests that erupted after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for wearing &quot;unsuitable attire&quot;.

                              <span>Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.
Following his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.
&quot;The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset,&quot; parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.
Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel&#x27;s history.
While the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu&#x27;s right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Both live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.
Netanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.
However, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.
His incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) -China will stop requiring inbound travellers to go into quarantine starting from Jan. 8, the National Health Commission said on Monday in a major step towards easing curbs on its borders, which have been largely shut since 2020.
China&#x27;s management of COVID-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.
Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China&#x27;s economy, fuelling last month the mainland&#x27;s biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
But China made an abrupt policy U-turn this month,…</span>
