                              <span>Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says Republicans generally have been doing “poor”. 

“Gas prices are down a little bit from their highs, President Biden’s approval rating is up a little bit,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“The general consensus now is that the Democrats are having a little bit of momentum as we go on to the end of the race. 

“And the question I suppose that’s being asked is was Donald Trump partially responsible for that, and has he decided to sort of dial things back as we go on to the midterms so that if Republicans don’t do well, he doesn’t get blamed.”</span>

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come after Mr Biden made a speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which took aim at MAGA Republicans. 
 
“The kind of speech that ... President Biden gave last week is designed specifically to get the really hardcore left-wing Liberal voters out,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“In that sense, I think it was probably a smart idea politically. 

“From a national standpoint, it’s just making things a lot worse here.”</span>

“That has caused this problem,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“That has disrupted supply chains, but also because we need to diversify away from such dependencies.” 

Ms Treadell said the energy crisis is a top priority for newly sworn-in UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, and in the next day or so, she&#x27;ll outline how her government plan to address an issue every family in the UK is facing.</span>

                              <span>Students in the Uvalde school district in Texas are returning to school three months after a deadly shooting. 

More than 20 people died when a gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary, leaving the local community in shock. 

Some students have opted for online learning since the attack, while others have left the school district completely.  

Despite heightened security, safety precautions and months of preparation, families of the victims worry about sending their other children back to school.</span>

Tico&#x27;s carers grew worried as he ventured into deep waters following the successful release.

In late August, a signal was transmitted to the Aquasis team, who located Tico off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. 

Tico is believed to have travelled a total of 4,000 kilometres since his deep sea voyage.</span>

The 36-story tower recently underwent major capital improvements by owner FosterLane Management, including two floors of tenant-only amenities.
CBRE’s Howard Fiddle, Brett Shannon, Arkady Smolyansky, Evan Fiddle and Jacob Rosenthal replaced the owner.  Howard Fiddle praised the building as “one of the best locations in Manhattan”.  Upper floors feature floor-to-ceiling windows, 13-foot ceiling heights, and panoramic views.

One tabloid, the Daily Star, calls this the &quot;end of an error&quot;, referring to Johnson&#x27;s hapless hold on power. Another tabloid, the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror, dismisses Truss&#x27;s leadership victory as just the &quot;same old Tories&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Exclusive-EU, U.S. step up Russian aluminium, nickel imports since Ukraine war 
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and United States have ramped up buying key industrial metals from Russia, data showed, despite logistical problems spurred by the war in Ukraine and tough talk about starving Moscow of foreign exchange revenue. 
The metal shipments highlight the West&#x27;s difficulty in pressuring Russia&#x27;s economy, which has performed better than expected and seen its rouble currency surge as buoyant oil revenue has helped offset the impact of sanctions. 
EU and U.S. imports of Russia&#x27;s main base metal products aluminium and nickel during March-June increased by as much as 70%, official trade data compiled by Reuters from the United Nations Comtrade database show. 
The total value of EU and U.S. imports of the two metals from March to June were $1.98 billion, the data showed. 
The West has imposed repeated waves of sanctions on a wide range of Russian products, people and institutions, but has largely spared the industrial metals sector.

WNU Editor: It is telling that these key industrial metals from Russia are being exempt from Western sanctions. But this massive push to buy Russia&#x27;s industrial metals tells me that some are stocking with the expectation that Russia&#x27;s industrial metals will eventually be sanctioned.</span>

Secretary general says agreement must be secured to commit Russian forces to withdraw and Ukrainian forces not to move in 
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. 
Guterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. 
The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles.

World is ‘in last minute of the 11th hour to save lives’, says aid chief, amid fears that crisis is worse than 2010 famine, when 250,000 died 
Two areas of Somalia are likely to enter a state of famine later this year as the country battles an unrelenting drought and flare-ups of conflict, the UN humanitarian chief has warned. 
Martin Griffiths said the latest UN food insecurity analysis had found “concrete indications” that famine would occur in the Baidoa and Burhakaba districts of south-central Somalia between October and December unless aid efforts were significantly stepped up.

 RFE: U.S. Says Russia Buying North Korean Artillery As Ukraine Weighs On Its Military  
A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment says Russia is acquiring millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea for its six-month-old invasion of Ukraine, in an indication of the effect that Western sanctions are having on the Russian war effort. 
The New York Times first published the findings of the intelligence assessment, but the newspaper said the specifics of the purchases, including their type and timing, were unclear. 
The paper quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying such purchases were expected to continue and perhaps expand beyond short-range rockets and ammunition.

KYIV (Reuters) -An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy&#x27;s chief of staff said he expected Kyiv to announce &quot;great news&quot; about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening, without giving further details.
Kharkiv region, in northeast Ukraine, is on the far end of the front line from the southern Kherson region, which Ukraine last week announced as the focus of a push to retake territory. 
&quot;Tonight there is going to be great news from President Zelenskiy on (the) counteroffensive operation in Kharkiv region,&quot; Serhiy Leshchenko said on Twitter.

                              <span>CNBC: German gas giant Uniper says the worst is still to come after Russia halts flows to Europe 
* “I have said this a number of times now over this year and I’m educating also policymakers. Look, the worst is still to come,” Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told CNBC on Tuesday at Gastech 2022 in Milan. 
* Russia’s state-owned energy giant, Gazprom, on Friday indefinitely halted gas flows to Europe via a major pipeline, stoking fears that parts of the Continent could be forced to ration energy through winter. 
* Uniper, as Germany’s biggest importer of gas, has been hit hard by vastly reduced flows via pipelines from Russia, which have sent prices soaring. 
German energy giant Uniper on Tuesday warned the worst is still to come as concerns over Russian gas supplies to Europe through fall and winter continue to push up prices. 
“I have said this a number of times now over this year and I’m educating also policymakers. Look, the worst is still to come,” Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble at Gastech 2022 in Milan. 
“What we see on the wholesale market is 20 times the price that we have seen two years ago — 20 times. That is why I think we need to have really an open discussion with everyone taking responsibility on how to fix that,” he added.

                              <span>Reuters: Putin shown in tense encounter with chief of staff at Far East war games 
LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin was shown in an awkward encounter with his military chief of staff on Tuesday as he inspected war games in Russia&#x27;s Far East, thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine. 
The Zvezda military news service published video of Putin and chief of staff General Valery Gerasimov entering an observation booth, sitting down with a wide space between them and maintaining an uncomfortable silence while waiting for Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to arrive. 
Gerasimov stroked his hair and shuffled papers and Putin picked up and peered through a pair of binoculars, at one point acknowledging a comment from the general by nodding tersely. 
The awkward body language drew scrutiny from political and military analysts on social media.

Such a trip will take place when the time is right, Dmitry Peskov says 
Russian President Vladimir Putin will certainly pay a visit to Donbass, but the date for such a trip hasn’t been set yet, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. 
“As for the president&#x27;s trip [to the People’s Republics of Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR)], I have no doubts that when the right time comes such a visit will take place,” Peskov told the newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday. 
He also said that Moscow has “vast plans” in terms of rebuilding Donbass, which has ended up being the main battlefield in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Navy vessels from Australia and New Zealand will be exempt from a temporary ban on foreign ships entering the ports of the Solomon Islands, the Pacific island nation&#x27;s prime minister told parliament on Monday. 
Foreign military vessels responding to a request for assistance from the Solomon Islands government would also be exempt, Prime Minister Manesseh Sogavare said. 
The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China in April, which a leaked draft said allows the Chinese navy to replenish in Honiara, prompting concern from the United States, Australia and New Zealand about China&#x27;s growing influence.

An 80-page Swedish intelligence report reviewed by JNS claims Iran “conducts industrial espionage such as primarily aimed at Swedish high-tech industry and Swedish products that can be used in a nuclear weapons program.” 
The Islamic Republic of Iran’s efforts to secure illicit nuclear technology is detailed in an intelligence report recently released by Sweden’s Security Service. 
According to the Swedish Security Service Yearbook report released in March, which covers the year 2021, “Iran also conducts industrial espionage such as primarily aimed at Swedish high-tech industry and Swedish products that can be used in a nuclear weapons program.” 
It added, “Iranian intelligence officers act, among other things, under diplomatic cover in Sweden.”

RT:  NATO struggling to supply winter uniforms to Ukraine – Der Spiegel 
Kiev has reportedly asked the military bloc to urgently provide it with hundreds of thousands of uniforms and other equipment 
NATO members have been scraping the barrel in their efforts to supply Ukraine with sufficient winter uniforms and field camp equipment, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday. 
Kiev has apparently called on the bloc to urgently provide the necessary equipment before the cold weather sets in. 
According to Der Spiegel, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov wrote a letter to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg back in late July, calling on the military alliance to provide cold-proof field tents along with clothing for as many as 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers. 
The uniforms and equipment should be delivered as quickly as possible, the minister added, according to the magazine.

Reuters: Putin approves new foreign policy doctrine based on &#x27;Russian World&#x27; 
LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a &quot;Russian World&quot;, a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers. 
The 31-page &quot;humanitarian policy&quot;, published more than six months into the war in Ukraine, says Russia should &quot;protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World&quot;. 
While presented as a kind of soft power strategy, it enshrines in official policy ideas around Russian politics and religion that some hardliners have used to justify Moscow&#x27;s occupation of parts of Ukraine and support for breakaway pro-Russian entities in the east of the country.
&quot;The Russian Federation provides support to its compatriots living abroad in the fulfillment of their rights, to ensure the protection of their interests and the preservation of their Russian cultural identity,&quot; the policy said.

                              <span>The investigations into former US president Donald Trump could mean he is facing “some grief” if he intends to announce another run for the presidency, Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen says.

“There’s over a dozen different investigations into his conduct in office, in leaving office,” she said. 

However, Mr Trump’s request to have a “special master” appointed to review documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate by the FBI has been approved by a US federal judge in Florida.

This has the potential to “hamper” the Department of Justice’s investigation into the former president, according to Ms Nielsen.</span>

TASS: Gazprom’s production not falling, but rising, Putin says  
The Russian leader pointed out that the replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential 
PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, September 5. /TASS/. Gazprom’s production is not falling, but it is even rising, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. 
&quot;Gazprom’s production is not falling, or you will scare everyone now, but [it is] only rising,&quot; he said at a meeting devoted to Kamchatka’s social and economic development after Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that as a program for Kamchatka’s gasification and field development was adopted 15 years ago Novatek started production, but the resource base was not confirmed, which caused a decline in production over the past years. The replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential, he added.

WNU Editor: Some differ with Putin&#x27;s Gazprom assessment .... Russian state-energy giant Gazprom saw its natural-gas production in July slump to its lowest level since 2008 (Insider). 
As to what is my take. 
Gazprom&#x27;s export of natural gas has declined this summer because of pipeline and turbine issues, and with Nord Stream 1 now shut down indefinitely, its production will fall even more. But I think this is temporary. There is now a push to export natural gas to energy hungry countries in Asia .... Gazprom discussing accelerated redirection of gas supplies eastward — Energy Minister (TASS). Ditto with oil production/exports .... Russia able to adapt to EU oil embargo — Energy Minister (TASS).</span>

The SUN: Welcome to sanction-hit Russia, where prices are DOWN as Brits suffer from soaring inflation 
WELCOME to sanctions-hit Russia – where heating bills and fuel prices are a fraction of those in Britain. 
Food costs are also coming down every month and Vladimir Putin’s people are partying as if there is no war. 
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Boris Johnson vowed that Western sanctions would “hobble the Russian economy”. 
In March, Liz Truss as Foreign Secretary announced 65 sanctions and fiercely declared: “Putin should be under no illusions. We are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up.” 
But six months on, while we are paying the price for the invasion with a crippling cost-of-living crisis, locals in Moscow are upbeat. 
It is not surprising. Despite claims they would face a severe food shortage, shoppers in Pyaterochka, Russia’s answer to Tesco, load their trolleys high with groceries half the price of ours.

RT: Ditching Russian gas no way to reach climate goals – Putin 
EU should have been better prepared for its green energy transition, the Russian president says 
The EU’s decision to slash natural gas imports while trying to reach climate goals was a mistake, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday during an environmental forum in Kamchatka in Russia’s Far East. 
“First, they (EU) jumped ahead, and then, after cutting off Russian gas supplies, returned everything that was reviled,” Putin stated. 
He emphasized that all nations are in favor of reducing emissions into the atmosphere, noting however that everything should be done in a timely manner. “And if you jump ahead, get cheap Russian gas, and then cut off the supply of this gas yourself and immediately switch back to everything that was previously condemned, including coal-fired generation, this, of course, is not the best option for solving global problems,” the Russian president said.

Pro-Russian forces are to blame for the protest against the Czech government’s foreign and economic policy in which 70,000 people gathered, according to Czech conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala. 
The event was organised by radical political groups, including Communist Party and Freedom and the Direct Democracy Party. 
Organisers criticised the high energy prices and the pro-Western course of the current government. They also demanded short-term contracts for cheap gas and oil supplies or replacement of the management of the public TV and Radio broadcasters. 
The demonstration was called “Czechia First”. Some participants carried anti-EU or anti-NATO banners.

CNN: Boris Johnson is handing his successor an economic ‘catastrophe’  
London CNN Business  — Across the United Kingdom, businesses and households are warning that they won’t make it through the winter without help from the government. That sets up enormous challenges for Liz Truss, the incoming prime minister. 
For months, the United Kingdom has endured a leadership vacuum while the country has skidded toward a recession and a humanitarian crisis triggered by soaring energy bills. 
Since Boris Johnson announced he would leave office in July, the outlook for growth has weakened. Annual inflation is running above 10% as food and fuel prices leap. Frustration over the rising cost of living has compelled hundreds of thousands of workers who staff ports, trains and mailrooms to go on strike. The British pound just logged its worst month since the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum, hitting its lowest level against the US dollar in more than two years.

Stockholm: Finland and Sweden have announced plans to offer billions of dollars in liquidity guarantees to power companies in their countries after Russia’s Gazprom shut the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, deepening Europe’s energy crisis. 
The Kremlin blamed European politicians on Sunday for the closure of the pipeline, saying their economic sanctions on Russia had hindered Gazprom from conducting maintenance. 
Finland is aiming to offer €10 billion ($14.6 billion) and Sweden plans to offer 250 billion Swedish crowns ($34 billion) in liquidity guarantees. 
“This has had the ingredients for a kind of a Lehman Brothers of energy industry,” Finnish Economic Affairs Minister Mika Lintila said on Sunday, local time.

Gas prices surged on Monday and the pound and euro slumped after Russia shut down a big pipeline indefinitely. Russia has used its control of gas supplies to exert pressure on European countries in retaliation against sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. 
Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled gas company, closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany on Friday, saying it had found a leak requiring repair.

RT: Main gas pipeline to EU will be closed until sanctions lifted – Kremlin 
Nord Stream 1 operations will be hampered as long as Western restrictions remain in place, Dmitry Peskov says 
The technical issues with gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline will persist until the West lifts sanctions it has slapped on Russia over the ongoing Ukraine conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. 
On August 31, Gazprom completely shut down gas deliveries via the pipeline. Although initially Nord Stream 1 was slated to resume gas transit on Friday, Gazprom announced that it would remain closed indefinitely due to technical issues. 
“Problems in [gas] deliveries arose due to sanctions that have been imposed on our country and a number of companies by Western countries, including Germany and the UK. There are no other reasons behind supply issues,” Peskov noted.

Liz Truss vowed to be &#x27;bold&#x27; in cutting taxes and reviving the economy after defeating Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest today. 
Ms Truss takes the helm of a country in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis after seeing off the former chancellor&#x27;s challenge with support from 81,326 party members, compared to Mr Sunak&#x27;s 60,399. 
The 57 per cent to 43 per cent result - closer than some had expected - was announced by 1922 committee chair Sir Graham Brady in a glitzy ceremony at the QE2 Centre in Westminster.

FOX News: Ukraine&#x27;s Zelenskyy accuses Russia of &#x27;preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans&#x27; this winter 
Russia shut down the critical Nord Stream 1 pipeline this week, which carries natural gas to Germany 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of using energy as a weapon by keeping a critical pipeline to Germany shut down in recent days, exacerbating electricity and natural gas shortfalls ahead of the winter months. 
&quot;Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European — in all countries of our continent,&quot; Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Saturday. 
 &quot;Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles. This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans.&quot;

Stars and Stripes/Washington Post: Ukrainians line up to donate blood to save &#x27;soldiers who are fighting for us&#x27; 
MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — Hundreds of civilians and soldiers lined up Saturday in response to calls for blood donations in this southern front-line city holding off Russian forces. 
&quot;They said on TV that there was an urgent need for blood today,&quot; said Svitlana Mymokhod, 58, an accountant who began cooking for local army units after the Russian invasion in late February. 
When officials pleaded for B-negative donors, Mymokhod&#x27;s blood type, it led her to donate for the first time in 20 years, she said as she methodically squeezed a rubber ball while crimson tubes led from her arm.  &quot;We need to give more blood to save the soldiers who are fighting for us.&quot;

The Guardian: Rich nations owe reparations to countries facing climate disaster, says Pakistan minister 
Sherry Rehman, the country’s climate change minister, insists rich polluters must pay their due as country is hit by devastating floods 
Rich polluting countries which are predominantly to blame for the “dystopian” climate breakdown have broken their promises to reduce emissions and help developing countries adapt to global heating, according to Pakistan’s minister for climate change, who said reparations were long overdue. 
Close to 1,300 people are dead and a third of Pakistan is under floodwater after weeks of unprecedented monsoon rains battered the country – which only weeks earlier had been suffering serious drought.

(Bloomberg) -- European ministers will discuss special measures to rein in soaring energy costs, from gas-price caps to a suspension of power derivatives trading, as the bloc races to respond to the deepening crisis. 
The Czech Republic, which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency, is set to include those tools on a list of emergency intervention options to be discussed at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday, according to a draft document seen by Bloomberg News. 
Europe is fighting to stave off an energy catastrophe that’s threatening to become an economic, social, and even financial crisis too. 
Nordic authorities moved this weekend to bolster the liquidity of utilities struggling with collateral requirements, saying there was a risk of a “Lehman” moment.

Reuters: Turkish warship docks in Israel as bilateral ties warm 
 HAIFA, Israel (Reuters) - A Turkish warship has docked in Israel for the first such visit in more than a decade as relations between the U.S. allies improve following fierce feuding over the Palestinian cause. 
The frigate Kemalreis docked in Haifa on Saturday as part of NATO manoeuvres in the Mediterranean sea, a Turkish official said. 
An Israeli official said Ankara had submitted a preliminary request for the crew to disembark on shore leave.

Liz Truss, a Brexit convert, won the Conservative leadership contest and will replace Boris Johnson. 
 The United Kingdom’s next prime minister may be an even bigger Brexiteer than Boris Johnson. 
Liz Truss, the former foreign secretary, has won the Conservative Party’s leadership contest, setting her up to take over as UK prime minister after Johnson announced in July he would resign. Truss defeated Rishi Sunak in a race she was heavily favored to win, largely because she captivated the right-wing base of the Conservative Party, including its Eurosceptic wing.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the attacks took place across 13 different locations in the James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon areas of Saskatchewan on Sunday.

“At this stage in our investigation, we believe some of the victims have been targeted by the suspects and others have been attacked randomly,” Rhonda Blackmore, Assistant Commissioner of RCMP Saskatchewan, said.

Police issued a province-wide Dangerous Person Alert for two suspects, identified as Damien Sanderson and Myles Sanderson.

The search for both suspects was still underway as of Sunday night, police said.

“It is horrific what has happened in our province today,” Blackmore said.</span>

Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher kicked off the concert which included The Beatles&#x27; Paul McCartney and Queen&#x27;s Brian May.

In an emotional send-off, Mr Hawkins’ teenage son Shane joined the band on stage taking over from his dad on drums for their hit song &#x27;My Hero&#x27;.</span>

“It’s just astonishing – a six and a half thousand-word sort of ... diatribe against the Royal Family,” Mr Russell told Sky News Australia. 

“Saying that Harry and Meghan were happy to leave, that they were unhappy at their treatment during their brief time as royals and certainly some veiled threats.”</span>

                              <span>The New York Post has revealed Joe Biden spent 234 days on vacation out of 589 days since becoming president.

Republicans have been calling out President Biden for being away from the White House for two-thirds of August.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates hit back back at the criticism of Mr Biden’s travelling, saying &quot;presidency is a nonstop job that chief executives can do from anywhere in the world&quot;.

“Regardless of location, he has taken fewer vacation days than the modern norm,&quot; he said.

&quot;Being somewhere other than the White House is not the same thing as being on vacation. 

&quot;And President Biden is constantly focused on the numbers that are most important to the American people: lowering costs for families — like prescription drugs and energy — reducing the deficit to fight inflation, creating the most jobs of any year in American history and bringing manufacturing jobs back from overseas, growing the membership of NATO, and passing the most significant gun reform law in almost 30 years.”  

The 79-year-old&#x27;s critics have mocked the constant travels, arguing the country runs better when the president is &quot;away&quot;.

&quot;Out of the last 32 days, Joe Biden has spent 23 of those days on vacation. I’m not criticizing him for it. Our nation is better off with him away on his medical retreats—I mean vacations,&quot; said Breanna Morello.

&quot;41 per cent of Americans have picked up a side job while Joe Biden spent half of August on vacation,&quot; said Lance Gooden.</span>

A massive manhunt is underway to find Damien Sanderson and Myles Sanderson, and warnings have been issued to the neighbouring provinces of Alberta and Manitoba. 

Canadian police say there are 13 separate crime scenes, with some of the victims believed to have been known to the suspects, and others targeted at random.</span>

                              <span>The drop in US stock markets last week extended the market-wide losing streak to three straight weeks.  The Nasdaq Composite has fallen for six straight days for the first time since 2019. Markets’ negative reaction to a seemingly positive August jobs report suggests traders are nervous about the Federal Reserve’s next steps and its effects on the economy.
Weakness in US stock markets pulled Bitcoin (BTC) moved back below $20,000 on September 2 and the bears kept the price below the level over the weekend.  It pulled Bitcoin market dominance at just under 39% on September 4, its lowest level since June 2018, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Duffy, a former congressman who spurred donald trump as an expert, and Oz, who was endorsed by the former president, apparently doesn’t think Trump is being called “angry.”
Biden addressed the country on Thursday and said Trump and “MAGA Republicans” posed a threat to democracy.
Conservatives reacted to the speech with outrage, and Duffy and Oz were no exception on Fox Business Friday.
“The ones who are going to decide this election — because it’s going to be close — are the independents,” Oz said.  “They didn’t like President Biden’s tone.”

The U.S. ambassador to Russia on Sunday ended his tenure as America&#x27;s top diplomat in Moscow after nearly three years. 
Spanning the Trump and Biden administrations, Ambassador John Sullivan will retire entirely from a lengthy career in government service. 
His departure, which comes in the midst of an increasingly serious crisis over Russia´s war in Ukraine as well as disputes over detained Americans in Russia, had been expected this fall as he reached the usual length of time for U.S. ambassadors.

Washington Post: Chilean voters decisively reject leftist constitution 
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chileans on Sunday delivered a resounding rejection to a new leftist constitution that aimed to transform the country into a more egalitarian society. 
In a referendum, Chilean voters were asked to approve or reject a proposal to replace the country’s 1980 dictatorship-era constitution — considered one of the most market-friendly in the world — with one of the world’s most inclusive. 
The new charter envisioned a dramatic shift to the left in the South American nation, expanding the role of government and calling for an economic model that would narrow inequalities and help lift up the poor. 
But for many Chileans, the proposed changes were too drastic. 
With more than 95 percent of ballot boxes tallied Sunday night, about 62 percent of voters rejected the charter, while 38 percent approved it, according to Chile’s electoral authority.

WNU Editor: It was not even close .... With 96% of the votes counted in Sunday’s plebiscite, the rejection camp had 61.9% support compared to 38.1% for approval amid what appeared to be a heavy turnout with long lines at polling states. Voting was mandatory. (AP)
