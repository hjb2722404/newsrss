                              <span>China has lifted suspensions off three of Australia&#x27;s largest meat exporters. 

Imports from the abattoirs were suspended during the pandemic following a string of COVID outbreaks onsite.

China&#x27;s Customs agency announced on Monday that, following a review, products from the three abattoirs will now allowed to send their products into China.

It marks the latest improvement in trade relations.

However, a number of Australian meat establishments, as well as lobster producers, remain subject to various sanctions.</span>

                              <span>Rescue crews are searching for anybody who may be trapped under rubble after an apartment building partially collapsed in the Bronx in New York City. 

Emergency services were called to the scene after the six-story building collapsed around 3:30pm on Monday (local time).

Live pictures have shown a small part of the building still standing but two walls fallen down and several rooms inside the building exposed. 

There are a number of emergency services on site. 

It&#x27;s unknown if there are any injuries.</span>

                              <span>Federal prosecutors have asked the US Supreme Court to quickly rule on whether former President Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution so that his trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election can proceed as scheduled. Special Counsel Jack Smith, in a filing to the Supreme Court, emphasized the importance of resolving the question of a former President&#x27;s immunity from federal prosecution for crimes committed while in office. The Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority, including three justices nominated by Trump, will expedite consideration of the request. Trump&#x27;s trial is set to begin on March 4, 2024.</span>

                              <span>The US State Department has stated that Israel, like any other country buying weapons from the US, must adhere to the laws of war. This comes after the US sold around 14,000 tank shells to Israel without congressional review. The Biden administration used emergency authority to allow the $106.5 million sale. While the State Department has not determined whether Israel has complied with the Conventional Arms Transfers policy, it has urged Israel to do more to minimize civilian harm in the Gaza conflict. The US is monitoring the situation and engaging in conversations with the Israeli government.</span>

                              <span>By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House on Monday passed a ban on imports of Russian uranium as lawmakers seek to add pressure on Moscow for its war on Ukraine, though the measure has waivers in case of supply concerns for domestic reactors. The bill must pass the Senate and be signed by President Joe Biden before becoming law. It is uncertain whether there will be enough time in the Senate schedule for it to be voted on this year. The bill passed by voice vote in the House after the chamber suspended usual voting rules on the measure. &quot;The risks of continuing this dependence ...</span>

                              <span>French lawmakers sent the government’s immigration bill back to the drawing board on Monday, in a surprise move that cut short debates at the lower house and dealt a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to pass laws without a majority.
Lawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far right party as well as many conservatives joined forces to reject the bill on its first day in the National Assembly, adopting a motion proposed by the Greens, which passed by just two votes.
The rejection does not mean the government needs to resign and does not signal the end of the immigration bill.
The government can now decide to send it back to the upper house, send it to a joint committee of senators and deputies to find a compromise, or pull it, which is unlikely.
It can also use special executive powers to force its adoption without a vote.
The immigration bill has been a key plank of Macron’s attempts to show he can be tougher on law and order issues while keeping France’s doors open to foreign workers who can help the French economy.
But short of a majority in parliament, he has struggled to pass a bill that has strict provisions disliked by left-wing lawmakers and more liberal aspects criticised by some conservatives and the far right.
The government has presented the bill as essential to expel foreign criminals more easily. One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.
Other provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government’s aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.

                              <span>Diamonds in the dust – a ring worth 750,000 euros ($807,000), which went missing at the luxury Ritz hotel in Paris, has been found in a vacuum cleaner.
The ring went missing on Friday and its owner suspected hotel staff of theft.
On Sunday, it was found in a vacuum cleaner bag after police launched an investigation, the Ritz said.
The hotel told AFP the ring had been found “thanks to the meticulous search work carried out by our security guards.”
“Our client is delighted with this news,” the hotel was quoted as saying.
The owner, described as a Malaysian businesswoman, went to the police on Friday after discovering that her ring, left on the table in her room, had disappeared.
On Saturday, she left Paris for London but was expected to return to the French capital to retrieve her ring, Le Parisien newspaper said.
It said the Ritz had offered her three nights’ accommodation as compensation but the businesswoman had no intention of taking advantage of the offer.

                              <span>The children of imprisoned Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi said Monday they were &quot;extremely worried&quot; about her health after she undertook a hunger strike in a Tehran prison.
Mohammadi, who has campaigned against the compulsory wearing of the hijab and the death penalty in Iran, stopped eating on Sunday in parallel with Sunday&#x27;s Nobel prize ceremony in Oslo, where she was represented by her 17-year-old twins, Ali and Kiana.
It is not known whether her hunger strike is continuing or if it was just for the day.
&quot;As her children, we are of course extremely worried,&quot; Ali said on Monday at a press conference that followed a meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
&quot;Maybe she is in hospital right now,&quot; his sister Kiana added.

The 46-year-old is fleeing to Spain after realising her legal rights as one of two mothers of three-year-old Arturo are no longer safe under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
&quot;It&#x27;s a nightmare,&quot; she told AFP, saying she and Christine, 42, are braced to leave friends, family and her job in Rome &quot;because it&#x27;s the only escape route&quot;.
Civil unions became legal in Italy in 2016, but the law on parental rights for same-sex couples is unclear.
Encouraged by several court rulings, local mayors have in recent years been registering both biological and non-biological parents on birth certificates.

                              <span>Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders appeared Monday to have persuaded his preferred coalition partners to keep negotiating but reportedly major &quot;stumbling blocks&quot; remain over his hardline anti-Islam, anti-European views.
Wilders delivered a political earthquake in the Netherlands and across Europe last month by handily winning elections and putting his PVV Freedom Party in pole position to form a government.
Unlike Britain and the United States for example, the Netherlands has a hugely fragmented political system that means no one party ever enjoys a parliamentary majority.
Wilders has struggled to convince other party leaders to join his government, as they are put off by elements of his party&#x27;s manifesto seen as unconstitutional, such as banning mosques and the Koran.

                              <span>With less than eight months to go before the Paris Olympics, the organisers and the French government are entering an awkward period in which cracks in the preparations are straining relationships.
The main areas of concern are the environmental issues around the surfing venue in Tahiti, the safety of the unprecedented opening ceremony on the Seine, the efficiency of public transport in the Paris region and, of course, the shadow of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
- Public transport mess -
The anger and irritation that has shrouded journeys for Paris commuters over the last 18 months has spilled into the political arena.
In mid-November the city&#x27;s Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo declared that the transport system in the city would &quot;not be ready&quot; for the summer of 2024.

                              <span>[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Hong Kong’s largest self-funded university, Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU), today held an Honorary Degrees Ceremony in which honorary doctorates were conferred on four distinguished recipients. This followed the conclusion of the winter session of its 2023 Congregation last week.  Up-to-date professional degree programmes These new honorary degree-holders have joined a university that next year will be celebrating its 35th anniversary.

Elsewhere, HKMU has drawn on a HK$73.9 million grant from the Government’s Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education to launch degree programmes in two other fields of high demand: Construction Management and Quantity Surveying, and New Music and Interactive Entertainment.    All HKMU new programmes are being designed to embrace the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.

* Israel has used white phosphorous in attacks on southern Lebanon 
* Rights groups say that on at least one occasion it amounted to a war crime 
* Now an investigation reveals the munitions were supplied by the US 
The White House is concerned about allegations that Israel used white phosphorus supplied by the U.S. during an attack in southern Lebanon, a spokesman said Monday. 
Weapons packed with white phosphorous are not banned under international law but are tightly regulated because of the way they can cause horrific burns. 
An investigation published Monday accused the U.S. of supplying munitions that wounded nine civilians in an attack in October.

UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths reiterated deep concerns for the people of Gaza on Monday, amid reports of intense fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza City and Jabalia in the north of the Strip, and in Khan Younis in the south, while Israeli bombardment of the enclave has continued.  
Speaking in Doha at the launch of the Global Humanitarian Overview, Mr. Griffiths said that the situation was “getting worse”, while efforts to secure “moments of peace” remained of the “greatest importance”.

                              <span>Business Insider: The huge missile barrage on Ukraine that Russia has been saving up for seems to have begun 
* Analysts have long said Russia was keeping missiles and bombs in reserve for winter. 
* Winter is here — and a Russian barrage has begun right on cue. 
* The UK MOD said Russia&#x27;s heavy bomber fleet has been active. 
Its target is likely Ukraine&#x27;s energy network.

Russia appears to have started a major bombing campaign on Ukraine after holding back for months to build its stockpiles. 
The UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that a cruise missile attack last Thursday was &quot;probably the start of a more concerted campaign by Russia aimed at degrading Ukraine&#x27;s energy infrastructure.&quot; 
The missiles &quot;were highly likely AS-23a KODIAK,&quot; Russia&#x27;s premier air-launched cruise missile, the MOD said.

&quot;Russia has almost certainly been stockpiling these missiles for use in the winter campaign,&quot; it said.

                              <span>BBC: Javier Milei: New president tells Argentina &#x27;shock treatment&#x27; looms 
Argentina&#x27;s new far-right president has vowed to deliver economic &quot;shock treatment&quot; in his first speech after formally taking office. 
Javier Milei warned Argentines &quot;there is no money&quot; and recommitted to a programme of harsh austerity measures. 
The populist outsider won a surprise election victory in November with radical pledges to overhaul the South American nation&#x27;s ailing economy. 
Mr Milei&#x27;s inauguration was held in Buenos Aires on Sunday.
In a day of pomp and ceremony, the 53-year-old capped his extraordinary rise to power with a speech which left Argentines in no doubt he intends to embark on an economic path unlike any previous president.

                              <span>Analysts believe that China&#x27;s military has changed its strategy from intelligence-gathering to infiltration in a bid to sew chaos should war break out

 
Daily Mail:  Chinese-affiliated hacking groups infiltrated critical American infrastructure, including Hawaii water utility and at least one oil and gas pipeline, US officials say 
* More than two dozen high-value targets have been attacked in the last year alone as China seeks to inflict &#x27;societal chaos&#x27; in the event of war 
* Beijing is by-passing hi-tech firewalls by targeting ordinary employees 
* It comes as tensions grow over Taiwan, with targets in Hawaii and Guam at the top of the Chinese hit list 
Chinese hackers are positioning themselves inside critical US infrastructure by targeting careless office workers in a bid to cause &#x27;societal chaos&#x27; from within should war break out. 
Beijing&#x27;s military have burrowed into more than 20 major suppliers in the last year alone including a water utility in Hawaii, a major West Coast port and at least one oil and gas pipeline, analysts have revealed. 
They have bypassed elaborate cyber security systems by intercepting passwords and log-ins unguarded by junior employees, leaving China &#x27;sitting on a stockpile of strategic&#x27; vulnerabilities.

The U.S. slammed China for “reckless disregard” and provocative action after Chinese coast guard boats shot water cannons at Philippine ships and collided with a vessel in the South China Sea over the weekend. 
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Chinese boats also deployed acoustic devices, or sound cannons, which can employ extremely loud sounds over a distance to incapacitate a target, to drive away Philippine boats.

Nearly half of voters in a new survey said the United States is spending too much on aid for Ukraine, which comes just ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington. 
The Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll found that 48 percent of voters said the U.S. was spending “too much” on sending financial and military aid to Ukraine. Twenty-seven percent said the U.S. was spending the right amount, and 11 percent said the U.S. was not spending enough. 
Republicans were more likely to say the U.S. is spending too much, with 65 percent saying so. About half of independent voters and 32 percent of Democrats said the U.S. was spending too much.

 The rise of generative AI applications like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Bard already leads to increased demand in the world&#x27;s data center network due to its sometimes hefty requirements for the underlying large language models. 
This computing demand will only increase in the upcoming years, necessitating the building of new data centers and expanding the capacities of existing ones.

As Statista&#x27;s Florian Zandt shows in the following chart, based on 2022 data collected by commercial real estate company Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the race between the global superpowers China and the United States also extends to data centers.

WNU Editor: At the beginning of the year I was asked the question on where should someone invest their money.

Russia will not initiate a diplomatic dialogue. A sense of threat is very real in Russia. Diplomatic channels conveyed this message to the Americans. 
And then, casually, almost as an afterthought while meeting Donbass heroes, Putin announces he will run for President again in next March’s elections. Considering his massive popularity – at least 80% nationally – he’s bound to remain in power until 2030. 
Welcome to VVP-2024. Plenty of time for serial meetings with his dear friend Xi Jinping. The Russia-China strategic partnership – in charge of paving the road to multipolarity – is scheduled to be rocking more progressively than Emerson, Lake and Palmer in Tarkus (“Have you walked in the stones of years?”) 
These have been heady days in dazzling, snowy Moscow. To start with, let’s go on a roll call of all those indicators which are being reluctantly admitted even by rabid NATOstan media.

WNU Editor: Pepe Escobar in the above post is giving a description of Russia that I am always hearing from my friends/contacts/and family members in Russia. Needless to say the above observations are completely opposite to what the Western media is saying is happening in Russia. 

 
Update: The Duran gives a good analysis in the video below on how Putin was recently treated in his last trip to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.. Putin may be ostracized in the West, but he is more than welcomed in other countries.</span>

President Biden will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House this week, the administration announced Sunday, as Congress looks increasingly unlikely to pass additional funding for Ukraine and as U.S. officials warn that the country will run out of money by the end of the year to fight against Russia’s invasion. 
Zelensky also will meet with some congressional leaders on Tuesday. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) invited Zelensky to speak to senators Tuesday morning, according to a Senate leadership aide. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will also meet with Zelensky, spokesman Raj Shah said on X, formerly Twitter.

 Sustained Western aid to Ukraine will compel Russia to negotiate on terms favorable to Kyiv by the end of 2024, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jonathan Finer said on Dec. 8. 
&quot;We want to position Ukraine in such a way by the end of next year that Russia will have to decide whether to come to the negotiating table with conditions acceptable to Ukraine..., or confront a stronger Ukraine,&quot; Finer said at the Aspen Security Forum, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine.
Finer believes that a more robust industrial base in the United States and Europe, which will enhance the capabilities of both the U.S. and Ukrainian military industries, will help power a new counteroffensive.

A senior UN aid official has warned that half of Gaza&#x27;s population is starving, as fighting there continues. 
Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat everyday. 
Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries &quot;almost impossible&quot;, Mr Skau said.

Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home.

Civilian proportion of deaths is higher than the average in all world conflicts in 20th century, data suggests 
The aerial bombing campaign by Israel in Gaza is the most indiscriminate in terms of civilian casualties in recent years, a study published by an Israeli newspaper has found. 
The analysis in Haaretz came as Israeli forces fought to consolidate their control of northern Gaza on Saturday, bombing the Shejaiya district of Gaza City, while also conducting airstrikes on Rafah, a town on the southern border with Egypt where the Israeli army has told people in Gaza to take shelter.

                              <span>Former EU chief Donald Tusk has been chosen by Polish lawmakers to form the next government, marking a significant shift in policy following eight years of right-wing populist rule. Tusk, who previously served as prime minister, received 248 votes in favour and 201 against. The conservative camp&#x27;s proposed new cabinet was rejected. Tusk&#x27;s pro-EU alliance, joined by two smaller opposition groups, secured a majority in parliament. The new government aims to mend strained ties with the EU, unblock frozen EU aid, and restore Poland&#x27;s credibility in the international arena.</span>

The new migration strategy includes a policy roadmap and over 25 commitments for future reform. It aims to cut annual immigration intake to 250,000. Indian students and professionals will not be adversely affected as they are protected under the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement. Indian graduates can stay in Australia temporarily after completing their studies.

He refuted claims of a dysfunctional government and supported his &quot;Eat out to help out&quot; subsidised meal scheme. Sunak, who became finance minister before the pandemic, provided significant financial support to businesses. Critics have questioned the scheme&#x27;s contribution to infections, but Sunak stated that it followed safe reopening guidelines. The inquiry also raised concerns about prioritizing the economy over public health, and Sunak expressed remorse for those who lost loved ones.</span>

In Iowa, Trump&#x27;s first-choice support surges to 51%, positioning him as the clear front-runner for the caucuses. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sees a modest increase in support, while former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley holds steady. Trump&#x27;s dominance is pronounced among key demographics, including evangelicals, Republicans, and first-time caucus-goers. Trump also holds a significant advantage over President Biden.</span>

The miners failed to emerge at the end of their Thursday night shift at Springs, east of Johannesburg, in a near repeat of a three-day protest in October, the Gold One company said. The miners all came out on Monday. Twelve were injured and were taken to hospital with injuries including fractures and cuts, said Ziyaad Hassam, head of legal affairs at the Gold One mine in Gauteng province.</span>

                              <span>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has submitted a discrimination complaint on behalf of Hajur El-Haggan, a Black Muslim Arab American teacher in Maryland. El-Haggan was placed on administrative leave for including a phrase supporting Palestinian rights in her email signature. Critics label the phrase as &#x27;antisemitic&#x27; and a rallying cry used by anti-Israel voices. CAIR argues that the school district selectively enforced its policy on email signatures. El-Haggan offered to remove the phrase but was kept on administrative leave. CAIR&#x27;s complaint alleges discrimination based on race and religion.</span>

The US has blocked the latest international effort to end the fighting and has provided additional munitions to Israel. The death toll in Gaza has risen to about 18,000, with 49,500 injured. Palestinians are facing severe shortages of basic goods due to the difficulty of delivering aid. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warns of a worsening situation and the possibility of a mass displacement into Egypt.</span>

This incident adds to the tensions between the Philippines and China in the disputed South China Sea (SCS). The Philippines accused the Chinese coast guard of obstructing their supply vessels near Scarborough Shoal, while China claims that the Philippine boat deliberately collided with their vessel. The situation escalated as water cannons were used and damages were inflicted on both sides.</span>

They agree that Washington is deeply dysfunctional, but disagree about what can be done to overcome political obstacles and the degree to which this dysfunction gives Russia and China an edge. Chris questions additional inflation adjustments for fixed price defense contracts, Melanie criticizes the United Nations’ unwillingness to recognize sexual violence in Gaza, and Zack welcomes new colleague Todd Harrison to the American Enterprise Institute.     Episode Reading:  Robert M.

                              <span>The US President&#x27;s son Hunter Biden has been indicted for a second time over his financial dealings. 

He&#x27;s facing new criminal charges that accuse him of failing to pay his taxes, when spending big on his luxurious lifestyle. 

Hunter has evaded more than $1.4 million in taxes while funding his extravagant lifestyle which includes drugs, escorts, cars and luxury hotels. 

Curtin University&#x27;s Dean of Global Futures Professor Joe Siracusa believes the president’s son won’t “get off” on the fresh charges. 

“This finishes off the Biden administration – Biden is weary.”</span>

                              <span>A fresh indictment against Hunter Biden will have broken the “spirit” of US President Joe Biden, says Curtin University&#x27;s Dean of Global Futures Professor Joe Siracusa. 

The President’s son is facing a total of nine criminal charges, which accuse him of failing to pay his taxes when spending big on his luxurious lifestyle. 

Hunter has evaded more than $1.4 million in taxes while funding his extravagant lifestyle, which includes drugs, escorts, cars and luxury hotels. 

“This, I think, finishes off the Biden administration – Biden is weary,” Professor Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

“There’s going to be a hell of a race to replace him in the Democratic Party.”</span>

                              <span>Nearly a hundred people have stripped down to their festive swimsuits in Hungary for the 20th annual Budapest Naked Santa Run. 

Participants braved the cold and ran through the streets shouting, ‘ho ho ho’. 

They also stopped over in several spots to sing and dance to the surprise of tourists.

Organisers say they were inspired by a similar marathon in Boston.

Funds raised will be donated to a children’s charity.</span>

                              <span>Albert Uderzo&#x27;s daughter, Sylvie Uderzo, challenges the auction of an original cover painting from the 1963 comic book &#x27;Asterix and Cleopatra&#x27;. The painting, expected to fetch 400,000 to 500,000 euros, shows Cleopatra with Asterix and Obelix. Sylvie Uderzo argues that the painting must have been stolen as her father would have signed and dedicated it if he had given it away. The auction house, Millon, claims to be selling the work on behalf of the son of a man who was given it by Uderzo over 50 years ago.</span>

Szymon Holownia, a former TV personality known for hosting the Polish edition of &#x27;Got Talent!&#x27;, has gained fame as the parliament speaker. His wit and quips during plenary proceedings have attracted thousands of new followers to the chamber&#x27;s social media channels. Holownia&#x27;s popularity has surged since the Oct 15 elections, with the parliament&#x27;s YouTube channel seeing a tenfold increase in subscribers. The rise in popularity even led a Warsaw cinema to organize a screening of the confidence vote for the conservative government.</span>

The hospital was already under strain before the war, with limited supplies. Israel claimed Hamas was running a command center below the facility, but the raid&#x27;s purpose remains unclear. The ongoing fighting has killed thousands in Gaza, mainly women and children. The majority of Gaza&#x27;s population has been displaced, seeking shelter in the heavily-bombed north.

Participants in the protest, titled &quot;Never again is now,&quot; marched to the Brandenburg Gate.

                              <span>HAVANA (Reuters) — Cuba said late on Saturday it had thwarted a terrorist plot hatched in neighboring south Florida, according to a report broadcast on state-run media, after a man allegedly arrived on the island by jetski to commit acts of violence. 
The resulting investigation, which state-run media said was still underway, alleged the plot was tied to at least two groups, Nueva Nacion Cubana and La Nueva Nacion Cubana en Armas, which Cuba has labeled as terrorist entities. 
Reuters was unable to contact either of the groups late on Saturday.</span>

	&quot;You mentioned Hitler earlier. I don&#x27;t think Trump is in the same league as Hitler. But he is using a similar playbook,&quot; she added. &quot;Hitler told Germany and Europe exactly what he intended to do. Nobody believed him. He wrote in a very long book. People read that book. They still did not believe it. And then he went ahead and executed his plan. And Trump is doing exactly the same thing.&quot;

                              <span>Former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who has claimed his home was targeted by a break-in shortly after he published a scathing &quot;Anonymous&quot; op-ed about Trump&#x27;s presidency, appeared on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta on Saturday. Acosta asked if the things Trump says he will do in a second term, such as mass deportations, another Muslim ban, and firings across the federal government, are realistic.


	&quot;It&#x27;s not a stretch at all. This is how Stephen Miller, likely to be one of Trump&#x27;s cabinet secretaries in a second term, described the second term to me. He specifically described day one to me: &#x27;On day one, when we win, it will be a shock and awe blitz.&#x27; You have to take him at his word,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;What does Stephen Miller mean by that? He means in a second go-around, there won&#x27;t be years of delay and indecision about whether to moderate Trump&#x27;s position so he can win a second term. It will be throwing the kitchen sink at American democracy and doing all the things he&#x27;s wanted to do by abusing federal power.&quot;

	Taylor went on to say that his biggest worry is the potential weaponization of the national security community.

	&quot;If you look anywhere in history you see the most grievous abuses of power is when the army or domestic security forces are used against a leader&#x27;s political enemies. And those are things that aren&#x27;t just forecasts of what Trump could do. He&#x27;s talked about weaponizing the spy community, to spy on his adversaries. He has talked about creating his own mercenary force within the community so he doesn&#x27;t have to go through a chain of command that he worries would disobey him. He&#x27;s talked about using the Department of Homeland Security to intimidate his opponents in democratic sanctuary cities and to make sure that blue states don&#x27;t get aid and red states do when there&#x27;s natural disasters. This is laid out very clear. We know what will happen.&quot;

Greene, who was recently called a hypocrite for saying Biden was scared to debate without noting her chosen candidate Donald Trump has taken similar positions, used social media to push blame on the president for a purported terrorist attack she apparently expects to occur because of the shared Mexico border.
On her congressional account, Greene posted her assessment of who would be &quot;entirely to blame&quot; if there was a terrorist attack on American soil.
&quot;If God forbid, there is a terrorist attack in America, the Biden Administration is entirely to blame [because] of the border!!!&quot; Greene exclaimed.

                              <span>Reuters: US skips congressional review to approve emergency sale of tank shells to Israel 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration has used an emergency authority to allow the sale of about 14,000 tank shells to Israel without congressional review, the Pentagon said on Saturday. 
The State Department on Friday used an Arms Export Control Act emergency declaration for the tank rounds worth $106.5 million for immediate delivery to Israel, the Pentagon said in a statement. 
The shells are part of a bigger sale that was first reported by Reuters on Friday that the Biden administration is asking the U.S. Congress to approve. 
The larger package is worth more than $500 million and includes 45,000 shells for Israel&#x27;s Merkava tanks, regularly deployed in its offensive in Gaza, which has killed thousands of civilians.

Business Insider: Putin believes Ukraine will fall within just months without new US aid, says Senate Intelligence Chair 
* Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner said Putin believes that Ukraine will fall in just months. 
* Warner drew his assessment from US intelligence after senators blocked a $175 million aid package. 
* &quot;Vladimir Putin&#x27;s hopes for victory rest on the US walking away from Ukraine,&quot; he said. 
Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner said Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine will fall within just months without renewed US military aid. 
Sen. Warner asked, &quot;Why, at this moment in time, would we prove Putin right?&quot; 
Warner made the statement on Wednesday after the Senate failed to hit the 60-vote threshold required to advance a new &quot;crucial&quot; military aid package to Ukraine.

WNU Editor: I do not know where U.S. Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner gets his intelligence. But I do know in Russia the expectation is that even if the West stops providing aid to Ukraine in the coming weeks, there is more than enough weapons and ammo in Ukraine to keep the war going on for a very long time. 
As to what is my take. 
Ukraine does not have the manpower to continue the war and accomplish its goal of expelling Russian military forces out of Ukraine. This new US aid, which I believe will be approved by the US Congress, will only prolong the slaughter.

 
Update: He is on a roll (for now) .... As Ukraine struggles with fickle allies, Vladimir Putin is on a roll (CBC News).</span>

                              <span>Flattery, gifts, and more are on the table when it comes to European officials dealing with a theoretical future president Donald Trump, according to a report published on Saturday.
Trump has bucked historically consistent concepts when it comes to dealing with European nations, including a rejection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, &quot;America’s most important military alliance,&quot; according to the New York Times. Trump has said repeatedly that withdrawing from NATO would save the U.S. money.
That&#x27;s causing some panic abroad, according to the Times.
&quot;In interviews over the past several months, more than a half-dozen current and former European diplomats — speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from Mr. Trump should he win — said alarm was rising on Embassy Row and among their home governments that Mr. Trump’s return could mean not just the abandonment of Ukraine, but a broader American retreat from the continent and a gutting of the Atlantic alliance,&quot; the article states.

The Times quoted James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral who was NATO’s supreme allied commander until 2013, as saying there is a &quot;great fear&quot; in Europe about Trump&#x27;s tentative plans.
It also reported that most officials were simply &quot;out of ideas&quot; when it comes to the Don.
&quot;The interviews with current and former diplomats revealed that European officials were mostly out of ideas for how to deal with Mr. Trump other than returning to a previous playbook of flattery and transactional tributes,&quot; the article says. &quot;Smaller countries that are more vulnerable to Russian attacks are expected to try to buy their way into Mr. Trump’s good graces by increasing their orders of American weapons or — as Poland did during his term — by performing grand acts of adulation, including offering to name a military base Fort Trump in return for his placing a permanent presence there.&quot;

                              <span>By Kate Abnett and Mohammed Benmansour DUBAI (Reuters) - The European Union&#x27;s climate chief on Saturday heavily criticised an attempt by OPEC to derail a COP28 deal on phasing out fossil fuels, calling the move by the oil producers&#x27; club &quot;unhelpful&quot; and &quot;out of whack&quot;. Nearly 200 countries meeting in Dubai for the U.N.&#x27;s COP28 climate summit are debating whether to agree, for the first time, to eventually end the world&#x27;s use of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.

A Ukrainian soldier said he stopped shelling small Russian units because his brigade was running out of US-provided artillery ammunition, per The Times of London. 
&quot;When it&#x27;s two or three soldiers, I&#x27;m not shooting any more; only when it&#x27;s a critical situation, say, ten guys close to our infantry, we will work,&quot; Sergeant Taras &quot;Fizruk&quot; told the newspaper. 
The 31-year-old mortar gunner said that he and his comrades from the 47th Mechanized Brigade &quot;had ten times more ammunition over the summer.&quot; per the newspaper.

Bloomberg: US Army Says It’s Not Yet Strained by Supplying Both Israel and Ukraine 
 (Bloomberg) -- US Army ammunition and equipment inventories aren’t yet being strained by supplying both Israel and Ukraine the Army’s top weapons buyer said Thursday, although he warned that could change as the conflicts drag on. 
“We’ve done munitions of many types, for everything from helicopters to artillery” for Israel, Douglas Bush, assistant secretary for acquisition, said at a conference in Washington. “But nothing where it was so far, at least, a direct competition with what was already planned to go to Ukraine.”

Bloomberg: US Won’t Rule Out Military Action Against Houthis, Official Says 
A top White House official said the US won’t rule out the possibility of strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which have been blamed for targeting commercial ships, while it focuses now on sanctions and security at sea. 
“We have certainly not ruled out the possibility of taking military action — we reserve that right,” Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told the Aspen Security Forum in Washington on Thursday. For the time being, the US will focus on “a maritime coalition to provide reassurance and security for commercial sea lanes,” he said. 

“And if there is a decision to escalate against us, we will look at other options,” Finer said.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter to warn of a &#x27;humanitarian catastrophe&#x27; in Gaza. The US vetoed a UN resolution for an immediate ceasefire, stating that it would allow Hamas to continue ruling Gaza. An Israeli man taken hostage by Hamas militants has died during a rescue mission. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,400, with over 46,000 wounded. In the West Bank, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces.</span>

Now, as Prime Minister, he has adopted the Rwanda plan to close a polling deficit. However, the plan has faced challenges, with the UK courts ruling it unlawful and senior ministers leaving the Cabinet.

Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, sought an emergency hearing after learning her unborn baby had trisomy 18. The court&#x27;s decision has sparked debate over the state&#x27;s medical exception to its strict abortion ban after six weeks.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
