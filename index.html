                              <span>Australia and India have a rich and shared history, underpinned by strong higher education and research links – opening an opportunity to grow trade relationships through education, particularly post-pandemic. 

Universities Australia CEO Catriona Jackson says it&#x27;s a time of “real opportunity” to boost the “already really strong and deep ties” between the countries. 

“At the moment, there are an enormous number of Australians travelling to India and same the way back,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“We had the Indian Education Minister in Australia very recently.

“Many very senior Indians are coming to Australia to have increasing conversations about really rocket-fuelling the relationship, and we can see all sorts of benefits.”</span>

                              <span>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have officially been demoted on the Royal Family&#x27;s website over the weekend in the latest snub for the couple since the Queen&#x27;s death.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex&#x27;s profile pages were relegated to the bottom of the Royal Family&#x27;s list.

The website ranks the senior working family first, such as King Charles III, Queen Consort Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales.

Next are the other minor working members of the Royal Family, such as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.

Beneath all of them are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who only sit above the embattled Duke of York – Prince Andrew.</span>

Mr Norman says that LIV Golf attempted to reach out to the European and PGA tour and integrate “within their system,” and it is “a shame people have taken this stance”.

Mr Norman believes that LIV Golf is “additive to the sport” and is confident about their success in the future.</span>

                              <span>Voting has ended in so-called referendums on whether or not to join Russia in four occupied regions of Ukraine. 

Preliminary results have already been released by Russian state media, which report around 90 per cent of votes counted so far are in favour of joining. 

The referendums have been widely dismissed as a “sham”. 

The Governor of one of the regions said the referendums could raise the risk of Moscow using nuclear weapons against Ukrainian forces. 

“We need to be ready. And Russia needs to understand such a step would plunge them into an abyss before they even acted,” Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. 

“Russians have a choice: either come here to the territory of Ukraine and not return alive, come back with bits of your body missing or be imprisoned or rise up against the regime on the ground in Russia.”</span>

Reporter Peter Doocy questioned the press secretary on what President Biden thinks of rising crime statistics impacting major cities in the last year.

&quot;Does President Biden think America&#x27;s big cities are safe?&quot; Mr Doocy asked.

&quot;It is not a yes or no question. It is very much a question of what has he done…to make sure that cities…have the funding and have what they need to protect their community, and that is what the president has done,&quot; Ms Jean-Pierre responded.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Jean-Pierre for avoiding the question, and claimed she portrays Biden’s America as a “Mythical Place.”</span>

The Guardian: EU and US consider further sanctions on Iran over protest crackdown 
Demonstrators call for greater support from west and help communicating with outside world 
The EU and the US are considering further sanctions against Iran over the attempt to suppress demonstrations and strikes in universities over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in a police detention centre. 
Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, condemned Iran’s disproportionate use of force and said all options would be on the table at the next meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers. 
The main options are helping to prevent the internet being shut by Iran, and further economic sanctions. 
Demonstrators at the street protests – now in their 10th day – have also called for greater support from the west, as well as help in communicating with the outside world.

                              <span>CNBC: For the first time in 30 years, Asia’s developing economies are set to grow faster than China’s, ADB says 
* The Asian Development Bank now sees growth among emerging Asian economies of 4.3% in 2022 and 4.9% in 2023. 
* The ADB expects the rest of developing Asia excluding China to grow by 5.3% in both 2022 and 2023, while it now expects China to grow by 3.3% in 2022, lower than revised forecasts released in July. 
* This will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the report said. 
Asia’s developing economies may be showing signs of recovery, but the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cut its growth forecasts for them yet again — thanks to China’s prolonged zero-Covid policy. 
But this will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the Manila-based lender said in its latest outlook report released Wednesday. 
“The last time was in 1990, when (China’s) growth slowed to 3.9% while GDP in the rest of the region expanded by 6.9%,” it said. 
The ADB now expects developing Asia — excluding China — to grow by 5.3% in 2022, and China by 3.3% in the same year.

Newly elected Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni will be the first woman to lead Italy, a fact that is producing far less than the usual “girl power” cheers. That relative quiet is undoubtedly due to the fact that Italy now joins Great Britain (Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, Liz Truss) and Germany (Angela Merkel) in having chosen female heads of the elected government only from parties of the center-Right or Right. Meloni is undeniably a figure of the social Right.

Beijing aims to pursue its policy of open trade, the Vice Commerce Minister says 
 China is not planning to end its policy of open trade, and aims to continue purchasing goods from across the world, including Russian oil and gas, TASS reports on Tuesday citing China’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen.
“You want me to comment on several projected trends at once,” Wang said, responding to a question from a Western journalist about China&#x27;s plans to buy energy from Russia and to sell its own produce to the EU and the US.

Politico:  ECB’s Lagarde expects technical recession this winter 
Central Bank estimates currently predict euro area growth to remain positive in 2023, albeit low at 0.9 percent.  The European Central Bank expects the euro area economy to contract in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter next year, its president said Monday. 
That fits the definition of a technical recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. 
&quot;It is difficult to predict what the real outcome will be in 2023 but it will certainly be a difficult year of which the first quarter will most likely be negative, as we believe the last quarter of 2022 will likely be negative as well,&quot; ECB President Christine Lagarde told the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

Update #1: Europe&#x27;s outlook &#x27;darkening,&#x27; ECB head hedges on recession (AP) 
Update #2: EU central bank warns ‘outlook is darkening’ (RT)   
WNU Editor: ECB President Christine Lagarde blames Russia for this economic crisis, even though it is the EU that imposed sanctions over Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine thereby precipitating the current economic crisis not the otherway around. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde is also predicting a short technical recession. 
I disagree. 
Europe&#x27;s access to cheap and reliable energy from Russia has now come to an end. What this means is that Europe&#x27;s business model, based on cheap energy, is now broken.
For the people in Europe this means expensive energy alternatives and supplies, the closure of businesses that are dependent on reliable and affordable energy, and the departure of businesses to other more affordable energy producing countries. 
Europe is not facing a short recession this winter. Europe is already in a recession, and it is going to get worse.</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg: Germany Secures Just One Tanker of Gas During Scholz’s Gulf Tour 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz secured just one shipment of liquefied natural gas from the United Arab Emirates, with a non-binding agreement for more, as Europe’s biggest economy struggles to replace Russian supplies. 
The cargo -- 137,000 cubic meters -- will be delivered by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to German utility RWE AG by early 2023. ADNOC also signed a memorandum of understanding to make more deliveries next year. An ensuing trip to Qatar didn’t immediately yield any more deals. 
Securing additional supplies is crucial for Germany after the Kremlin shut down a key pipeline. Officials have grown increasingly concerned about blackouts and rationing this winter, and the economy is hurtling toward a recession. The deal announced Sunday shows how difficult it will be for the country to get more gas in the near-term.

WNU Editor: So much for this summer&#x27;s reassurances from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his ministers that they would succeed in finding alternatives to Russian gas. They lied. But at least he got one tanker from Qatar, and maybe a few more next year, albeit at a record high price.</span>

NATO would not intervene if Moscow used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, Dmitry Medvedev has said, claiming that Kiev’s Western backers would be unwilling “to die in a nuclear apocalypse” for the country. 
However, the former Russian president said it was highly unlikely that the conditions for warranting a nuclear response by Moscow would arise in Ukraine.

Europe was racing on Tuesday to investigate possible sabotage behind sudden and unexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea, infrastructure at the heart of an energy crisis since Russia invaded Ukraine. 
Photos taken by the Danish military showed large masses of bubbles on the surface of the water emanating from the three leaks located in Sweden&#x27;s and Denmark&#x27;s economic zones, spreading from 200 to 1,000 metres (656 feet to 0.62 miles) in diameter.

The barge, which is festooned with radar reflectors, antennas, defensive launchers, and other gear, first appeared in model form a year ago. 
Pictures recently emerged on social media of an interesting Chinese barge covered in various radar reflectors and antennas, and also equipped with a pair of Type 726-series defensive launchers that are used on various People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy warships. By all indications, the barge&#x27;s main purpose is to support countermeasure and electronic warfare and related test and training activities, which could also support the development of new and improved weapons, sensors, and countermeasures. In some ways, it looks similar to decoy target barges that were used by Russia in efforts to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge in Crimea earlier this year.

WNU Editor: It looks like the Chinese are conducting exercises in countermeasures and electronic warfare. And this barge does have similarities to a barge that the Russian navy has deployed around the Kerch Strait Bridge to protect it from Ukrainian missile attacks (see image below).

Xi Jinping must make his move within a generation, before a growing India, climate change-induced ecological costs, demographic weakness, or even further political liberalization in China put Taiwan beyond reach. 
The policy of strategic ambiguity maintained by the United States vis-à-vis the status of Taiwan is an absurdity that has lost its initially intended purpose of drawing Communist China away from the Soviet Union. It is not a subtle declaration, as its proponents in the U.S. government claim, intended to preserve peace because it appeals to some imagined political equilibrium. Taiwan has all of the desirable properties of a country that deserves the close protection of allies: it is a very liberal democracy, a key component of the world’s economic system, and a geostrategic cork against Communist China’s easy access to the Pacific Ocean.

WNU Editor: I know among my friends in China they have a different point of view. That time is on China&#x27;s side when it comes to Taiwan. And I can understand this logic. 
Public opinion polls in Taiwan have always shown a certain level of support for closer ties, even reunification, with China .... Taiwan Opinion Polling on Unification with China (Jamestown /Foundation). As China continues to grow in influence and power, coupled with a more stable geopolitical environment, I can see a scenario where both countries will develop closer ties without Chinese military threats and coercion. It will take, but the Chinese are always looking at the long game.</span>

CNN: US Navy sends its most advanced surface warship to east Asia  
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — The US Navy’s most advanced surface warship is showing its stealthy profile in the western Pacific on a mission that may set the stage for the eventual deployment of US hypersonic missiles to the region. 
The USS Zumwalt is the first in a class of three multimission guided missile destroyers the Navy says will “create a new level of battlespace complexity for potential adversaries.” 
In the Pacific, one of those potential adversaries is obviously China, and the Zumwalt will certainly get Beijing’s attention. 
“The presence of a stealth warship will draw a great deal of (Chinese) interest,” especially if the Zumwalt is outfitted with hypersonic weapons, said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.

Business Insider: Bill Gates says political polarization &#x27;may bring it all to an end&#x27; and could even lead to a civil war 
* Bill Gates is sounding the alarm on political polarization in the US. 
* &quot;Political polarization may bring it all to an end, we&#x27;re going to have a hung election and a civil war,&quot; he told Forbes recently. 
* Gates, who has been the target of many conspiracy theories over the years, also pointed out the dangers of misinformation. 
Bill Gates usually focuses on issues like poverty and infectious diseases through his charitable foundation, but another problem on his mind is the polarization of US politics.
&quot;I admit that political polarization may bring it all to an end, we&#x27;re going to have a hung election and a civil war,&quot; he recently said in the keynote conversation at this year&#x27;s Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy. &quot;I have no expertise in that. I&#x27;m not going to divert my money to that because I wouldn&#x27;t know how to spend it.&quot; 
Political polarization, he says, goes hand-in-hand with another issue: the spread of misinformation.

Mirror: Nord Stream pipelines supplying gas from Russia &#x27;attacked&#x27; as pressure plunges 
A sudden drop in pressure on the Nord Stream pipelines has been due to a leak after it is believed they have been attacked, a German economy official reportedly said 
Gas pipelines connecting Russia to the rest of Europe appear to have been sabotaged after suffering a sudden drop in pressure, a German economy official reportedly said. 
The now defunct Russian-owned Nord Stream 2 suffered a gas leak and it has now been followed by a drop of pressure on Nord Stream 1, with German officials reportedly believing that the pipelines have been attacked. 
Supply has not been impacted as there was no gas being sent through the pipelines.

The Bank&#x27;s Governor said in a statement, &quot;the Bank is monitoring developments in financial markets very closely in light of the significant repricing of financial assets&quot;.

&quot;The MPC will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to return inflation to the 2 per cent target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit.&quot;</span>

The blaze began in the basement before spreading to the mall&#x27;s loading dock.

About a hundred people, including employees and customers, were evacuated to a nearby hotel – and more than 500 firefighters and 90 vehicles were called in to extinguish the inferno.

An investigation into the fire is underway, however eyewitness reports linked an explosion heard before the fire to the charging of an electric vehicle.</span>

                              <span>CNBC: Sterling hits record low against the dollar, as Asia-Pacific currencies also weaken 
* Sterling’s plunge comes after last week’s announcement by the new U.K. government that it would implement tax cuts and investment incentives to boost growth. 
* Critics say those economic measures will disproportionately benefit the wealthy and could see the U.K. take on high levels of debt at a time of rising interest rates. 
The British pound plunged to a record low on Monday morning in Asia, following last week’s announcement by the new U.K. government that it would implement tax cuts and investment incentives to boost growth.

Expect higher inflation, higher interest rates, greater costs when it comes to debt servicing, and a lower stock market. Bottom line. Here comes a recession. 
As for the U.S.. While imports are now cheaper, their exports are being priced out of the market.

                              <span>The Mermaid Inn, a perennially popular restaurant at 570 Amsterdam Ave.  for 15 years, will close on October 16.  Owners Danny Abrams and Cindy Smith said they had mutually agreed with the building’s new owners, a local partnership, to terminate their lease on the soon-to-expire New England-style seafood spot.
“We’re both very sad,” Smith said of her and Abrams after breaking the news to 90 employees.
Their new owner has unknown plans for the building and, “We didn’t want to have a restaurant surrounded by scaffolding,” Smith said.
But mermaid lovers can also expect a new location nearby, Abrams said. 
“We’re looking at two or three places to move to on the Upper West Side, and hope to be one by late spring or early summer,” he said.
Meanwhile, the duo are set to open a mammoth new Mermaid Inn at 127 W. 43rd Street near Times Square, the former site of HB Burger, where they partnered with Alicart Restaurant Group CEO Jeffrey Bank.
Abrams and Smith said Amsterdam Avenue employees would be offered jobs at the Times Square site.  Only about half of the planned 550 seats will open this fall, with the rest to follow early next year. 
The New England-style seafood spot will seek a new home on the Upper West Side, the owners said.James Keivom
“We haven’t built it yet,” Abrams explained.
This will be their fifth and biggest mermaid.  The oldest, at 96 Second Ave.  city ​​center, only reopened after two-year pandemic.  The others are in Greenwich Village (where it’s called the Mermaid Oyster Bar) and Chelsea.

                              <span>Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering a partial mobilisation is “not going to go very well,” former US ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker says.

“There are protests against it, people trying to flee the country,” Mr Volker told Sky News Australia.

“Even those who are successfully forced into the military service will be poorly motivated, very little training and they don’t have the equipment to give to them. 

“They are just going to be cannon fodder thrown into this conflict.”</span>

The DART mission will smash into an asteroid in the world&#x27;s first planetary defence test. 

The experiment aims to test whether deflecting or slowing down an asteroid on a potential collision course with earth may help to prevent a catastrophic impact.</span>

Kanye, who legally changed his name to Ye, was chatting in a new interview with hello america    his current legal battles with Gap and Adidas, with whom he has separate collaboration agreements for his Yeezy brand.

In 2013, Kanye defiantly objected to Sway’s insistence that he was distributing his own line rather than working with a conglomerate, shouting, “You don’t have the answers, Sway!”

Looking back, Kanye, in a much softer tone, said Sway was right. 

Kanye isn’t known for being accommodating, so it’s a shame he wasn’t asked to back down on other comments he made now that the rapper, producer, designer and businessman added e…</span>

                              <span>Hilaria Baldwin has given birth to her seventh child with husband Alec Baldwin, she shared a post on instagram Saturday afternoon.  The girl, named Ilaria Catalina Irena, was born on Thursday.
“She’s here! We’re so excited to introduce you to our little dream come true,” she wrote.
Hilaria added that both she and the baby are healthy and happy.

“Her Baldwinito brothers are spending the day bonding and welcoming her into our home,” she wrote.  “Much love to you all. We are so happy to celebrate this wonderful news with you.”


The yoga instructor and actress announced    that she was pregnant in March, calling it a “big surprise”.
“After many ups and downs over the past few years, we have an exciting one and a big surprise: another Baldwinito is coming this fall,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.  “We were sure that our family was complete and we are very happy with this surprise.”


In 2020, the couple welcome  a boy named Edward.  Then, six months later, they announced  the birth of their sixth child via surrogacy, a daughter named Lucia.  Hilaria had already opened up on social media about suffering two miscarriages.
Alec also has a 26-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger.
Hilaria was on a social media break for several weeks before announcing her pregnancy.  She had already moved away from social media last fall, when Alec was holding a gun that dispensed  on the set of the movie “Rust”, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.

                              <span>Former President Donald Trump is again signaling an affinity with believers in the QAnon conspiracies – on Thursday night he reposted a video originally shared by a QAnon follower containing catchphrases and which integrated Trump into images affiliated with the QAnon. conspiratorial movement.
The video includes edited footage of Trump that makes it look like he is holding a playing card with a “Q” and holding an American flag surrounded by the letter Q. There is also a slide with the QAnon slogan “WWG1WGA”, an acronym for “where let’s go one, let’s all go” and a man wearing Trump’s red tie with a “Q” pin in his lapel.

It said this was in line with Washington&#x27;s hostile stance towards Tehran.
&quot;By reducing the severity of a number of communications sanctions - while maintaining maximum pressure - the U.S. is seeking to advance its goals against Iran,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the center of the storm, now called Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona, was now in the Gulf of St. Lawrence after racing through Nova Scotia. Reports of downed trees and power lines were widespread in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Fiona, which nearly a week ago devastated parts of the Caribbea...</span>

Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), called it a &quot;heart-wrenching tragedy&quot;.
At least 14 people rescued were recovering in hospitals in Syria while six others were discharged, as search efforts continued, with several people still missing since the boat sank on Thursday.
&quot;There are 89 victims, while 14 people are receiving treatment at Al-Basel Hospital, two of whom are in intensive care,&quot; Syria&#x27;s official news agency SANA reported, quoting Iskandar Ammar, a hospital official.

&quot;Our culture has changed so much in the last 50 years when people used to live in igloos... the change is happening so fast, (and) we are losing our culture,&quot; he tells AFP.
Flaherty blames the societal shifts for a series of social ills such as violent crime, substance abuse and a high rate of suicide.

Angry demonstrators have taken to the streets of major cities across Iran, including the capital Tehran, for eight straight nights since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.
The Kurdish woman was pronounced dead after spending three days in a coma following her arrest by Iran&#x27;s feared morality police for wearing the hijab headscarf in an &quot;improper&quot; way.
&quot;The number of people who died in recent riots in the country has risen to 35,&quot; state media said, raising the official toll from at least 17 dead, including five security personnel.

However analysts aren&#x27;t convinced the Russian president is willing to be the first to unleash nuclear weapons since the US bombed Japan in 1945.
AFP spoke with several experts and officials about the possible scenarios that could arise should Russia carry out a nuclear attack.
What would a Russian nuclear attack look like?

                              <span>Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had downed four Iranian-made &quot;kamikaze&quot; unmanned aerial vehicles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain Tehran was harming Ukrainian sovereignty and its citizens.
	

		Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied.
	

		&quot;Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran,&quot; said a statement on the foreign ministry&#x27;s website.
	

		&quot;In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv.&quot;
	

		The message was handed to the acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
	

		Military authorities in southern Ukraine said in a statement they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the port of Odesa.
	

		Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets.

		It would also &quot;enable a global just transition for every worker, community and nation with fossil fuel dependence,&quot; said the leader of the carbon-negative country.
	

		A U.N. climate science panel - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - has warned that global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5 degrees C warming limit and reach some 3.2 degrees C by the end of century.

                              <span>A man who has fled his home country of Russia this week delivered a scathing portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s leadership in an interview with The Atlantic.
The man in question, a 38-year-old IT manager named Anton Shalaev, escaped from Russia this week to the Armenian capitol of Yerevan, which is one of the few places that will still allow Russians into the country.
When asked specifically about Putin&#x27;s decision making during the war, Shalaev did not hesitate to slam the man who has led his homeland for more than two decades.
&quot;A few old men and an army of zombies are leading us to hell,&quot; he said. &quot;I say that because people around me in Russia behaved as if they had been bitten by a zombie, dragging my entire country into a dreadful war. All I saw was Russian loser husbands beating their wives, while the entire rotting house of the state system has turned my people into an army of the dead.&quot;
IN OTHER NEWS: Insiders fear Letitia James is set to inflict &#x27;the biggest political damage&#x27; to Trump with GOP voters: report
To put a fine point on it, Shalaev added, &quot;They are my enemies.&quot;
Shalaev also had some unkind words for Russian state media operations.
&quot;Russian propaganda is a weapon, and the bastards working there are war criminals,&quot; he said. &quot;The greatest guilt in this entire tragedy belongs to a small bunch of old men at the top: KGB officers.&quot;
Various media outlets have reported that many Russian men of military age have been trying to escape the country even since Putin called for a mobilization earlier this week to rescue his war in Ukraine.

                              <span>One viral video on Twitter says it all about Iranian protesters’ defiance of the “morality police”: a young woman throws her veil into a bonfire and dances.


	The official death toll from popular unrest in Iran shot up to 17 on Thursday as Raisi vowed that Amini’s death would be investigated. She died in a Tehran hospital on September 16 after falling into a coma following her arrest by the “morality police” which enforces the wearing of the veil.


Women are compelled to cover their hair in public in Iran, which as a Shiite theocratic state follows a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The morality police – officially known as the Gasht-e Ershad; or “guidance patrol” – are responsible for enforcing this dress code.
But the law does not precisely define the “correct” way to wear the veil…</span>

                              <span>DUBAI (Reuters) -State-organised demonstrations took place in several Iranian cities on Friday to counter anti-government protests triggered by the death of a woman in police custody, with marchers calling for the execution of protesters.
The demonstrations followed the strongest warning from the authorities yet when the army told Iranians it would confront &quot;the enemies&quot; behind the unrest - a move that could signal the kind of crackdown that has crushed protests in the past.
Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as &quot;Israel&#x27;s soldiers&quot;, live state television coverage showed. They also shouted &quot;Death to America&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel&quot;, common slogans the country&#x27;s clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

                              <span>Hilary Mantel, the first British novelist to win the Booker Prize twice and who sold millions of books around the world, has died aged 70, her publishers announced on Friday.
&quot;We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel, and our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald,&quot; 4th Estate Books said.
&quot;This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work,&quot; it added, providing no other details.
Mantel won the Booker Prize for &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot; (2012) and had been tipped to win again in 2020 with &quot;The Mirror &amp; The Light,&quot; the third in the trilogy.
The Wolf Hall Trilogy has so far been translated into 41 languages with worldwide sales of more than five million.

Fewer than 10 of the shiny black mammals are still alive on Ocean Beach, in remote western Tasmania, state wildlife services said.
About 30 of the animals were released into the ocean on Thursday, but some had beached themselves again, said Brendon Clark, incident controller with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.
Under cool drizzle, marine wildlife experts began to wrap up a complex days-long rescue operation that started with a large pod of the animals, which are part of the dolphin family, stranding on the beach mid-week.
Three pilot whales had yet to be reached because of their remote location on the shore …</span>

Amini, 22, died after her arrest by the Islamic republic&#x27;s feared morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab headscarf in an &quot;improper&quot; way, and news of her death sparked widespread outrage.
The official death toll rose to at least 17 on Thursday, including five security personnel, but the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said its sources put the figure much higher.

		The voting, which the West and Ukraine says is a sham, is due to begin on Friday and will end on Tuesday, with results expected soon afterwards.

                              <span>Pfizer said it agreed to reduce the number of doses it will deliver by year end to 600 million, down from the billion-dose commitment the U.S. government made a year ago.
	

		The United States will have an option to buy up to an additional 400 million shots for the program after this year.
	

		The drugmaker said it would have sufficient supply to deliver the full billion doses under the U.S. commitment, but &quot;we are seeing reduced demand in some low- and lower-middle-income countries due to barriers in administration and vaccine hesitancy.&quot;
	

		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.
	

		Pfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.
	

		The vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world&#x27;s poorer countries.
	

		The program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.
	

		COVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.

Nuclear threat

		The integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.
	

		After the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use &quot;all means&quot; to protect its territory.
	

		Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included &quot;strategic nuclear weapons&quot;. He predicted the voting regions &quot;will integrate into Russia&quot;.
	

		For most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.
	

		The referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.
	

		Election officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.</span>
