                              <span>In Iran, most households rely on natural gas for their heating and hot water. But amid a cold snap and gas shortages, the population has been paralysed by sub-zero temperatures in many regions around the country. These gas shortages have not only led to widespread power cuts, but also severe air pollution from burning low-grade heavy fuel oil, known as mazut, to make up the difference. Despite denials from authorities, the FRANCE 24 Observers team found evidence that this fuel oil is partially responsible for the “unbreathable” air in some Iranian cities.</span>

                              <span>Remarks by President Biden on Continued Support for Ukraine (US Embassy of Ukraine)   
USA Today: As Biden seeks to avoid wider war, delivery of M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine escalates conflict 
WASHINGTON – The White House relented Wednesday after months of pleas from Ukraine for the Pentagon&#x27;s most lethal armored vehicle: the Abrams tank.  President Joe Biden announced the transfer of 31 Abrams to thwart an anticipated Russian spring offensive and galvanize European allies. 
Fighting this winter has been described by a senior U.S. military official as &quot;savage,&quot; likening it to World War I trench warfare. 
Analysts expect Russia to mount what could be a fierce offensive in a campaign to end Ukraine’s string of battlefield successes in recent months and reverse the heavy troop and territorial losses Russia suffered in the first year of fighting. 
Since the war began, the White House and Pentagon have sought to supply Ukraine with the weapons it needs to resist President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s aggression without sparking a wider war in Europe. Yet Biden&#x27;s announcement Wednesday also signals that the war, launched with a militarily unprovoked invasion and soon to enter its second year, shows no sign of ending.

* Kremlin claims Ukraine and West could arm Leopard 2 tanks with &#x27;Silver Bullets&#x27; 
* The uranium-core weapons were used in Iraq but are now largely discontinued 
A Kremlin official has warned that Russia will consider the use of any depleted uranium weapons in their new NATO tanks as nuclear &#x27;dirty bombs&#x27;. 
The West finally agreed to arm Kyiv with dozens of state-of-the art tanks yesterday, modernising the attritional warfare seen on the battlefield in the past 11 months. 
Konstantin Gavrilov, head of Russia&#x27;s delegation on the OSCE forum on security cooperation, claimed that Ukraine could arm their German-supplied Leopard 2 tanks with &#x27;uranium core armour-piercing&#x27; shells.

                              <span>National Defense: ANALYSIS: Shipyard Capacity, China’s Naval Buildup Worries U.S. Military Leaders 
While U.S. military leaders exchange fire over what the next-generation of naval fleets will look like, the shipbuilding industrial base is treading water. 
Since 2016, the Navy has been working toward a 355-ship fleet goal as outlined in its long-term force structure plan. 
But Navy ambitions have been complicated by the Marine Corps’ modernization strategy, prompting back-and-forth between service leadership and lawmakers regarding future fleet size and structure. 
In addition, China’s more aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific — especially considering Taiwan — is elevating the need for greater shipbuilding and maintenance capacity to meet demand, naval power experts said. 
Retired Adm. Phil Davidson, former commander of Indo-Pacific Command, predicted in 2021 that the following six years would see China’s threat to naval forces reach its height.

In regards to China&#x27;s naval build-up. The infrastructure is there to mass produce Chinese warships at a rate that will take a few years for the US to match. 
On a side note. Check out the Chinese naval base below:

News 360: Hungary rules out involvement in Ukraine conflict: «This is not our war». 
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has ruled out that the country could get involved in any way in the conflict in Ukraine because, he says, it is not Hungary&#x27;s war, although he has expressed the importance of the cessation of hostilities in Eastern Europe. 
 &quot;The Hungarian people are not responsible for this war, the Hungarian people can do nothing for the outbreak of war. The Hungarian people did not want this war,&quot; Szijjarto said, according to &#x27;Magyar Nemzet&#x27;. 
&quot;This is not our war, we do not even want to get involved, we have to stay out of this war (...) This is the decision of the Hungarian people&quot;, the foreign minister asserted, alluding at this point to the latest election results.

WNU Editor: None of my friends, readers, and contacts in Hungary want to get involved in this war. And they are not alone. With the exception of maybe a person or two that I know in the UK, there is no desire among the people that I know in Europe to get involved in this war. 

Unfortunately, most European leaders have a different view, and getting involved in this war by escalating it is their priority now. But fortunately for the Hungarian people, who voted decisively for Orban in elections last year because of his views on the war, the Hungarian leadership understand the risks and potential disaster if a policy of involvement is followed, and are choosing to stay out of it.</span>

                              <span>CNN: US and Israel launch largest military exercise ever despite concerns over Netanyahu’s government 
The US and Israel launched their largest joint military exercise ever on Monday, sending a clear signal to Iran and underscoring the strength of their alliance despite concerns over the composition of the new Israeli government which includes ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties. 
The live-fire exercise, named Juniper Oak, will include 100 US aircraft with fighters, bombers and refueling aircraft flying alongside 42 Israeli aircraft. The USS George H. W. Bush carrier strike group will also take part in the exercise, which will cover all the domains of warfare to include space and electronic warfare.
“We can’t really find another (exercise) that even kind of comes close,” said a senior US defense official. Nearly 6,500 US personnel will participate in the exercise, as well as more than 1,100 Israeli personnel, the official said.

Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians, including an elderly woman, and wounded several others during a raid in the restive West Bank city and refugee camp of Jenin on Thursday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. 
The death toll makes Thursday the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year, according to CNN records. 
It brings the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces this year to 29, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. That toll includes militants being targeted in Israeli raids, individuals who attacked Israelis, and bystanders, CNN reporting shows.

Donald Trump reacted with glee after a former FBI official who was involved in the investigation into the alleged ties between the former president&#x27;s 2016 campaign team and Russia was arrested. 
 Charles McGonigal, 54, the former head of counterintelligence for the FBI&#x27;s New York office, is accused of secretly working for a U.S.-sanctioned Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, as well as conspiring to commit money laundering. 
Prosecutors said that McGonigal is alleged to have tried to help Deripaska get off the sanctions list after leaving the FBI in 2018. He is also alleged to have taken money off the Russian billionaire in 2019 in order to investigate a rival oligarch.

   Marine Executive: Video: Two Turkish Cargo Ships Hit by Possible Missile in Ukraine 
Two Turkish-owned cargo ships have reportedly come under attack at the port of Kherson, marking the first time in many months that commercial ships have been damaged during the fighting in Ukraine. 
Turkish TV is airing an undated video showing the bridge and accommodation block of one of the vessels on fire while the second ship was reported to have been hit possibly by shrapnel. 
 Both of the vessels registered in Vanuatu and operated by Turkish shipping companies have been trapped in Kherson for nearly a year since the fighting began in Ukraine. They are part of as many as a dozen Turkish ships that were not covered by the UN agreement and have remained caught in Ukrainian ports including Kherson and Mykolaiv while the crews were mostly evacuated.

WNU Editor: There are a number of ships that have been stuck in the port of Kherson since the start of the war, including these two Turkish cargo ships. And many of them were hit hit by missiles in the first few months of the war. But it looks the fighting is intensifying, and these ships are now in the middle of it.</span>

I first encountered unabashed pride in being American when I came to the United States in 1951.  I sailed across the Atlantic alone.  Perhaps someone along the way told me tht I was going to the United States; however, as a seven or eight-year-old I knew nothing about the nation that had granted me refuge.  Upon disembarking in New York what stood out was not the awe-inspiring and intimidating skyscrapers seemingly reaching to the heavens, or for the first time in my life seeing a city not lying in ruins from the ravages of war, but that there was a palpable atmosphere of confidence, optimism, self-reliance and above all pride among the people in this new and mystifying country.

Billions of dollars worth of U.S. weapons are on the negotiating table between Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and Afghanistan’s Taliban government, according to at least one insider. 
Presidentish Joe Biden’s bungled bugout from Afghanistan resulted in a windfall for the new radical Islamic government, including artillery, attack helicopters, and thousands of HUMVEES, machine guns, radios — all left behind as our orderly withdrawal degenerated into a rout. 
The Department of Defense estimates the total value of the gear Biden left behind at a whopping $7.12 billion, and now Putin is reportedly offering to buy whatever he and the battered Russian Army need.

Moscow Times: Fear and Frustration in Moscow as Air Defense Systems Deployed 
The installation of air defense systems in the center of the Russian capital in recent weeks has been met with fear and anger by locals — as well as some indifference — as concerns appear to grow over Ukraine’s military ability to strike deep within Russian territory. 
“Some people are panicking, some are irritated and some of my neighbors consider this a military escalation,” said a Muscovite living near the Losiny Ostrov (Elk Island) National Park in northeast Moscow near where an air defense battery was reportedly deployed.
“People are angry that there is no official information.” 
At least five anti-aircraft missile systems have been spotted across Moscow in recent weeks, appearing in parks and on top of buildings as the Ukraine war — now in its 11th month — creeps closer to the Russian capital.

WNU Editor: Everyday I am talking to relatives and friends in both Russia and Ukraine. And they are all doing the same thing. An acceptance that this is going to be a long war and that much of Ukraine will be devastated, and to prepare for the worse. 
For my cousins in Moscow, they relocated months ago to their country homes, and only go back to the city once every-week or two to check and make sure everything is alright. Their kids are remaining in the city to run the business, but if they have any warning that Moscow will be under attack, they will act the same way that my cousin in Kyiv reacted on the first night of the war. She got ASAP and never looked back. 
So has the deployment of these air defense systems stirred fear or anger among locals that the above Moscow Times article is claiming? I say no. People&#x27;s focus is elsewhere. For one. Russian TV is covering the war 24/7, and that generates more than enough fear and anger among locals than a Pantsir-S1 air defense system down the street.</span>

Daily Beast: Ukraine Predicts Attacks on Major Russian Cities 
Ukrainian authorities say Russia’s biggest cities are bound to suffer attacks as a result of the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. 
“Internal escalation of the war in Russia is inevitable,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president. 
“Cities that are pampered, lazy, that thought they lived in a different reality, such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg, will be subject to strikes,” he said, stressing that Ukraine itself has no plans to carry out such attacks.

WNU Editor: The Kremlin has responded .... Kremlin spokesman Peskov responds to Podolyak’s prediction of ‘military escalation inside Russia’ (Meduza). 
What is not being discussed is that if Ukraine does launch missiles at a city like Moscow, Russia&#x27;s early warning systems will detect it immediately, and it will be interpreted by Russia&#x27;s military and the Kremlin as a nuclear missile attack on its command and control centers. I need not say what will happen next.</span>

The gas shortage itself has led to widespread power outages in several cities, an increase in air pollution and even more protests, on top of the anti-regime protests that have been wracking Iran since September 2022.</span>

Defense News: US arms export approvals soared in 2022 
WASHINGTON ― Sales of military weapons between the U.S. and foreign governments shot up to nearly $51.9 billion in fiscal 2022, largely because U.S. allies in Europe are rushing to arm themselves in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 11 months ago. 
The total represented a 49% jump from $34.8 billion in sales the previous year, according to new State Department data. Direct commercial sales ― from contractors to governments ― also grew, reaching $153.7 billion, up from $103.4 billion the year before.

The Guardian: Ukraine calls for fighter jets after Germany’s offer of Leopard tanks 
Kyiv seeks to break ‘taboo’ on supply of aircraft as defence ministry announces withdrawal from Soledar 
Germany’s offer of 14 Leopard tanks triggered calls from Ukraine’s government for western fighter jets and more heavy armour as it formally announced its forces’ retreat from the eastern town of Soledar after nine months of bloody battle.
Kyiv lauded Berlin’s decision, along with reports the US was preparing to send its own Abrams tanks, but the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his ministers are also seeking to break a “taboo” on the provision of jets such as US-made F16s.

                              <span>France 24: Ukraine confirms withdrawal of troops from battleground town of Soledar 
Ukraine confirmed on Wednesday its troops had withdrawn from Soledar in eastern Ukraine, almost two weeks after Russian troops said they had captured the small salt-mining town. 
&quot;In order to preserve the lives of service personnel, the Defence Forces withdrew from Soledar,&quot; military spokesman Serhiy Cherevatyi was quoted as saying by state broadcaster Suspilne. 
His remarks were the first Ukrainian confirmation that Russian forces have captured Soledar, which is in the Donetsk region. 
&quot;(Our forces) fulfilled their main task: not allowing the enemy to systematically break through in the Donetsk direction,&quot; Cherevatyi was quoted as saying.

WNU Editor: Russian forces actually seized Soledar 12 days ago (link here). The announcement is being made now by Kyiv after videos begin to emerge over the weekend of half a dozen Russian trucks filled with the coffins of killed Ukrainian soldiers being prepared to be repatriated to the Ukrainian side. 
One of the constant criticisms and anger that I am constantly hearing from my Ukrainian friends and family members is the complete lack of information from the Ukrianian government on missing Ukrainian soldiers. My Ukrainian cousin manages a Facebook page for families of missing Ukrainian soldiers, and she estimates that there are anywhere from 35,000 to 50,000 soldiers that are now listed as missing. 
Sighhh .... thousands killed on both sides and for what.

                              <span>BBC: Doomsday Clock signals highest ever peril level 
The symbolic Doomsday Clock has moved closer than ever to midnight, declaring humanity perilously close to catastrophe. 
The clock, set to 90 seconds to midnight, marks how close our planet is to complete annihilation because of man made actions.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) said the clock moved, in large part, because of the war in Ukraine.  The idea began in 1947 to warn humanity of the dangers of nuclear war. 
The hands of the clock are moved closer to or further away from midnight based on the scientists&#x27; reading of existential threats at a particular time. Midnight marks the theoretical point of annihilation. 
The decision is made by the BAS science and security board, which includes 13 Nobel Laureates. 
This year the announcement was made available in Ukrainian and Russian as well as English, due to the war in Ukraine.

Estonia, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), is considering the possibility of effectively blocking the passage of Russian ships through the Baltic Sea. 
Estonia&#x27;s introduction of a so-called contiguous zone, which can be up to 12 nautical miles from the 12-mile territorial sea, allows the country to conduct searches in the Gulf of Finland on military ships and civilian vessels to monitor compliance with Estonian law.

                              <span>BBC: US and Germany ready to send tanks to Ukraine - reports 
After months of reluctance, the US and Germany reportedly plan to send tanks to Ukraine, in what Kyiv hopes will be a game-changer on the battlefield.  US President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration is expected to announce plans to send at least 30 M1 Abrams tanks. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also reportedly decided to send at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks. 
Russia&#x27;s ambassador to the US blasted the news as &quot;another blatant provocation&quot;. 
Ukrainian officials have said such shipments could help its forces seize back territory from the Russians. 
Until now, the US and Germany have resisted internal and external pressure to send their tanks to Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The last time German tanks were used in this part of the world it ended very badly for Europe as a whole. My cousin in Moscow called these reports of the US and Germany planning to send tanks to Ukraine &quot;Operation Barbarasso 2&quot;. 
Sighhh .... Russians are about to see German tanks gunning for them over the horizon. Westerners have no idea on what passions this will raise in Russia. 
This is really bad. Everyone I know in Russia is now convinced that NATO is about to engage in a hot war with Russia. 
I have also been told that Moscow bluntly told Germany that this crosses a red-line. That once German Leopard tanks are engaged against Russian forces, President Putin will announce a General Mobilization. He will state that this deployment has broken treaties with Russia on the use and deployment of German military assets, and Russia must respond.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Finland Floats Solo NATO Entry After Erdogan Rejects Sweden 
 (Bloomberg) -- Finland for the first time opened the door to potentially decoupling its NATO application from that of Sweden, after its neighbor encountered fresh resistance from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
The path floated by Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, if it becomes more serious, would mark a significant shift in Finnish policy since the Nordic nations jointly applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May. 
Faced with continued objections from Turkey — mostly to what it sees as inadequate crackdown on Kurds in Sweden — the two Nordic countries had up to now insisted their applications be considered together.  It’s still unclear how much Finland will shift its approach. 
The stance remains for the two countries to enter NATO simultaneously, given security considerations, Haavisto told reporters in Helsinki on Tuesday, softening comments from earlier in the day, when he’d said Finland may need to prepare going it alone.

The Hill: Study: Defense industry unprepared for war with China 
The U.S. defense industry is “not adequately prepared” for “a protracted conventional war” with an enemy such as China, according to a think tank study published Monday. 
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ran a war games simulation that found that the U.S. would likely be depleted of some of its munitions, including long-range, precision-guided ones, in less than a week of war with China in the Taiwan Strait.

                              <span>CNBC: NYSE says trading issue that led to dozens of stocks being halted has been resolved 
* The major stocks impacted included Morgan Stanley, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Nike and McDonald’s, according to the NYSE’s website. 
* Many stocks were shown to have abnormally large moves when the market opened, which may have triggered volatility halts. 
* The NYSE said at roughly 9:50 a.m. that all of its systems were operational. 
Trading in dozens of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted shortly after the market opened Tuesday due to an apparent technical issue. 
The major stocks impacted included Morgan Stanley, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Nike and McDonald’s, according to the NYSE’s website. Many stocks were shown to have abnormally large moves when the market opened, which may have triggered volatility halts. 
CNBC’s Bob Pisani said on “Squawk on the Street” that the issue appears to be a technical one and not something that happened on the trading floor.  Many of the companies impacted resumed trading before 9:45 a.m. ET. 
The NYSE said at roughly 9:50 a.m. that all of its systems were operational. CNBC has reached out to the NYSE for more details about the issue.

Key Point #1: Preparation for any urban disaster helps to prepare an urban area for catastrophes regardless of cause or type.

Key Point #3: Rehearsing/exercising plans—even in so simple a form as talking through challenges—is essential.
Key Point #4: Plans must be executable. 
Key Point #5: No plan will survive contact with the disaster.…</span>

What followed were repeated efforts to capitalize on her anti-LGBTQ fame, including a short stint as a spokesperson for NOM, the National Organization For Marriage, an anti-LGBTQ organization that aggressively attempted to prevent same-sex couples from gaining the legal right to marriage.

                              <span>The streets of France filled with outraged workers on Thursday as rail employees, teachers, and others walked off the job to protest President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s deeply unpopular plan to overhaul the nation&#x27;s pension system by raising the official retirement age from 62 to 64.
The union-led demonstrations—which ground significant portions of the country, including many schools and transportation systems, to a halt—come as Macron is attempting to steamroll far-reaching opposition to his pension overhaul, declaring that &quot;we must work longer.&quot;
Macron&#x27;s government formally presented its draft law last week, the first step in the process of enacting a reform that would force French citizens to work longer to qualify for a full pension.

                              <span>A man from the Caribbean island of Dominica says he survived 24 days lost at sea in a sailboat by eating ketchup before being rescued in Colombian waters, the country&#x27;s naval authority said.
&quot;I had no food. There was only a bottle of ketchup that was on the boat, garlic powder and (bouillon cubes) Maggi. So I mixed it up with some water for me to survive 24 days in the sea,&quot; Elvis Francois, 47, said in English in a video released by the Colombian Navy.
The islander had the word &quot;help&quot; carved on the hull of the boat when he was found 120 nautical miles northwest of Puerto Bolivar in the northern department of La Guajira.
Francois said he saw other boats pass by and tried to flag them down, even lighting a fire on his vessel, but they did not see him.

The Dutch National Archive unveiled the hand-drawn map in early January, featuring a tell-tale red &#x27;X&#x27; believed to mark the spot where German soldiers stashed their hoard.
Documents held along with the map include testimony that the Nazis buried four ammunition boxes filled with jewellery, precious stones and gold coins, believed to be worth 11 million euros ($11.9 million) at current value.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thursday&#x27;s shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world&#x27;s youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the punishing demands faced by women in power.
Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old politician said she had next to nothing left &quot;in the tank&quot; and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office.
&quot;Politicians are human,&quot; she said. &quot;We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it&#x27;s time. And for me, it&#x27;s time.&quot;
But the remarks that followed were more revealing, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand&#x27;s University of Canterbury.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday made a shock announcement she had &quot;no more in the tank&quot; to continue leading the country and would step down no later than early February and not seek re-election.
Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside.
&quot;This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term - because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that,&quot; Ardern, 42, told a news conference.
&quot;I know there will be much discussion in the aftermath of this decision as to what the so called &#x27;real&#x27; reason was... The only interesting angle you will find is that after going on si…</span>

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Messina Denaro, a brutal Sicilian Mafia boss who was Italy&#x27;s most wanted criminal before his capture on Monday, had been on the run for 30 years. Here are some key facts about his arrest and what it means:
WHY IS THE ARREST SO IMPORTANT?
Messina Denaro, 60, was the last runaway member of a generation of mobsters who masterminded a string of bombings and murders that terrorised Italy in the early 1990s.
His arrest finally brings closure to that dark era, shatters a symbol of resistance to the Italian state and could reveal Mafia secrets in the unlikely event that Messina Denaro agrees to talk to investigators.
He was involved in dozens of killings, including of top prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the adolescent son of a Mafia…</span>

Washington (AFP) - The owner of China-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato was arrested in Miami on Wednesday, along with five associates in Europe, during an international operation against &quot;darknet&quot; markets.
Anatoly Legkodymov, 40, a Russian living in Shenzhen, China, appeared in handcuffs and leg shackles in a Miami courtroom on money laundering charges, and was denied bail by a judge who deemed him a flight risk.
He was detained for his role in allegedly transmitting a total of $700 million in illicit funds, the US Department of Justice charged, with officials saying that criminals used the exchange as a haven for narcotics…</span>

Washington (AFP) - The United States is not currently prepared to provide advanced Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said Wednesday, citing difficulties in maintenance and training.
Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for modern Western tanks to help battle Russia&#x27;s invasion, and Germany has reportedly linked its decision on whether to do so to Washington&#x27;s willingness to provide Abrams.
&quot;I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet,&quot; US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told journalists when asked about providing Abrams to Ukraine, though he did not completely close the door on a shift in the future.

&quot;I am very happy to pay more taxes, I want my government to tax me and tax people like me,&quot; White said.

                              <span>Brazil&#x27;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.
Just days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.
He ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was &quot;convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors.&quot;
In a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil&#x27;s presidents live.
Leftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.
As he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.

The president said last week that any &quot;radical bolsonarista&quot; found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.
&quot;How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?&quot; asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.
Bolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula&#x27;s inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.
He has denied any link to the riots.
In a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed &quot;regret&quot; over the events, which he described as &quot;unbelievable&quot;.

&quot;Under the proposals, same-sex couples would still not be able to get married in a Church of England church,&quot; the church said in a statement.
They can instead &quot;come to church to give thanks for their civil marriage or civil partnership and receive God&#x27;s blessing,&quot; it added.
Bishops met on Tuesday to finalize recommendations, which will affirm the church&#x27;s teaching that Holy Matrimony exists between one man and one woman for life.
The issue will not be put to a vote at the General Synod, the church&#x27;s legislative body, when it meets in London early next month.

                              <span>Notorious drug lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman has appealed to Mexico&#x27;s president for help due to alleged &quot;psychological torment&quot; he is suffering in a US prison, his lawyer said Tuesday.
&quot;In the six years that Joaquin has been in the United States, he has not seen the sun,&quot; said Jose Refugio Rodriguez, a Mexico-based legal representative of the Sinaloa cartel founder.
The message, described as &quot;an SOS,&quot; was transmitted via one of Guzman&#x27;s lawyers in the United States as well as his family, Rodriguez said.
Guzman is only allowed outside three times a week to a small area where he &quot;doesn&#x27;t get the sun,&quot; and has fewer visits or phone calls than other inmates, the lawyer said in an interview with Radio Formula.
&quot;He is suffering psychological torment,&quot; he said, adding that the lack of sunshine was also bad for the convicted drug trafficker&#x27;s physical health.
Guzman wants President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address alleged procedural violations during his extradition in 2017 under the former government, Rodriguez added.
The Mexican embassy in Washington confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that it received an email from Rodríguez on January 10. 
Without referring to the content of the email, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard downplayed the chance of any government intercession in favor of the notorious drug trafficker. 
&quot;He is serving a sentence there, he has a sentence,&quot; he told journalists. &quot;So, frankly I don&#x27;t see any possibilities for him, but I&#x27;m going to review it with the prosecutor&#x27;s office.&quot; 
El Chapo is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in 2019 of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.
One of his sons, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested by Mexican security forces this month in an operation that left 29 people dead and sparked a dramatic shootout at an airport in the city of Culiacan.

Brovary (Ukraine) (AFP) - Eighteen people, including Ukraine´s interior minister and three children, were killed in a helicopter crash near a kindergarten outside Kyiv on Wednesday.
The helicopter slammed down next to the kindergarten and a residential building in Brovary, a commuter town for the capital Kyiv that was the scene of fierce fighting early in Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
Amateur footage circulating on social media showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the aircraft mixed with debris from nearby buildings and a car crushed by large shards of metal. Cries could be heard at the scene which was consumed by a fire.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When dozens of defense ministers meet at an airbase in Germany on Friday, all eyes will be set on what Berlin is - and is not - willing to provide Ukraine.
Defense leaders from roughly 50 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will confer at Ramstein Air Base, the latest in a series of meetings since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago.
The focus is expected to be not on what the United States will provide, but on whether Germany will send its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve their transfer from third countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Katherine Swidan, whose son Mark has been imprisoned in China for over 10 years, has not seen even a photograph of him over the last decade. The last time she heard his voice was in 2018.
She and the families of other Americans, who according to the U.S. government are wrongfully held in China, are hoping that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken can push the Chinese authorities for the release of their loved ones as he visits Beijing next month.
&quot;My message for Blinken is: say their names,&quot; said Katherine Swidan in a phone interview from her home in Luling, Texas. &quot;They&#x27;re American citizens. They&#x27;ve been wrongfully detained. Enough is enough.&quot;

                              <span>Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was hauled away and detained on Tuesday during a protest near a German village being razed to make way for a coal mine expansion, police said.
Thunberg has been in Germany for several days to support protests against the demolition of Luetzerath, which have become a symbol of resistance against fossil fuels.
Images showed the activist, dressed in black, being picked up by police officers wearing helmets and then escorted to a waiting bus.
A police spokeswoman said a group of activists were in custody after having &quot;broken away from the demonstration&quot;, and run towards the edge of an open pit.
Officials were working to identify the protesters in custody, and a decision would be made later about what further action to take, she said.

                              <span>France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.
The suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.
The industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France&#x27;s unions are united.
&quot;It&#x27;ll be a hellish Thursday,&quot; Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.
Paris public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.
Services would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.
Elsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.
Most slow trains between cities would be halted.
Up to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.
Opinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.
The 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s population may have shot up beyond eight billion for the first time recently, but some countries including the most populous, China, are seeing their populations shrink.
And the decline is set to continue as factors including rising living costs, more women entering the workforce and having children later mean people in some countries are having fewer babies.
China&#x27;s population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, official data showed Tuesday, and it is expected to be overtaken by India this year as the most populous nation.
Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to UN figures published last July which forecast how the world&#x27;s population will develop between now and 2100.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.
Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum &quot;for having had &#x27;le palle&#x27; (the balls) to invite me tonight&quot;, according to Deadline and Variety reports.
The museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as &quot;unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation&quot;.
Its &quot;Stella della Mole&quot; award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film &quot;American Beauty&quot; and drama series &quot;House of Cards&quot; -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.
Spacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
His stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.
The actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.
Last summer he appeared at London&#x27;s Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.
Now on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, &quot;deepfake&quot; video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.
Cave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.
The chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.
The Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave&#x27;s website, asked the tool to produce a song &quot;in the style of Nick Cave&quot;.
One of the AI-created verses runs: &quot;I&#x27;m the king of the abyss, I&#x27;m the ruler of the dark / I&#x27;m the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark.&quot;
&quot;This song sucks,&quot; wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT&#x27;s work &quot;replication as travesty&quot;.
He followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn&#x27;t, describing the process of writing as &quot;an act of self-murder&quot;.
&quot;Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don&#x27;t feel,&quot; he wrote.
He added: &quot;Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit.&quot;
Cave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- &quot;I&#x27;ve got the fire of hell in my eyes.&quot;
&quot;I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it&#x27;s ChatGPT,&quot; he concluded.
