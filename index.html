Then the teleprompters came on, the cameras started rolling and the producer shouted “Action!”
Thus began the recording of “My Golden Kids”, one of the most popular reality shows in South Korea.  Reigning over the episode was Dr. Oh Eun-young, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatry who has been dubbed the “god of parenthood.”
His mantra: “There are no problem children, only parenting problems.”
In a country where celebrity is often personified by young megastars from a demanding entertainment industry, Dr Oh, 57, occupies a unique cultural place.  She attracts mi…</span>

The day before they left, two of the deceased, Robbie Phillips, 65, a travel consultant who was actually one of Sandals’ top salespeople, and her husband, Michael, 68, checked themselves into a medical facility complaining of nausea and vomiting, according to local authorities.  Donnis Chiarella, 65, who was staying on the other side of the wall, also visited a clinic, his son told ABC News.  All returned to their adjacent beachfront villas, where the Phillips and Ms Chiarella’s husband Vincent, 64, were found unresponsive the next morning according to local authorities.  Later that day, all three were pronounced dead.  Ms. Chiarella, who had to be hospitalized, was the only survivor.

There was James, sneaking onto the pitch repeatedly to check the scoreboard and the clock above him.  Or chew an apple and dig into a gallon-sized bag of nuts.  Or pleading, “Come on, ref,” when a call wasn’t to his liking.
He stood up to whisper instructions to his son, who nodded sharply as he passed the ball inbounds along the baseline.  James entered the pitch at half-time – first to give advice to the coach of the travel ball team he sponsors, Strive for Greatness, then to fire off some left-handed shots, prompting many in the crowded stands to pull out their cellphones.  to save the exercise.

The NFL?
Congress?
The fanbase of the dreary team he’s owned since 1999, now known as the Washington Commanders, which has long been the league’s Animal House?
By Thursday, Snyder had done everything he could to arm the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which has been investigating his team for nearly a year.  Instead of appearing before the committee, he dragged, challenged and asked his legal team to withdraw all delaying orders.  He declined to attend the June hearing where the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sat down and faced the committee grills.
Then, dodging the subpoena, he sailed off into the sunset, out of the country, away from the prying eyes of Congress.

They made their statements and promoted their cause, but refused to take the fight to the gates of Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.
“We’re glad people are refocusing their attention on this issue,” said Jay Winuk, one of the protest organizers.  “There is no reason to go to the scene where another atrocity is taking place.”
The group, a group of family members of victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has spoken out vehemently against the Saudi-backed LIV golf tournament being held this weekend at the club owned by a former President, Donald J. Trump.

Moscow Times/AFP: Kremlin Expresses Solidarity With China Over Taiwan 
The Kremlin expressed &quot;solidarity&quot; on Friday with China&#x27;s stance on Taiwan after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned U.S. leader Joe Biden not to &quot;play with fire&quot; over the self-ruled island. 
&quot;Certainly we are in solidarity,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
&quot;We respect China&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and believe that no country in the world should have the right to question this or take any inflammatory or other steps,&quot; he added. 
&quot;We are convinced that such behavior on the international arena can only cause additional tension.&quot;

Protesters demand the departure of peacekeepers, accusing them of failing to protect civilians from a recent wave of attacks by the militant groups that have terrorized the region for years, leaving hundreds dead or injured and forcing more than 160,000 people to flee their homes this year alone. 
Several government officials and a youth group allied to the ruling party have in recent weeks stoked anger against UN forces.

But as Francis continued his travels across the country – from Alberta, where he apologized, to Quebec and Nunavut in the Arctic – his stops also told the story of the unusually stable position of the church in Canada.

The High Court on Friday ended the long-running legal wrangle by ruling against plaintiff Rebekah Vardy, saying she had not been defamed by her former friend Coleen Rooney.
In the verdict, Judge Karen Steyn ruled that the reputational damage suffered by Ms Vardy lacked what she described as “the sting of defamation”.  For that reason, she said in a written decision released Friday, “the matter is closed.”


The judge also reprimanded Ms Vardy, who sued Ms Rooney in June 2020, writing that she had regularly leaked information about her former friend to the press, adding that “significant parts of her evidenc…</span>

                              <span>Since “Lemonade” (2016), her last solo studio album and accompanying film, Beyoncé has overwhelmed fans with a number of ambitious in-between projects.
In 2018, she performed as one of the headliners of the Coachella festival, where her show honored the tradition of historically black college and university marching bands, and was widely hailed as a triumph — one that “redirected its music, discarding its ties to pop and framing it squarely in a line of Southern black musical traditions,” as New York Times critic Jon Caramanica wrote.  The performance was later made into a Netflix special and an album, both titled “Homecoming.”
Also in 2018, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, her husband, released a joint album, “All is love” credited to the Carters.  And in June 2020, at the height of nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, she released a song, “Black Parade”, with lines like “Put your fist up, show black love.”
“Black Parade” won the Grammy Award the following year for Best R&amp;B Performance, one of four prizes that night it took Beyoncé’s career to 28 – more than any other woman.  This year, Beyoncé was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song for “Be Alive,” from the movie “King Richard,” a biopic about Venus and Serena Williams’ father.
How the early leak will affect the commercial prospects of “Renaissance” remains unclear.  Years ago, the unauthorized release of music in advance could have devastating consequences for an album.  But that danger has been mitigated by the move to streaming.
And Beyoncé, like most other artists today, has taken advance orders for physical copies of her album, which will count on the charts as soon as they ship — usually the week of release.  On Beyoncé’s site, all four boxes of “Renaissance” and its limited-edition vinyl version are sold out.

“What do you think of when you think of swimming?”  I recently posed this question to a class of high school students, and although their answers varied widely – “fun”, “a little scary”, “family”, “summer” – one answer led the pack: “ freedom”.  I love that our human relationship with water sparks conversations about so much more.
Two new picture books and a graphic novel discuss swimming as an expansive, slippery, and hopeful state of being.  They inspire young readers of different ages to interact with the world in unconventional ways.

                              <span>On a sleepy summer morning recently, a group of about 50 dancers from the New York City Ballet gathered in a sunny rehearsal studio at Lincoln Center and stretched.  They had just come from three weeks off and were back in company class, preparing for a tour of upstate New York.  Some carried energy drinks and bottles of hand sanitizer;  others brought their dogs, who sat under the barre as the dancers began a series of exercises – bends, stretches, jumps and pirouettes.
Tall and majestic, Chun Wai Chan stood near the center of the studio.  In May, he became the first Chinese-born principal dancer in City Ballet’s 74-year history, only the fourth Asian to hold the rank.  In the studio that morning, some dancers were still loosening up their routines.  But he was brimming with energy, vowin…</span>

In their comfortable contemporary sanctuary of a home, they seem so absolutely normal.  These people love each other.  The boy, Orestes, has never been a good sleeper, but when his bad dreams come his parents are there to comfort him.  And Iphigenia, her sister, is a sweetheart in a lemon-orange dress.

The woman is Faye and, like Lito (Wes Studi), the childhood friend she hopes will answer her invitation, she is a long widowed.  Maybe he too is ready for company.
Slow, sweet and understated, “A Love Song,” Max Walker-Silverman’s charming feature debut, is about end-of-life wants and needs that never quite go away.  Building solid characters from mere snippets of information (Faye was once a bush pilot, Lito a musician), the two leads embrace a script (by the director) filled with long silences and elaborate close-ups.

The accident happened during a Thursday night performance of Mirror, a 12-member group in China whose popularity increased during the coronavirus pandemic. 
In footage from the concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum, audience members scream after the video screen lands directly on a dancer, apparently hitting him in the neck.  The South China Morning Post Newspaper later reported that one of the two dancers suffered neck injuries and was in intensive care.  He said the other was in stable condition.

We talked about it at the beginning.  On the one hand, it doesn’t look like them anymore;  it seems less innocent.  But also, there’s something about them saying stupid things like “butt wagon.”  They are really silly and remind me of middle school.  It’s not like everyone says “Oh, I can’t wait for Beavis and Butt-Head to say [expletive].”
There was a focus group they did in the 90s. The moderator says, “What would you like to see in ‘Beavis and Butt-Head’?”  This guy is just mad, he says, “I’d like to see them get on the first plane to Mexico, go to a striptease, get drunk — you know, something creative.”  And I’m here thinking that there’s nothing funny about it, actually.

Washington said it was seeking a conversation between State Secretary Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov  
Moscow has acknowledged receiving a call request from Washington on Thursday. A conversation between the two nation’s top diplomats might take place as soon as the busy schedule of Russia’s top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, makes it possible, the Foreign Ministry said. 
Lavrov will “pay attention to this request when time permits,” the ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told journalists, referring to Washington’s request for a phone conversation between Lavrov and US State Secretary Antony Blinken.

Ukraine is more likely to be reduced to Kiev and its surroundings than to ever re-encompass Crimea and the Donbass republics, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on his Telegram channel on Wednesday. 
The one-time president and long-time prime minister who now heads the national security council also posted two maps helpfully illustrating his argument.

Afghanistan is again facing risks of mass starvation in coming months as critical relief operations suffer substantial funding shortfalls. 
The World Food Program (WFP) says it faces a net funding shortage of $960 million to sustain humanitarian operations over the next six months. 
&quot;Funding shortfalls and skyrocketing prices mean WFP has been forced to take hard decisions earlier this year to cut down activities to the bare minimum from June to August, temporarily focusing assistance on 10 million people who face the most urgent and life-threatening needs,&quot; Philippe Kropf, the WFP&#x27;s head of communication in Afghanistan, told VOA.

Hundreds of Iraqi protesters breached Baghdad&#x27;s Green Zone parliament on Wednesday chanting anti-Iran curses in a demonstration against a nominee for prime minister by Tehran-backed parties. 
Most of the protesters were said to be followers of influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. 
The demonstrators were seen singing and waving Iraqi flags, while some walked on tables on the parliament floor, leafed through folders, and sat in lawmakers&#x27; chairs. 
The incident raised the stakes in the political struggle for Iraq nearly 10 months after federal elections.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Thursday there was no deal yet with the United States on swapping detained U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner and a former Marine for an imprisoned Russian called by American prosecutors one of the world&#x27;s most prolific arms dealers. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday the United States has made a &quot;substantial offer&quot; to Russia to release American citizens held in Russia. A source said that Washington was willing to exchange convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout, known as the &quot;Merchant of Death.&quot; 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed surprise at the public remarks from Blinken. 
Russia has cautioned the United States that such discussions are best conducted in private.  &quot;So far, there are no agreements in this area,&quot; Peskov told reporters in Moscow. &quot;When discussing such topics, you don&#x27;t conduct information attacks.&quot;

RT:  EU heading for ‘war economy’ – Orban 
The Hungarian leader said his citizens want Brussels to stay out of the country’s energy policy 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has lambasted an EU plan to reduce gas consumption by 15%. Unless the bloc pushes for peace in Ukraine, he warned that Europe will face an energy crisis, a recession, and political turmoil. 
Speaking following a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer in Vienna on Thursday, Orban said that Hungary determines its own energy policy, and any attempt by Brussels to interfere with this “will not find favor with the Hungarians.”

                              <span>ABC News Australia: Kim Jong Un threatens to mobilise nuclear weapons, takes aim at new South Korea president 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says his country is ready to mobilise its nuclear war deterrent and counter any US military clash. 
He made the remarks during a speech at an event to mark the 69th anniversary of the July 27 Korean War armistice, which left the two Koreas technically still at war. 
That confrontation with the United States had posed nuclear threats since the 1950-53 war and required the North to achieve an &quot;urgent historical task&quot; of beefing up its self defence, Mr Kim said, according to the official KCNA news agency.

   Business Insider: More than 75,000 Russian troops in Ukraine have been killed or injured, US says — one of the highest estimates so far 
* US officials think more than 75,000 Russians were killed or injured in Ukraine, reports said. 
* Estimates for Russian troop losses have varied, but this is one of the highest given so far. 
* Russia has not released its troop loss figures in months, and is accused of covering up its dead. 
US officials said that more than 75,000 Russians have been killed or injured as part of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, according to multiple reports. 
The figure would represent around half the total number of troops Russia sent to Ukraine at the start of its invasion. It is significantly higher than estimates US officials have given in public. 
CNN reporter Michael Cohen tweeted on Wednesday that Rep. Elissa Slotkin told CNN she and other House lawmakers had been given the 75,000 figure that day by US officials.

Global Times: China’s defense ministry issues fresh, rare warning ‘action the most powerful language’ over Pelosi’s Taiwan visit; reinforces resolve 
Action is the most powerful language, said the Chinese Defense Ministry on Thursday as its spokesperson stressed the sensitivity of the Taiwan question again after China issued  six warnings against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s potential visit to Taiwan island over the past few days. 
The frequency of Chinese warnings and the remarks different departments use fully demonstrate China&#x27;s determination to take any necessary military measures to counter US provocations and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, analysts said.

    Radio Free Asia: China holds new naval drills as US carrier transits South China Sea  
China often holds military exercises at short notice in response to U.S. naval activities in disputed seas. 
China has staged another military exercise off the back of a five-day large-scale drill near the Paracel islands–just as the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan docked in Singapore after spending over a week in the South China Sea. 
The U.S. carrier and its strike group were slated to visit Vietnam this month but the visit has been called off, said two Vietnamese sources with knowledge of the matter who wish to stay anonymous because they’re not authorised to speak to the media.

WNU Editor: Now is not the time to send a US carrier group to Taiwan. Tensions are already incredibly high, and from the Chinese perspective they feel they have no choice but to respond. I can only hope that the Chinese response will not be a reckless one that can quickly escalate into a disaster.</span>

                              <span>BBC: Haiti gang violence: Gun battles rage in Port-au-Prince 
A war between Haitian gangs which has left hundreds dead since it flared up three weeks ago has spread to the centre of the capital, Port-au-Prince. 
Gang members engaged in a fierce gun battle with each other and with police on Wednesday. 
The city&#x27;s temporary cathedral caught fire amid the fighting. 
It is not yet known how many people were killed in this latest battle but UN figures suggest more than 200 died between 8 and 17 July. 
Previously, the focal points of the battle between the G9 criminal alliance and a rival alliance calling itself G-Pèp had centred around the impoverished neighbourhood of Cité Soleil. But on Wednesday, video showed police confronting gang members not far from the presidential palace.

PKSOI: Semi Annual Lesson Reports: Defense Support to Stabilization (DSS)
The US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI) has released a two-volume collection on lessons learned for Defense Support to Stabilization or activities related to logistical support, supplies, and servicfes for federal agencies involved in stabilization activities. The Global Fragility Act of 2019 outlined a US strategy to prevent conflict and promote stability in countries identified by the Department of State in partnership with other federal agencies. Among those agencies is the Department of Defense (DOD) with its relatively new interagency support authority, the Defense Support to Stabilization, or DSS. This new authority allows DOD to provide logistical support, supplies and services to other federal agencies so that critical civilian expertise can be in place quickly and efficiently for a unity of effort that the interagency may have lacked in the past.

When Glenn Greenwald announced that he would host the premiere of a documentary on Alex Jones — and interviewing the infamous conspiracy theorist — many who once respected the famed investigative journalist lamented this new low in his career.
Greenwald retaliated in a series of tweets confusing the ‘damn stupid’ notion that journalists should refrain from interviewing bad people, pointing out that mainstream media journalists have no qualms about interviewing George W. Bush and his ilk.

The United States reported 4,639 known cases of monkeypox on Wednesday, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data – surpass The 3,738 Spanish cases for the highest tally in the world.  Globally, more than 20,600 cases have been confirmed in 77 countries.  Of that, more than 20,300 have been confirmed in countries that have never reported monkeypox infections.

In response to the increase in numbers, our government has issued a familiar appeal to the public.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal is analysing the citizenship applications of two Russian oligarchs - one of whom is under U.S. sanctions, the government said late on Friday, as a law granting passports to descendants of Sephardic Jews faces growing scrutiny.
Russian-Israeli diamond oligarch Lev Leviev and Russian property developer God Nisanov are the latest high-profile Russians known to have applied for citizenship under the legislation.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that Nisanov, who was hit by sanctions following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, was &quot;one of the richest men in Europe and a close associate of several Russian officials&quot;.

The Ukrainian military said its air defences had shot down two cruise missiles but two more hit the port, threatening the landmark agreement hammered out over months of negotiations aimed at relieving a global food crisis.
The Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said the strike was &quot;a spit in the face&quot; by Russian leader Vladimir Putin against the deal brokered by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and United Nations chief Antonio Guterres.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombian President-elect Gustavo Petro on Friday met with representatives of U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration in Bogota, the Colombian capital, where they discussed topics including drug trafficking, the environment and economic development.
Petro, a 62-year-old economist who will become Colombia&#x27;s first leftist leader next month, has been roundly critical of the U.S.-led war on drugs and was elected on promises to tackle deep inequality and climate change and to seek peace with remaining leftist rebels.
&quot;This is a positive meeting because it shows the interest that exists in the government of the United States in Latin America and in Colombia,&quot; Petro told journalists, as he was accompanied by U.S. principal deputy nationa…</span>

		The fresh aid will bring to 20 the number of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) sent to Ukraine.
	

		Kyiv has called the Himars, which can precisely strike targets within 80 kilometers (50 miles), a game-changer in countering Russia.
	

		The Pentagon, giving further details on the package, said Ukraine would receive up to 580 Phoenix Ghosts -- small and highly portable drones that detonate on their targets.…</span>

                              <span>The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General&#x27;s office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
&quot;Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense,&quot; said the statement.
&quot;Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime.&quot;
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira&#x27;s heart -- as a motive for the killing.

&quot;What a wonder!&quot; Lustosa marvels at the honey-filled wax craters in the hive as the bees attack him furiously, but impotently -- his childlike amazement not diminished by six years working with the insects.
Long overlooked, Brazil&#x27;s native bees are making a comeback, with people such as Lustosa, a 66-year-old public servant, getting in on the movement to boost their profile.

One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury&#x27;s website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

Worst hit is expected to be Milan in the north with temperatures hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), while Bologna to its south and the capital Rome could hit 39 degrees, according to official government estimates.
Other major cities under a cautionary heatwave red alert for Friday and Saturday by Italy&#x27;s health ministry include Florence, Genoa, Turin and Verona.
On Thursday, the city of Pavia, just south of Milan, broke a record with thermometers hitting 39.6 degrees.
For three consecutive months -- May, June and July -- national temperatures have been at least two to three degrees above the seas…</span>

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s nuclear regulator on Friday formally approved a plan to release more than a million tonnes of treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean.
The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country&#x27;s Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO&#x27;s plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the &quot;reliability and transparency of its handling&quot;.
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

                              <span>At a sprawling landfill near Madrid, hundreds of white storks dodge garbage trucks as they look for scraps of food among the mountains of multicoloured garbage bags.
The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
&quot;For us they are part of the landscape,&quot; said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones &quot;where there is fresh garbage,&quot; he added.

                              <span>Thousands participated this week in a lavish ceremony in the Marshall Islands marking the first formal coronation of a paramount chief in around 50 years.
The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned &quot;Iroojlaplap&quot;, or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a &quot;Kailoojoj&quot; in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.

                              <span>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.
Biden on Thursday insisted he was &quot;doing great&quot;, and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
&quot;I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery,&quot; Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the &quot;next ten days&quot;, weeks after both countries&#x27; top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: &quot;Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese.&quot;</span>

Here is what we know about the deal:
Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.
Its location in Istanbul is both a nod to Turkey&#x27;s central location and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s key role in resolving a dispute which has often seemed to…</span>

                              <span>The slaughter of 29 dogs by men armed with rifles in Qatar has sparked outrage in the Gulf state as it gears up to host the World Cup later this year.
Authorities say police are investigating the killings, the worst of a series of brutal cases of cruelty to dogs.
But they face criticism from animal welfare activists who say laws defending domestic animals like dogs are not being enforced.
The latest killings took place at an industrial compound near the capital Doha on July 10, but the slaughter was only reported days later, activists told AFP.
Four men, two armed with hunting rifles, threatened guards at the factory and then killed 29 dogs and puppies, activists said. At least three others were wounded, including two in the late stages of pregnancy.

                              <span>A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor&#x27;s office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of &quot;I take care of Mexico,&quot; an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the &quot;seriousness of the injuries&quot; in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
&quot;We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women&#x27;s human rights and fight against gender-based violence,&quot; UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor&#x27;s behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son&#x27;s health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
&quot;You&#x27;re going to die,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m going to burn you alive,&quot; the messages read.
&quot;How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family,&quot; she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.</span>

                              <span>The International Union for Conservation of Nature on Thursday formally listed the beloved migratory monarch butterfly as endangered, citing dire threats to the subspecies posed by the climate crisis, deforestation, pesticide use, and logging.
Dr. Bruno Oberle, the director-general of IUCN—the world&#x27;s leading scientific authority on species conservation—said the new listing &quot;highlights the fragility of nature&#x27;s wonders, such as the unique spectacle of monarch butterflies migrating across thousands of kilometers,&quot; a reference to the insects&#x27; remarkable biannual journey across North America.
&quot;To preserve the rich diversity of nature, we need effective, fairly governed protected and conserved areas, alongside decisive action to tackle climate change and restore ecosystems,&quot; Oberle added. &quot;In …</span>
