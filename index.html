                              <span>US President Joe Biden is being mocked online after seemingly attempting to shake hands with nobody during his two-day trip to Israel.

President Biden received the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor at a ceremony in Jerusalem with Israel&#x27;s President Isaac Herzog on Thursday.

Unfortunately, at the end of the ceremony, it seemed President Biden was momentarily disorientated.

The incident was widely mocked by conservatives online, who claimed the incident demonstrated President Biden’s cognitive decline.</span>

                              <span>Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham says China’s “inaction” to condemn Russia&#x27;s aggression has provided a certain “tacit acknowledgement pathway” for Moscow. 

“It would have been far preferable for China to strongly condemn and join the rest of the world in strongly condemning Russia’s actions,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“The fact that China also does appear to have filled a void, created by some of the economic sanctions that much of the rest of the world have imposed upon Russia, by picking up demand for Russian wheat and the like has not only been a failure to participate in those sanctions but has been an undermining of elements of those sanctions.”</span>

He has also accused China of spurring on Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.</span>

                              <span>Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood says China’s economy in the June quarter is expected to have fallen by two per cent amid recent lockdowns in the country.  

“The central government there is hoping and expecting that the economy will grow by four per cent for the year,” Mr Greenwood said. 

“But the real problem is now that China is struggling, the United States is struggling. 

“That leads really, if you like, to some of this conversation about having to really at some point down the track cut interest rates to support these economies that really right now look as though they’re teetering on the edge of recession.”</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden has signed a joint declaration with Israel’s Yair Lapid to never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.

The pledge comes during Mr Biden’s first visit to the Middle East as president.

“The United States and Israel reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our two countries,” the statement said.

“The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel’s capability to deter its enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination of threats.

“The United States stresses that integral to this pledge is the commitment never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that it is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome.”

The statement went on to reaffirm the US’ commitment to work with other partners to “confront” Iran’s aggression and “destabilising activates”.

“The United States and Israel affirm that they will continue to work together to combat all efforts to boycott or de-legitimise Israel, to deny its right to self-defence, or to unfairly single it out in any forum, including at the United Nations or the International Criminal Court,” the declaration said. 

President Biden also spoke about his trip as an opportunity to reassert America’s influence in the Middle East.</span>

Ben van Beurden says Ukraine war fallout means big rise in bills and possible need to ration supplies 
European consumers could face energy rationing this winter as costs continue to soar amid the risk of Russia cutting off gas supplies, Shell’s chief executive has warned. 
“It will be a really tough winter in Europe,” Ben van Beurden told the Aurora spring conference in Oxford on Thursday. 
“We will all face very significant escalation in energy prices. In the worst case, Europe will need to ration its energy consumption.”

Middle East Monitor: BRICS expects Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to join group soon  
The president of the BRICS International Forum expects Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to join the group &quot;very soon&quot;. In an interview with Russia&#x27;s Izvestia, Purnima Anand said that China, Russia and India discussed this issue during the 14th BRICS Summit, which was held online last month. 
&quot;All these countries have shown an interest in joining and are preparing to apply for membership. I think this is a good step, because expansion is always perceived positively; this will clearly increase the influence of BRICS in the world,&quot; explained Anand. &quot;I hope that the accession of countries to BRICS will happen very quickly, because now all representatives of the core of the association are interested in expanding the organisation, so it will be very soon.&quot; 
She stressed that the accession of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey may not take place at the same time.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: With Few Able and Fewer Willing, U.S. Military Can’t Find Recruits 
FOUNTAIN, Colo. — The local Army recruiting station was empty. The normally reliable recruiting grounds at the nearby Walmart were a bust. With the Army still thousands of soldiers short of its recruiting goal, the station commander, Sgt. First Class James Pulliam, dressed head to toe in camouflage, scanned a strip-mall parking lot for targets. 
He spotted a young woman getting out of a car, and put on his best salesman smile. 
“Hey, how’d you know I was going to be here today!” the sergeant said with an affable Carolina drawl, as if greeting an old friend. “I’m going to help put you in the Army!” 
These are tough times for military recruiting. Almost across the board, the armed forces are experiencing large shortfalls in enlistments this year — a deficit of thousands of entry-level troops that is on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War. It threatens to throw a wrench into the military’s machinery, leaving critical jobs unfilled and some platoons with too few people to function.

VILNIUS — Lithuania will keep restrictions on Kaliningrad trade in place while it works out rules on how to resume the trade, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said on Thursday. 
The European Commission said on Wednesday that sanctioned Russian goods could transit through the bloc&#x27;s territory by rail to the enclave, after tensions between Moscow, Brussels and Lithuania escalated. 
&quot;Controls will need to be in place for certain sanctioned freight... Lithuania will have to set rules for the controls, and until that time the current procedures will remain in place&quot;, Simonyte told a press conference. 
She gave no timeline for creating the new rules.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do &quot;whatever is necessary to restore order&quot; after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. 
Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. 
But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go.  Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. 
Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem.

* Covid death and case figures are starting to sharply rise once again as the BA.5 variant takes hold in the United States 
* America is averaging 649 deaths from the virus every day, a 97% increase over the past week that broke over a month of stagnant figures 
* Cases are creeping upwards as well, jumping 24% over the past week to 136,000 per day after weeks of sitting in the low 100,000s 
* On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci warned of an upcoming surge and recommended that Americans start masking-up in indoor public places 
Daily Covid infections and deaths are beginning to surge in the U.S. after over a month of little movement - signaling that a summer surge fueled by the BA.5 variant could now be under way. 
America is averaging 649 daily deaths from Covid, a 97 percent increase over the past week. It is the largest seven day increase in deaths since early December. 
Recorded infections have made a leap as well, to 136,903 per day. It is a 24 percent increase over seven days and the largest daily case average since February - when America was coming down off of the largest Covid surge of the pandemic.

MSF says corpses line only road into isolated area of Cite-Soleil, Haiti, which rival gangs have turned into a ‘battlefield’. 
Thousands of people are trapped without access to food, drinking water and medical care in an isolated part of the Haitian capital, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) has said, as clashes between rival gangs in Port-au-Prince’s Cite-Soleil neighbourhood escalate. 
In a statement, the humanitarian aid group said residents have been unable to leave an area in Cite-Soleil known as Brooklyn, while trucks that bring drinking water into the neighbourhood have been unable to enter.

CNA/Reuters: France says only a few weeks left to save Iran nuclear deal  
PARIS: France&#x27;s new foreign minister said on Tuesday (Jul 12) there were only a few weeks before the window of opportunity to revive Iran&#x27;s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers would close. 
Speaking to lawmakers, Catherine Colonna said the situation was no longer tenable and accused Iran of using delaying tactics and going back on previously agreed positions during talks in Doha earlier this month, while forging ahead with its uranium enrichment programme.

UN hails ‘critical step forward’ after meetings in Istanbul as Turkey says deal will be signed next week 
Turkey has announced a deal with Ukraine, Russia and the UN aimed at resuming Ukrainian grain exports blocked by Russia, raising prospects for an end to a standoff that has exposed millions to the risk of starvation. 
Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said on Wednesday that the deal would be signed when the parties meet again next week and would include joint controls for checking grains in ports and Turkey ensuring the safety of Black Sea export routes for Ukrainian grain.

WNU Editor: The deal is suppose to be signed next week. A lot can happen between now and then. 
And as for solving the global food crisis. Even if Ukraine resumes grain exports via through the Black Sea the food crisis will continue. One of the biggest obstacles to alleviating the global food crisis are current Western sanctions on Belarus and Russian fertilizer exports. Sanctions that the West have said repeatedly will not be lifted.

Who is going to be the next UK prime minister?
 Boris Johnson resigned last week, and just as quickly, the race began for his replacement.
Five contenders remain in the running to take over leadership of the Conservative Party, and of the United Kingdom, after Conservative members of Parliament voted in the first rounds of the leadership contest this week.
This is just the start of selecting a new party leader, a process initiated after Johnson became embroiled in one scandal too many and faced intense pressure from his party to step down. Johnson is expected to stay on as prime minister until September 5, when h…</span>

Biden’s meeting with Israel’s Yair Lapid illuminated their countries’ twinned democratic crises — and their shared solutions.
 JERUSALEM — After President Joe Biden stepped off the plane at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid greeted him with a memory from eight years ago.
“You told me [then] that if you had my hair, you would be president of the United States,” Lapid recalled. “I said to you that, if I had your height, I would be Israel’s prime minister.”
During the tarmac welcoming ceremony, Lapid described Biden as “a great Zionist and one of the best friends Israel has ever known.” At a Thursday press conference, …</span>

As Biden visits Jerusalem, two states are more elusive than ever. 
 When President Joe Biden discusses Israel, he sounds like he is trapped in the 1990s, when the US had just begun shepherding negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians and two states for two peoples seemed within reach. “Greater peace. Greater stability. Greater connection,” Biden said upon arriving in Israel on Wednesday. “A two-state solution.

                              <span>Former DFAT Australia China Council scholar Andrew Phelan says China is attempting a “divide and conquer” strategy as it increases its presence in the Pacific region. 

Mr Phelan said China is “not going away” as it signs a security agreement with the Solomon Islands and strengthens its relationship with Kiribati. 

“They’re going to have some success, and they’re going to have some failures, but it&#x27;s game on,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

The Defence Minister is asking US officials for greater information sharing between the United States and Australia as the two countries work to counter the rise of China in the Indo-Pacific.</span>

“Which is the lowest it’s ever been since that metric was created back in 2006,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“You are now seeing what the biggest theoretical problem with inflation is – which is the erosion of purchasing power in the US, that is clear front and centre, the biggest take-away.”</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden made an &quot;embarrassing&quot; gaffe during his speech at an arrival ceremony in Israel today as he mistakenly said we must keep alive the &quot;honour of the Holocaust&quot;.

The president made the blunder just after landing outside Tel Aviv to kick start a three-day visit to Israel and the West Bank before travelling to Saudi Arabia.

The 79-year-old&#x27;s critics have been slamming the &quot;embarrassing&quot; moment.

&quot;Biden leaves crowd in stunned silence during official Israel visit after telling them to “keep alive the honor of the Holocaust” after his brain breaks,&quot; said Benny Johnson.

&quot;This administration can&#x27;t go a single day without embarrassing itself,&quot; the Daily Caller said.</span>

NYPost: Biden won’t hold press conference after MBS meeting in Saudi Arabia 
   President Biden won’t hold a press conference when he travels to Saudi Arabia and meets with killer Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the White House said Wednesday — days after Biden insisted in an op-ed that “fundamental freedoms are always on the agenda when I travel abroad.” 
“We don’t have a press conference for Saudi [Arabia],” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One en route to Israel for the first leg of Biden’s trip. 
“But what we are trying to do is trying to make sure that you guys hear from the president in Saudi [Arabia], on the bilats [bilateral meetings], on the trip, and make sure that you guys hear directly from him.”

Financial Times: Allies sound alarm over plight of Ukraine’s public finances  
Budget crisis now acute because of falling revenues and hold-ups in financial support from Kyiv’s partners 
Ukraine’s international partners are sounding the alarm about the mounting pressure on Kyiv’s public finances as Russia’s invasion drives down tax revenue and its allies struggle to provide rapid financial support. 
The US Treasury warned that emergency measures such as money-printing being used by Kyiv to prop up its public finances risked damaging its ability to provide critical public services over time, underscoring the need for allies to meet commitmen…</span>

   DW: Gazprom will not guarantee functioning of Nord Stream pipeline 
The Russian energy giant said it did not know if a turbine engine would be returned from Canada. Moscow announced earlier that the pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, was shut down for repairs. 
Gazprom, Russia&#x27;s energy giant, said Wednesday that the functioning of Nord Stream could not be guaranteed even when a &quot;critical&quot; turbine for the pipeline returns from Canada where it is being repaired. 
In a statement, the Russian state energy company said, &quot;Gazprom does not have a single document to allow Siemens to take out of Canada the gas turbine engine currently being repaired there.&quot;

Bloomberg: Russia Earns More Despite Lower Oil Exports in June, IEA Says 
(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s oil exports rose back above $20 billion in June despite lower shipments abroad because of a rally in energy prices, according to the International Energy Agency. 
That was an increase by $700 million from a month earlier, even as Russia’s daily exports of crude-oil and products fell by 250,000 barrels to 7.4 million barrels, the lowest since August, the IEA estimated in its monthly report published on Wednesday. 
Benchmark Brent averaged more than $117 a barrel last month as the global oil market remained tight. High international prices helped to partially offset the discount for Urals crude, which deepened amid the European Union’s preparations to gradually phase out seaborne oil imports from Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Business Insider: Oil prices could jump to $140 per barrel if Russian crude doesn&#x27;t get a price cap, US Treasury official says 
* Crude prices could jump 40% to about $140 if a Russian price cap isn&#x27;t implemented, a US Treasury official said, per Reuters. 
* On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks with Japanese officials on the price cap proposal. 
* In June, G7 leaders discussed a price cap on Russian crude of about $40 to $60 to slow down Moscow&#x27;s funding of its war machine. 
Oil prices could jump about 40% to $140 a barrel if Russian crude doesn&#x27;t get hit with a proposed price cap, a senior US Treasury official said Tuesday, according to a Reuters report. 
On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks over the price cap proposal with Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki. 
Japanese officials have shown hesitance to adopt a price cap set too low, but have not yet rejected the idea.

WNU Editor: This US push to put a cap on Russian oil does not make sense. If Russia does not get the price that it wants for its oil, it will simply not produce it. And if that happens you do not get $140 per barrel oil, you will get $200 per barrel (or more).

Reuters: Hungary Orders Export Ban on Fuels, Curbs Utility Price Caps 
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x27;s government has ordered an export ban on fuels like gas and scrapped a years-long cap on utility prices for higher-usage households, a senior aide said on Wednesday. 
The measures, which also include a plan to boost domestic gas output to 2 billion cubic metres from 1.5 billion, will take effect from August to ensure the continued supply of energy in winter, Orban&#x27;s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said. 
Gas supplies to Europe have tightened and fuel costs have soared since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February and subsequent sanctions, leaving countries scrambling to refill storage and diversify supply channels.

USNI News: U.S. Destroyer Performs South China Sea FONOP; China Says it Expelled Warship 
A U.S. guided-missile destroyer passed near a South China Sea island chain claimed by China as part of a Freedom of Navigation operation and drew complaints from Beijing. 
USS Benfold (DDG-65) sailed near the Paracel Islands early Wednesday local time in a FONOP and was monitored by the People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate Xianning (500), according to the Chinese Ministry of Defense. 
“This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam and also by challenging PRC’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands,” reads a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet.

                              <span>Ayeshea Perera, BBC News: Sri Lanka: Why is the country in an economic crisis? 
A state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka, and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country. 
His departure follows months of mass protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel.  The country&#x27;s foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and it has already missed debt interest payments.

Update: Sri Lanka in crisis: What, why and how? (Al Jazeera)   
WNU Editor: There are many reasons why Sri Lanka has collapsed. Government mismanagement starting with the printing of massive amounts of money. Insane fiscal and green policies that banned the imports of fertilizer that crippled Sri Lanka&#x27;s agriculture sector. Too much debt. 
And while the Western narrative is to blame China for Sri Lanka&#x27;s unsustainable debt levels that has led to the current crisis, the truth is that it is the Western countries that are the main creditors (see below): 

Sri Lanka owes 81% of its external debt to US and European financial institutions and Western allies Japan and India.
China owns just 10%.
But Washington blames imaginary &quot;Chinese debt traps&quot; for the nation&#x27;s crisis, as it negotiates a 17th IMF bailout.https://t.co/Tk49cuLvNS

Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency after President Rajapaksa and his wife fled to the Maldives hours before he was due to resign. 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has become acting president. 
Hours after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled Sri Lanka early on Wednesday, the country&#x27;s prime minister&#x27;s office announced a state of emergency. 
The move came even as thousands of protesters stormed the office compound of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe — who has been appointed acting president — calling again for his resignation, while police responded with tear gas.

WNU Editor: And what is even more scary than the current unrest is that there is no leader in Sri Lanka who has a solution to solve the crisis.

                              <span>Daily Mail: Europe faces huge surge in migration from Middle East and Africa due to food crisis created by war in Ukraine, EU warns 
* Around 20million tonnes of grain are currently blocked in Ukrainian ports 
* Food prices have rocketed which could fuel a migration wave towards Europe 
* Putin has been accused of deliberately weaponizing food supplies 
Europe is facing a huge migration wave from the Middle East and Africa because of the food crisis aggravated by the war in Ukraine, the EU has warned. 
Ukraine is one of the biggest grain exporters in the world but production and dispatch have been severely affected by Putin&#x27;s barbaric invasion. 
Around 20million tonnes of grain from last year&#x27;s harvest are blocked in Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. 

Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The EU is fixated on exporting Ukraine grain to alleviate the global food crisis. But many are predicting that Ukraine itself is going to face serious food shortages this winter because of the war. IMHO this is the wrong time for Ukraine to export its food stocks. 
And what makes the EU position on food even more absurd are the anti-farm policies that we are seeing in places like the Netherlands and Poland where farmers are being pressured to cut food production to meet climate change goals. 
The truth is that the global food crisis has been long in the making, and the cost to feed oneself is no longer affordable for hundreds of millions of people around the world. So face with the option of staying put and starving, or going to where there is food, it should then surprise no one that people will be going to where the food is.

Rarely-seen USAF B-2A stealth bombers have landed in Queensland in a high-profile show of strength, as Australian Defence Forces have another encounter with a Chinese warship. 
At least four bombers - whose unique design makes them virtually invisible to radar detection - touched down on Sunday at the RAAF Amberely Base, west of Brisbane. 
The &#x27;flying wing&#x27;-style aircraft flew 14,000km from their US base in Missouri on a &#x27;training and strategic deterrence mission in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific&#x27;.

Daily Mail: Multi-million-dollar Super Hornet fighter jet like the one Tom Cruise flies in Top Gun: Maverick is blown off deck of USS Harry S Truman into the sea after unprecedented winds whip up in the Mediterranean 
* The US Navy jet was onboard the USS Harry Truman when wind blew it off deck

* The carrier is based in Naples and is on extended deployment due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
A Super Hornet fighter jet similar to the one which is featured in Top Gun: Maverick was blown off an aircraft carrier into the sea. 
The US Navy&#x27;s F/A-18 was onboard the USS Harry Truman when strong winds in the Mediterranean blew the $66.9million fighter off of the deck and into the sea. 
The aircraft is the same model to the ones that were flown by the likes of Tom Cruise in the recent blockbuster sequel Top Gun: Maverick.

* Strategists lay out worst-case scenarios for stocks and bonds 
* Europe is caught in a ‘vicious circle,’ says Banque Syz CIO 
(Bloomberg) -- European stocks plunging 20%. Junk credit spreads widening past 2020 crisis levels. The euro sinking to just 90 cents. 
The predictions are ominous for financial markets if Russia cuts off all the gas supply to Europe. 
Shipments are currently running at reduced levels with the main pipeline shut for a 10-day maintenance, and fears are building over whether Moscow will turn the tap back on. Many investors are asking: How bad could this get? 
To that question, strategists across Wall Street have tried to put numbers on a scenario that would be unthinkable in normal times. There are so many variables, such as the length of any shutdown, the extent of supply cuts, and how far countries would go to ration energy, that anyone’s prediction is a guess at best.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is personally condemning Canada over its decision to grant a Canadian company a &quot;time-limited and revocable permit,&quot; allowing them to return turbines from a Russian pipeline that supplies natural gas to Germany. 
Zelenskyy said that Canada&#x27;s decision is about more than wrongly deciding to hand over the turbines, but that it was an &quot;absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia.&quot;  &quot;If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? 
This question is very dangerous,&quot; Zelenskyy said in a video and accompanying statement on Monday, that also stated the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs “had to summon Canada&#x27;s representative to our country.”

IBTimes: South China Sea Tensions: US Says It Will Back Philippines If War Breaks Out 
* U.S. urged China to abide by international law and cease its provocative behavior 
* Manila also hailed the Hague ruling, saying it cannot be denied by anyone 
* The previous Duterte administration shelved the ruling to get Beijing on its side 
The U.S. has reiterated its support to the Philippines, stating it will back Manila in the event of an armed conflict in the South China Sea. 
Washington&#x27;s statement came on the sixth anniversary of the significant Hague ruling, which rejected China&#x27;s nine-dash claim over the South China Sea in favor of the Philippines, according to Philstar. 
&quot;We also reaffirm that an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke the U.S. mutual defense commitments under Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press statement.

Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: China And Russia Want To Replace US Dollar With BRICS Currencies 
BRICS members call for cross-border payment in BRICS currencies to challenge the U.S. dollar. 
The BRICS—an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—held a summit on June 23. The meeting, chaired by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, was part of a lengthy series of BRICS cooperation events, which began on June 6 with the second finance ministers and central bank governors meeting and ended with the second meeting of the committee of senior energy officials on June 28. 
In his opening remarks, Xi stated, “We should also expand BRICS cooperation on cross-border payment and credit rating to facilitate trade, investment, and financing among our countries.”

Voters anxious over high prices as Democrats face rough midterm campaign  White House officials launched a defensive strike Tuesday against what they expect will be a dour report marking another month of soaring inflation. 
 One day before the release of the consumer price index for June, President Joe Biden’s top economic advisers issued a memo designed to temper the likely public reaction to a new round of recorded price spikes. 
The CPI data coming Wednesday “will largely not reflect the substantial declines in gas prices we’ve seen since the middle of June,” wrote National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Cecilia Rouse, chair of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a five-page memo designed to provide “context” for the upcoming report.

The UnHeard: The German economy is on the brink  
Putin can&#x27;t be blamed for the country&#x27;s economic malaise 
The economist Herbert Stein once wrote that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. 
This became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.

WNU Editor: Germany&#x27;s economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.</span>

                              <span>Sri Lanka&#x27;s embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa flew out of the country early Wednesday.  
Daily Mail: Sri Lanka&#x27;s embattled president FLEES his country after months of widespread protests over the island nation&#x27;s worst-ever economic crisis 
* Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday 
* He, his wife and a bodyguard were among four passengers on board an Antonov-32 military aircraft which took off for the Maldives, immigration sources say 
* &#x27;Their passports were stamped and they boarded the special air force flight,&#x27; an immigration official involved in the process said 
Sri Lanka&#x27;s embattled president flew out of his country early Wednesday, in a probable prelude to his resignation after months of widespread protests over the island nation&#x27;s worst-ever economic crisis. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday and clear the way for a &#x27;peaceful transition of power&#x27;, after fleeing his official residence in Colombo just before tens of thousands of protesters overran it. 
As president, Rajapaksa enjoys immunity from arrest, and he is believed to have wanted to go abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of being detained.

The cause was complications from chronic kidney disease, which required dialysis treatments and caused the amputation of his right leg below the knee last year, said his sister and sole immediate survivor, Liz Goldberg.
For more than 50 years, sport and gaming were inseparable spheres for Mr. Goldberg.  Accustomed to racetracks and casino sports betting, he writes for the famous bettor Jimmy Snyder, known as Jimmy the Greek, in the 1970s. He was an analyst for Miami Dolphins football games on radio, hosted sports talk shows on two Miami radio stations, and reported and anchored…</span>

                              <span>WIMBLEDON, England — For the first time in nearly half a century, a weekend at Wimbledon felt and looked different.
Nick Kyrgios and Ons Jabeur brought new diversity to the men’s and women’s singles finals.  Jabeur of Tunisia became the first North African player to qualify for a singles final.  Kyrgios, a Malaysian-born Australian and a well-documented swagger that marks him as something completely different from his peers, was playing in his first Grand Slam final.  Jabeur and Kyrgios each ended up losing, but that’s not the point.
Not since 1975, when Arthur Ashe and Evonne Goolagong reached their final, combined the two league matches to be so diverse.  Tennis moves in spurts, and nowhere does that seem more true than at Wimbledon.

Another of his discoveries, Bobby Castillo, a converted third baseman known as Babo, taught Valenzuela how to throw a screwball.
“I’m not lying to you,” Brito told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. “Within a week, Fernando was throwing the ball as well as Babo.”
“For many, many Mexican prospects, he was a God,” Jaime Jarrina Spanish-language Dodgers broadcaster since 1959, told Baseball America last year.  “They loved him because he protected them.”
Mike Brito was born on August 21, 1934 in Cuba.  As a catcher, beginning in 1955, he played three seasons in the lower tiers of the Washington Senators minor league system and then several seasons in the Mexican League.
After retiring, he moved to Los Angeles, where he found work as a truck driver and started an adult amateur league in which he also played.
Scouting became his way of staying in baseball.  “Thank God I became a scout in the Mexican League,” he said in a short video profile, “The White Hat and the Wild Horse: The Scout Who Found Puig.” When Dodgers general manager Al Campanis asked him to work for the team, he recalled thinking, “It’s like finding a guy in the desert and asking him if he wants a drink. of water.

WNU Editor: Everyone in Ukraine knows that if conscripted, it will only be a manner of time before you are sent to the front-lines and the meat-grinder that awaits all those who go there. I personally know a few Russian-Ukrainians AND Ukrainians who are refusing to join, and are looking for a way out of the country. But it is almost impossible as a military age male to escape Ukraine right now. Ukraine is under marshal law, and it is being enforced with rigor. 
On a personal note. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 the first mission my father had was to forcibly conscript Ukrainians into the Soviet Army. He hated it because many men that he had to conscript were also his friends and classmates. When the war was over my father learned that every male he knew who was forcibly conscripted got killed in the war. It is something that my father never forgot.

Sighhhh ... and now history is repeating itself.</span>

    Reuters: Ukraine Receives $1.7 Billion in New Financial Assistance - PM 
KYIV (Reuters) - Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States on Tuesday for its &quot;incredible support&quot; after Ukraine received a further $1.7-billion in international financial assistance. 
Shmyhal confirmed receipt of a grant which he said on Saturday would come from a Single-Donor Trust Fund created by the World Bank&#x27;s International Bank for Reconstruction, the International Development Association and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
&quot;Grateful to U.S. &amp; @POTUS (U.S. President Joe Biden) for incredible support,&quot; he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.

Mushahid Hussain, National Interest: U.S. China Policy Is Heading Towards Disaster 
Five fundamentals are pointers to the United States embarking on an unwinnable Sisyphean quest that will end up hurting its interests more than stopping China’s rise in its tracks. 
Less than a year after the longest, disastrous war in U.S. history ended on a messy military exit from Afghanistan, the Biden administration is apparently embarked on the fast track of fashioning a major new foreign policy design to combat the challenge from China. 
There are signposts to a new Cold War but, interestingly, the United States is resorting to containment of China from a rather outmoded playbook, namely, the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Since anti-Communism still sells, this playbook, too, begins with the demonization of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as its nostalgic throwback to the Communist Party of Soviet Union (CPSU), which presided over the liquidation of the Soviet Union.

   WNU Editor: While preparing my post for &quot;Tweets Of the Day&quot; I came across the above tweet.
It struck home. 
Since the start of the war I have been helping Ukrainian refugees who have lost everything and have hit rocked bottom. 
It has been rough. 
But it has also become a spiritual journey for me, and I have learned the following. 
When we help those who are in need we are also helping ourselves. A priceless reward that I never expected.</span>

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Is Saudi Oil Production At Capacity? 
Use it or lose it – this principle might apply to Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity that is now eyed by the Western world to fill the Russia-sized gap in supply left behind by embargoes. 
However, as Statista&#x27;s Katharina Buchholz details below, Saudi Arabia in the past three years only approached its declared maximum production capacity of 12 million barrels per day in one month, casting doubts on the kingdom’s ability to quickly up its production to stabilize world markets. According to Bloomberg, such predictions have come from UAE leadership, who together with the Saudis are the only OPEC members who have spare production capacity – at least on paper.

                              <span>&quot;This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,&quot; he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv&#x27;s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy&#x27;s predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an &quot;offended liver sausage&quot; when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine&#x27;s ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia&#x27;s attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of &quot;distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.&quot;
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. &quot;Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,&quot; Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations &quot;absurd.&quot;
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.</span>

                              <span>Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister is not just a portentous political event. His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.
Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…</span>

                              <span>Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the &quot;match of the century&quot;.
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess&#x27;s enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.

On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America&#x27;s greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

Huge crowds had surrounded the leader&#x27;s home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President&#x27;s Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
&quot;The president was escorted to safety,&quot; the source added. &quot;He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit.&quot;

From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham&#x27;s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God&#x27;s order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president&#x27;s offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president&#x27;s office said.

                              <span>By Satoshi Sugiyama and Tim Kelly NARA, Japan (Reuters) -A steady stream of mourners on Saturday visited the scene of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#x27;s assassination in the western city of Nara, an unusual act of political violence that has shocked the nation. Japan&#x27;s longest serving modern leader was gunned down while making a campaign speech on Friday morning by a 41-year-old man, in a deed decried by the political establishment as an attack on democracy itself. &quot;I&#x27;m just shocked that this kind of thing happened in Nara,&quot; Natsumi Niwa, a 50-year-old housewife, said after offering f...</span>

Signalling that the Kremlin was in no mood for compromise, President Vladimir Putin said continued use of sanctions against Russia for the invasion it launched in February risked causing &quot;catastrophic&quot; energy price rises.

                              <span>Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s lawsuit blaming China for COVID-19 was dismissed Friday when a federal judge ruled his court has no jurisdiction over foreign governments.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in a 38-page ruling, wrote that a federal law setting rules for when a sovereign foreign entity could be sued in U.S. courts doesn’t allow any part of the lawsuit filed by Schmitt in April 2020 to continue.

“All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh wrote.

Schmitt’s office filed a notice of appeal immediately after Limbaugh made his ruling.

When Schmitt filed the lawsuit, he claimed China was responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to cause a global pandemic by covering up the initial infection…</span>

&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,&quot; Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…</span>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
&quot;Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world&quot;, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France&#x27;s condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called &quot;absolutely unforgivable&quot;.
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …</span>

Around 1 million Muslim pilgrims gathered on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s holy Mount Arafat on Friday, for the peak of the biggest Hajj pilgrimage since the outbreak of the coronavirus two years ago.
Pilgrims arrived in buses early in the day to Mount Arafat, around 20 kilometres east of the holy city of Mecca. Pilgrims stay there until sunset in worship, praying and recitation of the Ho…</span>

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
&quot;We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this,&quot; he said.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia&#x27;s largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney&#x27;s west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia&#x27;s east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
&quot;The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,&quot; state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia&#x27;s most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
&quot;We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,&quot; Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia&#x27;s annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia&#x27;s east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum.
Shouts of &quot;When will you stop the war&quot; and &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop the war&quot; were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

                              <span>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com &quot;Love Actually,&quot; asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist&#x27;s ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 &quot;Morning @snb19692,&quot; tweeted Grant. &quot;Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?&quot;
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
&quot;Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being &#x27;lynched,&#x27; as they put it, by the January 6 Committee,&quot; reported Julia Davis. &quot;Appearing on Tuesday’s…</span>
