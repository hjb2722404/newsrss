Mr Jordan said “red states” would be more restrictive on abortion because “that’s the consensus of the people that live there”.

“Just like the different states, different laws in many different ways reflect the values of those estates,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

The peak body for swimming FINA made a historic decision to effectively ban most transgender women from participating in female competitions. 

Ms Seebohm said she is supportive of the open category being suggested into the swimming completion. 

“I’m happy that there’s finally been a decision made,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“We can all move on – like, we can all just go back to the sport that we love and enjoying it … it’s going to be a fair level playing field.”</span>

                              <span>A huge number of protesters are marching in North Carolina following the “contentious” US Supreme Court decision, says Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen.

Protesters have started across the US, in response to the landmark case of Roe v Wade being overturned by the US Supreme Court. 

Ms Nielsen said up to ten US states are uncertain to enact bans on abortion.

“This is a hugely divisive issue in America,” she told Sky News Australia.  

“There is a huge groundswell of support for the pro-choice movement, as we’ve seen, as with the pro-life movement – which is why this has gotten so contentious.”</span>

Politico: Biden&#x27;s pick for NATO chief confirmed 
Gen. Christopher Cavoli currently commands U.S. Army forces in Europe and will succeed Gen. Tod Wolters as the head of U.S. European Command and NATO supreme allied commander. 
The Senate has signed off on President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead U.S. forces in Europe and be NATO’s top commander. 
Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli was confirmed Thursday evening as the U.S. and European allies work to help Ukraine blunt Russia’s offensive and NATO looks to expand to include Sweden and Finland in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion. 
 Cavoli, who now commands U.S. Army forces on the continent, will succeed Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters as the head of U.S. European Command and NATO supreme allied commander. Cavoli will assume command in a change of command ceremony on July 1. 
He takes the reins as Russian forces slowly begin to gain ground in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.

                              <span>There is a real risk that multiple famines will be declared this year - and 2023 could be even worse.
We need strong political and private sector leadership for a coordinated multilateral response.
We cannot accept mass hunger and starvation in the 21st century.
— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) June 24, 2022
   Reuters: World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis, U.N. chief says 
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - There is a &quot;real risk&quot; of multiple famines this year, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday and urged ministers meeting on food security to take practical steps to stabilize food markets and reduce commodity price volatility. 
&quot;We face an unprecedented global hunger crisis,&quot; Guterres told the meeting in Berlin via video. &quot;The war in Ukraine has compounded problems that have been brewing for years: climate disruption; the COVID-19 pandemic; the deeply unequal recovery.&quot; 
More than 460,000 people in Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan are in famine conditions under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a scale used by U.N. agencies, regional bodies and aid groups to determine food insecurity. This is the step before a declaration of famine in a region.

                              <span>Casey Michel, The Atlantic: Decolonize Russia  
To avoid more senseless bloodshed, the Kremlin must lose what empire it still retains. 
The former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski once said that without Ukraine, Russia would cease to be an empire. It’s a pithy statement, but it’s not true. Even if Vladimir Putin fails to wrest back Ukraine, his country will remain a haphazard amalgamation of regions and nations with hugely varied histories, cultures, and languages. The Kremlin will continue ruling over colonial holdings in places including Chechnya, Tatarstan, Siberia, and the Arctic. 
Russia’s history is one of almost ceaseless expansion and colonization, and Russia is the last European empire that has resisted even basic decolonization efforts, such as granting subject populations autonomy and a meaningful voice in choosing the country’s leaders. And as we’ve seen in Ukraine, Russia is willing to resort to war to reconquer regions it views as its rightful possessions.

                              <span>CNBC: Putin is squeezing gas supplies. And Europe is getting seriously worried about a total shutdown

* Europe — which receives roughly 40% of its gas via Russian pipelines — is trying to rapidly reduce its reliance on Russian hydrocarbons. 
* When asked if he was concerned that Russia could fully cut gas supplies, Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told CNBC: “I’m fully aware that they can ... It’s their choice.”

                              <span>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler is in talks with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officials on a “memorandum of understanding” on digital asset regulation.  Together, the agencies can ensure market integrity, Gensler told the Financial Times in an interview published Thursday.  “I’m talking about a rule book on the exchange that protects all trades, regardless of the pair – [be it] security token for security token, security token for commodity token, commodity token for commodity token,” Gensler told the newspaper. 
Gensler’s desire to be collaborative comes as a variety of legislative initiatives have been introduced to create a more comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets.  The Digital Goods Exchange Act, introduced in its latest form in Apriland the law on responsible financial innovation, presented in Juneboth gave the CFTC greater market authority. 
Debbie Stabenow, chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, and senior committee member John Boozman are would have is also drafting a crypto regulation bill, which is expected to expand the powers of the CFTC.  Gensler, who led the CFTC from 2009 to 2013, said expressed skepticism about changes to the status quo.
The SEC has so far taken the lead in crypto regulation, but frequently to the displeasure of industry and lawmakerswho criticize his methods of supposedly regulate by application.  Crypto Industry Leaders have explicitly asked for clearer regulationsand SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce pressed for policy changes in the commission.

Regulation is not just a matter of authority.  The Financial Times quotes blockchain analytics firm Elliptic as saying US regulators have raised $3.35 billion through enforcement actions in the crypto industry over the years, more than 70% of this sum being donated to the SEC.

Wade made abortion legal. Abortion-rights activists are protesting in the streets of U.S. cities, while anti-abortion demonstrators are celebrating the court’s decision. President Joe Biden says he knows many Americans are “frustrated and disillusioned” by the decision but says objections to the ruling should remain peaceful.</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]    Waves of immigration have been seen again recently from politically and economically less stable and prosperous regions to those so-called Western democratised and industrialised countries. Rapid changes in the geopolitical terrain, along with a drastic transformation in the appeal of the defining elements of democracy and prosperity in the past decade, has made immigration to Western countries less attractive nowadays, but some still hold a perception of Western liberalism as the ultimate goal of immigration.  Regardless of what reasons a person has for deciding to immigrate, some basic challenges presented by the process of immigration and integration into Western host societies include barriers of language, culture, ethnicity, education, recognition of credentials and professional experience, and employment. This does not mean the development and upward mobility of immigrants and their offspring  are hamstrung for good, but empirical research has generally shown that different life trajectories for immigrants and their offspring in Western host societies emerge in the process of assimilation. Some immigrants successfully move to a better-off class—termed the white Protestant middle-class in America by scholars—while many remain in the labouring classes or even urban underclasses, leading a life of poverty and marginalisation.  The picture will be more complicated for the offspring of immigrants. This is because immigrant parents need to overcome the invisible obstacles of intricate educational and social systems to help their children succeed academically and obtain a prestigious college degree as a credential for upward mobility, consonant with what Portes, Fernandez-Kelly, and Haller (2009) mentioned: “(w)ithout the costly and time-consuming achievement of a university degree, such dreams are likely to remain beyond reach” (p. 1081). Specifically, recent research on immigration authored by Dr Jerf YEUNG Wai-keung, Associate Professor of CityU’s Department of Social and…</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]  The past few years have seen huge growth in mobile fitness apps globally. Expecting increased revenue to be generated from this category, app designers strive to add features to enhance the user experience and motivate better performance.   Dr HUANG Guanxiong, Dr Crystal JIANG Li, and doctoral student SUN Mengru from CityU’s Department of Media and Communication surveyed 643 WeRun users to examine the effects of social networking functions of fitness apps on users’ participation in physical activity. WeRun is a fitness plugin embedded in the most widely used mobile social networking app WeChat in China and has accumulated more than 100 million active users. Similar to other fitness apps, WeRun tracks users’ daily step counts and ranks them among WeRun friends. Users can also “like” their friends’ step counts, and the app will notify the users about the “likes” received.   The study focused on the ranking and “liking” functions and linked them to social comparison and social support mechanisms. The survey found that checking WeRun rankings and following more friends on WeRun were positively correlated with participation in physical activity. The social comparison mechanism appeared more dominant than the social support mechanism. Specifically, upward comparison (comparing oneself with those who are more competent in a particular task) was positively associated, and downward comparison (comparing oneself to those who are less competent) was negatively related to physical activity participation.   The more frequently users checked the rankings, the more friends they followed on WeRun and the more upward comparison, leading to more participation in physical activity.    The study has several implications for motivating physical activity and promoting fitness apps. Fitness app design can benefit from sending more notifications to encourage users to compare their behaviour more often. The design can leverage the positive effects of upward comparison by sending messages like “You are…</span>

But is that really the case? To investigate this question, research authored by Dr Jun ZHANG, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Asian and International Studies, takes as entry point technological nationalism among middle-class professionals in urban China in the context of the Sino-American trade war of recent years.   Nationalism is a form of identity that is built on—as Benedict Anderson famously argues—an imagined community within a bounded territory. Unlike much existing research, this work does not see ICTs as merely the medium through which nationalism is expressed. Instead, it looks into how ICTs are entangled in people’s everyday lives and how such entanglement shapes “socio-technical imaginaries” of their relationship with their country. Experts may understand ICTs through theories, algorithms and experiments. But when many ordinary people talk about ICTs, they are actually talking about things such as smartphones, and daily practices such as ordering food and hailing a car through online platforms—a way of life that can be called a “platformised lifestyle”.  This research draws on over a decade’s conversations with middle-class professionals and observation of their lifestyles in the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta. It is found that these middle-class professionals are proud of their platformised lifestyle with its unique socio-technological features, high-end smartphones made by Chinese companies, and development in ICTs by tech companies such as Huawei—seemingly advanced enough to alert the American government and thereby leading to Huawei being sanctioned. For many professionals, these achievements suggest that China is moving beyond its sweatshop factory reputation and becoming a rising power in technology. This matters a lot to these professionals. While they have benefited greatly…</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]  In contemporary US politics, the Democratic Party is often regarded as the most welcoming to racial minority groups. Even so, each election cycle sees many members of these groups cast their vote for the Republican Party. In 2016, for example, Chinese Americans from the East Coast to Silicon Valley organised rallies for Republican candidates. Even though former President of the US, Donald Trump consistently used anti-Asian rhetoric throughout the pandemic, he received an even higher share of votes from Asian Americans in 2020 than in 2016. Why do some Asian Americans support a seemingly anti-minority party?   Although existing research underscores the importance of majority-minority relations to voting behaviour, work done by Dr LIU Dongshu, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Public Policy, and other researchers, proposes a new “minority-minority” perspective. He argues that some Asian Americans feel victimised by pro-minority policies promoted by the Democratic Party as they perceive those policies to only help African Americans and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans. This perceived competition results in Asian Americans supporting the Republican Party, whose policies they perceive to, at least, undermine their competitors from other minority groups. In short, we argue that Asian Americans support the seemingly anti-minority Republicans because they feel more threat from other minority groups.  To assess this, the research team relied on two representative surveys of Asian Americans from 2012 and 2016, along with an experiment Liu and his team conducted in 2018. The surveys find that Asian Americans who perceive themselves to have less in common politically with African and Latino Americans are more likely to support the Republican Party. Experimentally, the team uses affirmative action in university admissions, which many Asian Americans believe to disproportionately favour African and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans, to show that Asian…</span>

Although it has already been 27 years since Chang’s death, her works are still loved by readers of different generations, and provide evergreen inspiration for numerous screen adaptations, such as Ang LEE’s Lust, Caution and Ann HUI’s latest film Love After Love.   To give secondary school students multiple perspectives to understand Chang’s work and her writing style, CityU’s Department of Chinese and History (CAH) organised three events based on her literary works for secondary school students and teachers, to enhance students’ writing skills, and share relevant teaching techniques with other Chinese subject teachers.  Eileen Chang’s Literary Work in Film  Several of Chang’s novels have been made into plays and films in recent decades. The latest adaptation was Love After Love, a movie adapted from Chang’s Agarwood Incense: The First Censer, which was also award-winning director Ann Hui’s third adaptation of Chang’s work. The first event of the series, held on 5 March 2022, originally planned to show Love after Love to students on a large screen in the assembly hall of a secondary school. However, this had to be taken online due to the outbreak of the pandemic’s fifth wave. In spite of that, the event still attracted 256 participants from over 30 secondary schools. Secondary school teacher and juvenile fiction series writer YAN Pui-kei hosted the event and guided students to compare the text with the adaptation. Two teachers from local secondary schools were also invited to discuss Chang’s works in greater depth with students.    Mastering Techniques of Novel-writing  The characters in Chang’s works have well-defined personalities. The change of psychology in the protagonists was vividly captured using trivial…</span>

    Defence View: Two French CAESAR howitzer have been captured by the Russian military 
A French journalist announced the capture of the Caesar self-propelled guns transferred to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
The French self-propelled 155 mm CAESAR artillery units, handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine only a few weeks ago, have already been captured by the Russian military. With such information, the French journalist, lawyer and politician Régis de Castelnau noted that due to the oversight of the Ukrainian military, the Armed Forces of Ukraine not only lost two Caesar self-propelled artillery mounts, but the latter were captured by the Russian military, who had already sent NATO weapons for study.

WNU Editor: Russian media is saying that these captured French self-propelled 155 mm CAESAR artillery units were actually sold to them by Ukrainian soldiers. A Russian arms manufacturer that is studying these captured artillery pieces is not impressed with its capabilities. They are also mocking the French President  .... Russian arms maker mocks France&#x27;s Macron (RT).
I am the first to admit that this could be a Russian disinformation effort.  But the thing is that this story is plausible when it comes to a place like Ukraine.</span>

Newsweek: Kremlin Official Sees NATO Preparing for War With Russia 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday said he believes NATO and the European Union (EU) are building a coalition that could eventually wage war with Russia. 
Russia state media outlets reported Lavrov made the comments while speaking at a news conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, following a meeting with Jeyhun Bayramov, Azerbaijan&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs. 
During the conference with reporters, Lavrov discussed the EU&#x27;s Thursday decision to grant candidacy status to Ukraine and Moldova. The move by the EU, which is the first step in the process to full membership, was seen as sign of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. (Both Ukraine and Moldova applied to join the union soon after Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in late February.)

                              <span>Politico:  Zelenskyy wants to replace Ukraine’s top spy after security failures 
Ivan Bakanov was tapped to revamp the controversial Security Service of Ukraine. But after a string of failures and the loss of Kherson, he’s fallen out of favor with the Ukrainian president. 
KYIV — You think you know someone, and then Russia invades your country and your childhood friend turned top intelligence official flubs it and some of his senior spies flee their posts, apparently helping the Kremlin’s forces avoid landmines and direct its attack aircraft to blast your cities. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy isn’t getting a lot of sleep these days, and the man he appointed to lead Ukraine’s domestic intelligence and security agency can’t be helping matters. 
Ivan Bakanov — his friend from way back who once ran his entertainment company and then his presidential campaign — is on thin ice in Kyiv. 
Zelenskyy is looking to replace Bakanov, who now runs Ukraine’s spy agency, with someone more suitable to serve as the wartime chief of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), according to four officials close to the president and a Western diplomat who has advised Kyiv on reforms needed to revamp the SBU.

The package, which will be drawn from existing Defense Department stocks, also includes 18 patrol boats for monitoring coasts and rivers, and small arms. 
The most significant part of the package is the four additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, wheeled vehicles capable of launching barrages of guided rockets at targets up to approximately 40 miles away.

Paul Poast, Washington Post: The war in Ukraine is on track to be among modern history’s bloodiest 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is entering its fifth month, and there is no end in sight. The grueling conflict has shifted to the eastern provinces, where Russian progress in the Luhansk region has been described as “plodding.” Still, military experts predict that the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk may fall. At the same time, the Ukrainians — increasingly well-equipped, courtesy of the West — talk boldly of reclaiming the southern city of Kherson, which the Russians took early in the conflict. 
American attention has drifted somewhat from the war to domestic concerns, which makes it easy to overlook that what’s unfolding in Ukraine is one of the deadlier conflicts of the past 200 years. That it is a “mere” proxy war, rather than a clash between two great powers, also tends to obscure its scale. But the rate at which soldiers are dying is already significantly higher than in the typical war of the modern era — and both sides are digging in, meaning it will steadily climb the list of conflicts that have caused the most overall fatalities.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukrainian troops may need to pull back from the key frontline city of Lysychansk to avoid being encircled after Russian forces captured two villages to its south, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Thursday. 
The retreat of Ukrainian troops from Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, the last two Ukrainian-held cities in Luhansk, would bring Moscow closer to one of its key war aims of capturing all of that region. 
Divided by a river, the cities have become a key battleground in Russia&#x27;s assault on the industrial heartland of Donbas and the fighting is nearing a &quot;fierce climax,&quot; a top official said on Wednesday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s global ratings have sunk to 20-year lows as the Russia invasion of Ukraines enters its fourth month, according to a Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday. 
A median of 9% of respondents in 18 countries said they have confidence in Putin “to do the right thing regarding world affairs,” Pew said. 
That compares with 18% confidence in Chinese leader Xi Jinping and 60% for U.S. President Joe Biden and 59% German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 
Putin&#x27;s worldwide approval has been on a downward trend during his two decades in power.

Ukrainian guerrillas claimed on Friday they killed a Kremlin-backed politician in the Russian-held southern region of Kherson, the latest in a series of attacks aimed at destabilizing the occupation authorities.
Dmitry Savluchenko, the head of the region’s Youth and Sports Department, exploded in his car, Ukrainian and Russian officials said, in what appeared to be part of a growing insurgency fueled by public anger over deteriorating economic, security and humanitarian conditions as Moscow pushes to Russify the region.
Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-appointed administration, called the attack “a despicable act of terrorism”.

As a black woman who rejects the imposition of the “strong black woman” myth in my life, this sentence is one that has always struck me as an unjust demand that we endure serious harm.  Death, in this framework, is indirectly disentangled from the processes of progressive exhaustion of a person.  There’s an immediacy that underlies the cliché saying that if something doesn’t kill you then, then persevering makes you better.  There’s no room for contempt or anger at the thing that didn’t explicitly kill you because you’re now better off for resisting it.

Prior to this, Hughes said, he felt his appearance “was going to hold me back”, but after being around other actors with disabilities, he felt empowered.  He even started wearing short sleeves to emphasize his limb difference, he added.
The Royal Shakespeare Company show is Hughes’ highest-profile casting to date.  In May, Doran gave an interview to The Times of London which was titled:Valid actors cannot be Richard III.”  In a letter of complaint to that newspaper, Doran said the headline was mislead…</span>

The removal of intelligence chief Hossein Taeb after 13 years in the post was confirmed in a statement from the guards which did not explain why he was removed from his post.  But analysts agreed that his failure to prevent Israel from breaching Iran’s security network was at the heart of it.
“He failed to stop Israel’s infiltration and didn’t have much success in retaliatory operations outside the borders,” said Seyed Peyman Taheri, an analyst close to the Iranian government.  “His withdrawal is to bring in new blood and get those two things under…</span>

The mural, inside a San Francisco high school, will remain on display after the city’s school board voted 4-3 on Wednesday to cancel a previous effort to remove it from view.  The decision came several months after a February recall vote changed the composition of the school board, which many parents had accused to prioritize cultural debates on the challenges of schooling students during the pandemic.

With their arms raised to one side and their gnarled clawed hands, they were reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s classic “Thriller” move, but their faces betrayed little emotion.  The recognizable gesture, combined with their balanced energy, managed to say “horror movie” and “postmodern dance” at the same time, a fitting synthesis of their interests.
Later in the rehearsal, lying on the floor, they wondered, “What was it like when you were 12?”
“When I was 12, I decorated my room with pages from magazines,” Valencia said.

Immigrating to the United States to play professional football for the Milwaukee Bucks, where he was the 15th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, he sees everything through eyes of innocent wonder: he’s dazzled by cream chocolate bars and hot dogs, by peanut butter bars and mixed berry smoothies.
Even American jargon fascinated him.  “The day he learned the phrase ‘Yo mama’,” Fader writes, “he ran into the locker room yelling, ‘Yo mama! Hi mom! Hi mom!&#x27;”

The search gave Canadian-born Galt MacDermot a most unlikely choice: he was slightly older than his colleagues and a straight arrow with an eclectic musical background but little Broadway experience.  Mr. MacDermot wrote the melody for the versions of “Aquarius” and several other songs, on request, in less than 36 hours.  It immediately became clear that he was the perfect choice to set the lyrical ruminations of Mr. Rado and Mr. Ragni to rock show music.

                              <span>In 2019, many auto experts said Tesla was making a big mistake by deciding to sell cars only online, arguing that whatever bad feelings people had about dealerships were essential to the auto business.
But the strategy, which was adopted by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and combines direct sales with a limited number of stores and service centers, appears to prove naysayers wrong.  The company dominates the growing electric car market, even as other manufacturers struggle to sell cars due to a shortage of computer chips.

Germany warned residents and businesses on Thursday that the country is going through a natural gas crisis that could worsen in the coming months.
“The situation is serious and winter will come,” Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, told reporters at a press conference in Berlin.  He said the government had triggered the second stage of its three-stage energy gas plan;  the next step would allow the government to begin gas rationing.
“Even if you don’t feel it yet: we are in a gas crisis,” he said.  “Gas is now a rare commodity.  Prices are already high and we must be prepared for further increases.  It will affect industrial production and become a big burden for many consumers.

The short answer is: it’s the tool the Fed has to control inflation.
The central bank is trying to force the rise in prices to slow down.  It does this by raising interest rates, which makes mortgages, auto loans, and business loans more expensive.  As silver becomes more expensive, it weighs on spending and hiring, weakening the job market and the economy in general, perhaps in particular.  Slower growth will give supply a chance to catch up with demand.

Al-Monitor: Iran replaces IRGC&#x27;s intelligence chief 
Taeb&#x27;s apparent dismissal comes after Israeli media outlets identified him as masterminding plots against Israeli citizens in Turkey. 
Iran has replaced the head of the intelligence unit for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Taeb, the IRGC confirmed on Thursday. 
“Guard Corps chief Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami appointed Gen. Mohammad Kazemi as the new head of the IRGC Intelligence Organization,” spokesman for the IRGC Ramezan Sharif said in a statement. Kazemi had previously run the IRGC’s Intelligence Protection Organization. 
Iran&#x27;s state broadcaster IRIB reported Thursday that Taeb will now serve as an adviser to IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami.

Zero Hedge: NATO Chief Calls For Sweden And Finland To Join &#x27;As Soon As Possible&#x27; 
Why is NATO so anxious to induct multiple countries near the borders of Russia into the fold without concern for the geopolitical consequences?  Probably because the war in Ukraine is not going so well.  Or, perhaps the goal is to deliberately create an even wider conflict.  Either way, NATO&#x27;s behavior suggests that there is considerable information that is not being revealed to the general public. 
NATO Chief General Jens Stoltenberg has been pushing for swift approval of applications from Sweden and Finland, with Department of Defense officials in the US calling on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to quickly approve the requests.

Hurriyet Daily News: Turkish intelligence busts Iranian plans to kidnap, attack Israelis 
Türkiye’s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) and police busted the Iranian intelligence service SAVAMA in Istanbul on June 17. 
They were allegedly preparing to kidnap and attack Israeli diplomats and tourist groups in Istanbul. 
They have determined that the shooters who planned to take part in the attacks were in Istanbul. 
MİT and police have received information that kidnappings and killings were planned against Israelis living or visiting as tourists in Istanbul and against a former Israeli ambassador and his wife who were staying at a hotel in the Beyoğlu district.

* European Parliament votes overwhelmingly in favour of Ukraine accession 
* Moldova and Georgia bids also backed in stinging rebuke to Vladimir Putin 
* But any accession process to the EU is likely to take years if not decades 
* Ukrainian President Zelensky said he had been calling EU leaders to make case 
The European Parliament has approved Ukraine&#x27;s bid to join the EU in a vote backed by an overwhelming majority of MEPs. 
Leaders of the member states will gather in Brussels later today to discuss calls to formally grant Ukraine &#x27;candidate status&#x27; to join the bloc, as Russian forces slowly advance in the eastern Donbas region. 
But some member states have been lukewarm about letting Ukraine join the EU, and any accession process is likely to take years if not decades.

* Putin is meeting leaders of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) alliance this week. 
* Putin said Russian trade with BRICS nations rose 38% between January and March despite Western sanctions. 
* The meeting shows Putin still has friends despite the backlash to his Ukraine invasion. 
President Vladimir Putin is meeting this week with a group of prominent world leaders, a reminder that Russia still has powerful allies despite the backlash to its invasion of Ukraine. 
Putin is attending a virtual meeting of the BRICS alliance on Thursday, a group made up of Russia, India, China, Brazil, and South Africa founded in 2009. 
The leaders released pre-recorded speeches on Wednesday, all which went without criticism of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

Euronews/AFP: Moscow renames US embassy street after Donetsk separatists 
The city of Moscow has renamed the official address of the US embassy in Moscow after pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. 
The street housing the embassy building has now been labelled &quot;Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic Square&quot;. 
The move now forces the US diplomatic mission to refer to the separatist territory in Ukraine&#x27;s eastern Donbas region. 
Russia recognised the independence of the region in February -- just before it launched its invasion of Ukraine -- but the US and the West have not recognised it. 
&quot;The US embassy in Russia has a new official address,&quot; Moscow City Hall said in a statement.

Alex Vershinin, The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI): The Return of Industrial Warfare  
Can the West still provide the arsenal of democracy? 
The war in Ukraine has proven that the age of industrial warfare is still here. The massive consumption of equipment, vehicles and ammunition requires a large-scale industrial base for resupply – quantity still has a quality of its own. The mass scale combat has pitted 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers, together with 450,000 recently mobilised citizen soldiers against about 200,000 Russian and separatist troops. The effort to arm, feed and supply these armies is a monumental task. Ammunition resupply i…</span>

Business Insider: Take a look at China&#x27;s biggest destroyer, a $920 million cruiser that&#x27;s said to be the 2nd most powerful in the world after the USS Zumwalt 
* China has the biggest navy in the world in terms of number of vessels. 
* The Type 055 is the biggest destroyer class in China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy. 
* Chinese media has touted the ship as the second most powerful in the world after the USS Zumwalt.  China has the world&#x27;s largest navy in terms of total number of vessels. 
The Type 055 is the biggest destroyer class in China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy.  China&#x27;s navy has 355 vessels, outnumbering the US Navy&#x27;s 297 vessels. 
China State Shipbuilding Corp. began building its biggest vessel — the Type 055 — in 2014. 
The Type 055 destroyers have been in service since 2020. 
The class of destroyers is also known as Renhai-class cruisers. As a multirole warship, it&#x27;s equipped with weapons to counter missiles, ships, and submarines, according to the South China Morning Post.

Children starving to death ‘before our eyes’ say aid workers as G7 leaders warned only ‘massive’ and urgent funding will avert famine 
Only a “massive” and immediate scaling-up of funds and humanitarian relief can save Somalia from famine, a UN spokesperson has warned, as aid workers report children starving to death “before our eyes” amid rapidly escalating levels of malnutrition. 
In a message to G7 leaders who are meeting from Sunday in Germany, Michael Dunford, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) regional director for east Africa, said governments had to donate urgently and generously if there was to be any hope of avoiding catastrophe in the Horn of Africa country.

(MENAFN) The System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), Russia&#x27;s replacement for SWIFT, is open to banks from the BRICS nations, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who announced this on Wednesday. 
Putin claimed at a BRICS economic event that Moscow is creating dependable substitutes for international payments with its allies Brazil, India, China, and South Africa.
“The Russian system for transmitting financial messages is open to connecting banks from the five countries,” he declared, noting: “The geography of the use of the Russian payment system Mir is expanding.”

Business Insider: Europe is drawing up emergency plans to switch back to coal after Russia cuts natural-gas supplies 
* The Netherlands and Denmark triggered emergency energy plans on Monday. 
* Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Austria signaled a shift to coal as an emergency fuel. 
European countries have triggered emergency plans that could lead to rationing of natural gas and signaled a shift back to coal-fired power as the continent&#x27;s largest buyers of Russian fuel seek to secure their energy supplies. 
Russian state gas giant Gazprom cut natural-gas supplies via the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany — which also goes to the rest of Europe — by more than half since last week, citing an equipment hold-up in Canada as a result of sanctions over the Ukraine war. 
German economy minister Robert Habeck and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week Gazprom&#x27;s move was politically motivated, but Moscow insists it&#x27;s technical. &quot;We have gas, it is ready to be delivered, but the Europeans must give back the equipment, which should be repaired under their obligations,&quot; said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday, Reuters reported.

Canada is wrestling with how to comply with sanctions on Russia’s oil-and-gas business without penalizing big customer -- and Ottawa ally -- Germany at the same time, a Cabinet minister said. 
Penalties on Russia for invading Ukraine left a turbine needed to help run the Nord Stream pipeline stranded in Canada. Soon after, Russia’s state-run gas giant Gazprom PJSC slashed supplies through the pipeline, the biggest gas link to the European Union, to just 40 per cent of capacity.

The leaders of France, Germany and Italy have jointly visited Ukraine in an attempt to present a unified European front regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The one-day visit was long on rhetoric but short on substance: European unity remains elusive.  When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the European Union responded the following day with a package of unprecedented economic sanctions aimed at isolating Russia. 
The EU, which was praised for displaying &quot;determination, unity and speed&quot; in its response to Putin, was said to be facing a &quot;transformative moment&quot; that would allow the bloc to become a &quot;geostrategic actor&quot; on the global stage. An observer claimed that the EU had become &quot;a top geopolitical protagonist&quot; and that Europe &quot;discovered that it&#x27;s a superpower.&quot;

                              <span>Daily Mail: Rise of the killer robots! Watch an AI-powered tank shoot rounds and blow up targets in the first live fire of the unmanned &#x27;Type-X&#x27; robotic combat vehicle 
* A robotics company showed off its AI-powered tank, dubbed Tank-X 
* The tank navigates obstacles on an open field and blows up targets 
* The idea is to let the robot head into battle, while human soldiers stay safe 
* At least 10 countries have already placed orders for the Type-X platform 
Imagine a world where wars are fought by AI-powered tanks, allowing soldiers to stay at a safe distance from the battlefield and yet, still demolish their enemies. 
Although this sounds like something out of a sci-fi film, the scenario is exactly what Milrem Robotics and Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace have shown in a first live fire of the PROTECTOR Remote Turret from the Type-X Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV). 
The unmanned tank, dubbed Type-X,’ features navigation and obstacle detection systems powered by AI and a range of weapons including 50 mm cannons, anti-tank missiles, and even a tethered drone.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Oil Giants Warn Of Much Higher Prices For The Next 3-5 Years Amid Lack Of Supply 
It wasn&#x27;t just the epic confusion unleashed by the Biden admin in the past few days over how to lower record gas prices (suggesting that Biden really has no idea what the 79-year-old president is doing), that sparked today&#x27;s jump in crude oil and surge in energy names. 
Providing some bullish support for the oil cash, in his latest weekly note, Bank of America&#x27;s energy analyst Fernando Blanch writes that even if the world goes into recession, Brent oil could average more than $75/bbl next year.

Some conservatives accused the president of trying to interfere with the midterm elections 
During presidential remarks on COVID-19 vaccines for children under 5 years old, President Joe Biden alarmed Twitter users when he spoke of the government preparing for a &quot;second pandemic.&quot; 
A reporter prompted Biden’s head-turning remarks with a question on what spending the U.S. government is still prepared to do in order to manufacture and distribute more vaccines and maintain the infrastructure necessary to combat COVID-19 as it lingers throughout the country.

Matt Margolis, PJ Media: Is Kamala Harris Planning a Coup to Oust Biden? 
We’ve known about tensions between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for some time now, but former President Bill Clinton strategist Dick Morris believes Biden’s aides are now leaking damaging stories on Harris out of concern that she will attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office. 
Morris cites a New York Times story that dismisses Harris as not ready for prime time because she antagonizes her staff and botched her trip to the border. Morris believes the leak “must have undoubtedly come from the Biden forces.” 
Further, Morris says that he’s heard rumors close to the White House that Biden’s dementia is getting worse and has become harder to control and cover up. 
“I believe there may be a move coming to invoke the 25th Amendment against Biden and replace him with Harris,” Morris writes. “Biden’s people are pushing back against it by shooting at Harris and saying that she’s not really ready to be president.”

WNU Editor: I must admit that I am surprised that President Biden is still in office. I always watch and listen to his speeches and announcements, and I predicted last year that if his loss of cognitive abilities continue, he would be replaced in 2022. Well ... his cognitive capabilities have declined noticeably since last year, but he is still in the Oval Office. 
As to US Vice President Harris being the person who will initiate the moves necessary to have President Biden removed from office as the above PJ Media article suggests. I have my doubts that it will work that way..
My guess is that it will be the people who convinced candidate Biden and his staff to appoint Kamala Harris as his running mate in 2020 that will lay the groundwork for President Biden to leave, and it will be the people around President Biden as well as the leadership in the Democrat Party who will then finally tell him that his time is up.</span>

President Joe Biden is fast heading into worst-ever territory as people are rejecting his handling of the economy — and him. 
In two new polls depressing the White House today, one put his approval rating at a career low of 32%, and another rejected the president’s finger-pointing on the economy. 
The latest Civiqs approval rating hit 32%, with 56% disapproving of the president. Even Democrats are expressing frustration, with their approval rate at a low 69%, according to the data.

* President Joe Biden again blamed inflation on &#x27;Putin&#x27;s Price Hike&#x27; on Wednesday 
* It came soon after Fed chair said Ukraine war is not the primary driver of inflation 
* Powell said that rate hikes will be decided on &#x27;meeting by meeting&#x27; basis 
* The central bank will need to see &#x27;compelling evidence&#x27; that inflation is coming down to stop the hikes 
* He acknowledged the risk of recession: &#x27;It&#x27;s certainly a possibility, and the events of the last few months around the world have made it more difficult&#x27; 
President Joe Biden has again blamed inflation on &#x27;Putin&#x27;s Price Hike&#x27; just moments after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine was not the main driver of rising consumer prices. 
&#x27;I&#x27;m doing everything I can to blunt the Putin Price Hike and bring down the cost of gas and food,&#x27; Biden wrote in a tweet on Wednesday touting his release of oil from strategic reserves and efforts to help Ukraine export grain.

Pepe Escobar, The Cradle: St. Petersburg sets the stage for the War of Economic Corridors 
In St. Petersburg, the world&#x27;s new powers gather to upend the US-concocted “rules-based order” and reconnect the globe their way 
The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum  has been configured for years now as absolutely essential to understand the evolving dynamics and the trials and tribulations of Eurasia integration. 
St. Petersburg in 2022 is even more crucial as it directly connects to three simultaneous developments I had previously outlined, in no particular order: 
* First, the coming of the “new G8” – four BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), plus Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico, whose GDP per purchasing parity power (PPP) already dwarfs the old, western-dominated G8. 
* Second, the Chinese “Three Rings” strategy of developing geoeconomic relations with its neighbors and partners. 
* Third, the development of BRICS+, or extended BRICS, including some members of the “new G8,” to be discussed at the upcoming summit in China.

CNN: Putin says Russia is rerouting trade to China and India  
President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Russia is rerouting trade to “reliable international partners” such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa as the West attempts to sever economic ties.
“We are actively engaged in reorienting our trade flows and foreign economic contacts towards reliable international partners, primarily the BRICS countries,” Putin said in his opening video address to the participants of the virtual BRICS Summit. The “BRICS” acronym refers to an informal grouping of the five developing economies. 
According to Putin, trade between Russia and the BRICS countries increased by 38% and reached $45 billion in the first three months of the year.

                              <span>WASHINGTON — President Biden’s top aides are debating whether to ban new oil and gas drilling off America’s coast, a move that would delight climate activists but could leave the administration vulnerable to Republican accusations that it is exacerbating a energy crisis as gas prices soar.
By law, the Department of the Interior is required to publish a plan for new oil and gas leases in federal waters every five years.  Deb Haaland, the Interior Secretary, has promised Congress that a draft Biden plan will be available by June 30.
With the administration keenly aware that inflation and high prices at the pump are weighing on voters ahead of November’s midterm elections, the White House is crafting the plan, two administration officials said.

                              <span>WASHINGTON — Members of the World Trade Organization announced several agreements on Friday at the end of their first in-person ministerial conference in four years, pledging to curb harmful government policies that have encouraged overfishing and to relax some controls on intellectual property in an effort to make coronavirus vaccines more widely available.
The agreements were hotly contested, after several long nights of talks and long periods during which it appeared that the meeting would yield no major agreement.  Indeed, while the parties were able to reach a compromise on vaccine technology, the rift remained so deep that both sides criticized the outcome.

Hours after the House Committee on Oversight and Reform released a memo saying Snyder had interfered with the investigation, Goodell said he believed Snyder had been held accountable by the league’s assessment of a $10 million fine in the team and that Snyder is stepping away from day-to-day team operations over the past year.

The San Francisco Police Department received a call around 10 a.m. about a shooting at the Forest Hill station of the Muni subway, the city’s public rail system, officer Kathryn Winters told reporters on Wednesday.  When officers arrived they found the train had left the station and was heading towards Castro Station, one stop northeast of Forest Hill Station, Officer Winters said. 
“Most of the people on the train got off the train quickly,” Constable Winters said, adding that police were unsure how crowded the train or station was at the time of the shooting.

Jonah, 15, and his mother, Stacie Fang, stepped out onto their patio and looked up, thinking the disturbing noise was coming from the roof of the 13-story Champlain Towers South condominium in Surfside, Florida.  But standing on the 10th floor, they couldn’t see anything wrong, so they settled in for the night.
Everything was calm.  No alarm sounds.  No evacuation order came.  But the condo tower was about to collapse.

Trump’s Coronavirus Response Coordinator, told a congressional committee investigating the federal response to the pandemic that Trump White House officials asked her to edit or delete portions of the weekly guidelines she sent to state and local health officials, in what she described as a constant effort to stifle information as virus cases surged in the second half of 2020.
Dr. Birx, who publicly testified at the panel on Thursday morning, also told the committee that Trump White House officials withheld reports from states during a winter outbreak and refused to release the documents, which contained data on the spread of the virus and recommendations on how to contain it.

The case will now go to a lower court – the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit – which is expected to return it to the federal district court in New York, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the ‘University of California.  , Los Angeles, specializing in constitutional law and gun policy.
This court is likely to grant New York officials a grace period, instead of striking down the law immediately, Winkler said.

Russian soldiers who control a giant nuclear power plant in Ukraine are detaining workers and subjecting them to brutal interrogations for possible saboteurs, prompting many employees to leave and raising security concerns, according to Ukrainian officials.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest in Europe – is located in southern Ukraine, in the town of Enerhodar on the eastern bank of the Dnipro, opposite territory still held by Ukrainian forces.

Unlike a large majority of his fellow Republicans, Mr. Kinzinger remained firm in his condemnation of what happened that day and President Donald J. Trump’s role in stoking it.

The Robotic Executive joined CNBC for an exclusive in which he explains how he plans to make more money.  He told Cramer that his Metaverse will use “virtual and augmented reality” to give people an opportunity to “express themselves.”
To screw up was all ears and told the tech billionaire he’d be open to trying out some parts of a virtual reality life.
Zuckerberg explained that he wanted people to take real money and spend it to live in what looks like an empty digital pit:

But days after arriving in Malta on June 5, Ms Prudente, then 16 weeks pregnant, began to miscarry.  A few days later, her waters broke and her placenta began to detach, making it impossible for the fetus to survive, according to Dr Isabel Stabile, a gynecologist who has worked with Doctors for Choice, a Maltese advocacy group.
Ms. Prudente and Mr. Weeldreyer were devastated.  But then they discovered that the situation was even worse than they had imagined and that Ms. Prudente’s own life was also in danger.

WASHINGTON — “It’s my Super Bowl,” an off-camera news anchor said during public hearings held by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.  But what’s a Super Bowl without stars, or even fans, I thought.  Former President Donald J. Trump and his family would certainly not show up in person.  Neither Rudolph W. Giuliani, once his personal attorney and former mayor of New York, nor any other who would be recognizable to anyone but a student of politics.
And unlike last month’s libel lawsuit involving Johnny Depp and his estranged wife, Amber Heard – in which the public’s passion for salacious celebrity gossip was unmistakable – eager supporters didn’t appear to be lining up to …</span>

It was unclear exactly what investigators were looking for, but Mr. Clark played a pivotal role in President Donald J. Trump’s failed efforts in late 2020 to force the nation’s top prosecutors to support his election fraud allegations.
The law enforcement action at Mr. Clark’s home in suburban Virginia came just a day before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol is set to hold a hearing examining Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department after his election defeat.

Fifteen Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Minority Leader, joined Democrats in a crucial test vote that paved the way for the Senate to pass the measure as early as Thursday.  The 65-34 vote more than crossed the 60-vote threshold needed to break a Republican filibuster, breaking a three-decade string of failures over gun legislation.  A Republican senator was absent.

                              <span>A new Granite State poll of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire signals waning support for former President Donald J. Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee — and growing strength for Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida.
Among more than 300 likely Republican primary voters, 37% said they wanted Mr. Trump to be the party’s next presidential nominee, compared with 39% who said they would support Mr. DeSantis, within the margin of error of 5.5% for this question.  Mr. Trump is now “statistically linked” to Mr. DeSantis, according to the poll.
That’s a significant change from October, when a Granite State poll showed Mr. Trump had the support of 43% of likely Republican voters;  Mr. DeSantis was at 18%.


But Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the poll, warned there was still plenty of time before the 2024 presidential cycle: “It’s daylight saving time.  We haven’t even had the midterm elections yet.


The tightening between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis is “part of a typical pattern,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.  “As the primary draws closer, new candidates are emerging and attracting more media attention, and therefore more voter attention, than the losing candidate from the previous election.”
The survey was conducted from June 16 to 20.  It also showed that among more than 840 likely voters in the 2024 general election, Mr. DeSantis was a stronger Republican challenger than Mr. Trump to face President Biden in the next presidential election.
Mr. Biden, who won the state in 2020, would get 50% of the vote if he ran against Mr. Trump, who would get 43%, according to the poll.  But Mr. Biden was only expected to get 46% against Mr. DeSantis, who would get 47%, according to the poll.
In a brief interview, Mr. Smith described waning support for Mr. Trump as voters “move away from last year’s model to look at this year’s model”.

                              <span>ALBANY, NY — In the final days of the New York legislative session, the state’s progressive left seemed poised for a surprise victory.
A bill that would allow New York to build state-owned renewable energy has suddenly been thrown into play, after being considered dead.  It passed the Senate despite strong opposition from energy producers, and after hours of fervent grassroots lobbying, activists proclaimed they had enough votes in the Assembly to pass.

“One of the central elements of the movement for better policing is the demand that those who serve in uniform better represent the communities they police,” Mayor London Breed said. said.  “We can’t say, ‘We want more black officers,’ or ‘We want more LGBTQ officers,’ and then treat those officers with disrespect when they step in and serve.”

Which Beaches are Better? NSW or Queensland
Australia is literally surrounded by beaches, but arguably the best ones are in New South Wales and Queensland, although most other states could contest otherwise. But the one thing that cannot be denied is that if someone wants to travel to Australia for the beaches, they are not heading to Victoria or South Australia unless […]

&quot;That is why we ask foreign media to tell the truth about this war and continue to tell the world about Russia&#x27;s crimes in our country,&quot; she told AFP.

                              <span>A gun battle left four police officers and eight suspected gang members dead in Mexico&#x27;s western state of Jalisco, authorities said Thursday.
The clash happened on Wednesday night at a house in El Salto on the outskirts of the city of Guadalajara and, according to witnesses, lasted for more than an hour.
Eight suspects were killed and three others seriously injured, Jalisco Governor Enrique Alfaro said.
Two people being held captive inside the building were rescued following a tip-off that gunmen had been seen taking gagged people into the house, prosecutor Luis Mendez Ruiz told reporters.
Several people were arrested, and weapons and ammunition were seized.
Ten police officers have been murdered this year in Jalisco, one of Mexico&#x27;s most violent states due to the presence of criminal gangs, according to official figures.
The western region, one of the country&#x27;s most prosperous, is the cradle of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which authorities blame for numerous deaths and disappearances.
Its leader, Nemesio &quot;El Mencho&quot; Oseguera, is one of the world&#x27;s most wanted drug lords, with the US Drug Enforcement Administration offering $10 million for his arrest.
More than 340,000 people have been killed in a spiral of bloodshed in Mexico since the government deployed the army to fight drug cartels in 2006.

                              <span>The rush for academic credentials is nothing new ahead of a Kenyan election. Candidates are challenged about the existence or validity of their university degrees, and controversy is common.
This is because, under Kenya’s elections act, contestants for president, senator and, governor seats must show proof of a degree from a university recognised in Kenya. Members of parliament resisted attempts to extend this requirement to them, and the Kenyan High Court ruled in their favour.  
It’s not just politicians that are under pressure to produce qualifications. Many public servants have used fake degrees in pursuit of job opportunities or promotions. One case involved a man who posed as a high-ranking police officer for over 10 years. He hired and fired officers, attended top security meetings …</span>

After years of planning and months of training to climb Mount Everest on the first all-Black expedition to the world&#x27;s tallest peak, 35-year-old Fred Campbell came down with a respiratory infection soon after arriving in Nepal in April.
Campbell fought the infection for weeks on acclimatization hikes with his mountaineering team, Full Circle Everest, but by the time he reached Camp 3 at 24,000 feet above sea level in the Himalayas, his fever spiked to 104 degrees.

&quot;In accordance with criminal laws... (Aung San Suu Kyi) has been kept in solitary confinement in prison&quot; since Wednesday, Zaw Min Tun said in a statement.
Since her ouster in a coup last year, Suu Kyi had been under house arrest at an undisclosed location in Naypyidaw, accompanied by several domestic staff and her dog, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.
The Nobel laureate, 77, left those premises only to attend hearings for her trial in a junta court that could see her handed a prison sentence of more than 150 years.

                              <span>Strikes crippled Britain&#x27;s rail network on Thursday as union bosses, train operating firms and the government faced off over demands that workers&#x27; pay increases keep pace with surging inflation.
A spike in the cost of food and fuel is pushing many household budgets to the brink and is driving trade unions to demand higher pay increases for their members. The government has urged wage restraint to avoid an inflationary spiral.
Unions formed picket lines around rail stations for the second day this week and warned of more industrial action unless a deal can be reached to improve pay and avoid redundancies.
&quot;We&#x27;ll continue to talk to the companies about everything that&#x27;s been put on the table and we&#x27;ll review that and see if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action,&quot; Mick Lynch, secretary-general of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), told the BBC.
&quot;But if we don&#x27;t get a settlement, it&#x27;s extremely likely that there will be.&quot;
Although talks are ongoing, a third day of strikes is planned for Saturday. Other industries are also moving towards industrial action in what unions say could be a &quot;summer of discontent&quot;.
The government has criticized the strikes, calling them counterproductive and most damaging for those on low incomes who depend on public transport and are unable to work from home.
Later on Thursday, ministers will set out planned changes to a law that would make it easier for businesses to use temporary staff, in a moved designed to minimize the impact of strike action.

&quot;Once again trade unions are holding the country to ransom by grinding crucial public services and businesses to a halt. The situation we are in is not sustainable,&quot; Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said.
&quot;Repealing these 1970s-era restrictions will give businesses freedom to access fully skilled staff at speed, all while allowing people to get on with their lives uninterrupted to help keep the economy ticking.&quot;

                              <span>The global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine will kill millions by leaving the hungriest more vulnerable to infectious diseases, potentially triggering the world&#x27;s next health catastrophe, the head of a major aid organization has warned.
A Russian naval blockade of Ukraine&#x27;s Black Sea ports has stopped grain shipments from the world&#x27;s fourth-largest exporter of wheat and corn, raising the specter of shortages and hunger in low-income countries.
The knock-on effects of the food shortages mean many will die not only of starvation but from having weaker defenses against infectious diseases due to bad nutrition, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria told AFP this week.

LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) will decide on Thursday whether to declare monkeypox a global health emergency, stirring criticism from leading African scientists who say it has been a crisis in their region for years.
The deliberations and scrutiny of the WHO&#x27;s response to the outbreak follows concerns over how the U.N. agency and governments worldwide handled COVID-19 in early 2020.
Monkeypox does not spread nearly as easily as COVID and there are vaccines and treatments available unlike for the coronavirus when it emerged. But it has still raised alarm.
The case count from the current outbreak outside of Africa has topped 3,000 in more than 40 countries, according to a Reuters tally - largely among men who have sex with men - since it was first r…</span>

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow&#x27;s massive air and artillery attacks were aimed at destroying the entire Donbas region and urged Ukraine&#x27;s allies to accelerate the shipment of heavy weapons to match Russia on the battlefield.
The fight for the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Ukraine&#x27;s Luhansk region is &quot;entering a sort of fearsome climax&quot;, said Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to Zelenskiy. Russia is seeking to capture both Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region - the nation&#x27;s industrial heartland.

                              <span>WASHINGTON — A sweeping new law aimed at cracking down on Chinese forced labor could have significant — and unforeseen — ramifications for American businesses and consumers.
The law, which took effect on Tuesday, bars products from entering the United States if they have ties to Xinjiang, the far western region where Chinese authorities have carried out a massive repression on Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.
This could affect a wide range of products, including those using raw materials from Xinjiang or linked to the kind of Chinese labor and poverty reduction programs that the US government has deemed coercive – even if the finished product used only a tiny amount of material from Xinjiang somewhere along its journey.


The law, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, p…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON — President Biden plans to ask Congress on Wednesday to temporarily suspend the federal gasoline taxan effort to mitigate soaring fuel prices that have stoked frustration across the United States.
In a speech on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden will ask Congress to lift federal taxes – about 18 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24 cents per gallon of diesel – until the end of September, just before the election in midterm in the fall, according to a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the announcement.  The president will also ask states to suspend their own gasoline taxes, hoping to ease the economic pain that has contributed to his waning popularity.
The White House will face an uphill battle to get Congress to approve the vacation, however.  While the …</span>

                              <span>WINDHOEK, Namibia – Namibian investigators were on the trail of the suspected burglars.  After receiving a tip of a sensational robbery – the theft of cash from a farm belonging to President Cyril Ramaphosa of neighboring South Africa – they had traced large money transfers the suspects had made from bank accounts South Africans to Namibian bank accounts.
All that remained was to build a case against the suspects to establish a link between the money and the burglary.
But when Justice Ministry officials in Namibia contacted their counterparts in South Africa for confirmation, they said they got an unusual response that killed their case: silence.
Now, two years later, that silence raises new questions about whether Mr Ramaphosa was trying to hide the burglary from public view and mobilize …</span>

Middle-class people did not speak like that in the pastoral of Chandernagore, a small town in West Bengal, about 30 miles from Kolkata.  Her father was a chemical engineer in a wool factory, her mother an artist who taught cooking.  She told him to stop saying such things or else the neighbors might think he was crazy.
When he was 14, he moved into a small room in his paternal grandmother’s house in the chaotic post-colonial city of Calcutta so he could attend a good high school.  He had always scored 100s – which, in India, inevitably means being followed in science.  “I thought the education system in India was like an arranged marriage, where they push you into a sys…</span>

France 24: Xi warns about &#x27;expanding military alliances&#x27; at BRICS summit: state media 
Beijing (AFP) – Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against &quot;expanding&quot; military ties on Wednesday in a speech ahead of a virtual summit with top leaders from Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa. 
Beijing is hosting the meeting of the influential club of BRICS emerging economies, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world&#x27;s gross domestic product. 
Three of its members -- China, India and South Africa -- have abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

Bloomberg: Refugee Food Rations Cut as War in Ukraine Worsens Global Hunger 
(Bloomberg) -- The World Food Programme is cutting food rations for refugees by as much as half, as it faces a hunger crisis worsened by the war in Ukraine and funding constraints. 
“We are being forced to make the heart-breaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley said Monday in a statement. 
Food prices are near a record high after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sharply reduced Kyiv’s key exports of grain and vegetable oil, adding to price pressures from logistics snarl-ups and a rebound in demand after the pandemic. 
Efforts to let Ukraine resume crucial agricultural exports are moving slowly.

Reuters: Lithuania: We&#x27;re ready if Russia cuts us out of common power grid over Kaliningrad disruptions  
VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania will be prepared if Russia disconnects it from the regional power grid in retaliation for blocking rail shipments of some Russian goods to Moscow&#x27;s Kaliningrad exclave, but no military confrontation is expected, its president told Reuters. 
He spoke after the Kremlin warned Lithuania on Tuesday that Moscow would respond to the ban on the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU to Kaliningrad in such a way that citizens of the Baltic state would feel the pain. 
With relations between Moscow and the West at a half-century low over Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania banned the transit of goods sanctioned by the European Union across its territory to and from Kaliningrad, citing EU sanction rules.

Peace across the world has declined to the lowest level in 15 years as uncertainty over post-Covid economic recovery and Russia’s war in Ukraine loom large, according to the 16th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI). 
The report, produced by the Institute for Economics &amp; Peace (IEP) thinktank, said the rise in food and fuel costs have increased food insecurity and political instability globally, especially in south Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 
The average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.3 per cent in 2021, the report said.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said waste from the Beckton sewage treatment works in Newham tested positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus in February and that further positive samples had been detected since. 
No cases of the disease or related paralysis have been reported, and the risk to the general public is considered low, but public health officials urged people to make sure that they and their families were up to date with polio vaccinations to reduce the risk of harm.

                              <span>CNBC/Reuters: Afghanistan quake kills 1,000 people, deadliest in decades 
* A powerful earthquake struck a rural, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more. 
* Officials warned that the toll may still rise. 
* Rescuers rushed to the area by helicopter, but the response is likely to be complicated since many international aid agencies left Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. 
A powerful earthquake struck a rugged, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing at least 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more in the country’s deadliest quake in two decades, the state-run news agency reported. Officials warned that the already grim toll may still rise.
In the remote area near the Pakistani border, residents searched for survivors and the dead by digging with their bare hands through the rubble of collapsed stone and mudbrick houses, according to footage shown by the news agency Bakhtar. 
It was not immediately clear if major rescue equipment was being sent — or even if it could reach the area.

                              <span>(Reuters) -Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and actress Jerry Hall are getting a divorce, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Murdoch got married to Hall in a low-key ceremony in central London in March 2016. The Fox Corp chairman and his former supermodel wife were frequent fodder for the tabloids, which chronicled their marriage at Spencer House and the festivities surrounding the elder Murdoch&#x27;s 90th birthday celebration last year at Tavern on the Green in New York City.
Murdoch&#x27;s divorce, his fourth, is unlikely to alter the ownership structure of businesses he holds stakes in, which include Fox Corp, the parent company of Fox News Channel, and News Corp publisher of the Wall Street Journal, according to the report.
The Murdoch family&#x27;s shares in the companies he founded reside in a strictly managed trust.
Bryce Tom, a spokesperson for Murdoch, declined to comment. A representative for Hall did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

                              <span>U.S. Republican Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas used a hearing about toxic workplace culture to attack football star Tom Brady.
During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Wednesday, Fallon lashed out at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.
&quot;Last week marked the anniversary of the scandal that led to Watergate, which led to felony convictions and the first resignation of a United States president,&quot; he said. &quot;And a scant seven and a half years ago, another scandal rocked our nation threatening the very core and foundation of our republic, that being, of course, deflategate.&quot;
The congressman recalled the scandal &quot;where in an AFC championship game, the NFL footballs, the pigskins, the rock, the pill, the hand egg, the melon and the leather was mysteriously underinflated by two PSI.&quot;
Fallon noted that the league eventually suspended Brady, referring to him by the nicknames &quot;the GOAT, the California Cool, Real Slim Brady, the Master of the Tuck, the Lord of the Rings, Tom Terrific.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Commissioner, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware that many in New England worship Mr. Thomas Patrick Brady as a demigod of sorts,&quot; he continued. &quot;My point here, sir, is this country simply can&#x27;t afford another scandal, particularly a preventable one.&quot;
Fallon called on Goodell to change the NFL rules to &quot;guarantee the consistency of the pressure of footballs.&quot;
The rant shocked sports reporter Ari Meirov.
&quot;This hearing is off the rails,&quot; he wrote on Twitter.
One video of Fallon had nearly 40,000 views just hours after his remarks.

                              <span>A Brazilian former education minister accused of influence peddling, allegedly at the request of President Jair Bolsonaro, was arrested Wednesday, police and a defense lawyer said.
Milton Ribeiro resigned in March over allegations that he channeled public funds to allies of two influential Evangelical pastors at Bolsonaro&#x27;s &quot;special request.&quot;
Newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo revealed an audio recording of Ribeiro saying he gave priority in deciding school-funding requests to municipalities governed by &quot;friends&quot; of the pastors.
One mayor reportedly said he had been asked for a kilo of gold in exchange for having his school-funding request cleared.
The claims triggered calls from opposition lawmakers for Ribeiro and Bolsonaro to be investigated.

Scattered around Europe since Russia&#x27;s invasion in February, life for top swimmers like Mykhailo Romanchuk whose father is &quot;fighting on the eastern front&quot; has been upended.
&quot;Every morning he sends me (a message) that he is OK,&quot; said Romanchuk, 25, after winning a bronze medal in the 800m freestyle Tuesday.
The father and son refuse to talk by phone to avoid revealing Ukrainian army locations to the Russians.
As swimming facilities in cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol have been decimated by bombing, swimmers&#x27; foreign connections came to the rescue.

The rape allegations go back to when Chrysoula Zacharopoulou -- who is now state secretary for development, Francophonie and international partnerships -- still worked as a gynaecologist, according to French magazine Marianne.
One complaint was lodged May 25 and the investigation opened two days later, the prosecutors said. The second complaint was filed on June 16. Both allege that the assaults happened in the context of medical care.
Greece-born Zacharopoulou, 46, joined the government of Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne in May, having been a member of the European Parliament for the previous three years. She report…</span>

                              <span>Kate Bush, in a rare interview, has described her return to the top of the music charts as &quot;quite shocking&quot; after Netflix drama &quot;Stranger Things&quot; wowed a new generation of fans.
The much-loved British singer-songwriter also dwelt on her lockdown experience of binge-watching and gardening, and revealed that she prefers an old-style phone when out and about.
Bush&#x27;s classic song &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot; has surged to number one in Britain and elsewhere after featuring prominently, and movingly, in the fourth series of the sci-fi Netflix series set in the 1980s.
&quot;It&#x27;s such a great series, I thought that the track would get some attention,&quot; she told BBC radio in the interview, which was recorded Tuesday and broadcast Wednesday.

                              <span>Women will be allowed to take part in the main Viking-inspired torchlight procession on the remote Scottish island of Shetland for the first time next year, organizers said on Wednesday.
The committee in charge of the &quot;Up Helly Aa&quot; festival, which commemorates the end of the Christmas season, said that it was time to lift restrictions on women taking part in the traditionally male-only procession.
&quot;The decision means the festival in Lerwick on Tuesday January 31, 2023 will have a different dimension to it, but we have no doubt that its essence and spirit will remain the same,&quot; committee secretary Robert Geddes said.
The event, which is popular among tourists, traditionally involved around 1,000 male participants known as guizers in Viking dress, dividing into squads to parade through the town.
The walk is led by the &quot;Guizer Jarl&quot; or &quot;chief guizer&quot;, and culminates in the participants using their flaming torches to set ablaze a replica Viking longship.
The modern event, first held in 1881, is famous for its festive parties which often involve traditional Shetland dancing and copious alcohol consumption.
Rural &quot;Up Helly Aa&quot; processions on Shetland, which lies in the middle of the North Sea some 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Edinburgh, started allowing women to take part in 2015.
But the Lerwick committee stood firmly against allowing female participants to get involved in celebrating the island&#x27;s Norse heritage.
&quot;We felt that it was time to give squads a choice over their guizers, including allowing female participation,&quot; Geddes said.
The other criteria for participation -- that guizers be older than 16 and have lived in Shetland continuously for five years -- remains the same for the event, which has not been held since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The talks in Ankara between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan come one month before a visit to Riyadh by US president Joe Biden, for a regional summit focused on the energy crunch caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
Erdogan&#x27;s decision to revive ties with one of his biggest rivals is also driven in large part by economics and trade.
Turks&#x27; living standards are imploding one year before a general election that poses one of the biggest challenges of Erdogan&#x27;s mercurial two-decade rule.

Still, it&#x27;s just a fish. How is it possible it could have gotten British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira murdered?
Police say Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead on June 5 returning from a research trip in Brazil&#x27;s far-flung Javari Valley.
At first glance, the jungle-covered region near the Peruvian and Colombian borders seems like one of the last untouched wildernesses, home to a sprawling Indigenous reservation with the biggest concentration of uncontacted tribes on Earth.
But the double murder lay bare growing violence in the region fueled by illegal fishing, logging, mining and drug trafficking.

                              <span>Tor Selnes owes his life to a lamp. He miraculously survived a fatal avalanche that shed light on the vulnerability of Svalbard, a region warming faster than anywhere else, to human-caused climate change.
On the morning of December 19, 2015, the 54-year-old school monitor was napping at home in Longyearbyen, the main town in the Norwegian archipelago halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.
Suddenly, a mass of snow hurtled down from Sukkertoppen, the mountain overlooking the town, taking with it two rows of houses.
Selnes&#x27; home was swept away 80 meters (263 feet). The room where he was sleeping was completely demolished amid &quot;a scraping sound like metal against a road&quot;.
To avoid being buried under the snow, he grabbed onto a ceiling lamp.

A powerful earthquake in Afghanistan killed more than 900 people and injured hundreds more on Wednesday, flattening homes and devastating entire villages in a nation already ravaged by decades of U.S.-led war and an ongoing economic collapse.
The earthquake, which hit overnight, had an estimated magnitude of 6.1 with an epicenter near the nation&#x27;s border with Pakistan.
&quot;The death toll is likely to rise as some of the villages are in remote areas in the mountains and it will take some time to collect details,&quot; said Salahuddin Ayubi, an official with the country&#x27;s interior ministry, as disaster relief efforts continued.

&quot;It&#x27;s busy down there,&quot; the soldier observes.
France&#x27;s Atlantique 2 aircraft, in service since the 1980s to detect surface vessels and submarines, has been dispatched to track Russian and Russia-friendly ships, a task that became key after President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

                              <span>Monkeypox may soon have a new name after scientists called for a change to dispel stereotypes of Africa being seen as a crucible of disease.
The World Health Organization announced last week that it is &quot;working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it causes.&quot;
Monkeypox&#x27;s clades, which are different branches of the virus&#x27; family tree, have been particularly controversial because they are named after African regions.
Last year the WHO officially named Covid-19 variants after Greek letters to avoid stigmatizing the places where they were first detected.
Just days before the WHO announced it would change monkeypox&#x27;s name, a group of 29 scientists wrote a letter saying there is an &quot;urgent need for a non-discriminator…</span>

Officials warned that the already grim toll may still rise. The European seismological agency said the tremors were felt over 500km by 119 million people across Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.</span>
