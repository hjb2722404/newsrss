Lula - as he&#x27;s commonly referred - has promised a suite of environmental and social changes - including an end to illegal mining and the scaling back of logging projects in the Amazon.</span>

                              <span>Former Liberal MP Dave Sharma says he thinks we’ll see a stronger form of leadership from Chinese President Xi Jinping. 

Mr Sharma’s remarks come after the ruling Communist Party signed off on a third term for Xi - breaking an unofficial convention that limited leaders to two terms. 

“I think China’s more hawkish approach to the outside world is going to continue,” Mr Sharma told Sky News Australia. 

“I think their wolf warrior style of diplomacy and uncompromising attitudes towards the outside world are going to continue.”</span>

“If investigations ramp up and Hunter Biden comes to the forefront , and we there’s so much there and we’ve only scratched the surface, the interest of his family is the only thing that can get him to step aside – I think,” Ms McEnany told Jesse Watters.

“But then he loses the pardon power doesn’t he? To pardon his son Hunter Biden if he’s no longer president.”</span>

                              <span>A tweet by US President Joe Biden has been fact-checked on Twitter barely two days after Elon Musk finalised his $US44 billion takeover deal of the popular social networking service.

On Friday, the president was called out by Twitter readers for inflating the number of corporations that were making billions, according to Fox News.

In a tweet said to be giving &quot;the facts&quot;, Mr Biden claimed that 55 corporations made $US40 billion in 2020 and &quot;paid zero in federal taxes&quot;.

The tweet had an &quot;added context&quot; stamp applied to it by readers indicating the Inflation Reduction Act imposed a minimum tax on corporations with average pre-tax earnings greater than $US1 billion.

It also noted &quot;of the 55 corporations mentioned by President Biden, only 14 had earnings greater than $1 billion and would be eligible under Biden’s tax law&quot;.</span>

                              <span>In this photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan&#x27;s President Tsai Ing-wen watches soldiers operate equipment during a visit to a naval station on Penghu, an archipelago of several dozen islands off Taiwan&#x27;s western coast on Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2022.

StraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons 
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. 
Defending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. 
Preventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.

WNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.

The same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.</span>

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 30, 2022
   From Instapundit .... “Grab the popcorn, baby! It’s on! Maybe a questionable decision this early in his tenure as Chief Twit, but we’re here for the show, and we couldn’t write a better opening episode. This tweet would have gotten flagged for disinformation or taken down by Twitter in the before times. Now it’s out there in all its glory for people to read, debate, criticize, and all the other things that should happen in a free society where ideas are discussed with words INSTEAD of resorting to violence. It’s a new day!” 
Wow!!!! 
If this Santa Monica article is true (link here), it completely changes the narrative behind the Pelosi assault story.   This tweet by Elon Musk perfectly illustrates why the political establishment is freaking out over Elon Musk&#x27; ownership of Twitter.</span>

                              <span>Asia Times: US chip ban de facto declaration of war on China?  
America’s latest chip war sanctions risk wider conflict in physical and economic spheres.  
The United States has gambled big in its latest across-the-board sanctions on Chinese companies in the semiconductor industry, believing it can kneecap China and retain its global dominance. 
From the slogans of globalization and “free trade” of the neoliberal 1990s, Washington has reverted to the technology-denial regimes that the US and its allies followed during the Cold War. While it might work in the short run to slow down Chinese advances, the cost to the US semiconductor industry of losing China – its biggest market – will have significant consequences in the long run. 
In the process, the semiconductor industries of Taiwan and S…</span>

A Haitian politician has been shot dead outside his home, authorities have said, as international concerns intensify over the gang violence, political turmoil and humanitarian crises that have seized control of the country. 
Eric Jean Baptiste was killed on Friday night outside his home in the capital Port-au-Prince, local police told CNN.
He was the leader of the Rally of Progressive National Democrats Party (RNDP), a minor political party in Haiti, and launched a longshot presidential bid in 2016.  A security guard was also killed in the attack, the police spokesperson said. Baptiste survived an earlier attempt on his life in 2018, escaping with a bullet wound.

OilPrice.com: U.S. LNG Cannot Replace The Russian Natural Gas That Europe Has Lost 
* Europe has relied on U.S. LNG imports to offset the loss of Russian gas, with nearly 70% of U.S. LNG exports heading to Europe in September. 
* In the long term, Europe will have to find other sources of natural gas as its inventories are likely to drain over the upcoming winter. 
* Ultimately, Europe will have to reduce demand for natural gas going forward as there is very little available supply left. 
Europe cannot rely solely on imports of U.S. LNG to offset the pipeline gas supply it will have lost from Russia when it starts rebuilding inventories after the end of this winter, according to BloombergNEF. 
So far this year, American LNG has been crucial in meeting demand in Europe, which is scrambling for gas supply and willing to pay up for spot deliveries, outbidding most of Asia.
The United States is shipping record volumes of LNG to Europe to help EU allies and nearly 70% of all American LNG exports were headed to Europe in September, according to Refinitiv Eikon data cited by Reuters.

Update: Europe Can’t Rely on US Gas to Plug Growing Shortfall Next Year (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: I am sure the EU is going to be able to get the natural gas that it needs this winter. But it is not going to be cheap, nor reliable. And the bigger problem will be next year, since Russian gas will  no longer be available to fill up their reserves unless purchased through middle-men like Turkey or China at exoborant prices. 
And that is the crux of the problem. 
Europe&#x27;s industrial base is dependent on having access to cheap natural gas. No more now.</span>

* Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, said Twitter will have to “fly by our rules” after Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of the company. 
* Tech companies will face greater pressure to remove illegal content under the EU’s incoming Digital Services Act. 
* Companies can be fined up to 6% of global annual revenues for violations of the rules, which are expected to come into force in 2024. 
A top European Union official had a warning for Elon Musk Friday about his $44 purchase of Twitter, telling the billionaire he will have to play by the rules. 
After a cryptic tweet from Musk suggesting he’d completed his acquisition of Twitter, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, warned Musk that he will have to comply with the bloc’s new digital regulations. 
“The bird is freed,” Musk tweeted. In response, Breton quote-tweeted Musk saying: “In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.”

The film, a joint Russian-Ukrainian production, was released in both countries on 2 April 2015, and its international premiere took place two weeks later at the Beijing International Film Festival. 
The movie revolves principally around the events of the siege of Odessa and the siege of Sevastopol of 1941-42.</span>

The package will include more ammunition for high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), 500 precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds, 2,000 155 mm rounds of remote anti-armor mine systems, more than 1,300 anti-armor systems, 125 Humvees, small arms and over 2.75 million rounds of small arms ammunition and four satellite communications antennas, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters.

   The Cradle: ‘US has no plans to withdraw from Syria or end sanctions’: Official  
Despite claiming its presence in Syria is solely to fight ISIS, US forces instead maintain regime change policies against Damascus and illegally loot the country’s oil  
The Coordinator of Strategic Communications for Washington’s National Security Council, John Kirby, said on 28 October that the US has no plans to either ease the Caesar Act sanctions against Syria or to withdraw its illegally occupying forces from the country. 
 The Caesar Act, passed by Congress in 2019, imposes harsh sanctions against Syria and targets any state, business, or individual involved with the Damascus government.  In an attempt to justify the US presence in Syria, Kirby said that “only a thousand American soldiers” were stationed there, whose mission he claimed was solely to combat ISIS.

Iran has been gripped by protests since the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, in the custody of the morality police last month, posing one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution.

Two car bombs have exploded at a busy junction in Somalia&#x27;s capital near key government offices, causing &#x27;scores of civilian casualties&#x27; including children, national police said. 
One hospital worker counted at least 30 bodies amid fears of possibly many more. 
The attack in Mogadishu occurred on a day when the president, prime minister and other senior officials were meeting to discuss expanded efforts to combat violent extremism, especially by the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabab group that often targets the capital.

Russia has announced it is suspending its involvement in the internationally-brokered deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its Black Sea ports. 
 It comes after Russia accused Ukraine of a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea. 
Ukraine has not admitted the attack and President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Russian move &quot;rather predictable&quot;. 
Without providing evidence, Russia also accused British troops of being involved in Saturday&#x27;s attack. 
It also accused the UK of blowing up gas pipelines last month.

   Warzone/The Drive: Ukraine Unleashes Mass Kamikaze Drone Boat Attack On Russia’s Black Sea Fleet Headquarters  
Russia says Ukrainian aerial drones and unmanned surface vessels targeted the home of its Black Sea Fleet, damaging at least a minesweeper.  
The largest city in Crimea and the home of Russia&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet woke up to heavy explosions and anti-aircraft fire during an attack Russian officials say included aerial drones and especially unmanned surface vessels (USV), both of which were &#x27;suicide&#x27; or &#x27;kamikaze&#x27; types mean to explode when they arrive at their targets. 
The Ukrainian Armed Forces have since released incredible footage purportedly from aboard several unmanned surface vessels used in the attack. The video shows the purported attack run on a guided missile frigate and Russian forces engaging the USVs with machine-gun fire.

                              <span>Reuters: Bolsonaro-Lula presidential race down to the wire in Brazil, polls show 
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil&#x27;s heated presidential race has tightened ahead of a Sunday vote, several opinion surveys showed on Saturday, with right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro eroding a slight advantage for leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in most polls. 
Surveys by pollsters Datafolha and Quaest both showed Lula with 52% of valid votes against 48% for Bolsonaro, down from a 6 percentage-point lead three days prior, putting the incumbent in striking distance of a come-from-behind victory. 
A survey by pollster MDA showed Lula&#x27;s edge slipping to just 2 percentage points, equal to the margin of error for the poll commissioned by transport sector lobby CNT.

   WNU Editor: Inflation that is over 30% and climbing. Interest rates at 21% and climbing. A economy that has imploded, coupled with the country now facing its worse energy crisis in its history .... sighhhh .... this is what is fueling these protests .... President says Moldova facing worst energy crisis in its history (BNE Intelligence). 
Kudos to Reuters for following these protests closely and reporting on why they are happening, and how large they are .... Thousands in new Moldova anti-government protest (Reuters). 
The Washington Post has a different analysis. Quoting Ukrainian intelligence sources they are labeling these protests as a Russian destabilization operation (see below):

For years, Republicans made Nancy Pelosi out to be a public enemy — the attack on her home is the result.
 Friday’s brutal attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, at their San Francisco home was overtly political — and a logical endpoint to the decades deeply personal villainization House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has weathered from her political opponents.
It’s now clear the speaker was the target of Friday’s attack. The assailant broke into the home looking for her, reportedly shouting, “Where is Nancy?” — echoing the chant insurrectionists called out when they breached the US Capitol on January 6 — and sayi…</span>

How the incumbent president might win — or lose — in Sunday’s runoff.
 The runoff presidential election in Brazil is close. Right now, the left-wing Workers’ Party (PT) candidate and former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — better known as Lula — remains ahead of the right-wing incumbent President Jaír Bolsonaro. 
But if the polls are wrong — and they were once already — the outcome of this election is still not a sure thing. 
One of the questions pollsters struggled with after the first round of voting earlier this month, where Bolsonaro outperformed predictions, is how to account for his supporters. T…</span>

The enormous stakes of this weekend’s presidential runoff in Brazil, explained.
 Brazilian voters on Sunday will decide which of two longtime political fixtures they want to return to the country’s top elected office: incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right strongman, or former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist who served for two terms from 2003 through 2010.

                              <span>Saturday is chore day for me. Also helping this afternoon an elderly Ukrainian couple move to a home that a Ukrainian-Canadian family have opened for them to stay with them for a few months. Charity work never ends. 
Blogging will return this evening.
Just some final thoughts. 

The timing of the Sevastopol attack only hours after the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the UK of being responsible for damaging the Nord Stream pipeline attacks is bothering me on every level. 
This war is clearly escalating to an entirely new level. 
On another note. 
The Western narrative is saying that Russia is losing the war and Putin is facing great opposition within Russia itself. But what I see on the ground is the opposite. A rush from the West to supply more money and weapons to Ukraine, more sanctions, massive electrical black-outs in Ukraine, and now numerous reports from Russia of direct Western involvement in the war on the ground.  
We are also seeing a growing protest movement against EU policy towards the war (link here), and link here.

   WNU Editor: I suspect US drones are flying in the region 24/7. But optics is everything, and this has all the looks of being a coordinated attack by Ukraine and NATO against the Russian fleet at Sevastopol. 
There are now reports (yet to be confirmed) that some Russian warships were damaged in the attack. 
 I am surprised that the tracker was not turned-off by this US drone.</span>

                              <span>BBC: &#x27;Massive&#x27; drone attack on Black Sea Fleet - Russia 
Ukraine has carried out a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, damaging one warship, Russia says.  Nine drones were used, a top official said. Ukraine has not commented. 
Without providing evidence, Russia accused British troops of being involved in that attack - and in blowing up gas pipelines last month. 
The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was &quot;peddling false claims of an epic scale.&quot;  Saturday&#x27;s attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by occupying Russians. 
Russia has replied by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country&#x27;s energy grid.

UK forces participated in an operation which damaged Europe&#x27;s energy security, Moscow claims   Units of the British Navy were involved in a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, which destroyed the key Nord Stream gas pipelines, the Russian Defence Ministry alleged on Saturday. 
Writing on its official Telegram channel, the ministry alleged that Royal Navy operatives “took part in planning, supporting and implementing” the plot to blow up the infrastructure in September. It did not provide any direct evidence to support its assertion.

                              <span>Yahoo News: As temperatures begin to fall, Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine&#x27;s vulnerable power grid 
KYIV — Large parts of the Ukrainian capital have been experiencing rolling blackouts in recent weeks, after increased Russian attacks over the past month that have destroyed an estimated 30% of Ukraine’s power and heating generation capacity. 
Kyiv has accused Russia, which continues to suffer a string of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield, of pursuing a determined strategy of targeting such facilities in order both to increase Ukrainian refugee flows into Europe and to freeze the population at home into submission.
Ukraine’s power stations and electricity distribution network have also been heavily bombed in the past few weeks. On Oct. 22, a thermal power station in Lutsk, in Ukraine’s northwest, was hit by three Russian cruise missiles, according to the city’s mayor, Ihor Polishchuk, leading to critical damage.

Breaking Defense:  Boeing defense racks up $2.8B in costs this quarter, with losses from KC-46 and new Air Force One  
“We’re not embarrassed by [the cost overruns]; they are what they are. And we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers,” said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.  
WASHINGTON — Boeing disclosed a whopping $2.8 billion loss on defense programs this quarter, led by significant cost overruns on the KC-46 tanker and new Air Force One, the company stated today. 
Losses were sustained on KC-46, T-7A Red Hawk trainer, the Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone, VC-25B — better known as Air Force One, when the president is onboard — and NASA’s Commercial Crew program, Boeing said in a news release. 
The overruns were “driven by higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs, as well as technical challenges” and “were also impacted by unfavorable performance on other programs,” Boeing said.

                              <span>Next Shark: Vladimir Putin declares Taiwan is &#x27;inherent part&#x27; of China, blames &#x27;granny&#x27; Nancy Pelosi for stoking tensions  
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated Taiwan is an inherent part of China and accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of provoking the Taiwan-China conflict on Thursday. 
At the 19th annual meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in Moscow, Putin was asked about his position on Taiwan. The Russian president responded, “Taiwan indubitably is an inherent part of the People’s Republic of China and this is the position we’ve always adhered to. 
It remains unchanged.”   “The provocative gestures, such as the visits to Taiwan by the U.S. highest dignitaries, are seen in Russia as nothing but a provocation. Why do that? Honestly, I cannot answer that,” the Russian president said.

SCMP: China brushes off US request to resume military dialogues 
* US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin had called for contacts to restart, after China cut off exchanges in retaliation for US House speaker&#x27;s visit to Taiwan in August 
* But US should &#x27;respect China&#x27;s interests and major concerns and remove the negative factors that impede the development of ties&#x27;, a military spokesman says 
The US needs to respect China&#x27;s interests and concerns if it is serious about reopening military communications, a Chinese military spokesman said on Thursday. 
Contact has been cut off since August, after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan over Beijing&#x27;s protests. Responding to US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin&#x27;s recent call for China to resume contact, Tan Kefei, a spokesman for China&#x27;s defence ministry, said that Washington bore all blame.

Businesslend: BASF to downsize &#x27;permanently&#x27; in Europe 
BASF has stated it should downsize “permanently” in Europe, with excessive power prices making the area more and more uncompetitive. 
The assertion from the world’s largest chemical substances group by income got here after it opened the primary a part of its new €10bn plastics engineering facility in China a month in the past, which it stated would help rising demand within the nation. 
“The European chemical market has been growing only weakly for about a decade [and] the significant increase in natural gas and power prices over the course of this year is putting pressure on chemical value chains,” chief govt Martin Brudermüller stated on Wednesday.

WNU Editor: BASF downsizing its operations in Europe and moving elsewhere is a shock. 
This company provides critical materials and supplies to numerous companies throughout Europe and is critical to the industrial base of Europe. If BASF closes down, these companies that employ hundreds of thousands will also be force to close. To say that this is a recipe for mass unemployment followed by mass unrest is an understatement.
To give you an indication of BASF&#x27;s size, its largest plant uses more natural gas than Switzerland .... The biggest corporate victim of Europe’s energy crisis may be a $93 billion chemical giant whose flagship plant uses as much gas as Switzerland (Fortune). 
In March President Biden and European leaders told everyone that sanctions will implode the Russian economy. It looks like the reverse is happening.</span>

EurAsian Times: Ukraine War: Russia’s ‘Indigenous &amp; Inexpensive’ UAVs Bring Ukrainian Counter Offensive To A Grinding Halt 
Since October 10, 2022, when Russia retaliated fiercely against the Ukrainian intelligence-masterminded terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge, world attention has been riveted on the Russian use of inexpensive Geran-2 drones. 
Russia has used the Iranian-designed drones, which reportedly cost under $20,000/- a pop, to effortlessly knock out 40% of Ukraine’s power generation infrastructure, despite Western-supplied MANPADS and AWACS support. 
Even as Ukraine and its Western curators are struggling to put together an effective counter to the Geran 2 drone, Russia has escalated its use of inexpensive drones, this time all along the frontline where Russian forces have brought the Ukrainian counteroffensive to a grinding halt, well before its stated aims could be realized.

WNU Editor: There are many reasons why Ukraine&#x27;s counter-offensives have stalled. Supply lines and lack of supplies/fortified Russian positions backed by more reinforcements and superior artillery fire/lack of trained manpower/etc.. But Russian drones have definitely had an impact, from detecting Ukraine military movements to knocking out a good portion of Ukraine&#x27;s electrical grid. 
I also see the Russian military copying the same drone tactics that Azerbaijan used in their last war with Armenia. Armenian forces were dug in and reinforced, but Azerbaijan&#x27;s drones made mincemeat out of them using Turkish-supplied drones, as well as knocking out Armenian reinforcements that were then sent in.</span>

   USA Today: Exclusive poll: Republican support rises ahead of Election Day, with inflation driving voters  
After SCOTUS reversed Roe v. Wade, some Democrats thought the issue would disrupt typical midterm factors like views of the economy. But the new poll shows many voters going back to basics. 
 * Voters overwhelmingly view the election as a way to send a message to the White House. 
 *  Biden&#x27;s upbeat reassurances on the economy aren&#x27;t breaking through with voters. 
 * Asked whether inflation or abortion mattered more to them, respondents chose inflation by 56%-40%. 
Republicans are resurgent as the midterm campaign heads into its final stretch, an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, amid angst about President Joe Biden&#x27;s leadership and the nation&#x27;s economy. 
As Americans feel the bite of inflation in their daily lives, from eating out less often to canceling vacations, voters overwhelmingly view the election as a way to send a message to the White House – and by double digits, that message is to change course.

Fox News featured a detailed and factual report on threats against election workers on Wednesday, but curiously omitted from the coverage was who precisely made these threats.

Shawn said election officials across the country were taking action that included “active marksmanship training” for election officials and bulletproof glass for election offices, due to “an increase in violent threats to their against”.

                              <span>In an interview with FRANCE 24, former Iranian television host Ehsan Karami says he has no desire to return to his homeland where the government continues its harsh crackdown on mass protests sparked by the death last month of Mahsa Amani. The 22-year-old woman died just days after she was arrested and beaten by Iran&#x27;s &quot;morality police&quot; for allegedly wearing an &quot;improper&quot; hijab. Outrage over her killing has led to protests worldwide – women chopped off their hair and many Muslim women burned their hijabs.

Karami, now living in California, says he is determined to use his voice to support the Iranian people who have been rising up in unprecedented numbers in defiance of Iran&#x27;s repressive regime.</span>

In the 1980s, the IDF declared their homeland a so-called “firing zone”, or a closed military zone, allowing it to remove people and destroy their homes. In early May, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a petition to reclassify the area, meaning residents continue to live in fear of being forced out.</span>

                              <span>Qatar&#x27;s hosting of the upcoming 2022 World Cup brought in thousands of migrant workers to build stadiums and other infrastructure.

But once in Qatar, they have often experienced exploitation: unpaid wages, confiscated passports and extreme working conditions that have led to several thousands of deaths, according to various NGOs. Some migrant workers agreed to speak to our reporters Chloé Domat and Rammohan Pateriya for this special full-length report. They explain how their Qatari dream has turned into a nightmare, even if Doha also offers some opportunities for upward social mobility.</span>
