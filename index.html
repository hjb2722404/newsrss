   WNU Editor: US Senator Ted Cruz wonders how then US Senator Biden was able to take documents out of a secure SCIF in the basement of the Capital (see tweet below). 
This says some of the docs are from his Senate service.
Serious Q: how on earth did he do that?
I’ve served in the Senate for 10 years. EVERY single classified doc I’ve read—100%—have been in a secure SCIF in the basement of the Capitol.
What the hell?? https://t.co/XXznYth2dA

Reuters: American lawmakers urge U.S. to ship Abrams tanks to Ukraine 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American lawmakers on Sunday pushed the U.S. government to export M1 Abrams main battle tanks to Ukraine, saying that even sending a symbolic number to Kyiv would be enough to push European allies to do the same. 
Michael McCaul, the newly installed Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; that &quot;just one&quot; Abrams tank would be enough to prompt allies, notably Germany, to unlock their own tank inventories for the fight against Russia. 
&quot;Even saying that we&#x27;re going to put Abrams tanks in would be enough,&quot; he said.

* The former top FBI agent for counterintelligence in New York has been charged with a former Soviet diplomat with violating U.S. sanctions on Russia by providing services to the oligarch Oleg Deripaska. 
* Charles McGonigal also was charged Monday in Washington in connection with accepting $225,000 in cash — while working at the FBI — from a former employee of a foreign intelligence service. 
* “Mr. McGonigal betrayed his solemn oath to the United States in exchange for personal gain and at the expense of our national security,” said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Donald Alway.

The Telegraph: Beard row as new Russian army chief orders all troops to shave 
The commander of Russia’s forces in Ukraine has ordered soldiers to cut their hair and shave, sparking a row with his bearded Chechen and mercenary allies. 
Chechnya’s leader Ramzan Kadyrov criticised the order as a deliberate “provocation” and said it was a distraction from the real business of fighting.  “Let’s just drop our guns and go and shave,” Mr Kadyrov said on his Telegram channel. “What kind of nonsense is this?” 
Western intelligence said that General Valery Gerasimov, appointed overall commander of Russia’s forces earlier in January by Vladimir Putin, was trying to promote more discipline in the Russian army.

EurAsian Times: Rival Or Copy Of NGAD? China’s Mysterious ‘Stealth Fighter’ Spotted On Screen That Looks Quite Similar To US 6th-Gen Design 
Once again, a very interesting image that points towards China developing a fixed-wing, sixth-generation fighter jet has gone viral on social media. 
Earlier this week, a mysterious stealth fighter was spotted on the computer screen at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). 
The photo was taken by an anonymous user and initially posted to the Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo with little to no additional details. 
From the look, the fighter-sized aircraft concept appears to be a tailless, twin-engine, flying wing design similar to the sixth-generation fighter concepts like the American NGAD or the British Tempest sixth-generation fighter jet. 
Even though the photo’s veracity could not be independently established, it is in line with the assumption and the evidence that suggests China is indeed focusing on a tailless configuration for its sixth-generation fighter jet.

The Guardian: German tank manufacturer’s warning puts pressure on Ukraine’s allies  
Defence firm dampens Kyiv hopes other European allies will follow UK’s lead in supplying heavy armour 
Battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024, the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has warned, increasing pressure on Nato allies to support Ukraine with armoured vehicles in active service instead, ahead of a key meeting this week. 
“Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 
Rheinmetall, which manufactures the battle vehicle’s gun, has 22 Leopard 2 and 88 older Leopard 1 tanks in its stocks. Getting the Leopard tanks ready for battle, however, would take several months and cost hundreds of millions of euros the company could not put up until the order was confirmed, Papperger said.

BBC: Al-Shabab: US air strike in Somalia &#x27;kills 30 militants&#x27; 
A US air strike assisting government troops in Somalia has killed about 30 Islamist al-Shabab militants, the US military says. 
The operation happened near the town of Galcad, about 260km (162 miles) northeast of the capital Mogadishu. 
Over the past few days, the Somali army and al-Shabab militants have fought for control of the town. 
Friday&#x27;s air strike came as the army was being attacked by more than 100 militants, the US Africa Command says. 
Earlier the Islamists killed seven soldiers after storming a military base in Galcad. Somalia&#x27;s Information Ministry said dozens of the militants were killed.

Along the front line, Ukrainian forces are wondering where Russia will strike next 
Exactly where and when Russia will launch its expected next offensive no one can be sure, but Ukrainian soldier Volodymyr Tereshchenko wants to ensure any Russian he confronts regrets it. 
Tereshchenko, a burly, bearded 50-year-old, is part of Ukraine&#x27;s northern defensive line, tasked with securing the marshy, forested terrain along the border with Belarus and — more to the point — preventing Russian forces from making another assault on the capital Kyiv and other Ukrainan cities. 
In the days after Russia&#x27;s invasion last February, troops attempted to take Chernihiv, about 50 kilometres from Tereshchenko&#x27;s position, with thousands of soldiers swarming through the area.

That with the exception of the battles in the Donbas much of what Russia has deployed and/or will deploy is to establish and force a frozen front/conflict that with time will exhaust the West. Either way the next two months are going to be critical on what direction this war is heading.</span>

The report on Monday was the first official mention of the participation by the Russian frigate Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov. 
The frigate is armed with Zircon missiles, which fly at nine times the speed of sound and have a range of more than 1,000km (620 miles). 
The missiles form the centrepiece of Russia’s hypersonic arsenal, along with the Avangard glide vehicle that entered combat duty in 2019. 
“‘Admiral Gorshkov’ … will go to the logistic support point in Syria’s Tartus, and then take part in joint naval exercises with the Chinese and South African navies,” TASS said in its report, citing an unidentified defence source.

ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s national grid suffered a major breakdown on Monday, the power ministry said, leaving millions of people without electricity for the second time in three months and highlighting the infrastructural weakness of this heavily indebted nation. 
Power Minister Khurrum Dastagir told Reuters the outage was caused by a large voltage surge in the south of the grid, which affected the entire network. 
Supplies were being partially restored from north to the south, he added, nearly six hours after factories, hospitals and schools reported outages. 
The grid should be fully functioning by 10 pm time (1700 GMT), Dastagir said, adding: “We are trying our utmost to achieve restoration before that.”

The Department of the Navy should use this time to validate the assumptions that underpin the existing program and, potentially, re-evaluate the acquisition.

Popular Mechanics: Project Mayhem, the Air Force&#x27;s Secret Hypersonic Bomber, Has Begun Cooking 
* Project Mayhem, the Air Force’s secret hypersonic bomber, would be an air-breathing Mach 10 replacement for the SR-71. 
* The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory recently awarded a $334 million contract to several engineering companies, including Draper, to oversee the designs, prototypes and tests of Project Mayhem. 
* At hypersonic speeds, heat makes building and testing hypersonic planes tricky business. 
The engineering of next-gen weapons and defense systems is a science built around speed. 
In 2018, Russia made headlines when President Vladimir Putin revealed the country’s hypersonic missile system, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal, in a sizzle reel video showing the missile blowing up Florida, of all places. Although the video wasn’t quite as sleek as a new iPhone reveal, the message was apocalyptically clear: the era of hypersonic weapons was here.

The Cradle: Kurdish delegation leaves Damascus on ‘positive’ note: Report 
The US has reportedly warned the SDF several times not to engage in any dialogue with Damascus 
A Kurdish delegation representing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) concluded a visit to Damascus on 20 January after meeting with several representatives of the Syrian government over the last few days, Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported. 
The delegation was headed by the foreign relations chief of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), Badran Jia Kurd, and arrived in the capital on 17 January. 
According to the report, the last few meetings did not result in anything significant, but the “prevailing impression” is that both sides are willing to continue along the path of dialogue, despite US warnings. 
“These are preliminary understandings between the two sides, on things such as Syrian territorial integrity, the national flag, and the presidency of Bashar al-Assad,” it states.

LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices rose by 1% on Monday to $88.50 a barrel, extending last week&#x27;s gains on the back of a stronger outlook due to an expected economic recovery in top oil importer China this year. 
Brent crude was up 88 cents, or 1%, to $88.51 at 1247 GMT, their highest since Nov. 18. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude rose 76 cents, or 0.93%, to $82.40 a barrel. Last week Brent rose 2.8%, while the U.S. benchmark logged a 1.8% gain.

Business Insider: The US is scrambling to find what experts say may be the &#x27;most important&#x27; hardware Ukraine needs to hold off Russia in 2023 
* Ukraine and Russia have relied heavily on artillery to batter each other&#x27;s forces. 
* Whether they can find more ammunition for that artillery will affect the course of the war in 2023. 
* To support Ukraine, the US and its allies are searching all over the world for the right shells. 
Amid indications that Russia is planning to resume offensive operations in spring 2023, Ukraine&#x27;s allies are scrambling to provide Ukraine with sufficient artillery ammunition. 
But this requires scouring the globe for munitions to feed Ukraine&#x27;s polyglot collection of Soviet-designed guns and the dizzying array of howitzers and rocket launchers supplied by various Western countries. 
&quot;Ammunition availability might be the single most important factor that determines the course of the war in 2023, and that will depend on foreign stockpiles and production,&quot; US defense experts Michael Kofman and Rob Lee wrote in December for the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

WNU Editor: In November, the Pentagon estimated that Russia was firing 20,000 shells a day, while Ukraine fired 4,000 to 7,000. But I am now reading/hearing that while Russia is continuing to fire 20,000 shells a day, Ukraine is firing around 1,400 shells. 
In this type of war you need artillery. If these reports are true, Ukraine&#x27;s military is going to be suffering horrific casualties in 2023.</span>

The military government of Burkina Faso has demanded the departure of French troops from the country, according to the government press agency Agence d’Information du Burkina (AIB). 
France has exactly one month to remove its troops from Burkina Faso, according to the terms of the 2018 agreement, AIB reported, citing sources. 
The military government “denounced last Wednesday, the agreement which has governed since 2018, the presence of the French Armed Forces on its territory,” AIB reported Saturday.

                              <span>Bloomberg: US Navy’s Newest Submarine Leaves Pentagon Baffled on When It Will Be Ready 
Officials overseeing development of the US Navy’s next-generation submarine to carry nuclear missiles don’t have the information they need to know whether the first vessel in the $132 billion Columbia program can deploy on time in 2031, an unreleased congressional audit found. 
Navy and Pentagon officials “have not obtained the schedule data and statistical information needed to confidently determine the likelihood that the shipbuilders can accomplish it as planned,” the Government Accountability Office said in the report, which was delivered in September but hasn’t been made public. 
The 12-ship Columbia class is set to replace the current fleet of 14 Ohio class ballistic-missile submarines. It’s envisioned as a key component of the US nuclear deterrence strategy into the late 21st century, complementing intercontinental ballistic missiles and air-launched weapons in the nation’s nuclear triad. 
The first ship is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost $15 billion in 2022 dollars, one of the costliest US weapons systems ever.

* China has passed the peak of Covid patients in fever clinics, emergency rooms and with critical conditions, a National Health Commission official said on Thursday. 
The possibility of a big Covid-19 rebound in China over the next two or three months is remote as 80% of people have been infected, a prominent government scientist said on Saturday. 
The mass movement of people during the ongoing Lunar New Year holiday period may spread the pandemic, boosting infections in some areas, but a second Covid wave is unlikely in the near term, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the Weibo social media platform.

EU Observer: Germany &#x27;shocks&#x27; allies by withholding Ukraine tanks 
Accusations of Russia appeasement have redoubled following Germany&#x27;s decision to continue withholding tanks from Ukraine. 
German defence minister Boris Pistorius defended Berlin&#x27;s decision following a Western arms-pledging meeting by 54 countries at the Rammstein military base in Germany on Friday (20 January). 
&quot;There was no unified opinion on this,&quot; he told press, referring to Kyiv&#x27;s call for Germany to deliver Leopard 2-class tanks to the battlefields of Ukraine. 
&quot;The impression that sometimes arises that there is a united coalition and Germany is standing in the way is wrong,&quot; he added. 
&quot;There are many allies who say: &#x27;We share the view you&#x27;ve set out here. There are good reasons for delivering [the Leopards] and good reasons against it&#x27;,&quot; Pistorius said.

Reuters: Colombia, ELN Rebels to Resume Peace Talks in Mexico in February 
CARACAS (Reuters) - Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group said on Saturday they will resume peace talks in Mexico next month, overcoming a recent impasse after the government recently declared and then called off a bilateral ceasefire. 
There was a first cycle of talks last year in Caracas to end the guerrillas&#x27; part in nearly six decades of war.  The about-face on the ceasefire came after ELN said it had not agreed to it. The government blamed a misunderstanding of the ELN&#x27;s position. 
Both sides held an emergency meeting in Caracas this week and agreed to hold the second round of negotiations on Feb. 13 in Mexico, one of the guarantor nations for the talks along with Norway, Venezuela, Cuba and Chile.

A multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract has been awarded by the US Department of Defense to IAI to develop and deliver the new hybrid electro-optically-guided missile 
IAI has unveiled its POINT BLANK electro-optically guided missile, that can be carried in a soldier’s backpack. The system answers the battlefield requirement to provide tactical units ranging in size from small tactical teams to battalion level, with an independent and organic capability to increase their lethality. 
POINT BLANK allows these units to attack a variety of targets in real time with great precision and high lethality, without the need for support. The missile is hand-launched, operated by a single soldier, and can take off from and land vertically back to, the soldier’s hand.

A US RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV (tail number 10-2045) was reportedly spotted in the Black Sea, south of Crimea, for reconnaissance, data from a live flight tracking website confirmed. 
Russian observers have long claimed that the reconnaissance drone is often used for collecting targeting data for Ukrainian UAV strikes in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014 and subsequently voted to be with the country in a referendum the same year. 
Most importantly, the drone’s US operators aim to study Russian air defense processes, including the reaction time, the frequencies of the radars, and their location with the UAV’s help, Russian defense observers have claimed.

President Maia Sandu tells POLITICO a ‘serious discussion’ is taking place about locking into a broader military alliance. 
DAVOS, Switzerland — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is prompting soul-searching in neighboring Moldova about whether the country needs to shift away from its constitutionally-enshrined neutrality and lock itself into a “larger alliance.” 
When asked about potential NATO accession, Moldova’s President Maia Sandu said in an interview with POLITICO the country was still weighing its next step, and whether it would require a constitutional change to do so. 
“Now, there is a serious discussion … about our capacity to defend ourselves, whether we can do it ourselves, or whether we should be part of a larger alliance,” she said. “And if we come, at some point, to the conclusion as a nation that we need to change neutrality, this should happen through a democratic process.”

                              <span>Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - Russian Army Activates Southern Front 
The long expected Russian offensive in Ukraine has begun. 
The Ukrainian army, egged on by its U.S. controllers, had put most of its resource into the static defense of the Bakhmut (Artyomovsk) - Soledar sector of the eastern front. An insane number of Ukrainian brigades, though many partially depleted, were concentrated on that 50 kilometer long front. This left other sectors nearly empty of Ukrainian troops.       
I count the equivalent of some 27 brigade size formations in that area. The usual size of a brigade is some 3,000 to 4,000 men with hundreds of all kinds of vehicles. If all brigades had their full strength that force would count as 97,500 men. In a recent interview the Ukrainian military commander Zaluzhny said that his army has 200,000 men trained to fight with 500,000 more having other functions or currently being trained. The forces which are currently getting mauled in the Bakhmut area constitute 50% of Ukraine&#x27;s battle ready forces. 
On the southern and northern sectors of the battle-line the Ukrainian forces have been thinned out and are only able to defend against minor forces.

Daily Mail: US intelligence claims Russia has suffered a staggering 188,000 casualties in Ukraine and lost more than 2,000 tanks since Putin&#x27;s bloody invasion began less than a year ago 
* Ukraine is bracing for a three-pronged attack from Russia within weeks 
* This is a significant increase to the estimated figure of 100,000 soldiers 
* Russia last week took Soledar, a mining town in the Donbas, in a bitter campaign 
American intelligence sources have claimed Russian casualties in Ukraine have reached a staggering 188,000 as Vladimir Putin&#x27;s bloody invasion continues to backfire. 
The figure is a significant increase to the estimation of 100,000 Russian soldiers who were wounded, deserted and killed when outlined by UK’s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace at the end of 2022. 
It is also thought that the Ukrainians have captured or destroyed approximately 2,000 Russian tanks since the invasion, which happened less than a year ago.

The massive losses the Ukrainian army is incurring against Russia in Bakhmut has alarmed Germany’s foreign intelligence service (BND), according to the German newspaper Der Spiegel. 
For months, the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has been the site of fierce conflict. The fighting has intensified recently, but Ukraine claims its forces are holding out against the Russians, who recently said they had taken control of the nearby salt mining town of Soledar. 
In a closed-door meeting this week, the BND informed the members of the Bundestag (German federal parliament) that the Ukrainian army is currently losing a “three-digit number of soldiers” daily in combat with the Russian invaders. 
“The Ukrainians are currently suffering huge losses near Bakhmut. The BND briefing informs about “three-digit numbers of casualties per day,” the report said.

Bloomberg: Germany Allows Ukraine ‘Preparatory’ Training on Leopard Tanks 
Germany hasn’t made a decision to allow the sending of Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, but will allow other countries to train Ukrainian soldiers on the vehicles.
“Germany won’t stand in the way if other states act like us, especially with regard to the possible preparatory training on these tanks,” new defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said Friday after a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at the US airbase in Ramstein. 
The step to allow training doesn’t “pre-conclude” any possible decision on provision of the German-made tanks, Pistorius said. 
“But we are preparing ourselves for every possible case.”  At the same time, he stressed that a request by some countries to send Leopards to Ukraine wasn’t discussed at the Ramstein meeting.

🇩🇪🇺🇦💥🇷🇺
The Bundeswehr is actually naked! We are expected to have a severe shortage of weapons by 2025 due to the energy crisis. It is simply unprofitable for factories to sell weapons at the same prices!
What kind of delivery of tanks to another country can we even talk about? pic.twitter.com/QsSpNurG9q

                              <span>First Post: Stryker combat vehicles, Patriot missiles, Challenger 2 tanks and more: A breakdown of military aid promised to Ukraine 
It’s almost a year since the Russia-Ukraine war began and Kyiv has been provided with military equipment by more than 30 countries. The US has announced a new package that includes armoured vehicles such as the Stryker and Bradley, and others too have also made valuable contributions 
It’s Day 331 of the Russia-Ukraine war (yes, it started back in February 2022) and the United States on Friday announced a military package valued at $2.5 billion for Kyiv. The military aid includes 90 Stryker combat vehicles and an additional 59 Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine, in addition to hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, the Pentagon said. 
Interestingly, the aid has been announced just hours before a critical meeting will be held at the Ramstein military base in Germany this evening to discuss the next steps in the defence of Ukraine and ways to fend off Russian aggression.

 * Middle-ranking powers such as India and Turkey have not taken sides in Ukraine 
* Battles elsewhere will not remain frozen just because America is preoccupied 
All eyes are on the borderlands of Russia and Ukraine. All Western eyes, that is.  And understandably so. The consequences of the Russian invasion have been huge, not least when it comes to energy prices. 
If the West is preoccupied, however, that doesn’t mean the rest of the world has ground to a halt. 
Life hasn’t stopped just because NATO and Moscow are locked in conflict.  Other countries have their own problems to face – pressing ones. And it should be no surprise that a range of middle-ranking powers, including India, Turkey and South Africa have refused to take sides. 
The vicious civil war in the Yemen, the fighting in the Horn of Africa, the perpetual conflicts in the Middle East – all these are continuing, even if the Western media has turned its gaze elsewhere. 
These battles will not remain frozen just because America is preoccupied. And it is a mistake to ignore them because the various outcomes will help shape the future for all of us.

CNN: Taiwan to allow women into military reserve force training as China fears grow 
Hong Kong CNN  — Taiwan’s military on Tuesday rolled out plans to allow women to volunteer for reserve force training for the first time, as China continues to ramp up military pressure on the democratic self-ruled island. 
The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said it will allow 220 discharged female soldiers to enroll in the training starting from the second quarter of this year. 
Maj. Gen. Yu Wen-cheng, from the ministry’s All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency, said the move would be on a trial basis for this year.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry has previously said it only trained male reservists because it did not have sufficient capacity to accommodate both sexes.

WASHINGTON — Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff who has steered President Biden’s administration through two years of triumphs and setbacks, is expected to step down in coming weeks in the most significant changing of the guard since Mr. Biden took office two years ago. 
Mr. Klain has been telling colleagues privately since the November midterm elections that after a grueling, nonstop stretch at Mr. Biden’s side going back to the 2020 campaign, he is ready to move on, according to senior administration officials, and a search for a replacement has been underway. 
The officials, who discussed internal matters on condition of anonymity, would not say whether a successor has already been picked…</span>

In 2009, Miss California, Carrie Prejean, gained national attention for her response to a question by a gay blogger at the Miss USA Pageant about same-sex marriage.
What followed were repeated efforts to capitalize on her anti-LGBTQ fame, including a short stint as a spokesperson for NOM, the National Organization For Marriage, an anti-LGBTQ organization that aggressively attempted to prevent same-sex couples from gaining the legal right to marriage.

                              <span>The streets of France filled with outraged workers on Thursday as rail employees, teachers, and others walked off the job to protest President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s deeply unpopular plan to overhaul the nation&#x27;s pension system by raising the official retirement age from 62 to 64.
The union-led demonstrations—which ground significant portions of the country, including many schools and transportation systems, to a halt—come as Macron is attempting to steamroll far-reaching opposition to his pension overhaul, declaring that &quot;we must work longer.&quot;
Macron&#x27;s government formally presented its draft law last week, the first step in the process of enacting a reform that would force French citizens to work longer to qualify for a full pension.

The islander had the word &quot;help&quot; carved on the hull of the boat when he was found 120 nautical miles northwest of Puerto Bolivar in the northern department of La Guajira.

The Dutch National Archive unveiled the hand-drawn map in early January, featuring a tell-tale red &#x27;X&#x27; believed to mark the spot where German soldiers stashed their hoard.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thursday&#x27;s shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world&#x27;s youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the punishing demands faced by women in power.
Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old politician said she had next to nothing left &quot;in the tank&quot; and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office.
&quot;Politicians are human,&quot; she said. &quot;We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it&#x27;s time. And for me, it&#x27;s time.&quot;
But the remarks that followed were more revealing, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand&#x27;s University of Canterbury.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday made a shock announcement she had &quot;no more in the tank&quot; to continue leading the country and would step down no later than early February and not seek re-election.
Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside.
&quot;This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term - because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that,&quot; Ardern, 42, told a news conference.

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Messina Denaro, a brutal Sicilian Mafia boss who was Italy&#x27;s most wanted criminal before his capture on Monday, had been on the run for 30 years. Here are some key facts about his arrest and what it means:
WHY IS THE ARREST SO IMPORTANT?
Messina Denaro, 60, was the last runaway member of a generation of mobsters who masterminded a string of bombings and murders that terrorised Italy in the early 1990s.
His arrest finally brings closure to that dark era, shatters a symbol of resistance to the Italian state and could reveal Mafia secrets in the unlikely event that Messina Denaro agrees to talk to investigators.
He was involved in dozens of killings, including of top prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the adolescent son of a Mafia…</span>

Anatoly Legkodymov, 40, a Russian living in Shenzhen, China, appeared in handcuffs and leg shackles in a Miami courtroom on money laundering charges, and was denied bail by a judge who deemed him a flight risk.

Washington (AFP) - The United States is not currently prepared to provide advanced Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said Wednesday, citing difficulties in maintenance and training.
Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for modern Western tanks to help battle Russia&#x27;s invasion, and Germany has reportedly linked its decision on whether to do so to Washington&#x27;s willingness to provide Abrams.
&quot;I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet,&quot; US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told journalists when asked about providing Abrams to Ukraine, though he did not completely close the door on a shift in the future.

&quot;I am very happy to pay more taxes, I want my government to tax me and tax people like me,&quot; White said.

                              <span>A human rights organization founded by slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi is calling on Congress and the Justice Department to investigate former President Donald Trump&#x27;s business deals with a controversial golf company owned by the Saudi Arabian government and controlled by Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. 
Nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now said LIV Golf, a tournament franchise and PGA Golf rival, paid Trump-owned golf resorts &quot;unknown millions of dollars&quot; to host events. Recent court proceedings revealed that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund -- chaired by bin Salman -- owns 93% of LIV Golf, and pays &quot;100 percent of the costs associated with the events.&quot;

                              <span>Brazil&#x27;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.
Just days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.
He ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was &quot;convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors.&quot;
In a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil&#x27;s presidents live.
Leftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.
As he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.

The president said last week that any &quot;radical bolsonarista&quot; found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.
&quot;How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?&quot; asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.
Bolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula&#x27;s inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.
He has denied any link to the riots.
In a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed &quot;regret&quot; over the events, which he described as &quot;unbelievable&quot;.

&quot;Under the proposals, same-sex couples would still not be able to get married in a Church of England church,&quot; the church said in a statement.
They can instead &quot;come to church to give thanks for their civil marriage or civil partnership and receive God&#x27;s blessing,&quot; it added.
Bishops met on Tuesday to finalize recommendations, which will affirm the church&#x27;s teaching that Holy Matrimony exists between one man and one woman for life.

                              <span>Notorious drug lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman has appealed to Mexico&#x27;s president for help due to alleged &quot;psychological torment&quot; he is suffering in a US prison, his lawyer said Tuesday.
&quot;In the six years that Joaquin has been in the United States, he has not seen the sun,&quot; said Jose Refugio Rodriguez, a Mexico-based legal representative of the Sinaloa cartel founder.
The message, described as &quot;an SOS,&quot; was transmitted via one of Guzman&#x27;s lawyers in the United States as well as his family, Rodriguez said.
Guzman is only allowed outside three times a week to a small area where he &quot;doesn&#x27;t get the sun,&quot; and has fewer visits or phone calls than other inmates, the lawyer said in an interview with Radio Formula.
&quot;He is suffering psychological torment,&quot; he said, adding that the lack of sunshine was also bad for the convicted drug trafficker&#x27;s physical health.
Guzman wants President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address alleged procedural violations during his extradition in 2017 under the former government, Rodriguez added.
The Mexican embassy in Washington confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that it received an email from Rodríguez on January 10. 
Without referring to the content of the email, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard downplayed the chance of any government intercession in favor of the notorious drug trafficker. 
&quot;He is serving a sentence there, he has a sentence,&quot; he told journalists. &quot;So, frankly I don&#x27;t see any possibilities for him, but I&#x27;m going to review it with the prosecutor&#x27;s office.&quot; 
El Chapo is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in 2019 of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.
One of his sons, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested by Mexican security forces this month in an operation that left 29 people dead and sparked a dramatic shootout at an airport in the city of Culiacan.

Brovary (Ukraine) (AFP) - Eighteen people, including Ukraine´s interior minister and three children, were killed in a helicopter crash near a kindergarten outside Kyiv on Wednesday.
The helicopter slammed down next to the kindergarten and a residential building in Brovary, a commuter town for the capital Kyiv that was the scene of fierce fighting early in Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
Amateur footage circulating on social media showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the aircraft mixed with debris from nearby buildings and a car crushed by large shards of metal. Cries could be heard at the scene which was consumed by a fire.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When dozens of defense ministers meet at an airbase in Germany on Friday, all eyes will be set on what Berlin is - and is not - willing to provide Ukraine.
Defense leaders from roughly 50 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will confer at Ramstein Air Base, the latest in a series of meetings since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago.
The focus is expected to be not on what the United States will provide, but on whether Germany will send its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve their transfer from third countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Katherine Swidan, whose son Mark has been imprisoned in China for over 10 years, has not seen even a photograph of him over the last decade. The last time she heard his voice was in 2018.
She and the families of other Americans, who according to the U.S. government are wrongfully held in China, are hoping that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken can push the Chinese authorities for the release of their loved ones as he visits Beijing next month.
&quot;My message for Blinken is: say their names,&quot; said Katherine Swidan in a phone interview from her home in Luling, Texas. &quot;They&#x27;re American citizens. They&#x27;ve been wrongfully detained. Enough is enough.&quot;

Thunberg has been in Germany for several days to support protests against the demolition of Luetzerath, which have become a symbol of resistance against fossil fuels.
Images showed the activist, dressed in black, being picked up by police officers wearing helmets and then escorted to a waiting bus.
A police spokeswoman said a group of activists were in custody after having &quot;broken away from the demonstration&quot;, and run towards the edge of an open pit.
Officials were working to identify the protesters in custody, and a decision would be made later about what further action to take, she said.

                              <span>France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.
The suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.
The industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France&#x27;s unions are united.
&quot;It&#x27;ll be a hellish Thursday,&quot; Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.
Paris public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.
Services would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.
Elsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.
Most slow trains between cities would be halted.
Up to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.
Opinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.
The 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.

And the decline is set to continue as factors including rising living costs, more women entering the workforce and having children later mean people in some countries are having fewer babies.
China&#x27;s population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, official data showed Tuesday, and it is expected to be overtaken by India this year as the most populous nation.
Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to UN figures published last July which forecast how the world&#x27;s population will develop between now and 2100.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.
Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum &quot;for having had &#x27;le palle&#x27; (the balls) to invite me tonight&quot;, according to Deadline and Variety reports.
The museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as &quot;unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation&quot;.
Its &quot;Stella della Mole&quot; award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film &quot;American Beauty&quot; and drama series &quot;House of Cards&quot; -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.
Spacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
His stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.
The actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.
Last summer he appeared at London&#x27;s Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.
Now on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, &quot;deepfake&quot; video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.
Cave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.
The chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.
The Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave&#x27;s website, asked the tool to produce a song &quot;in the style of Nick Cave&quot;.
One of the AI-created verses runs: &quot;I&#x27;m the king of the abyss, I&#x27;m the ruler of the dark / I&#x27;m the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark.&quot;
&quot;This song sucks,&quot; wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT&#x27;s work &quot;replication as travesty&quot;.
He followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn&#x27;t, describing the process of writing as &quot;an act of self-murder&quot;.
&quot;Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don&#x27;t feel,&quot; he wrote.
He added: &quot;Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit.&quot;
Cave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- &quot;I&#x27;ve got the fire of hell in my eyes.&quot;
