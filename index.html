                              <span>Former US president Donald Trump is calling for the affidavit justifying the raid of his Mar-a-Lago home to be made public.

However, Department of Justice prosecutors say the document must remain sealed as it contains “highly sensitive” information with the potential to impact national security. 

A federal judge will hold a hearing later this week, allowing the lawyers to develop a proper rationale in defence of their argument as reports indicate the attorney general responsible for the approval of the raid spent weeks deliberating over the decision. 

“You can release parts of this affidavit, it has happened before, but more importantly, you can respond to these concerns, you can answer the questions,” Constitutional Law Attorney Jonathan Turley said.</span>

                              <span>Bad Bunny reclaims No. 1 on the Billboard album chart by the slimmest of margins this week, as the Puerto Rican superstar’s three-month-old album “Un Verano Sin Ti” recorded its eighth time at the top, beating the last release of the prolific Louisiana rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again by only 400 copies.
‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, a consistent streaming hit since its release 14 weeks ago, is credited with the equivalent of 108,800 sales in the US, while YoungBoy’s ‘The Last Slimeto’ had 108,400. according to Luminate tracking service.
Looking Under the Hood shows slight differences in the performance of the two albums over the past week.  “Un Verano” had 143 million streams, which Luminate and Billboard attribute to the equivalent of just over 102,000 sales.  “The Last Slimeto,” on the other hand, took significantly more streams — 163 million — to earn just 1,000 more equivalent sales.


Billboard gives more weight to streams from paying subscribers than non-paying ones.  The tea leaves data suggests that YoungBoy may have performed particularly well on services with free tiers like Spotify and YouTube, where YoungBoy has been a huge attraction for years.


Even so, the deciding factor in winning No. 1 was the number of copies sold in a complete package.  Last week, the CD version of “Un Verano” became widely available, so the album sold 6,000 copies, while “The Last Slimeto” only sold 4,600.
“Rebirth” by Beyoncé best seller last week, falling two places to No. 3 in its second week, with the equivalent of 89,000 sales, a drop of 73%.  Beyoncé’s single “Break My Soul” topped the Hot 100 chart, thanks to a “Queens Remix” which incorporates Madonna’s 1990 hit “Vogue” and features Beyoncé tweaking her predecessor’s song screams to include black musicians such as Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Aaliyah and Lizzo.

                              <span>At some point, did your relationship with the role turn into a sense of belonging?
Yes.  mike is mine.  Mike is mine.  I caught myself choking almost for a moment when you asked that.  And I think the honest thing to say is if I really think about it, maybe Mike changed Johnny too.
I think Jonathan Banks, playing Mike, became a little quieter, a little less rambunctious.  And by silence, I mean, I think I’m listening a little more than 12, 13 years ago.  I don’t like to use the word witness, but that’s what comes to mind.  I think it may have affected me in that I’m a bit more patient.  Maybe it comes with age anyway.
Was there ever a time when you had a script and thought, “Mike wouldn’t do that”?
There were times when I was like, “Oh, I don’t think Mike would do that.”  But I found, quite honestly, often that what the writers told me, if I relied on them, made sense.
The first thing that comes to mind is in “Breaking Bad” when Mike left his granddaughter in the park and had to escape.  And I was like, ‘No, Mikey would never leave his granddaughter.  And of course the reasoning is that the police department – ​​they’re right there in the park.  They will take care of her, they will return her to her mother.  I still have trouble with Mike leaving his granddaughter in the park.
There’s a scene in “Better Call Saul” last season where Mike reads “The Little Prince” to his granddaughter, Kaylee.  It is a passage where the little prince says: “My flower is ephemeral, and it has only four thorns to defend itself against the world.  What do you think this scene means for Mike?

                              <span>Self-driving car services are popping up across the country.  But they are not what they seem.
The latest example is an improved service in Las Vegas from ride-sharing company Lyft.
On Tuesday, the company said it would allow users to hail a new type of self-driving car on and around the Las Vegas Strip, building on a similar service it has offered in the city for four years.  But the news comes with an important caveat: These vehicles will come with two of what the industry calls safety drivers, who will take control of the car if something goes wrong.
The technology and automotive industries spent much of the last decade promising cars that would drive the streets on their own.  But many years, perhaps even decades, will pass before truly autonomous vehicles are commonplace.  Although la…</span>

                              <span>Russian media channel share the route of RAF RC-135W plane, reportedly intercepted over the Barents Sea
Daily Mail: Russian MIG-31 fighter jet carried out an &#x27;unsafe close pass&#x27; of an RAF spy plane while it was in international airspace over Norwegian and Barents Seas, MoD reveals after Moscow claimed British aircraft crossed its state border 
* Moscow said it &#x27;intercepted&#x27; a British RC-135 spyplane over the Barents sea 
* A leading pro-Putin politician demanded a &#x27;harsh&#x27; response from the Kremlin 
* MoD refuted the claim, arguing the spyplane did not breach Russia&#x27;s airspace 
* The plane maintained constant contact with Russian civilian air traffic control     * An MoD spokesperson said a Russian MiG-31 jet made an &#x27;unsafe close pass&#x27; of the RAF aircraft to force it away 
A Russian MiG-31 fighter jet made an &#x27;unsafe close pass&#x27; of an RAF spy plane yesterday, Britain&#x27;s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said, after Moscow claimed the plane had infringed on its airspace. 
The RAF spyplane was flying over the Norwegian and Barents seas on Monday on a flight path which took it close to Russian territory, but at no point did the British aircraft enter Russian sovereign airspace. 
The MoD said the RC-135 spy plane&#x27;s crew maintained radio communications with Russian civilian air traffic control throughout its flight.

The alleged move has prompted the head of recruitment for the Royal Air Force (RAF) - herself a senior female officer - to resign in recent days in protest. 
The head of RAF recruitment has resigned in protest at an &quot;effective pause&quot; on offering jobs to white male recruits in favour of women and ethnic minorities, defence sources have claimed. 
The senior female officer apparently handed in her notice in recent days amid concerns that any such restrictions on hiring, however temporary and limited, could undermine the fighting strength of the Royal Air Force (RAF), the sources said.

  “The likelihood of a severe US housing downturn has increased;  however, our rating scenario calls for a more moderate pullback that includes a mid-single-digit decline in real estate activity in 2023 and further pressure in 2024,” Fitch analysts said in a statement tuesday.

He sits high in the cabin on his father’s lap, moving the digger’s huge boom arm to scoop up dirt and dump it.
This was the founding ideal of Diggerland: For families, to experience the pleasure of using real construction machines.


The park was opened in 2014 by Ilya and Yan Girlya, Moldovan American brothers who worked for their father’s construction company and opened Sahara Sam’s Oasis indoor and outdoor water park in the 2000s in land adjoining this which became Diggerland.

                              <span>Pete Carril, who coached basketball at Princeton for 29 years and scared off big-name opponents with his undersized and often underqualified colleges playing an old-fashioned textbook game, died Monday.  He was 92 years old.
His family announces the death in a report published on the Princeton Tigers website.  He did not say where he died or give the cause of death.
As the men’s head coach from 1967 to 1996, Carril (pronounced care-ILL) taught a thinking man’s basketball at Princeton.  As a member of the Ivy League, Princeton could not offer athletic scholarships and its academic standards were high, but Carril’s teams, almost invariably outmatched and outmatched, still won twice as often as they lost.

                              <span>MASON, Ohio — Serena Williams’ farewell tour is set to continue Tuesday at the Western &amp; Southern Open.
But for how long ?
The match – Williams against Great Britain’s Emma Raducanu in the first round – seems particularly well suited to the big occasion that is Williams’ extended farewell from professional tennis.
With 23 Grand Slam singles titles, she is unquestionably the greatest female tennis player of this era and one of the greatest athletes of all eras.  Raducanu, a 19-year-old cosmopolitan, shocked the world (and herself) by winning the US Open last year as a qualifier, and has the smarts and shots to be one of the game’s leaders if she can adjust to her new status and go back to hitting forehand winners and winning games by the peloton.

DeGrom.  Scherzer.
You can command them any way you want now that Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom are finally installed at the top of the Mets pitching rotation.  Each would be the No. 1 starter on almost every other team, and you don’t really get to choose team rotation order or projected pitching stats anyway;  most of the time, you choose the phraseology of an idea.  Or a fantasy.
From 2016 to 2019, the four National League Cy Young Awards have all gone to Scherzer (then a Washington National) or deGrom (so far a Met career).  From 2016 to 2019, only two NL pitchers have had more than 20 wins over substitution: Scherzer (27) and deGrom (24).  With Scherzer and deGrom paired up, it’s easy to imagine they’ll make an even bigger team.  How could they not?

But something unusual happened: the TV show didn’t get a commercial cut.
Instead, the camera trailed behind Díaz as he walked through the bullpen door, jogged, and crossed the grass of the outfield.  The trumpets of “Narco,” Díaz’s beloved entrance song, were piped directly from the stadium’s PA system to the broadcast, giving fans at home the feeling of watching it all happen in person.

To be asked to give reasons for personal decisions is to consider the possibility that such reasons exist.  Thomas Aquinas, another author of our program, calls the reason which is the point of orientation of all your other reasons your “final end”.  Those who discover they have such ultimate ends, and learn to value them, find their way out of the fun house of arbitrary decisions in which young people so often find themselves trapped.
For the number of final ends is not infinite.  Thomas Aquinas helpfully suggests that the ultimate objects of human desire can only be classified into eight enduring categories.  If we want to understand where we are going, we need to ask ourselves these questions: Am I interested in thi…</span>

Miners have sold nearly 30% of BTC’s record stash since May
The trip to $25,000 this month eased pressure on a struggling Bitcoin mining sector throughout 2022.
At one point, fears abounded that the cost of producing miners was much higher than the spot price of Bitcoin and that strong sales would result to keep miners in business.  Worse still, many of them may have to retire because their businesses are no longer financially viable.
Data from the period since May seemed to confirm that a major upheaval was underway.  As Arcane notes, only one public miner – Core Scientific – sold around 12,000 BTC during the May-July period.

They have brought their children and their dogs, and share a kitchen above the machines where they spend their days reviving a business that could have been destroyed by the war.
But Mr Mysyk, 23, and his workers, who came to Lviv from the bombed city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, benefited from a spirit of solidarity and a government policy to rescue  industries threatened by an invading Russian army and help bring them together, piece by piece, in towns along Ukraine’s western border.

On Monday I written about a video posted to Twitter that day by a verified account.  The video featured a mad merchant Alex Jones genuinely scold strangers in a fried chicken restaurant, like we do.
Alas, the video in question seems to be from 2019.
I regret posting the story, as I’m not one to try to pass off old content as new.  It doesn’t have to be because people are always coming up with new ways to be weird in front of the camera.
The video posted on Monday is 51 seconds long, but the extended cut above turns out to be, well, a cut above.

In a town like Amherst, where non-citizens make up more than 10% of the population, it stands to reason that immigrants who have not yet naturalized should be able to vote in local elections.
Before you ask, it’s perfectly constitutional to give non-citizens the right to vote, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld that.  In 1996, Congress banned noncitizens from voting in federal elections.  Some state constitutions explicitly tie voting in state elections to citizenship, while others do not.

Automakers are building new factories and scouring the world for raw materials.  And so many people resent the waiting lists for battery cars going on for months.
The electric vehicle revolution is almost here, but its arrival is being slowed by a fundamental problem: the chargers where people fill up these cars often break down.  A recent study found that about a quarter of public charging stations in the San Francisco Bay Area, where electric cars are commonplace, were not working.

It was parked in the yard of a house, and the explosion killed 10 people, including Zemari Ahmadi, 43, and seven children, according to his family.  The Pentagon claimed Ahmadi was an Islamic State enabler and his car was packed with explosives, posing an imminent threat to US troops guarding the evacuation at Kabul airport.  “Procedures were followed correctly, and it was a fair strike.”  What the military apparently did not know was that Ahmadi was a longtime aid worker, who colleagues and family members say spent the hours before his death running errands to the office and ended his day by stopping at his place.

   OilPrice.com: Heatwave Sends European Gas Prices Higher 
* Europe’s benchmark gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub increased by 2% to $215.50 per MWh on Monday. 
* Power demand is growing amid heatwave in most of Europe. 
* The low water levels on the Rhine have already affected coal supply and contributed to record-high year-ahead power prices in Germany. 
European benchmark gas prices rose by 2% early on Monday as demand is high in a heatwave and supplies of other fuels for power generation is constrained by low water levels on Europe’s main petroleum transport corridor. 
Europe’s benchmark gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub increased by 2% to $215.50 (211.35 euro) per megawatt-hour in the morning in Amsterdam, per Bloomberg’s estimates.

RT: Ukraine bombs nuclear waste storage site – official  
Rockets also targeted the cooling systems of the facility  
Ukrainian artillery has fired multiple rockets directly at the coolant systems and nuclear waste storage site inside the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in Energodar, local government administration member Vladimir Rogov told Russian media on Tuesday. 
He warned that a successful strike may result in a radiation release equivalent to a “dirty bomb.”  “One of the guided missiles hit just ten meters” from the barrels with spent nuclear fuel,” Rogov told Soloviev Live. “Others hit a bit farther away, 50 to 200 meters.” 
Since the storage site is out in the open, any hit will result in the release of nuclear waste ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilograms and contamination of the area, the official explained. “In plain language, that would be like a dirty bomb,” said Rogov.

SKY News: Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un exchange letters suggesting the pair form closer ties against &#x27;hostile military forces&#x27; 
Mr Kim&#x27;s letter said the &quot;strategic and tactical cooperation, support and solidarity&quot; between the two countries had reached a new level. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has written to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to suggest the two countries form closer ties. 
The letter from Mr Putin suggested the pair work to &quot;expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts&quot;, according to North Korea&#x27;s state media, KCNA. 
Delivered to Pyongyang on North Korea&#x27;s liberation day, it went on to say a union would help &quot;strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the Northeastern Asian region&quot;.

Politico: Xi Jinping’s Saudi trip seeks to exploit Riyadh-Washington tensions  
Saudi’s Chinese flirtation reflects a leverage bid with Biden administration. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon end more than two years of self-imposed in-person diplomatic isolation as he travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — a month after President Joe Biden’s strained visit to Jeddah. 
The Xi trip has not been confirmed, but an unnamed Saudi source said it may occur as early as this week. 
Xi can expect a full helping of Saudi diplomatic pomp and ceremony in contrast to Biden’s low-profile visit, punctuated by an awkward fist bump with MBS, as the Crown Prince is known. Instead of pesky questions about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, Xi will get a red-carpet welcome and likely respond with a full-throated affirmation of deepening Saudi-Chinese ties.

White House and Pentagon spokesmen keep insisting, as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl did on Aug. 14:  &quot;What’s important for us right now is to make sure that Beijing understands that our forces in the region will continue to operate, to fly, to sail wherever international waters allows. 
That includes the Taiwan Strait.  &quot;I think you should expect that we will continue to do Taiwan Strait transits, as we have in the past, in the coming weeks. …&quot;

Washington Post: Chinese military ship docks in Sri Lanka over Indian, U.S. objections 
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — A Chinese navy ship at the center of a diplomatic spat docked in a southern port in Sri Lanka on Tuesday, marking a small triumph for Beijing over India and the United States. 
The Yuan Wang 5 arrived before 8 a.m. on Tuesday and will stay for three days, according to the Hambantota International Port Group. 
The ship, which reportedly carried 2,000 sailors, was welcomed in a traditional Sri Lankan ceremony attended by Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhenhong and Sri Lankan lawmakers. 
Footage from the event showed the dignitaries sitting on a red carpet in front of the docked Chinese military vessel while its crew held a massive red banner along a deck that read: “Hello Sri Lanka, Long Live Sri Lanka — China Friendship.”

The last soldiers belonging to France&#x27;s Barkhane operation in Mali have now left the African country, the French chiefs of staff said on Monday. 
French forces have been supporting Mali against insurgents for nearly a decade, but President Emmanuel Macron decided to pull out after France and the Malian junta fell out in the wake of a military takeover in August 2020. 
&quot;Today at 13H00 Paris time (1100 GMT) the final contingent of the Barkhane force still on Malian territory crossed the border between Mali and Niger,&quot; the statement said.

                              <span>BBC: Kenya election 2022: Raila Odinga rejects William Ruto&#x27;s victory 
Raila Odinga has rejected the results of Kenya&#x27;s presidential election saying that the figures announced on Monday were &quot;null and void&quot;. 
According to the official results, Mr Odinga narrowly lost to Deputy President William Ruto.  Mr Odinga accused the head of the electoral body of a &quot;blatant disregard of the constitution&quot;. 
&quot;We totally without reservation reject the presidential election results,&quot; he said. 
Making his remarks in front of supporters in the capital, Nairobi, he said that there was &quot;neither a legally elected winner nor a president-elect&quot;. 
The 77-year-old long-time opposition leader was running for president for the fifth time. 
He has challenged the results in the previous two elections, including successfully in 2017. 
This time round, the chairman of the electoral body Wafula Chebukat said he got 48.8% of the vote in last Tuesday&#x27;s election compared to Mr Ruto&#x27;s 50.5%.

American Greatness: It’s Inevitable: Trump Will Be Indicted  
Americans should prepare for the spectacle of Donald Trump pleading not guilty to charges brought by the Biden Justice Department. 
A few days after federal agents stormed Donald Trump’s castle in Palm Beach last week, Judge Beryl Howell berated a man from Georgia for his involvement in the Capitol protest on January 6, 2021. 
“Listening without question to political rhetoric that leads to serious offenses, criminal conduct, is not an excuse when you’re standing in a court of law,” Howell told Glen Simon, a Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct on restricted grounds. “You’ve got to use your common sense and your own sense of who you are and how you’d like to conduct yourself as an American citizen before just blindly doing what a political figure says.” 
Howell then sentenced Simon to eight months in prison.  The “political figure” to whom the judge was referring is President Trump. And Howell is not just any judge; she is the chief judge of the D.C. District Court that is overseeing at least 850 criminal cases related to the Capitol protest.

* It comes after the DOJ on Monday opposed requests to unseal the affidavit used to justify last week&#x27;s search 
* Meanwhile Trump&#x27;s spokesman shared an email appearing to admit the bureau did seize his three passports 
Donald Trump furiously called for the immediate release of the &#x27;completely unredacted&#x27; affidavit that sanctioned the FBI raid on his Florida mansion late Monday night. 
The former president said it was &#x27;in the interest of transparency&#x27; the document be made public following the &#x27;horrible and shocking break-in&#x27; at Mar-a-Lago last week. 
He also slammed the &#x27;very large number of gun toting FBI agents&#x27; who entered his home and, in his Truth Social post, demanded the judge who authorized the search warrant recuse himself.

   American Miliatry News: FBI barricades headquarters in DC 
Authorities erected barricades around the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) headquarters office in Washington, D.C. over the weekend. The bureau claims it has seen an increase in threats against the FBI and its agents in the wake of the FBI’s raid on former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home last week.   Associated Press reporter Mike Balsamo tweeted photos of the new barricades around the FBI headquarters. 
“With an increasing number of threats against the FBI and agents, including an armed man who tried to breach a field office in Ohio, officials have put up barricades around FBI headquarters in DC. Similar fencing was put up after the unrest in DC in 2020 &amp; after the Capitol riot,” he wrote.

                              <span>Polish firefighters said Tuesday they had recovered 100 tons of dead fish from the Oder river running through Germany and Poland, deepening concerns of an environmental disaster.
&quot;We&#x27;d never had an operation of this scope on a river before,&quot; said Monika Nowakowska-Drynda from the national firefighter press office.
She confirmed that around 100 tonnes (220,500 pounds) of dead fish had been recovered since Friday.
The cause of death is uncertain, though officials believe the fish are likely to have been poisoned.
&quot;Probably enormous quantities of chemical waste was dumped into the river in full knowledge of the risk and consequences,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said last week.
Water samples have been sent to laboratories in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Britain in the hopes of finding the cause.
The first reports of mass fish deaths were made by Polish locals and anglers as early as July 28.
German officials have accused Polish authorities of failing to inform them about the deaths, and were taken by surprise when the wave of lifeless fish came floating into view.
In Poland, the government has also come under heavy criticism for failing to take swift action.
The Oder has over the last years been known as a relatively clean river, and 40 domestic species of fish are found in the waterway.
But now, dead fish -- some reaching up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) -- can be seen across the river.
Nowakowska-Drynda said more than 500 firefighters have been recovering the dead fish in Poland with the help of dams, boats, quad bikes and even a drone.

But the August 9 elections marked a breakthrough for female politicians.

The reservoirs of the Tibetan Plateau, which covers much of southern China and northern India, are fed by monsoons and currently supply most of the water demand for nearly two billion people.
But the plateau&#x27;s complex terrain has made it difficult for scientists to predict how warming temperatures and altered weather patterns linked to climate change will affect the region&#x27;s water stores.

                              <span>By Roger Tung
TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan accused China of exaggeration and &quot;tricks&quot; on Tuesday after the Chinese military published footage of the strategically located Penghu islands where there is a major Taiwanese air base.
China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has carried out military exercises around the island this month after a visit by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was followed by five U.S. lawmakers on Sunday and Monday.
The Chinese military unit responsible for the area adjacent to Taiwan, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s Eastern Theatre Command, released on Monday video of the Penghu islands, apparently taken by a Chinese air force aircraft close by.
Taiwan Air Force Vice Chief of Staff for Operations Tung Pei-lun told reporters in Taipei that this was Chinese information warfare, though he said he had no comment on who had taken the video.
&quot;China used the exaggerated tricks of cognitive warfare to show how close it was to Penghu - which is not true,&quot; Tung said.
Taiwan&#x27;s Defence Ministry on Monday, in an update of Chinese air force activity near Taiwan, showed on a map that the closest Chinese aircraft to Penghu that day were four J-16 fighters.
The fighters crossed the Taiwan Strait median line - normally an unofficial barrier between the two sides - but stayed closer to the Chinese coast than Penghu, the map showed.
Tung said Taiwan had a real-time &quot;grasp&quot; of what was going on in the skies, and that Chinese aircraft have been operating to the north and southwest of Taiwan and across the median line.
&quot;Both the air force and ground air defence forces respond.&quot;
Penghu is close to Taiwan&#x27;s southwestern coast, unlike the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands which are right next to the Chinese coast.
Penghu is a popular summer tourist destination for its beaches, reefs and seafood.

“There have been hardcore Democrats and left-leaning legal analysts on television … saying that this invasion may have been too much, it may have been dangerous, it may have been unnecessary,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia.</span>

                              <span>Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says he thinks Donald Trump is probably going to run for president again in 2024. 

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come after the FBI raided the former US president’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, where ‘top secret’ documents were seized. 

“It is garnering President Trump some sympathy in some circles,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“And I think it actually makes it more likely that he’s going to run and less likely that some of the names you and I have thrown around in the past will run against him.”</span>

Mr Ruto, who heads the Kenya First Alliance, has been declared the winner of the tightly contested presidential race, winning 50.49 per cent of the vote. 

There was controversy before the result was announced as four electoral commissioners refused to certify the outcome.</span>

                              <span>More than two million baby swings and swings were recalled on Monday for posing a strangulation hazard after one baby died and another was rescued from entanglement.
Restraint straps on MamaRoo swings and RockaRoo rockers hang below the seat when not in use, creating the possibility that crawling babies can get caught in them, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has declared.
The company behind the two models, 4moms, “has received two reports of entanglement incidents involving infants becoming entangled in the strap under the unoccupied MamaRoo infant swing after crawling under the seat, including a 10-month-old baby who died of asphyxiation, and a 10-month-old baby who suffered bruising to his neck before being rescued by a caregiver,” a safety commission statement said.

Workers are paid as W-2 employees, not independent contractors, which means they are still protected by federal labor laws and elements of the social safety net, including the workers’ compensation for injury.
Snagajob, an hourly work platform, says these shifts have tripled from 2020 to 2021, and are likely to quintuple in 2022 – mostly as a side income because people’s regular jobs weren’t enough.
“I think if they got the ultimate flexibility and all the compensation they wanted from their full-time employer, there would probably be less need for shifts,” said Snagajob chief executive Mathieu Stevenson.  “But the reality is, in the overwhe…</span>

                              <span>When oil prices fall, many costs for industry and agriculture, including chemicals and fertilizers, usually follow.  And shipping becomes more economical.  But when they rise sharply, as they did in 2008 and the 1970s, they tend to raise other prices and drag down the overall economy.  And political fallout often ensues.
Predicting energy prices has always been a fool’s game because there are so many factors, including the expectations of traders who buy and sell fuel, the political fortunes of unstable producing countries like Venezuela, Nigeria and Libya, and the investment decisions of public and private oil companies.  business leaders.
Today, these complexities are particularly difficult to assess.

Hearing no response, she poured her energy into volunteer work, and in March she began helping family friend Rachel Brooks, who ran an after-school English program for local students, and also started helping out at an abbey in Cavagnolo that was hosting Ukrainian refugees.

                              <span>TikTok’s design makes it a breeding ground for misinformation, the researchers found.  They wrote that the videos could easily be manipulated and reposted on the platform and featured alongside stolen or original content.  Pseudonyms are common;  parody and comedy videos are easily misinterpreted as fact;  popularity affects the visibility of comments;  and the data about posting time and other details are not clearly displayed on the mobile app.
(Shorenstein Center researchers noted, however, that TikTok is less vulnerable to so-called brigadier, in which groups coordinate to spread a message widely, than platforms like Twitter or Facebook.)
In the first quarter of 2022, more than 60% of videos containing harmful misinformation were viewed by users before being deleted, TikTok said.  Last year, a group of behavioral scientists who had worked with TikTok said an effort to attach warnings to posts with unsubstantiated content reduced sharing by 24% but limited views by just 5%.
The researchers said misinformation will continue to thrive on TikTok as long as the platform refuses to disclose data about the origins of its videos or share information about its algorithms.  Last month, TikTok said it would offer access to a version of its application programming interface, or API, this year, but it didn’t say whether it would do so until the midterms.
Filippo Menczer, professor of computer science and computer science and director of the Indiana University Social Media Observatory, said he had offered research collaborations to TikTok and had been told ” Absolutely not”.
“At least with Facebook and Twitter, there is some level of transparency, but, in the case of TikTok, we have no idea,” he said.  “Without resources, without being able to access the data, we don’t know who is suspended, what content is removed, if it acts on reports or what the criteria are.  It’s completely opaque and we can’t independently assess anything.

                              <span>Despite these adaptations and dietary shifts in apex predators, invasive species still win out.  In Australia in 2015, for example, the country’s then-endangered species commissioner told the national channel that “Australia has lost 29 mammals since European settlement, and wild predators are implicated in 28 of those extinctions”.
Florida faces similar invasion problems as it is home to an ideal combination of a subtropical climate, a thriving pet trade, and multiple ports of entry.  The result, said Ian Bartoszek, a wildlife biologist with the Southwest Florida Conservatory, is that the state has “more established non-native animal species than any country in the world”.  Or, as Dr. Mazzotti said of the Everglades, “I’m preparing to call it Everglades Invasive Reptile National Park.”

“I remember sitting at this same desk when I was applying to universities,” said Ms Lai, 36.
Now she was recalibrating her life.  Feelings of burnout had left her crying on a street in downtown Austin, Texas three months earlier.  It was more than a year into the pandemic, on her day off, which she had spent with her mother and sister.  She was eventually overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Ms. Lai worked 50 hours a week as a pediatric nurse practitioner at a community health clinic in Southeast Austin.  Some of her patients at the clinic, which Ms. Lai said served a mostly Latin American population, did not have access to clean water. …</span>

Celesita is essentially a minimalist Layer 1 blockchain that provides users with the infrastructure that makes it easy to deploy their own blockchain, or Layer 2 rollup.

For all its glamorous shops, restaurants and performing arts programs, Hudson Yards is first and foremost an office complex, with four huge towers comprising 8.6 million square feet.  Although the private company Related, led by Chairman Stephen M. Ross, is reluctant to share data, several brokers have helped us estimate that all expensive office space is about 95% leased or sold.
In the newest tower, 50 Hudson Yards, which will open later this year, a slew of big deals recently closed that totaled 285,000 square feet in a lackluster market.

Goel spoke candidly with Cointelegraph in Seoul last week about Polygon (MATIC) are pushing to help NFT games proliferate and why game publishers in South Korea like Neowiz and Nexon are diving headfirst into space.
One of the main arguments made by Goel is that the traditional business model that NFT games compete against may be inherently weaker.  In traditional games, users typically purchase in-game items with real money, but they cannot sell those items to recoup a dollar value.

John Fetterman having a lot of fun on Twitter at the expense of dr. Mehmet Ozhis Republican rival for the Pennsylvania Senate seat, and Oz can’t seem to help stepping on rakes in his attempts to fight back.
Fetterman, who is currently lieutenant governor of Keystone State, made Oz’s longtime residence in neighboring New Jersey a central part of his campaign message, poking fun at Oz as an out-of-touch millionaire celebrity of Pennsylvania blue-collar voters.
One of Fetterman’s most memorable Twitter zingers was responding to an Oz campaign video to point out that it was filmed at his New Jersey mansion which was profiled in People.

Pro tip: Don’t film a senatorial campaign commercial from your New Jersey mansion. https://t.co/D9BDweZmym pic.twitter.com/p…</span>

Thanks to journalist Brian Steele and the Gazette for the extensive July 30 article on the big changes in central Florence.  No, this story was not about the well-planned central Florence redesign project underway at that time, but about the ongoing gentrification.
Case in point: Residents of Florence/Northampton have expressed concern over new building owners’ plans to evict – via an unaffordable rent increase – the Pizza Factory and replace it with a cannabis retail store called Euphoria.
This article was probably the first time most readers had heard of this project.  As proposed, Euphorium would be owned by father and son Marco and Richard Aranzullo of Connecticut.

It was hard to blame him for crying.  “Kat’a” is a heart-pounding tragedy about a small-town woman trapped in a loveless marriage and driven to suicide after having a brief affair.  Janacek’s music crushes her ethereal fantasies with the brutal fist of reality.
At Barrie Kosky’s the staging was the culmination of a week in Salzburg, classical music’s preeminent annual event, which runs until August 31.  Kosky has reduced this stripped-down work even further, to its core of trembling human beings.

The 1960s are different when “The good years” centered on a black family.  There’s more to chat about “Gossip Girl” without the rigid do-si-do of a gender binary.
Likewise, a new version of “A League of Their Own” oscillates around ideas about queer identity and spaces, race, and blackness in particular.  But he can’t move his bat fast enough to connect.
This “League,” available now on Amazon, has the same setting as Penny Marshall’s near-perfect 1992 film: It’s 1943, and the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League makes its debut as World War II erupts. continues and Major League Baseball’s labor pool contin…</span>

The hope of SK, Ford, many energy policymakers and pragmatic environmentalists is that most Georgians stalking for holiday fireworks in years to come will instead be hanging from F-150 sets. Lightnings.
Even with logistics and production volume straightened out, the lingering question for Jackson County residents and Americans alike is whether batteries made on the road in SK will power vehicles ultimately as accessible as Ford’s Model T.  Henry Ford called it a vehicle “for the great multitude,” and it fueled America’s original automobile revolution.
As usual, silver bullets are rare.  And like most major challenges, it helps if a solution is to create something cool.
Maddison Dean, a Jackson County native, was hired earlier this year by SK for a community relations role.  In April, she gave a presentation on the company to over a hundred juniors and seniors at Commerce High School, her alma mater.  In the auditorium, she provided insight into electric vehicles, the rapidly changing future of automakers, and how SK operations work.
“I told them, feel free to interrupt me anytime, just raise your hand,” she said.  At first, she didn’t have many takers.  “You know, especially talking to high school kids, they’re just sort of transparent, they’re like, ‘Yeah, whatever, that’s an excuse for us to be out of class, but we don’t lend it don’t pay attention.  “”

They have overcome boardroom clashes, investor power struggles and regulatory landmines.
But this summer, some of them encountered their most threatening adversary yet: multi-family townhouses.
Their battle took place in one of the most exclusive and affluent cities in Silicon Valley: Atherton, California., a 4.9 square mile enclave just north of Stanford University with a population of 7,500.  There, tech CEOs and venture capitalists coalesced on the spectrum that more than one home might exist on a single acre of land in general proximity to their estates.

Speaking to MSNBC, John Brennan noted that it begs the question about the security of the documents that were at Mar-a-Lago and it could have been a reason that the DOJ wanted to act quickly to take the classified information back. 
&quot;It certainly seems as though the Department of Justice and Merrick Garland have been careful in terms of how they&#x27;ve gone about trying to retrieve these documents that should not be in the possession of Donald Trump,&quot; said Brennan. &quot;As your chronology indicates there has been back and forth between the folks in the Trump orbit and the Department of Justice [and] National Archives, but…</span>

Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations this month of shelling near the plant, which dominates the south bank of a vast reservoir on the Dnipro River, amid fears of a nuclear catastrophe.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned Russian soldiers who attack Europe&#x27;s largest nuclear power station or use it as a base to shoot from that they will become a &quot;special target&quot;.
The plant is in the now Russian-controlled city of Enerhodar.

Currently a Supreme Court justice -- a job in which he has been a constant target of Bolsonaro&#x27;s attacks -- Moraes is set to take over Tuesday as head of Brazil&#x27;s Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE), the institution responsible for refereeing the South American giant&#x27;s October elections and punishing violations of electoral law.
It is typically a fairly humdrum role. But these aren&#x27;t shaping up to be typical elections.

Analysts paint a picture of a weakened armed resistance against the Taliban and an Afghan population that increasingly abhors the Islamic fundamentalist group – but is too exhausted to oppose it.
When Afghanistan captured the world’s attention shortly after the Taliban’s precipitous takeover on August 15, 2021, the media focused on the Panjshir Valley – where late Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud held off both the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. As the Taliban closed in, the lionised commander’s son, Ahmad Massoud, vowed to fight the Taliban from Panjshir once again. 
But by September, Massoud had fled to neighboring Tajikistan alo…</span>

Iran has denied any involvement in the attack on writer Salman Rushdie in the United States.
&quot;There is no connection between Iran and the perpetrator,&quot; foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Monday, as reported by the Iranian news agency Isna.
&quot;Rushdie himself is responsible for the attack,&quot; Kanaani asserted, noting that the author&#x27;s work not only offended Iran, but Muslims worldwide.
Rushdie was stabbed onstage as he was about to deliver a lecture in New York State on Friday. The writer is recovering in hospital. A 24-year-old suspect is in custody.
The Indian-born Briton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; led to death threats from Iran in the 1980s.
Iran is increasingly coming in for criticism in the international community over a death sentence issued against the respected author in the 1980s.
Late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, or fatwa, sentencing Rushdie to death more than 30 years ago because of the &quot;The Satanic Verses,&quot; published in 1988.
Khomeini accused Rushdie of insulting Islam, the prophet Mohammed and the Koran in his novel.</span>

                              <span>LONDON (Reuters) - It is &quot;ludicrous&quot; to suggest that novelist Salman Rushdie was responsible for the attack on him, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday, after Iran&#x27;s foreign ministry suggested the author was to blame.
&quot;Clearly it is ludicrous to suggest that Salman Rushdie was in any way responsible for this abhorrent attack on him,&quot; the spokesman told reporters.
&quot;This was not just an attack on him, it was an attack on the right to free speech and expression and the UK government stands both by him and his family, but equally we stand in defence of free speech around the world.&quot;

                              <span>Afghanistan has been suffering through a grave humanitarian crisis since the Taliban took control on August 15, 2021. According to the UN, 95 percent of Afghans are going hungry. It’s a catastrophe that worsened after the fall of Kabul one year ago, exacerbated by the US decision to freeze the Afghan Central Bank’s assets and the international sanctions that have crippled an already fragile economy.
The Afghan economy was already in a terrible state when the Taliban seized Kabul a year ago, with half the population living below the poverty line. The situation has only worsened since then. International aid accounted for 80 percent of the Afghan state budget – but it was cut off upon the Taliban victory, prompting economic collapse and depriving many Afghans of basic necessities.

                              <span>Revelations that Australia&#x27;s ex-prime minister secretly appointed himself to several ministerial posts during the pandemic sparked a political firestorm Monday, with his successor promising a rapid investigation.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Scott Morrison of &quot;tin-pot activity&quot; after it emerged the former leader had made himself minister of health, finance and resources, among other positions, without informing colleagues, parliament or voters.
Describing Morrison&#x27;s actions as &quot;extraordinary and unprecedented&quot;, Albanese said Monday he had sought legal advice from the solicitor-general and would be briefed later today.
&quot;This is a sort of tin-pot activity that we would ridicule if it was in a non-democratic country,&quot; Albanese said. &quot;Scott Morrison was running a shadow government&quot;
In some cases, Morrison made himself a co-minister without telling the cabinet members he had already appointed to those positions.
The scandal has shone a light on the opaque nature of decision-making inside Australia&#x27;s government -- and raised questions about whether more stringent democratic safeguards are needed.
It is still not clear how many posts Morrison held, but local media reported that he took on the resources portfolio and used his power to axe a significant gas project off Sydney&#x27;s coast.
Morrison&#x27;s conservative coalition lost power in May elections, ending nearly a decade of centre-right rule in the country.
In Australia, elected politicians are selected by the prime minister before being sworn in by the governor-general in a formal ceremony that is usually publicly recorded.
Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey described the allegations as &quot;bizarre&quot; and said it raised possible legal challenges to some of the former government&#x27;s decisions.
&quot;The secrecy involved in this is just simply bizarre. I mean, you know, you just wonder what&#x27;s wrong with these people, if they have to do everything in secret,&quot; she said.
&quot;It&#x27;s just utterly inappropriate. We live in a democracy, which requires transparency.&quot;

But the Modi administration has overseen massive crackdowns on civil liberties, including discrimination against India’s Muslim minority, raising fears for the future of the world’s largest democracy.
Speaking from the 17th century Red Fort, the former residence of Mughal emperors in Delhi, Prime Minister Modi said India must turn into a developed nation before it marks a centenary of independence from colonial Britain.
&quot;We must turn India into a developed country in the next 25 years, in our lifetime,&quot; said the 71-year-old Modi, wearing a turban in the colors of the Indian flag, in his 75-minute-speech in Hindi.

                              <span>China staged fresh military drills around Taiwan on Monday, slamming a new visit by United States lawmakers to the island days after a similar trip by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi triggered a furious response from Beijing.
The unannounced two-day trip by senior members of Congress prompted China to renew its rhetoric that it would &quot;prepare for war&quot; over Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing&#x27;s leaders claim and have vowed to one day seize.
The five-member congressional delegation -- led by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts -- met with President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday, according to Washington&#x27;s de facto embassy in Taipei.
&quot;The delegation had an opportunity to exchange views with Taiwan counterparts on a wide range of issues of importance to both the United States and Taiwan,&quot; it said.

Exactly a year ago, the hardline Islamists captured Kabul after a nationwide lightning offensive against government forces just as US-led troops were ending two decades of intervention in a conflict that cost tens of thousands of lives.
&quot;We fulfilled the obligation of jihad and liberated our country,&quot; said Niamatullah Hekmat, a fighter who entered the capital on August 15 last year just hours after then-president Ashraf Ghani fled the country.

Suu Kyi, 77, was convicted of misusing funds from the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation - an organisation she founded promoting health and education - to build a home, and leasing government-owned land at a discounted rate.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will aim to become a developed nation within 25 years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a national day address on Monday, with policies to support domestic production in power, defence and digital technology.
Speaking from the 17th century Red Fort in Delhi as India celebrates its 75th year of independence from British colonial rule, Modi exhorted youth to &quot;aim big&quot; and give their best years for the cause of the country.
&quot;We must turn India into a developed country in the next 25 years, in our lifetime,&quot; said the 71-year-old Modi, wearing a turban in the colours of the Indian flag, in his 75-minute-speech in Hindi.
&quot;It&#x27;s a big resolution, and we should work towards it with all our might.&quot;

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese fans of the sci-fi hit &quot;Stranger Things&quot; can chow down on demonic pasta and rock out to retro 1980s tunes at a pop-up cafe inspired by the Netflix Inc horror drama.
The shop, a partnership with local restaurant chain Pronto Corp, recently extended its run in the fashionable Shibuya district of Tokyo several months amid overwhelming demand. &quot;Stranger Things&quot; has remained one of the streamer&#x27;s top 10 shows in Japan since the release of its fourth season in May.
The interior has replicas of shops and sets from the show, set in fictional U.S. town of Hawkins, Indiana, along with its dark-mirror underworld that the pre-teen protagonists call the &quot;Upside Down.&quot;
Patrons can take pictures next to the drama&#x27;s signature Demogorgon monster while songs from the show, such as Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; play in the background.
Diners can nosh on food inspired by the show, such as squid-ink pasta arranged like the monster&#x27;s head or the waffles craved by the psychically powered star character, Eleven.
To reduce the risk spreading COVID-19, now battering Japan in record infections, the cafe requires visitors to make a reservation and only about 20 are allowed inside every hour.
&quot;Every day at midnight, I have been trying to book a table on my phone,&quot; said 29-year-old mother Kimiko Nakae. &quot;Finally there&#x27;s an opening today because someone had cancelled the reservation.&quot;
Tokyo has a long tradition of themed restaurants and cafes, featuring everything from ninja waiters and exotic animals to vampire-inspired cuisine.
But like many tourist-oriented businesses, the sector has been hard hit by the pandemic. The Lockup, a chain of haunted prison eateries, ended a 23-year run when its final location closed last month, joining the fate of the famous Robot Restaurant, a gaudy music and dance spectacle in the red-light district of Kabukicho that closed in March 2020.

Iran and Russia have expanded the level of their strategic cooperation in various fields. Most recently in space, when a Russian rocket launched an Iranian satellite into orbit from a Russian spaceport in Kazakhstan, writes analyst and Middle East expert Elijah J. Magnier. 
Russia signed a contract with Iran to buy 1,000 drones after Iran supplied several aircraft and a simulator on which Russian officers trained: they successfully used the first drones in Ukraine. The move is considered unprecedented for a superpower that buys drones from Iran. Tehran considers it recognition of its advanced and efficient military industry, achieved despite 43 years of US sanctions against the Islamic Republic.

A pall of smoke from burning cities would engulf Earth, causing worldwide crop failures, models show.
Even a small conflict in which two nations unleash nuclear weapons on each other could lead to worldwide famine, new research suggests.
Soot from burning cities would encircle the planet and cool it by reflecting sunlight back into space. 
This in turn would cause global crop failures that — in a worst-case scenario — could put 5 billion people on the brink of death.

                              <span>The Guardian: Ukraine says it will target Russian soldiers at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant  
Volodymyr Zelenskiy vows troops based at Europe’s largest nuclear plant will become ‘special targets’ 
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from Europe’s largest nuclear power station, amid warnings that the Kremlin may falsely claim Kyiv has directly struck the critical site. 
Zelenskiy said anyone giving orders for attacks on the site or nearby towns and cities should face trial by an international court, as concern about the safety of the nuclear site remained high.

The SUN: PANIC STATIONS Putin’s officials in ‘secret talks with the West to end Ukraine war’ as ‘panicked’ Moscow elite go ‘behind tyrant’s back 
VLADIMIR Putin&#x27;s panicked cronies are secretly reaching out to the West to try and bring Russia&#x27;s disastrous war in Ukraine to an end, intelligence chiefs have alleged. 
Russia&#x27;s elite are increasingly despairing about the sanctions imposed on the country in the wake of Vlad&#x27;s bloody invasion and are trying to negotiate for peace, a senior Kremlin official is reported to have claimed. 
A document believed to have been circulated around Western intelligence agencies and supposedly seen by The Mirror said: &quot;A representative of Putin&#x27;s inner circle sent a signal about the desire to negotiate. 
&quot;The mood of the Kremlin elite is panic.&quot; 
Putin&#x27;s backstabbing official isn&#x27;t named in the document but has been described as a &quot;pillar of the regime&quot; in Russia. 
Ukraine believes high-ranking Kremlin officials are attempting to reach out to Western intelligence agencies behind Putin&#x27;s back, a Kyiv diplomatic source told The Mirror.

                              <span>Bloomberg: What would happen if the US goes to war with China over Taiwan? 
As China waged extensive military exercises off of Taiwan last week, a group of American defense experts in Washington was focused on their own simulation of an eventual — but for now entirely hypothetical — US-China war over the island. 
The unofficial what-if game is being conducted on the fifth floor of an office building not far from the White House, and it posits a US military response to a Chinese invasion in 2026. 
Even though the participants bring an American perspective, they are finding that a US-Taiwan victory, if there is one, could come at a huge cost.

U.S. warships will continue to make Taiwan Strait transits and perform freedom of navigation operations in the Indo-Pacific despite the recent Chinese live fire drills, the undersecretary of defense for policy told reporters Monday. 
The U.S. Navy is expected to conduct some freedom of navigation operations in the region in the coming days, Colin Kahl, undersecretary of defense for policy, said during a press briefing. It is important for Beijing to understand that the United States will continue to sail in international waters where it is allowed.

Another group of U.S. lawmakers are visiting Taiwan over the weekend after China issued a stark warning and began military drills near the island following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit less than two weeks prior. 
A five-member delegation, led by Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, are in Taiwan on Sunday and Monday as part of a larger trip through Asia, according to the American Institute in Taiwan. 
Pelosi&#x27;s trip to Taiwan just 12 days before this new trip angered China, leading to Beijing sending missiles, warships and warplanes into the seas and air around Taiwan.

UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced &#x27;a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War&#x27; and was just &#x27;one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.&#x27; 
&#x27;We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,&#x27; Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

A huge nuclear power plant occupied by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine is &quot;completely out of control&quot;, the head of the UN&#x27;s nuclear agency says.  Rafael Grossi was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying the Zaporizhzhia plant needed an inspection and repairs.
&quot;You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,&quot; he said. 
Europe&#x27;s biggest nuclear plant is dangerously close to the fighting. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia earlier this week of using the plant, which it overran in March, as a military base to launch attacks on Ukrainian forces.

Daily Mail: America is &#x27;on edge of war with Russia and China&#x27;, says former US secretary of State Henry Kissinger - and blames US leaders having &#x27;trouble defining a direction&#x27; 
* Henry Kissinger served as Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon 
* He suggested to the Wall Street Journal over the weekend that leaders in today&#x27;s US political climate have trouble separating personal values from negotiations 
* &#x27;All you can do is not to accelerate the tensions and to create options, and for that you have to have some purpose,&#x27; he said of issues with China and Russia 
* It comes as another Congressional delegation is en route to Taiwan 
* House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit was seen by some as exacerbating tensions 
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned on Friday that the United States could be &#x27;on the edge of war&#x27; with Russia and China, as the Biden administration grapples with its historically low relations with the two autocratic regimes. 
Without naming names, the 99-year-old statesman suggested that American leaders have &#x27;trouble defining a direction&#x27; in today&#x27;s political climate, which he believes has contributed to rising global tensions. 
 &#x27;We are at the edge of war with Russia and China on issues which we partly created,&#x27; Kissinger told the Wall Street Journal.

The Guardian: Russia claims US ‘directly involved’ in Ukraine war 
Kremlin says White House supplying information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes  The role of American intelligence in the war in Ukraine has been put under scrutiny after Russia accused the White House of supplying targeting information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes. 
Russia’s defence ministry claimed Washington was “directly involved” in the war, and had passed on intelligence that had led to the “mass deaths of civilians”. The US was responsible for rocket attacks by Kyiv on populated areas in the eastern Donbas and in other regions, it said.

Update #3: Russia accuses US of ‘direct involvement’ in Ukraine war (Al Jazeera)   
WNU Editor: The above Kremlin claims on US involvement in the Ukraine war was first reported two weeks ago. There has been nothing but silence from the Kremlin since then. But on Russian media there has been nothing but discussions and reporting on US involvement in the Ukraine war, and it has been effective. This Russian media/propaganda campaign has pushed anti-US sentiment in Russia to levels that I have never seen in my lifetime.</span>

MENAFN: For Europe to back Ukraine, it must be willing to &quot;pay&quot; 
(MENAFN) According to the head of EU foreign policy, EU citizens should be prepared to pay the cost associated with aiding Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. 
As per Josep Borrell, a Russian victory would be a setback for Brussels.  “We must explain to our citizens that this is not someone else’s war,” the diplomat stated in an interview released by newspaper El Pais on Thursday.
“The public must be willing to pay the price of supporting Ukraine and for preserving the unity of the EU. 
 “We are at war. These things are not free,” he added, acknowledging that the cost should be distributed “equitably.”

Teachers and government workers weren’t getting paid, and even if those salaries have resumed, incomes are lower. People sell furniture and silverware for cash. They also sell their kidneys.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Climate activists affiliated with Extinction Rebellion have targeted golf courses in southern France, filling holes with concrete in protest over exemptions from water restrictions during one of the worst droughts on record.
France has told residents to avoid non-essential water usage like car-washing and watering gardens. However, activists complain that golf courses are allowed to continue watering greens.
The protest action took place at the Vieille-Toulouse club and also at the Garonne des Sept Deniers course.
Defending their exemption from the water restrictions, Gerard Rougier of the French Golf Federation told the France Info news website: &quot;A golf course without a green is like an ice-rink without ice.&quot;
Extinction Rebellion Toulouse posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing a golf hole filled with cement and a sign saying &quot;This hole is drinking 277,000 litres. Do you drink that much? #Stop Golf&quot;.
A petition aimed at scrapping the exemption enjoyed by French golf courses during drought said: &quot;Economic madness takes precedence over ecological reason.&quot;
Water bans are enforced at the discretion of regional officials and so far only Ille-et-Villaine in western France had banned the watering of golf courses.
France had been one of the hardest hit by the hot and dry conditions across Europe with firefighters battling a &quot;monster&quot; blaze in forests in the southwest France.
