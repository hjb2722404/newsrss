                              <span>The evening, punctuated by the local cover band, the Fly Bettys, ended with a final fireworks display accompanied by “God Bless the USA”.
The hope of SK, Ford, many energy policymakers and pragmatic environmentalists is that most Georgians stalking for holiday fireworks in years to come will instead be hanging from F-150 sets. Lightnings.
Even with logistics and production volume straightened out, the lingering question for Jackson County residents and Americans alike is whether batteries made on the road in SK will power vehicles ultimately as accessible as Ford’s Model T.  Henry Ford called it a vehicle “for the great multitude,” and it fueled America’s original automobile revolution.
As usual, silver bullets are rare.  And like most major challenges, it helps if a solution is to create something cool.
Maddison Dean, a Jackson County native, was hired earlier this year by SK for a community relations role.  In April, she gave a presentation on the company to over a hundred juniors and seniors at Commerce High School, her alma mater.  In the auditorium, she provided insight into electric vehicles, the rapidly changing future of automakers, and how SK operations work.
“I told them, feel free to interrupt me anytime, just raise your hand,” she said.  At first, she didn’t have many takers.  “You know, especially talking to high school kids, they’re just sort of transparent, they’re like, ‘Yeah, whatever, that’s an excuse for us to be out of class, but we don’t lend it don’t pay attention.  “”

And I found, to my surprise, that learning about baby equipment forced me to learn more about babies themselves – what they like, what they don’t like, to how old they grow and come out of certain behaviors.  As my due date approached, I felt more prepared and less unhappy than many other future dads I met in our birthing classes, many of whom had outsourced equipment decisions to their wives.
And when my wife finally gave birth three weeks early, I was ready.  I drove her to the hospital with confidence, full bags in tow, not once worrying about whether the car seat was properly installed.

Their battle took place in one of the most exclusive and affluent cities in Silicon Valley: Atherton, California., a 4.9 square mile enclave just north of Stanford University with a population of 7,500.  There, tech CEOs and venture capitalists coalesced on the spectrum that more than one home might exist on a single acre of land in general proximity to their estates.

Operator Dean’s Poll closes restaurant in Central Park October 16.  The Big Apple landmark will close due to soaring costs, according to Poll. 
Whichever way you slap it, this is bad news for the city.  A dark boathouse would leave a heartbreaking hole in the park at a time when New York’s green lung needs all the healthy, law-abiding human traffic it can handle. 
Last rebuilt in the 1950s, where Calvert Vaux’s original 1870s Boathouse once stood, magically located on the east shore of scenic Central Park Lakeis ignored by some New Yorkers who foolishly take it for a tourist trap.

The fire was quickly extinguished.  And although a Russian shell hit Reactor No. 1, its thick walls protected it from damage, the Ukrainian government said at the time.
Now, five months later, repeated bombings inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant complex over the past seven days have raised renewed concerns, with Ukrainian and Western officials warning that the attacks increase the risk of nuclear accident.

                              <span>It was a long-term gamble on liquid natural gas, but it paid off and turned the United States into a major exporter of fossil fuels.
Journalist Jake Bittle delves into the career of Charif Souki, the Lebanese-American entrepreneur whose appetite for risk changed the course of America’s energy sector.
The article describes how Mr. Souki went from restaurant owner in Los Angeles to co-founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy, an oil and gas company specializing in liquefied natural gas, and provides insight into his process of reflection: “According to Souki,” writes Mr. Bittle, “the need to provide energy to the world in the short term outweighs the long-term demand to act on carbon emissions”.


At a time of acute climate anxiety, Mr. Souki’s rationale might seem outdated, even brazen.  The world may be facing energy and climate crises, Mr Souki told The New York Times, “but one is going to happen this month, and the other is 40 years from now.”


“If you tell someone, ‘You’re going to run out of power this month,’ and then you tell the same person about what’s going to happen 40 years from now,” he said, “they say, ‘What do you care about in 40 years?’  »

In other words, the clay would be a bad choice.  This is where the term feet of clay comes from, connoting a weak foundation, a flaw that could bring down a person of honor.  Which brings us to Fernando Tatis Jr.
When the San Diego Padres signed Tatis to a 14 years, $340 million contract in February 2021, he matched the boldness of their investment with an equally bold statement: “I want the statue.”  Then Tatis led the National League in home runs and nearly won the Most Valuable Player award, all before his 23rd birthday.

When I rolled myself out of that comfy bed and soft, gentle air conditioning, I was hit with a wave of regret, warmth, and smoldering humidity.  I knew it was coming.  My long run was more like a long job.
When you have to go out for a run and the temperatures are high, no matter what time you wake up, how do you get your workout right?  Of course, I know the basic tips.  But how do extreme athletes excel in these conditions?

Elon Musk: US ‘passed peak inflation’ after Tesla sold 90% of Bitcoin
While Tesla has now sold 90% of its bitcoin holdings during the bear market, Elon Musk says the US economy has “passed peak inflation” and predicts that only a “mild to moderate” recession could come.  “We kind of have an idea of ​​how prices are changing over time, and the interesting thing we’re seeing now is that most of our core products, most things that go into a Tesla – not all of them, more than half the prices — tend to go down in six months,”…</span>

The lights were on at the therapy art gallery, but there were no visitors.  Not a scrap of paper was moved to the psychological and social services unit.
Beneficiaries of the Saudi government program, which helps prisoners reintegrate into society, were on leave for family visits for Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice season, leaving the place eerily empty, like a campus American university at Christmas.  Pause.
Only one painting in the gallery offered a glimpse of the religious tolerance that characterizes the program: it was of a woman smelling a flower, her hair uncovered and flowing, against the night sky.

“Democrats call Republicans extremists because Republicans have become a party of extremists, crazies have taken over the asylum. People who are in the mainstream of the Republican Party today, there’s 10 years, would have been avoided by the party leadership,” Smith said.

    The City of Amherst government is again trying to take over the parking lot from the citizens of Amherst.  Now they also want to remove parking on Sunset Avenue and Elm Street. 
The Amherst City Council should allow as much unpaid daytime parking as possible for visitors, workers and students.  I know the owners of Lincoln Avenue have been reciting horror stories about parking on this street, but that’s not what I see on a daily basis.  I see a manageable traffic pattern under control with frequent speed bumps. 
I also see hard-working members of the community: workers, students and visitors, who use a public resource – free public parking – in a careful and efficient way.  Those people parking on Lincoln Avenue are doing …</span>

Nearly six million people depend on the cocoa industry in the West African nation of Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest cocoa producer.  But most of them are not involved in processing the crispy, sour beans that are turned into a sweet treat.

Most of them, perhaps all of them, will never attract the attention of Michelin Guide critics.  Their decor is generally modest, as are their prices.

                              <span>Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says China wants “political compliance” in return for “economic reliance”.

He said there are fears of a future blockade of the Taiwan Strait by China. 

“There were few signs from the ambassador that there would be a reversal anytime soon in terms of trade bans on Australian beef or wine,” Mr Clennell said. 

“It seems the Chinese government wants to hold that over Australia as if to say there are further trade sanctions that can be put in place.”</span>

It&#x27;s been revealed the FBI has seized files classed as “top secret” during the search of Mr Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago home.

“Donald Trump’s back in the news, his base is animated, they think he’s been hard done by,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“It’s going to keep him going for some time to come.”</span>

                              <span>KYIV, Ukraine – From spring to summer, the Ukrainian army was beaten by Russian artillery in eastern Ukraine, steadily losing ground and up to 200 troops a day in a mismatched duel.  But in recent weeks, Ukraine has changed its strategy with new weaponry and has succeeded, at least for now, in slowing Russia’s advances.
Comes with a growing arsenal of western long-range weapons and aided by local fighters known as Partisans, Ukraine was able to strike Russian forces deep behind enemy lines, disrupting critical supply lines and, increasingly, hitting critical targets of combat potential. from Moscow.

The flowers that a family had brought were beginning to wilt.  The babies were crying.  The crowd was huddled in the shade, greetings and laughter alternating with silence, their excitement cut by the tension.
By the clock, the prison authorities were running late.  But Khaled Dawoud, a former detainee, was used to their ways.  By Egyptian standards, he joked, a three-hour delay to see his former cellmate and five other political prisoners released was nothing.

The translator, Hitoshi Igarashi, was stabbed to death aged 44 in July at the University of Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo, where he had been teaching comparative Islamic culture for five years.  No arrests were ever made and the crime remains unsolved.
Mr. Igarashi had translated “The Satanic Verses” for a Japanese edition which was published after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinithen supreme leader of Iran, had ordered Muslims to kill the British writer of Indian origin because of the book’s description of the Prophet Muhammad.

In the opening pages of “A History of Present Illness,” Anna DeForest’s novel about medical training, the unnamed narrator finds herself with two groups of people – her colleagues, who are future doctors, and the corpses they are responsible for dissecting.
His sympathies, it is fair to say, are with the corpses.  Residents are mostly wealthy kids, brought up on ski trips and country homes, who brag about the financial sacrifice they make by going into medicine instead of finance or consulting.

                              <span>Long before the car accident that drove the actress Anne Heche declared brain dead at the age of 53, her on-screen work was always on the verge of being overshadowed by tabloid interest in her life.
In 1997, she became best known as the girlfriend of comedian Ellen DeGeneres, appearing with her on red carpets at a time when open gay relationships were still rare in Hollywood.  His name was the butt of countless jokes after a “20/20″ interview with Barbara Walters in 2001 in which she revealed that she had concocted for herself a separate world called “fourth dimension” and a personality named “Celestia”.  Never mind that she also told Walters about the horrific sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her father.  She faced mockery that followed her for the rest of her career.

These are concerns that are, in essence, legal, but really more philosophical and moral.  Acknowledging a source of inspiration, direct or indirect, is good business practice but also, in the age of internet-centric hyperresponsibility, something akin to playing offense as well as defense.

Ms Heche, 53, was seriously injured on August 5 when she crashed the Mini Cooper she was driving into a home in the Mar Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles, authorities said.  She suffered a severe anoxic brain injury and was being treated at the Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital, according to a statement released on behalf of her family and friends Thursday evening.

Employees of a Trader Joe’s in Massachusetts voted to unionize last month, amid a trend of recent union victories involving service workers at companies like Starbucks, Apple and Amazon.
Minneapolis’ vote was 55 to 5, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which organized the election.


Minneapolis workers voted to join Trader Joe’s United, the same independent union that represents workers in Hadley, Mass.  Workers at a third Trader Joe’s store in Colorado filed for union electionbut the labor board has not yet authorized a vote or set an election date.

The changes, which are embedded in climate and tax legislation known as the Cut Inflation Act 2022, are drawing backlash from farmers than the original debt relief package, which was part of the 2021 $1.9 trillion US bailout, was meant to help.  The new agenda is the latest twist in an 18-month period that has underscored the challenges facing the Biden administration’s attempts to make racial equity a centerpiece of its economic agenda.

                              <span>When the pandemic closings hit the real estate sector, showings were halted, homes were taken off the market and municipal offices that process closing documents were closed.  As a result, in March 2020, almost 18% of purchase contracts in the United States were canceled – although it took only a few months to return to normal levels.
But in 2022, the frequency of canceled transactions started to rise again, reaching almost 15% in June – the highest rate since the peak of the pandemic, according to a recent report by red finwhich represents approximately 60,000 failed home sales across the country.
The likely culprit: rising mortgage interest rates.  The journey between the accepted offer and the closing day can take up to two months or more, and interest rates sometimes change in the meantime.  Buyers can lock in rates for certain periods, but not all do, and even a small increase can stretch monthly payments out of reach and kill a deal.  And the rate increases this year have been substantial.  Consider, for example, that the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose from 3.79% in January to 5.3% in July.  This change would increase a monthly payment approximately $90 for every $100,000 borrowed.


The places with the highest percentage of deals failed in June – including many in the south and southwest – are among the most popular with buyers.  In Las Vegas, just over 27% of trades failed in June, the highest rate of any market, according to Redfin.  Preferred Florida destinations followed, including Lakeland, Florida at just under 27% and Cape Coral, Florida at just under 26%.


This week’s chart shows the US metropolitan markets where the highest share of trades failed in June.

Climb the professional ladder

I’m a librarian in my late twenties, and due to a wave of retirements, I’ve risen through the ranks very quickly.  My supervisors like me and I recently applied and was offered a job that puts me in charge of my own library.  It’s just another person and myself working there.  The other librarian has been in the business almost as long as I’ve been alive, and I know she applied for the job.
It created some awkwardness and that’s something we didn’t discuss.  We barely talk to each other.  She was very surprised and upset that she was not chosen for the job.  I think she can eve…</span>

                              <span>When the summer sun is blazing, the mere idea of ​​turning on the oven – even for the most wonderful dish – is revolting.  Sure, you might have air conditioning, but why heat the kitchen if it’s not necessary?  (You came inside to escape the stickiness and sweat!) You could cleverly put together a salad or put together a meal without cooking – and we have so many beautiful ones here and here – but ultimately, you’re going to want a hot meal.  Enter the slow cooker.
The recipes below are the simplest type of slow cooker recipe, the fix and forget type.  There’s no pre-searing or sautéing, and very little prep.  Just throw the ingredients in the slow cooker and let it simmer while you head to the beach or to work, or just curl up with a good book in front of the air conditioner.  A few hours…</span>

                              <span>Polio epidemics caused regular panics decades ago, until a vaccine was developed and the disease was largely eradicated.  Then on Friday, New York City health officials announced they had found the virus in sewage samples, suggesting polio was likely circulating in the city again. 
Parents of young children have wondered —  perhaps for the first time in their lives and collectively for the first time in generations — how worried they should be about polio.
Anabela Borges, a designer who lives in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood, said she has friends whose children are likely unvaccinated.  After Friday’s announcement, she said she planned to “raise awareness among her friends.”


Ms Borges said she hoped her 7-month-old daughter Ava, who is old enough to have had three of the four inj…</span>

LOCATED BETWEEN the North and South Forks of LONG Island, Shelter Island is a particularly distinct type of island getaway.  About three hours from Manhattan and accessible by short car ferry from Greenport or North Haven, the 8,000-acre island is bordered by the Peconic River to the west and Gardiners Bay to the east.  As far as beach getaways go, it’s less challenging than the Hamptons and more laid back than North Fork.  The narrow coastline is dotted with rocks and s…</span>

Her Seattle Storm teammate Natasha Howard had preceded her as a wide receiver, as she usually did whenever Bird was leading the offense in transition.  Howard realized it was open under the basket and stiffened.  Bird, she knew, would find her as always.  She just didn’t know how.
Bird slipped into the lane, drawing in a defender.  Then, without looking, she whipped the ball above his head and in Howard’s waiting palms.
“My hands were always ready for Sue when she passed the ball to me,” said Howard, now with the Liberty.  She added, “It’s just there, it’s like, ‘Wow, OK, Sue. You’ve got eyes in the back of your head.&#x27;”

Lynch is facing a DUI and three other charges after police say they found him sleeping in a parked car.  Police said in their report that Lynch, 36, was asleep behind the wheel of a car on a street north of the Las Vegas Strip near the Stratosphere hotel and casino around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday.
They said the vehicle, a black sports car, was turned off, visibly dented, and missing the rim and tire on the driver’s side front wheel.  The rear driver’s side wheels and the front passenger’s side rim and tire were nearly detached, according to the report.…</span>

The ruling, included in a status report filed by the settlement administrator that was entered into court on Thursday, came two years after two former players sued the league ending the use of race as a criterion for judging player claims, a process known as “race-norming”.

On Monday, officers reportedly recovered documents that Trump improperly took with him to his Mar-a-Lago estate after leaving office.  Some of the materials are supposed to be classified.
In response, conservatives reacted with unbridled fury, with Fox News hosts leading the charge.

On the same day this month that Governor Charlie Baker signed a long-awaited bill overhauling the governance structure of Holyoke and Chelsea Veterans’ Homes, a jaw-dropping trial by an Easthampton nurse has been made public about the Holyoke house which is deeply disturbing.  .
