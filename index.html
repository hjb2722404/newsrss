                              <span>A powerful winter snowstorm has hit the states of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey in the US, bringing with it up to 35 centimetres of snow in some areas. 

Authorities are recommending residents stay inside – as the mix of snow, sleet and rain is making for dangerous road conditions. 

Snowploughs have been busy cleaning roadways, sidewalks and parking lots as the country’s northeast experiences blizzard-like conditions. 

The accumulation has proved dangerous for vehicles not equipped to handle the downpour. 

Residents are being urged to stay off the streets and wait out the storms inside their homes.</span>

River levels are continuing to rise in some places, threatening homes. 

After almost a week, parts of England have been submerged as Storm Henk and torrential rain compounded the wettest half-year on record. 

Amid criticism of a decade of cuts to environment agency budgets, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak surfaced in Oxford to offer his defence. 

“We’ve invested 5.2 billion pounds in flood defences over the period in question – that’s a record sum,” Mr Sunak said.</span>

                              <span>Former US president Donald Trump has mocked French President Emmanuel Macron by imitating his accent as he ridiculed negotiations over taxes on American tech giants during his presidency.

The 2024 presidential hopeful made the remarks on Friday during a campaign event in Iowa.

Trump referenced a past conversation with Macron regarding a 25 per cent tax proposal to slap US tech giants operating in Mexico.

Trump recalled that he&#x27;d threatened Macron to put a 100 per cent tariff on French wine and champagne imports if the tax proposal took effect.

The 77-year-old then took a jab at President Joe Biden, whom he may face in the upcoming general election, and mocked his press conference antics.

Trump is rallying support in Iowa for the Republican caucus on January 15, where he is far and away the leading candidate.

He currently leads all competitors by more than 30 percentage points in the state, according to most polls.</span>

                              <span>Congressional leaders have reached an agreement on overall spending levels to avoid a partial government shutdown. The agreement adheres to spending caps for defense and domestic programs, but provides concessions to House Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson states that the agreement secures $16 billion in additional spending cuts. It is $30 billion less than what the Senate was considering. The agreement also speeds up the already agreed-upon cuts for the Internal Revenue Service and rescinds $6 billion in Covid relief money.</span>

                              <span>The Pentagon breached protocol by taking three and a half days to inform the White House about Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&#x27;s hospitalization. Austin&#x27;s hospitalization, following complications from a procedure, was not disclosed to senior defense officials until Thursday. The delayed notification puzzled officials across the government, and Austin issued an apology, taking responsibility for the lack of disclosure. President Biden expressed full confidence in Austin, who has since resumed his duties. The incident raised concerns about the breakdown in communication and the need for consequences.</span>

Khan and most senior leaders of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) have been rejected as candidates for the February 8 vote in what they say is a campaign by the military-led establishment to thwart their participation. PTI planned a massive national and global telethon Sunday evening to launch its manifesto and raise campaign funds, but internet disruptions started from early evening.</span>

The 67-year-old yoga teacher has been a constant support for the couple during a challenging year. Doria&#x27;s presence has been especially helpful as Meghan and Harry faced setbacks in their Hollywood endeavors. She has become a mother figure in the household, providing care for the grandchildren and giving Harry the alone time he needs. This close bond serves as a distraction from the ongoing tensions with the UK-based family.</span>

It should also be noted that unlike last year, winter has returned with a vengeance to the front-lines. The grounds are frozen, and this is perfect for Russia to open-up another front in the war. 
I concur with the Military Summary&#x27;s analysis in the top video that Russia will probably be launching a major offensive in the direction of Kharkiv.</span>

Washington Post: Israel’s talk of expanding war to Lebanon alarms U.S. 
ISTANBUL — President Biden has dispatched his top aides to the Middle East with a critical objective: Prevent a full-blown war from erupting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
Israel has made clear it views as untenable the regular exchange of fire between its forces and Hezbollah along the border and may soon launch a major military operation in Lebanon. 
“We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Friday, “but we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over.”
U.S. officials are concerned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may see an expanded fight in Lebanon as key to his political survival amid domestic criticism of his government’s failure to prevent Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which killed an estimated 1,200 people and resulted in some 240 hostages being taken to Gaza.

The defense chief is facing criticism for keeping his bosses in the dark. 
At a White House meeting last week, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, noticed that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was absent. A top Pentagon official, Sasha Baker, was there in his place. 
There was nothing obviously unsettling about this. Austin was scheduled to work from home and lower-level aides often sit in for their boss. 
But what neither Sullivan nor Baker knew at that moment was that Austin was already hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, with complications from an undisclosed surgical procedure. 
 Days later, Austin’s secret hospitalization has spiraled into a drama engulfing the upper echel…</span>

Washington Post: Obama, worried about Trump, urges Biden circle to bolster campaign 
The former president shared his thoughts about the reelection campaign during a private lunch with Biden at the White House 
Former president Barack Obama has raised questions about the structure of President Biden’s reelection campaign, discussing the matter directly with Biden and telling the president’s aides and allies the campaign needs to be empowered to make decisions without clearing them with the White House, according to three people familiar with the conversations. 
Obama grew “animated” in discussing the 2024 election and former president Donald Trump’s potential return to power, one of the people said, and has suggested to Biden’s advisers that the campaign needs more top-level decision-makers at its headquarters in Wilmington, Del. — or it must empower the people already in place. Obama has not recommended specific individuals, but he has mentioned David Plouffe, who managed Obama’s 2008 race, as the type of senior strategist needed at the Biden campaign. 
Obama’s conversation with Biden on the subject took place during a private lunch at the White House in recent months, one of the people said, a meeting that has not been previously reported. Biden, who has long used Obama as a sounding board, invited his former boss to lunch, and the two discussed a range of topics including the 2024 election.

* Republican AGs from 27 states filed a brief on Saturday backing Trump 
* Trump is appealing a Colorado court decision to remove him from state&#x27;s ballot 
* The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on February 8 
Republican attorneys general from 27 states have filed a court brief supporting Donald Trump in his Supreme Court battle to remain on Colorado&#x27;s 2024 presidential ballot. 
In a 22-page &#x27;friend of the court&#x27; brief filed on Saturday, the attorneys general called on the high court to strike down a Colorado court decision barring Trump under the 14th Amendment&#x27;s insurrectionist ban. 
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on February 8, and its decision on Trump&#x27;s eligibility to run for president will have far-reaching implications for the November election, after Maine acted separately to ban Trump on similar grounds.

WNU Editor: I am confident that the Supreme Court will overturn efforts by Democrats to use the law and regulations to ban the former President. But in the interim the Democrats are accomplishing their goal of not only diverting Trumps&#x27; focus away from the campaign and to the courts, but also draining his campaign coffers. 
Here is an easy prediction. In the even that the Supreme does choose to keep the ban (or some version) in place, the &quot;chaos&quot; and precedent that it will spawn will damage the entire US electoral process for decades.</span>

Famine is “around the corner” as people in Gaza face the “highest levels of food insecurity ever recorded,” according to UN emergency relief chief Martin Griffiths. 
Citing a death toll in the tens of thousands, attacks on medical facilities and a lack of functioning hospitals, Griffiths said in a statement issued Friday that Gaza had become “a place of death and despair.”
“Hope has never been more elusive,” he added. 
A public health disaster is unfolding as infectious diseases spread in overcrowded shelters as sewers spill over, Griffiths said, adding that around 180 Palestinian women “are giving birth daily amidst this chaos.”

An education department official resigned this week, and 17 staffers sent an anonymous letter calling for a ceasefire 
Dissent inside the Biden administration over the president’s Gaza policy is growing, with a public resignation this week of a Department of Education official, and a letter signed by more than a dozen Biden campaign staffers calling for a ceasefire and the conditioning of aid to Israel. 
“It’s pretty extraordinary levels of dissent,” said Josh Paul, a career official working on arms sales at the state department who resigned in protest in October, of the mounting signs of discontent. “I am hearing in recent weeks from people who are thinking more seriously about resigning.”

The news came as a shock to top staff, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan. 
The Pentagon did not tell President Joe Biden and other top officials about Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s hospitalization for three days, three U.S. officials said. 
National security adviser Jake Sullivan and other senior White House aides didn’t know of Austin’s Jan. 1 hospitalization until the Defense Department sent over word Jan. 4, two other U.S. officials said. Sullivan informed Biden shortly after DOD’s Thursday notification. 
The officials said it was highly unlikely that Austin conveyed word to Biden privately before Sullivan’s briefing. “If Jake didn’t know, no way the president knew,…</span>

The Telegraph: Israel-Hamas war: IDF brings enormous blimp out of retirement to deter Hezbollah 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has brought an enormous radar blimp out of retirement to patrol its border with Lebanon. 
The Sky Dew, a white high-altitude balloon which is used to detect missiles and drones, was retired in 2022 amid unspecified setbacks in its development. 
But it has now been confirmed to be back in use after being photographed over northern Israel on Saturday.

JERUSALEM/BEIRUT/ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Lebanon&#x27;s Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said on Saturday it had fired rockets at Israel and its arch-foe said it had struck a &quot;terrorist cell&quot; in retaliation, as top U.S. and EU diplomats visited the region to seek ways to halt spillover from the war. 
Shortly after rocket sirens sounded across northern Israel, the Israeli military said that &quot;approximately 40 launches from Lebanon toward the area of Meron in northern Israel were identified&quot;. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

Business Insider: China&#x27;s back at it with its balloons 
* More Chinese spy balloons appear to be drifting around. 
* This time, Beijing is flying the balloons over neighboring Taiwan. 
* Last year, China sparked a diplomatic crisis when it floated a spy balloon over the US. 
China&#x27;s high-altitude balloons are back. 
And this time Beijing is flying the balloons over neighboring Taiwan, possibly as an ominous warning message before the self-governing island&#x27;s high-stakes elections. 
Last year, China floated a spy balloon above the continental United States, sparking a diplomatic crisis before the device was shot down by a US fighter jet. 
Since last month, Taiwan&#x27;s defense ministry has reported more than a dozen sightings of balloons from China floating over the Taiwan Strait and into the island&#x27;s airspace before ultimately disappearing.

Daily Mail/Reuters: Pentagon is slammed for keeping Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&#x27;s hospitalization secret for FIVE DAYS, as wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine 
* U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was admitted to hospital on New Year&#x27;s Day for unspecified complications following an elective surgery 
* The Pentagon has been criticized for not revealing that information for five days while the US plays key national security roles in the wars in Israel and Ukraine 
The Pentagon has been criticized for keeping U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&#x27;s  hospitalization secret for five days, after he experienced complications following an elective surgery. 
Austin, who is 70, sits just below President Joe Biden at the top of the chain of command of the U.S. military and his duties require him being available at a moment&#x27;s notice to respond to any manner of national security crisis. 
It is not clear whether Austin ever lost consciousness before or after he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on New Year&#x27;s Day.

The Guardian:  Kim Ju-ae likely heir to North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, says South’s spy agency

 
Intense speculation over future role of daughter, reportedly 10, comes as North Korea fires shells near South Korean islands 
The young daughter of Kim Jong-un is seen as her father’s heir apparent, South Korea’s spy agency has said, after speculation that the North Korean ruler is grooming her to become the fourth member of the dynasty to lead the country since its foundation more than seven decades ago. 
There has been intense international speculation about Kim Ju-ae, who is reportedly about 10 years old, since she made her first public appearance in November 2022 when she watched a long-range missile test launch with her father.

Since the early days of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the people of Ukraine have had access to a single source of television news — an all-day broadcast packed with footage of Ukrainian tanks blasting Russian positions, medics operating near the frontline and political leaders rallying support abroad. 
The show, Telemarathon United News, has been a major tool of Ukraine’s information war, praised by the government officials who regularly appear on it for its role in countering Russian disinformation and maintaining morale.
“It’s a weapon,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said last January of the program, which is jointly produced and broadcast 24/7 by the country’s biggest television channels.

WNU Editor: Getting unfiltered news on the war from the Ukrainian side is becoming next to impossible now. For example. The penalty to post a Russian drone/missile strike on social media now carries heavy prison terms, and everyone is keeping their opinions to themselves. I am surprised that the New York Times got some people to talk.</span>

                              <span>AFP: As losses mount, Ukrainians fiercely debate future of draft 
After an initial outpouring of patriotism in the months after Russia&#x27;s invasion began, the realities of the battlefield -- and mobilisation -- have largely set in among Ukraine&#x27;s population. 
Heavy casualties and almost two years of grinding trench warfare have sparked a fierce debate on the future of the draft, an ever more pertinent topic as the army struggles to fill its ranks. 
President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last month the military wanted to mobilise up to half a million people to battle the 600,000 or so Russian soldiers deployed in Ukraine.

The January 2024 issue of Special Warfare Magazine is available in PDF here: https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/05/2003369571/-1/-1/1/SWM_JAN%2024_VOL%2036%20ISSUE%202.PDF
The Commanding General&#x27;s message and table of conte​nts are below. The issue focuses on the transformation of the US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.  
I especially call attention to two articles: the establishment of the PSYWAR School (psychological warfare) and the Irregular Warfare Academy. 
The current and all past issues are available at this link below.

                              <span>The United States on Friday criticized Burundi&#x27;s President Evariste Ndayishimiye after he called for public stoning of same-sex couples, the latest anti-gay broadside by an East African leader.
&quot;The United States is deeply troubled by President Ndayishimiye&#x27;s remarks targeting certain vulnerable and marginalized Burundians,&quot; State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.
&quot;We call on all of Burundi&#x27;s leaders to respect the inherent dignity and inalienable rights, including equal access to justice, of every member of Burundian society,&quot; he said.
The statement did not explicitly mention LGBTQ rights, a delicate topic in much of Africa, but was a clear reference to remarks by Ndayishimiye at a public event late last month.
Responding to a question on gay couples, Ndayishimiye said, &quot;Personally, I think if we see these kind of individuals in Burundi, we should put them in a stadium and stone them.&quot;
Burundi&#x27;s relationship has improved in recent years with the United States, which had imposed sanctions in 2015 over a deadly crackdown on dissent as Ndayishimiye&#x27;s predecessor Pierre Nkurunziza controversially sought a third term.
The United States in 2022 agreed to a five-year aid package with Burundi after removing sanctions, in part crediting reforms by Ndayishimiye.
The US statement Friday did not threaten repercussions. Last month, the United States restricted visas to officials from Uganda who implement a new law that carries potential death sentences for homosexual relations.
President Joe Biden promised on taking office in 2021 to advocate forcefully at home and abroad for LGBTQ rights, although US diplomats often say a quiet approach is more effective.</span>

At the start of every year the &quot;galette des rois&quot;, or king cake, fills bakeries across the country and there&#x27;s one to suit everyone&#x27;s taste. In this show, we find out more about the origins of this French culinary tradition which, contrary to popular belief, doesn&#x27;t date back to the Three Kings but to the Saturnalia feasts in ancient Rome. We also take you to the bakery that won this year&#x27;s title for best galette in the greater Paris area. Yasmine Menacer, its head pastry chef, gives us some of her baking tips.</span>

That could put President Joe Biden in the center of a messy Middle East conflict in the midst of a bruising re-election campaign. 
Biden administration officials are drawing up plans for the U.S. to respond to what they’re increasingly concerned could expand from a war in Gaza to a wider, protracted regional conflict. 
Four officials familiar with the matter, including a senior administration official, described internal conversations about scenarios that could potentially draw the U.S. into another Middle East war. All were granted anonymity to speak about sensitive, ongoing national security discussions.

WNU Editor: Bottom line. The groundwork is being laid for even more US military aid being shipped to Israel and to support their war against Hezbollah.  The US is also clearly in planning stage to launch military operations targeting the Houthis in Yemen.

Update #2: I am not optimistic .... A widened Middle East war would be a disaster, but it can still be avoided (Stephen Collinson, Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN)

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week with the goals of getting Israel to curtail attacks that are killing thousands of Palestinian civilians and preventing the war from spreading across the region. 
But previously unreported details of a clash between Mr. Blinken and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel point to the challenges ahead. 
During a private meeting in November, Mr. Blinken told Mr. Netanyahu that the Israelis would have to agree to a series of pauses in the fighting in Gaza to let more aid flow into the war zone and to allow civilians to leave areas under attack.

WNU Editor: The EU&#x27;s top diplomat is also in the region trying to defuse the situation .... US and Europe in diplomatic push to stop escalation of Gaza war (RTE). 
A prediction. This diplomatic push is going to fail. Israel is not going to change its war goals, and on the opposite sides the Arabs are furious with the military support that the U.S. is giving to Israel. 
This is a region where the &quot;dogs of war&quot; have been unleashed. And what concerns me is that I see no end to where all of this is heading.

Wall Street Journal: Russia Moves Forward With Plans to Buy Iranian Ballistic Missiles 
Russia is planning to buy short-range ballistic missiles from Iran, a step that would enhance Moscow’s ability to target Ukraine’s infrastructure at a critical moment in the conflict, U.S. officials said. 
Moscow’s plans have provoked deep concern within the Biden administration and come as support wanes in Congress for continued U.S. military assistance for Ukraine. Lawmakers have yet to pass a bill that would provide additional funding for Ukraine. 
“The United States is concerned that Russian negotiations to acquire close-range ballistic missiles from Iran are actively advancing,” one of the U.S. officials said. “We assess that Russia intends to purchase missile systems from Iran.” 
Delivery of the Iranian missiles could happen as soon as this spring if the purchase proceeds, but U.S. officials don’t believe the deal has been completed.

                              <span>ABC News Australia: Islamic State claims responsibility for deadly attack in Iran, as Tehran vows revenge 
The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings targeting a commemoration for an Iranian general slain in a 2020 US drone strike, the worst militant attack to strike Iran in decades as the wider Middle East remains on edge. 
The militant group made the claim on social media.

Wednesday&#x27;s attack in Kerman killed at least 84 people and injured another 284. 
It targeted a ceremony honouring Revolutionary Guard general Qassem Soleimani, held as an icon by supporters of the country&#x27;s theocracy and viewed by the US military as a deadly foe who aided militants who killed American troops in Iraq.

                              <span>Politico.eu:  Expensive fuel and million dollar missiles: Counting the cost of the Red Sea crisis 
The standoff between Iran-backed Houthis and the West is taking a toll on the world economy. 
The combat reports from Western navies operating in the Red Sea in recent days read like missives from a war zone — anti-ship missiles shot down, boats full of fighters sunk. But this conflict is playing out in one of the world’s busiest waterways and the knock-on disruption to global trade routes has the potential to reverberate around the globe. 
Attacks on commercial shipping by Yemen’s Houthi militants have spiked in recent weeks in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, with dozens of cargo ships and fuel tankers targeted or delayed as a result of the fighting.

While a U.S.-led coalition has been deployed to keep peace in the region, the impact of the burgeoning conflict is already being felt in a number of sectors. And, with Iran vowing to ensure its long-running efforts to pressure Israel continue, it’s likely the crisis has only just begun.

Kyiv Post: Germany Sends New Military Aid to Ukraine

 
Along with fighting vehicles and tanks, the aid includes the IRIS-T air defense missiles, which have been essential in preventing Russian missiles from hitting Ukrainian cities. 
Germany sent defense missiles, infantry fighting vehicles, radars, trucks and other equipment to Ukraine. 
The delivery comes in the wake of the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
According to the government’s website, Germany supplied Ukraine with a Skynex air defense system with ammunition, missiles for the IRIS-T SLM air defense system, ammunition for Leopard 2 A6 tanks, and almost 10,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
