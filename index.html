                              <span>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says US President Joe Biden welcomed the fact that he is going to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping. 

Mr Albanese’s remarks come after the Prime Minister wrapped up a state visit to the United States, strengthening ties and pushing for key AUKUS legislation to be passed this year. 

A major theme of the visit was policy in the Indo-Pacific, particularly towards China, and US President Joe Biden had some pointed criticism for the People’s Republic ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to China in November.  

“Australia and China have different political systems, of course, and different values,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell. 

“One of the reasons why the relationship with the United States is so close is because we do have that common commitment to human rights, to democracy, and to our values. 

“It’s important that Australia stabilise the relationship – that’s something that the US is seeking as well.”</span>

                              <span>The month-long Vatican meeting on the future of the Roman Catholic Church ended without clear positions on issues such as women deacons and LGBT inclusion. The meeting, called a Synod of Bishops, allowed women and lay people to vote on Church affairs for the first time. However, the final report did not take a stand on LGBT issues despite discussions beforehand. The report mentioned the need to hear and accompany marginalized individuals but did not call for greater inclusion. LGBT advocates expressed disappointment with the report. The pope will close the gathering with a Mass on Sunday.</span>

                              <span>The extensive tunnel network built by the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip poses a significant threat to Israeli troops and the Palestinian population. Clearing and collapsing these tunnels is crucial for dismantling Hamas, but it is a challenging task that strips the Israeli military of its technological advantages. The tunnels provide Hamas with hiding places and the ability to choose the time and location of engagement. Israeli airstrikes have targeted these tunnels, but combating underground warfare is difficult due to the abundance of ambush opportunities.</span>

The high number of casualties has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues, making it difficult to perform traditional funeral rituals. Many bodies are unrecognizable due to decomposition or the absence of surviving family members. In an attempt to increase the chances of identification, families are resorting to wearing identification bracelets and writing names on their children&#x27;s bodies.</span>

Turkey&#x27;s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, referred to Hamas as &#x27;mujahideen&#x27; defending their lands and cancelled his visit to Israel. Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, accused Israel of committing &quot;a crime against humanity&quot; in its war in Gaza.</span>

The parade was led by a Ugandan man who had fled his country after being arrested for being gay. The march aimed to raise awareness for LGBT rights in Africa, particularly in Uganda, where the death penalty for homosexuality was introduced in May. South Africa, in contrast, legalized same-sex marriage in 2006 and is the only African country to have done so.</span>

This activism has also had broader implications, with some colleges facing accusations of antisemitism and losing donor support.</span>

                              <span>Halloween celebrations in South Korea were subdued on the eve of the first anniversary of the harrowing party crush that killed 159 people. Many restaurants, bars, department stores and amusement parks are avoiding Halloween-themed events as a sign of respect for the victims. Few people clad in Halloween costumes were seen Saturday in Seoul’s popular Itaewon neighbourhood, the site of last year’s deadly surge when many revellers and others packed an alley, causing people to fall on each other like dominoes. The walls of the narrow, sloped alley in Itaewon were plastered with numerous Post-it notes with condolence messages that read “We won’t forget you” and “We’ll remember you”. A mourning station established in central Seoul received many visitors, who laid white flowers and burned incense in front of photos of the victims.  In Seoul’s Hongdae area, another entertainment zone, there were only a few people wearing Halloween outfits. Authorities have deployed thousands of police, emergency and other officials since Friday for crowd control and safety of pedestrians in Itaewon and 15 other major nightlife districts in Seoul. About 200 police officers were separately mobilised to monitor narcotics use and violent crime, according to Seoul police. “I offer a deep apology again by bearing the sorrow and heavy responsibility for the disaster in my heart,” Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon said on Friday. “The way to overcome the pains and sorrow of the disaster is preventing this kind of incident from happening again.” Bereaved families are to hold a formal memorial service on Sunday.  In January, a police special investigation team concluded that police and municipal officials failed to work out effective crowd control steps despite correctly anticipating a huge number of people in Itaewon. Investigators also concluded that police had ignored hotline calls by pedestrians who warned of swelling crowds before the surge turned deadly. The Itaewon crush caused a nationwide outpouring of grief as the dead were mostly in their 20s…</span>

Military Times/AP: No, the US military isn’t ‘laying the groundwork’ for a draft

 
Claim: The U.S. military is planning to reinstitute the draft.

 
AP’s Assessment: False. Defense officials confirm the armed forces have made no such recommendation to Congress or the president, which are the entities empowered to authorize a draft.

 
The Facts: With America’s allies in Europe and the Middle East embroiled in conflicts with no end in sight, social media posts are claiming the U.S. military is considering mandating regular citizens to enlist in the armed forces. 
A number of those are sharing a headline from a Sept. 25 article from the Mises Institute, a libertarian group in Alabama that reads: “The US Military Is Laying the Groundwork to Reinstitute the Draft.”

WNU Editor: &quot;U.S. military draft&quot;  has been trending on search engines for the past few weeks. Videos like the one above and rumors on social media are probably fueling it .... Video of Biden calling for a military draft is AI-generated, not real | Fact check (USA Today). More here ....

Fact Check: Video of Joe Biden calling for a military draft was created with AI (Reuters).
Just one more note. 
On the eve of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine the Kyiv government was telling everyone to not worry, and to stay home. Within 24 hours of Russia&#x27;s invasion, the Ukraine government immediately closed its border to men of military age who can be drafted. The U.S. government will do the same. Telling everyone that everything is fine, until the very moment that the &quot;shit hits the fan&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Warzone: B-21 Raider Has Begun Taxi Tests 
The Air Force is hopeful that the B-21 Raider stealth bomber will take to the skies for the first time before the end of the year. 
The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s first pre-production B-21 Raider stealth bomber is now undergoing taxi testing, moving around the sprawling Plant 42 in Palmdale under its own power. This is the latest developmental milestone for the aircraft as it continues to move closer to its first flight, which could come before the end of the year. 
&quot;I can confirm the B-21 is conducting ground taxi activities. Rigorous testing is a critical step in the B-21 flight test program,&quot; an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to The War Zone today. &quot;Extensive testing evaluates systems, components, and functionalities. This testing allows us to mitigate risks, optimize design, and enhance operational effectiveness.&quot;

Reuters: US halts exports of most civilian firearms for 90 days 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. has stopped issuing export licenses for most civilian firearms and ammunition for 90 days for all non-governmental users, the Commerce Department said on Friday, citing national security and foreign policy interests. 
The Commerce Department did not provide further details for the pause, which also includes shotguns and optical sights, but said an urgent review will assess the &quot;risk of firearms being diverted to entities or activities that promote regional instability, violate human rights, or fuel criminal activities.&quot;

WNU editor: This is unprecedented. The only exceptions to this export ban are Israel and Ukraine. 
So why the ban and this hoarding of weapons and ammo? 
My gut tells me that with US military stockpiles now at an all time low and supply chain disruptions are  growing. In this environment the US has made the decision that with international relations deteriorating and threats of a major war growing everyday, the US needs to replenish some of their stockpiles ASAP.</span>

Gazans who have refused to leave the north of the enclave despite Israel&#x27;s warnings to do so are living in a state of &#x27;panic, fear and chaos&#x27; amid the heaviest bombardments yet since October 7 and a total communications blackout. 
Shocking images were leaked out of the Palestinian occupied territory on Saturday as bombardments deprived civilians, journalists and aid agencies of electricity, internet or phone signal.

&quot;Since early Friday evening, combined combat forces of armour, combat engineers and infantry have been operating on the ground in the northern Gaza Strip,&quot; the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. &quot;As part of the operation, IDF soldiers identified terrorist cells attempting to launch anti-tank missiles and mortar shells and struck them. IDF soldiers also identified and destroyed a booby-trapped structure,&quot; it said.</span>

Sixty-three others were injured in the accident that happened on the Cairo-Alexandria desert road, the ministry added in an online statement. 
Earlier Saturday, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported that investigations revealed an oil leak from a passing car led to a collision among a large number of vehicles with several of them catching fire.</span>

Her conduct was roundly mocked by Austin Bailey in an editorial for the Arkansas Times Friday.
&quot;A new $33 million facility will create 30 new jobs to crank out missiles for Israel’s Iron Dome and a similar U.S. system, the SkyHunter® missile. The first batch won’t roll off conveyor belts until 2025, but that didn’t stop Sanders and the defense contractors from throwing a huzzah to Israel and yawping Arkansas’s hawkish swagger,&quot; wrote Bailey. &quot;&#x27;We don’t shy…</span>

                              <span>Several years ago, dozens of elephants mysteriously dropped dead in Zimbabwe, a landlocked country in southern Africa. 
Now, researchers finally know why. 
Over several months of 2020, 35 African elephant carcasses were discovered in the Kavango–Zambezi conservation area, which encompasses five countries and is home to Africa’s largest population of elephants. 
Intriguingly, the carcasses showed no signs of outward trauma or distress; their skin was bite-free, and their tusks were intact, which ruled out predators and poachers as the cause of death.</span>

Physicists Use Quantum Entanglement to Simulate Time Travel
Physicists have conducted a conceptual study utilizing quantum entanglement to simulate closed timelike curves, effectively replicating time travel at the quantum scale. But no particles actually traveled back in time. Gedankenexperiment Tests Time Travel Hypothetically The research was a “thought experiment” examining the notion of time travel by modeling it theoretically using quantum principles. Read […]

                              <span>The onePulse Foundation has announced that it is dropping its plans to build a museum to honor the victims of the 2016 massacre at a gay nightclub in Florida. The foundation cited financial concerns, including soaring construction costs and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the city of Orlando is still moving forward with constructing a memorial for the victims. The efforts to build a memorial and museum have been slow, with the nightclub&#x27;s owners only recently agreeing to sell the property.</span>

Prosecutors believe that these once-rival criminal organizations have set aside their differences to form a grand alliance, exploiting business opportunities in Italy&#x27;s prosperous north. The mafia groups have shifted their focus to white-collar crime and legitimate investments, funneling drug trafficking profits into various sectors.</span>

                              <span>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed concerns about President Biden&#x27;s cognitive decline after their meeting. Johnson emphasized that this observation was not a personal insult to the President and mentioned the differences between Biden&#x27;s past performances and recent speeches. The meeting revolved around Biden&#x27;s request for aid to Ukraine, Israel, and other projects. Johnson confirmed that his caucus did not approve of packaging foreign aid together and advocated for separating these issues.</span>

Israel says it is preparing a ground invasion, but has been urged by the US and Arab countries to delay in order to avoid civilian casualties. Two US fighter jets struck weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria in retaliation for attacks on US forces by Iranian-backed militias.</span>

Including abuse by lay members, the percentage rises to 1.13%. The commission also interviewed 487 victims who highlighted the lasting emotional impact of the abuse.

                              <span>MIAMI — A retired Colombian army officer who pleaded guilty to leading a group of commandos in the assassination of Haiti’s president was sentenced Friday to life in prison in Miami federal court, though he’s hoping for less severe punishment in a cooperation deal with federal prosecutors. Germán Alejandro Rivera Garcia, aka “Colonel Mike,” declined to say anything when asked by U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez if he wanted to comment before his sentencing.

Growing international distress at the conditions for 2.3 million people trapped under the heaviest air strikes Israel has ever unleashed on the Mediterranean enclave led major powers this week to call on Israel to allow such pauses to get aid in and Israeli hostages held by Islamist militant group Hamas out.

Just hours earlier, Pessah’s wife alerted him that Israel had been suddenly attacked. That day, nobody could reach Yair Yaakov, his girlfriend Meirav Tal or his two sons.

                              <span>Former President Donald Trump filed a new motion in the federal 2020 election interference case, hinting that he plans to adopt a new defense.
Specifically, he wants to introduce supposed classified reports of foreign interference that support the merits of his efforts to overturn the election.
&quot;The Indictment in this case adopts classified assessments by the Intelligence Community and others that minimized, and at times ignored, efforts by foreign actors to influence and interfere with the 2020 election,&quot; said the filing. &quot;President Trump will offer classified information at trial relating to foreign influence activities that impacted the 2016 and 2020 elections, as well as efforts by his administration to combat those activities. President Trump will also present classified information relating to the biased and politicized nature of the intelligence assessments that he and others rejected during the events in question. Collectively, this evidence will undercut central theories of the prosecution and establish that President Trump acted at all times in good faith and on the belief that he was doing what he had been elected to do.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
&quot;Mostly appears to be IC assessments of foreign interference,&quot; said legal analyst Bradley Moss in response to the new filing, in a post on X. &quot;This should be interesting.&quot;
It is unclear why Trump would put this evidence forward, as commentators have noted that Trump trying to actually prove his long-discredited claims of voter fraud and election rigging would not be relevant to the crimes of which he is accused. He is more broadly expected to mount an advice of counsel defense, although special counsel Jack Smith has long been laying the groundwork to destroy such a legal strategy.
Ironically, the other federal case against Trump that Smith is pursuing pertains to his alleged illegal theft and retention of classified information in unsecured boxes at his Mar-a-Lago country club in South Florida.</span>

                              <span>Time: Biden Cast Doubt on Gaza’s Death Toll. Palestinian Officials Responded With 6,747 Names 
In the past three weeks, more than 1,400 people in Israel and 7,000 Palestinians have been killed amid fighting between Israel and Hamas. That is, if you believe the casualty figures coming out of the region. This week, U.S. President Joe Biden suggested that the Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which has been under heavy bombardment by Israel following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre, is not to be trusted. 
“I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging a war,” Biden said at a press conference on Wednesday. “But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.” The President didn’t offer further evidence for his skepticism of the Palestinian health ministry&#x27;s data, which the U.S. State Department has cited both internally and publicly, in the latter case as recently as March. (When asked to provide evidence to support Biden&#x27;s statement, the White House referred TIME to comments made by U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, who on Thursday reiterated the President’s assertion that the death toll cannot be taken “at face value” because the “Gaza Ministry of Health is just a front for Hamas.”)

Zero Hedge: Tucker Carlson Blasts Zelensky&#x27;s Orwellian War On Orthodox Christianity &amp; West&#x27;s Deafening Silence 
A proposed new Ukrainian law which will ban the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for merely maintaining communion and ties to the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow is poised to go into effect. This after its churches and monasteries have already in some instances been subject to brutal raids by police or else ultra-nationalist thugs, which has been met with international silence despite the egregious violation of religions freedom. Bishops have been hauled before courts, priests have been thrown in jail, monks and nuns have been thrown onto the street.

Bloomberg: House Will Consider Ukraine, Israel Aid Separately, Johnson Says 
(Bloomberg) -- The House of Representatives will consider new military assistance for Ukraine and Israel as separate measures, the newly installed speaker said Thursday, complicating President Joe Biden’s attempts to secure support for both US allies. 
“Our consensus among House Republicans is that we need to bifurcate those issues,” Speaker Mike Johnson told Sean Hannity of Fox News. He said he delivered that message to White House officials after meeting with Biden earlier in the day.

VOA: Exclusive: $150 Million in Ukraine Military Aid Expected Wednesday 
PENTAGON — The United States is providing up to $150 million in additional military aid for Ukraine in a package expected as soon as Wednesday, three U.S. military officials tell VOA, a week after Ukraine used its newest weapon from the United States to pummel Russian military targets deep into Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine. 
The package includes more GMLRS rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), munitions for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), TOW anti-tank missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles and 155 mm rounds, according to two of the officials who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss the package prior to its announcement.

The repercussions will be severe either way. The group has used the threat of its weapons as a deterrence against Israel, but Hizballah leadership also knows that

                              <span>A former drug dealer has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for manslaughter in the overdose death of 14-year-old Carson Crimeni in 2019. B.C. Supreme Court heard that other youth posted video of the boy’s distress on social media before he died. Crimeni&#x27;s father, Aron Crimeni, and his grandfather, Darrel Crimeni, say they hope the case offers lessons for other young people. (Oct. 26, 2023)</span>

                              <span>An IDF spokesperson has claimed Israeli troops plan to “dismantle totally” all of Hamas’ military infrastructure in Gaza. 

Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told Sky News Australia the country was involved in a war it “did not start”. 

“It started by Hamas crossing into our communities and butchering more than one thousand of our civilians,&quot; he said.  

“In response to that we are going to dismantle, totally, all of the military infrastructure in Gaza which facilitated this attack and we are going to dismantle Hamas from ever being capable of doing it again.” 

The Lieutenant’s comments follow a targeted ground raid by Israel’s military in northern Gaza on Thursday. 

A wider offensive is expected.</span>

A pilot project being launched in Atlantic Canada also aims to make it easier for people to switch to heat pumps. (Oct. 26, 2023)</span>

The beetle infestation has even spread to urban areas, requiring the removal of pine trees from residents&#x27; gardens.</span>

However, Kubrakov stated that all available routes established by the Ukrainian Navy are valid and being used by civilian vessels. The corridor was launched in August as a &quot;humanitarian corridor&quot; to bypass the de facto blockade in the Black Sea after Russia quit a U.N.-brokered deal.</span>

Despite potential consequences, Trump&#x27;s defiance of gag orders may continue to appeal to his voting base.</span>

Reuters: 900 US troops heading to Middle East to bolster defenses as attacks surge 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 900 more U.S. troops have arrived in the Middle East or are heading there to bolster air defenses for U.S. personnel amid a surge in attacks by Iran-affiliated groups, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
As tensions soar over the Israel-Hamas war, U.S. and coalition troops have been attacked at least 12 times in Iraq and four times in Syria in the last week, Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters. 
A total of 21 U.S. forces have suffered minor injuries, the vast majority of them traumatic brain injuries.

WNU Editor: One source that I trust is saying that two more US aircraft carrier strike groups are going to be deployed to the Middle East in the coming days. This will make a total of 4 US aircraft carrier strike groups being deployed to the Middle East. 

If true, this is not a deployment to deter other actors to get involved in the Israel - Hamas war, this is a deployment to strike a major target.</span>

Politico: The EU prepares for war — and this French ship is the tip of the spear 
France’s powerful amphibious helicopter carrier is a floating village with gyms and a boulangerie … plus missiles, machine guns, landing craft, choppers and tanks. 
ABOARD THE FRENCH HELICOPTER CARRIER TONNERRE — John Denver’s &quot;Country Roads,&quot; a folk song from 1971, resounds through the Tonnerre. 
It’s 7:30 a.m., and some of the crew aboard the Mistral-class amphibious helicopter carrier are already eating breakfast — loading up on coffee, bread and jam ahead of a planned exercise to storm a Spanish beach. It&#x27;s been a short night, and plans for the landing have changed several times. 
The French assault vessel — 199 meters long, 32 meters wide and able to carry 21,500 metric tons — is a key element in the European Union’s first live military exercise in October off the southern coast of Spain.

                              <span>CNBC: U.S. GDP grew at a 4.9% annual pace in the third quarter, better than expected 
* Gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a 4.9% annualized pace in the third quarter, ahead of the 4.7% estimate. 
* The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending. 
* While the report could give the Fed some impetus to keep policy tight, traders were still pricing in no chance of an interest rate hike when the central bank meets next week.
The U.S. economy grew even faster than expected in the third quarter, buoyed by a strong consumer in spite of higher interest rates, ongoing inflation pressures, and a variety of other domestic and global headwinds.

* Missiles, machine guns, ammunition and rocket propelled weapons are visible 
Chilling footage has emerged showing the elaborate tunnel systems that Hamas terrorists have been using to move weapons, hostages and stage attacks on Israel. 
The footage gives insight into the claustrophobic conditions the Palestinian Islamist fighters have been operating in. 

It shows militants using metal rods and shovels to dig the tunnels. 
Many of them appear to be quite cramped and dark with footage showing the fighters slightly slouching as they move through the tunnels guided by headtorches.

Rolling Stone: Trump Plots to Pull Out of NATO — If He Doesn’t Get His Way 
At the very least, the former president wants to put the U.S. on “standby” mode — and undermine NATO’s principle of collective defense

Donald Trump wanted to pull the United States out of NATO during his first term, but was repeatedly talked out of it by senior administration officials. 
For a possible second term in the White House, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner is already discussing how he could actually get it done, if his demands aren’t met by NATO. He and his policy-wonk allies are also gaming out how he could dramatically wind down American involvement to merely a “standby” position in NATO, in Trump’s own words.

New Delhi said in a statement that it attaches “high importance to this case” and will “take up the verdict with Qatari authorities.”  
A Qatar court has announced the death penalty for eight Indians arrested in the country last year, the Indian government said on Thursday, adding it was “deeply shocked” by the verdict. 
New Delhi said in a statement that it attaches “high importance to this case” and will “take up the verdict with Qatari authorities.” 
Local media has reported that the eight men, who worked with a private company in Qatar, were arrested for spying in August 2022, but Reuters could not independently confirm the charges.

                              <span>VOA: China&#x27;s Top Diplomat Arrives in Washington for Talks Ahead of Potential Biden-Xi Meeting 
State Department — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Washington Thursday for meetings with senior U.S. officials on bilateral and regional security issues as the two countries aim to maintain open communication channels.

Update #1: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Washington for high-level meetings -- Washington Post 
Update #2: As world roils, US and China seek to ease strained ties and prepare for possible Biden-Xi summit -- AP 
WNU Editor: US President Biden will be talking with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi tomorrow .... Exclusive: Biden set to speak with China&#x27;s top diplomat Wang Yi on Friday, sources say (Reuters). The Chinese are hoping this will pave the way to higher level talks .... Wang’s trip to US ‘crucial’, to pave the way for higher-level of interactions (Global Times).
As to what is my take .... I am skeptical. 
There is little common ground between the two governments. They differ on Taiwan, trade, the Israel - Hamas war, the Russia - Ukraine war, the South China Sea, and more importantly, they do not trust each other. Sighhh ..... but talking is better than not talking.</span>

“Democrats are preparing to send a resolution to the Rules Committee that would allow most of the 300-plus promotions Tuberville is blocking to be considered on the floor en bloc,” Punchbowl News reported Thursday. “This would dramatically reduce the number of votes the Senate would need to take to approve the long-stalled promotions. It would be in effect for a little over a year,” and not be a permanent change.

                              <span>Blake Masters has dropped out of the U.S. Senate race, announcing Thursday that he is running for Congress instead. It paves the way for failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake to take the Republican nomination. 
Masters, who failed in his attempt at a U.S. Senate seat in 2022 against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), announced his new campaign on social media, saying that he&#x27;s seeking the eighth congressional district. 
&quot;Biden has failed. We need Trump back. We need to stop inflation, Build the Wall, avoid WW3, and secure Arizona&#x27;s water future,&quot; the candidate said. &quot;We need to fight for our families.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
The district, which includes part of Peoria and north Glendale, is currently held by Rep. Debbie Lesko (R), who assumed office in May, 2018. Lesko announced that she was retiring earlier in 2023 and there are now 13 candidates running for the seat. 
Masters was supported and funded for his Senate run by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who pledged $5 million on the race but ultimately spent $15 million.</span>

Greene brought the resolution to the House floor after Tlaib participated in a peaceful protest at the Capitol to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
&quot;A resolution censuring Representative Rashida Tlaib for anti-Semitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex,&quot; Greene said, reading her resolution. &quot;Whereas by leading an anti-American and anti-Semitic insurrection on October 18, 2023, Rashida Tlaib followed Hezbollah&#x27;s orders to carry out a day of unprecedented anger, following an explosion at a Gazan hospital, lying about Israel&#x27;s responsibility for the attack, which United States intelligence agencies said was not perpetrated by Israel.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?
&quot;And whereas members of Congress who denounce the United States while praising terrorist organizations are unfit to hold office,&quot; she continued. &quot;Now, therefore, be it resolved that Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured.&quot;
The chair ruled that the full House would consider Greene&#x27;s resolution at a later date.

Read more below to find out. *** In 2018, Leo Blanken, Kai Thaxton, and Michael Alexander wrote “Shock of the Mundane: The Dangerous Diffusion of Basic Infantry Tactics” for War on the Rocks, in which they argued that “the marginal improvement of tactical prowess in violent non-state groups may lead to outcomes that have strategic implications for global U.S. counter-terrorist and counter-insurgent operations.”

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
