                              <span>On an otherwise typical morning, one very important component of village life appeared to be missing. The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‘Eggs’ in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‘Welcome to Egginton’ signs bookending the village, now read ‘Welcome to …Inton’ leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‘Eggs’ back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‘Easter obsessed’ village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs – one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.</span>

                              <span>Shadow Immigration Minister Dan Tehan is questioning the reasons for Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews&#x27; “secret trip” to China and why he won’t take media officials with him.

Mr Andrews announced his visit to China was to increase the desirability of Melbourne’s universities for prospective Chinese students but won’t reveal specific details.

“I’m concerned that the only reports we’ll get out of it will be by state-run media in China and I’d really like to know what the purpose is of this visit,” Mr Tehan told Sky News Australia.

“I mean he should clearly articulate what the purpose is, why he’s going, what is the outcome he’s seeking to achieve from this secret, secret trip that he’s taking that he will not take any reporters with him on.”</span>

New York Times: From Rockets to Ball Bearings, Pentagon Struggles to Feed War Machine 
WASHINGTON — The Navy admiral had a blunt message for the military contractors building precision-guided missiles for his warships, submarines and planes at a moment when the United States is dispatching arms to Ukraine and preparing for the possibility of conflict with China. 
“Look at me. I am not forgiving the fact you’re not delivering the ordnance we need. OK?” Adm. Daryl Caudle, who is in charge of delivering weapons to most of the Navy’s East Coast-based fleet, warned contractors during an industry gathering in January. “We’re talking about war-fighting, national security, and going against a competitor here and a potential adversary that is like nothing we’ve ever seen. And we can’t dillydally around with these deliveries.” 
His open frustration reflects a problem that has become worryingly apparent as the Pentagon dispatches its own stocks of weapons to help Ukraine hold off Russia and Washington warily watches for signs that China might provoke a new conflict by invading Taiwan: The United States lacks the capacity to produce the arms that the nation and its allies need at a time of heightened superpower tensions.

I received the following from a friend who is well plugged in with the Ukrainian side. I consider his information reliable:
 Volodomyr Zelensky visited Chasov Yar today to kick off an offensive to relieve Bakhmut and push the Russians back. A number of armored and artillery brigades are being moved down from the North to support such a relief operation. 
Chasov Yar may be four or so miles from Bakhmut.  Zelensky can no longer chance a visit to Bakhmut as he did earlier this month. 
As we have noted before there are somewhere between 15 to 20,000 UKA fighting inside Bakhmut, and the UKA area of control is shrinking and also bifurcated between a larger group in the western center of th…</span>

                              <span>The Gateway Pundit: Can America’s Leaders Find an Accommodation With Russia? 
I am afraid the answer is a resounding, “No!” I hope and pray that I am wrong on this point, but I see no evidence that such a shift in opinion towards Putin and all things Russian is in the offing. The United States and Soviet troops shook hands over the waters of the Elbe River on April 25, 1945. That water is now poisoned. 
A recent Gallup poll reveals the depth of the negative feeling:       
Americans’ already-negative opinions of Russia have soured further in the past year, dropping from 15% holding a favorable view to 9%. The current reading for Russia is the lowest Gallup has measured since it first asked about the “Soviet Union” in this format in 1989. 
 Russia is now the fourth country in Gallup’s polling of country favorable ratings to register a sub-10% favorable score. Iran, Iraq and North Korea have had ratings below 10% on multiple occasions. The all-time low favorable rating for any country was 3% for Iraq in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War.

WNU Editor: The only prominent US political leader that is talking about the need to find a quick and peaceful end to the Ukraine war is former President Trump. But he is going against the media narrative and public opinion. And as the above Gallup poll unfortunately reveals, in the current environment Washington is more motivated to escalate the conflict against Russia, rather than stabilizing the situation to find a peaceful solution.</span>

The tiny island of Tinian was the launch point for American planes carrying atomic bombs to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Now a new runway is being carved from the jungle, just south of World War II ruins inked with mildew. 
And on a blustery February morning a few hundred yards away at Tinian’s civilian airport, American airmen refueled Japanese fighter jets during a military exercise using more airstrips, islands and Japanese planes than the two enemies-turned-allies have ever mustered for drills in the North Pacific. 
“We’re not concerned with the past, we are concerned with the future,” said Col. Inadome Satoru, commander of Japan’s 9th Air Wing Flight Group. “We can ensure stability by showing strength.”

VOA: Iran Could Make Fuel for Nuclear Bomb in Less Than 2 Weeks, Milley Says  
Iran could make enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb in “less than two weeks” and could produce a nuclear weapon in “several more months,” according to the top U.S. military officer. 
Speaking to members of Congress on Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told lawmakers the United States “remains committed” to preventing Iran from fielding a nuclear weapon. 
“We, the United States military, have developed multiple options for national leadership to consider if or when Iran ever decides to develop an actual nuclear weapon,” Milley added.

                              <span>NBC News: Norway watches as Russian subs and aircraft step up Arctic patrols 
ABOARD THE KV SORTLAND — NATO ally Norway has announced that it is boosting the number of naval patrols near vital undersea gas pipelines off its coast, and released a trove of videos exclusively to NBC News illustrating what it sees as a growing Russian threat in the Arctic. 
The videos provided by the Royal Norwegian Air Force capture the high-stakes cat-and-mouse game between the two militaries, with Russian attack submarines patrolling near a maze of undersea pipelines carrying vast amounts of natural gas to Europe and telecommunication cables linking Europe and America. 
According to the head of the Royal Norwegian Navy, the videos indicate that Russian attack submarines and planes have expanded their presence in the High North, operating near Norway’s natural gas pipelines that represent a vital energy lifeline for Europe.

   Warzone/The Drive: Nordic Air Defense Pact Combines Forces Of Hundreds Of Fighter Aircraft 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are working to combine air defense forces in the face of the Russian threat. 
To better cope with threats emanating from Russia, the countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have created a unified Nordic air defense alliance, pooling the resources of their air forces. They have upwards of 300 fighter jets between them as well as training, transport and surveillance fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. 
Those four nations on Friday announced they signed the first Nordic Air Commanders&#x27; Intent last week during a meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
“The declaration of intent strengthens Nordic cooperation and paves the way for further strengthening of the Nordic air forces,” the four nations said Friday in a joint statement. “The ultimate goal is to be able to operate seamlessly together as one force by developing a Nordic concept for joint air operations based on already-known NATO methodology.”

RT: Putin names country behind Nord Stream blasts  
The Russian president believes Washington orchestrated the attack on the gas pipelines  
US intelligence agencies were most likely behind last September’s sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russia 24 TV on Saturday, adding that he agrees with the conclusions made by veteran American journalist Seymour Hersh. 
It would be “very difficult” to bring the entire truth to light, the Russian president admitted in comments to journalist Pavel Zarubin in the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Putin expressed his hope that at some point in time “it will be finally revealed what was done and how.”

* Iskander missile systems have already been transferred to Belarus, Putin claims  Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring 
Belarus in response to Britain&#x27;s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds, President Vladimir Putin announced today. 
The rounds which are set to be provided to Kyiv&#x27;s forces contain depleted uranium, and Moscow has falsely claimed that they have nuclear components as it escalates its confrontation with Ukraine and its allies. 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch supporter of the invasion, has long asked for the weapons on the territory, Putin said during an interview on Russian state television.

The U.S. said it carried out strikes on facilities affiliated to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria after a drone attack killed an American contractor in Syria.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Twitter Inc CEO Elon Musk has offered the social-media company&#x27;s employees stock grants at a valuation of nearly $20 billion, the Information reported on Saturday, citing a person familiar with an email Musk sent to Twitter staff.
The reported valuation is less than half of the $44 billion that Musk paid to acquire the social media platform, pointing to a drop in Twitter&#x27;s value.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters&#x27; emailed request for a comment.
Musk said in December that Twitter is on track to be &quot;roughly cash flow break-even&quot; in 2023 as top advertisers slashed their spending on the social-media platform after the billionaire&#x27; s takeover.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian Labor Party in New South Wales claimed power in a state election on Saturday, with voters backing the centre-left party&#x27;s pledges on anti-privatisation and cost of living relief.
The election in Australia&#x27;s most populous state had been touted as a tight race between the incumbent Liberal-National coalition and Labor, but the vote count on Sunday showed Labor on track to take the 47 seats needed to form majority government, after three terms in opposition.
The win marks further endorsement of the party of Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, who joined his state counterpart Chris Minns - who is set to become New South Wales&#x27; 47th premier - in Sydney on polling day.
&quot;A huge congratulations to @ChrisMinnsMP ... and the whole NSW Labor team on your election victory,&quot; Albanese said on Twitter late on Saturday.
Labor&#x27;s win in New South Wales means the party now governs at state and federal level across Australia&#x27;s mainland, leaving island state Tasmania as the conservative outlier.
&quot;After 12 years in opposition the people of New South Wales have voted for a fresh start,&quot; Minns told supporters in Sydney late on Saturday.
&quot;The people of New South Wales voted to put in a government that would put people at the heart of all decision-making&quot;.
Labor&#x27;s campaign in the state featured a pledge to rule out further privatisation of state assets, and a promise to boost public sector wages, amid cost-of-living concerns.
Outgoing premier Dominic Perrottet, a social conservative Catholic and former state treasurer, was elected premier in 2021 after his predecessor resigned after a corruption watchdog probe into whether she was involved in conduct that &quot;constituted or involved a breach of public trust&quot;.
Albanese, in the lead up to polling day, had urged voters in his home state to back Labor, saying the coalition government was &quot;in shambles&quot; due to infighting.

Residents recounted fleeing their houses and leaving animals behind.
&quot;Bad, how am I supposed to feel? Your town is burning, your life is burning, Our animals were there and no one can tell us anything,&quot; Antonio Zarzoso, 24, who had to leave the village of Puebla de Arenoso, told Reuters.
More than 500 firefighters supported by 20 planes and helicopters were working to bring the blaze under control near the village of Villanueva de Viver, emergency services said on Saturday, forcing 1,500 to leave their homes.
The blaze also spread to the Teruel area of the Aragon region, where 200 …</span>

Putin made the announcement at a time of growing tensions with the West over the Ukraine war and as some Russian commentators speculate about possible nuclear strikes. Putin told state television that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had long raised the issue of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in his country, which borders NATO member Poland.</span>

                              <span>In a Kyiv monastery that has played a crucial role in both Ukrainian and Russian history, scores of monks accused of allegiance with Moscow are defying eviction.
The government has said they must leave the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra by Wednesday but the monks say the order has no basis and plan to stay &quot;as long as physically possible&quot;.
&quot;There is no legal foundation&quot; for the expulsion, Archbishop Kliment, a spokesman for the church, told AFP in the monastery.
The monks are members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which was under the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church.
After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the Church broke off links with Russian Patriarch Kirill -- a supporter of the war.
But Ukraine&#x27;s government believes it is still de facto dependent on Moscow.

&quot;The gifting of the fragments of the Parthenon, which have been held in the Vatican Museums for more than two centuries, shows itself as an ecclesial, cultural and social gesture of friendship and solidarity with the people of Greece,&quot; Bishop Brian Farrell, secretary for promoting Christian unity, told a ceremony at the Acropolis Museum in Athens.
The marble fragments from the Parthenon, one of the marvels of the ancient world, include the head of a horse, one of the four horses drawing Athena&#x27;s mythical chariot, according to the Vatican Museums website.

                              <span>A large wildfire raging in Spain&#x27;s eastern Valencia region forced more than 1,500 people to flee their homes on Friday, providing further evidence of life-threatening consequences of the fossil fuel-driven climate crisis and bolstering the case for meaningful mitigation efforts.
Since it broke out in the municipality of Villanueva de Viver on Thursday, Spain&#x27;s first major wildfire of the year has destroyed more than 7,400 acres of forest, prompting evacuation orders in eight communities across the Castellón province.
As residents sought refuge in shelters run by the Red Cross and other charities, more than 500 firefighters—supported by 18 planes and helicopters—were still attempting to contain the blaze on Friday afternoon.

                              <span>In the world&#x27;s highest mountain range, global warming threatens thousands of glaciers, resulting in increasingly frequent natural disasters: landslides, avalanches and glacier collapses. Our reporters Alban Alvarez and Navodita Kumari travelled to the small northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, where these disasters are compounded by a rush to develop infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams.
Up in the foothills of the Himalayas, the region of Uttarakhand is getting the Indian government’s attention. The state of 10 million inhabitants, bordering both China and Nepal, has become a vast open-air building site. The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi fully intends to take advantage of the region’s geographical position to make it a hub for renewable energy. 
India, the world’s third-biggest carbon emitter, which gets 80 percent of its electricity from coal, is counting on the large-scale construction of hydroelectric power stations in the region to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. Uttarakhand certainly has assets: the state is home to dozens of rivers, especially the Ganges and the Yamuna, the country’s largest waterways. But in addition to being located in a seismic zone, Uttarakhand is threatened by global warming, resulting in the accelerated melting of its glaciers. 
For the past decade, the region has experienced natural disasters every year: landslides, avalanches, glacier collapses and even &quot;cloudbursts&quot; – sudden storms that can destroy a valley in a few minutes. In 2013, some 10,000 Hindu pilgrims died there during sudden bad weather while praying at a religious site. The bodies of almost 4,000 of them were never found.</span>

                              <span>CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited army engineers on Saturday and reviewed their training, saying that defending democracy is the armed forces&#x27; &quot;great&quot; mission, ahead of a trip next week to the United States and Central America.
China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up its military and political pressure over the past three years or so to try and force the island to accept Chinese sovereignty, viewing Tsai as a separatist.
She is making a high-profile and sensitive trip to the United States and Central America starting on Wednesday. China has condemned the United States for allowing her to go, though her visit there is technically only a transit.
At the end of the trip, Tsai is expected to meet U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in Los Angeles.
China staged war games near Taiwan in August after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.
Visiting an army base in Chiayi in southern Taiwan, Tsai reviewed their training, seeing them erect anti-tank barriers and practice martial arts.
&quot;Protecting Taiwan and defending democracy has always been our military&#x27;s great mission,&quot; she told the soldiers, accompanied by Taiwan&#x27;s Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng and National Security Council Secretary-General Wellington Koo.
&quot;I believe that only by continuously training and strengthening the military&#x27;s war preparedness can we be even more able to protect our home and defend our country,&quot; Tsai added.
Tsai has repeatedly offered talks with China, but says Taiwan will defend itself if attacked and that only the island&#x27;s people can decide their future.

Politico:  Ukraine sees no way to negotiate peace with Putin after war crimes warrant  
Kyiv sees Putin’s abduction of children as part of a genocidal attempt to wipe out its culture and identity. 
KYIV — Last week’s international arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia has made it impossible for Kyiv to accept Russia’s president as a potential interlocutor for any peace deal to end the war. 
The International Criminal Court issued its warrant on Friday. The crime of children being forcibly taken to Russia is especially sensitive as Ukrainian and Western lawyers identify the deportations as falling within the legal definition of genocide, as part of an attempt to wipe out Ukrainian cultural identity. 
Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian president’s office head and representative of Ukrainian negotiations group in Istanbul, promptly tweeted that identifying Putin as “an obvious international criminal directly means there will be no negotiations with the current Russian elite.”

Reuters: Brazil&#x27;s Lula cancels trip to China due to pneumonia -press secretary 
BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has canceled a high-profile trip to China due to medical reasons, and the March 27-31 visit will be rescheduled for a later date, his press secretary said on Saturday. 
The press secretary released a medical note stating that after a clinical evaluation, the 77-year-old Lula was diagnosed with bacterial and viral bronchopneumonia caused by influenza A, and treatment has been initiated. 
&quot;Despite clinical improvement, the medical service of the Presidency of the Republic recommends postponing the trip to China until the viral transmission cycle ends,&quot; the note said.  The Brazilian government has informed the Chinese authorities of the postponement and its intention to reschedule the visit.

USNI News: NORTHCOM: Russia Close to Persistent Nuclear Cruise Missile Attack Sub Presence off U.S. Coasts 
Russia could have its most powerful and quiet nuclear attack submarines on persistent patrols off either U.S. Coast in the next two years, the head of U.S. Northern Command told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
In response to questions from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) on the threat of Chinese and Russian cruise missile submarines operating close to the U.S., NORTHCOM commander Gen. Glen VanHerck said that the deployments of the Russian Yasen-class nuclear cruise missile attack boats have been deploying more frequently. 
“[The risk is] absolutely increasing. Within the last year, Russia has also placed their [Yasens] in the Pacific,” he said.  “Now not only the Atlantic, but we also have them in the Pacific and it’s just a matter of time – probably a year or two – before that’s a persistent threat, 24 hours a day. … That impact has reduced decision space for a national senior leader in a time of crisis.”

WASHINGTON — The conflict in northeast Syria escalated on Friday as Iran-backed militias launched a volley of rocket and drone attacks against coalition bases after American reprisals for a drone attack that killed a U.S. contractor and injured six other Americans. 
President Biden, speaking at a news conference in Canada, sought to tamp down fears that tit-for-tat strikes between the United States and militant groups could spiral out of control, while at the same time warning Tehran to rein in its proxies. 
“Make no mistake, the United States does not, does not, I emphasize, seek conflict with Iran,” Mr. Biden said in Ottawa, where he was making a state visit. “But be prepared for us to act forcefully to protect our people. That’s exactly what happened last night.”

                              <span>An anti-terrorism court in northwest Pakistan has convicted and sentenced a Muslim man to death after he was accused of posting blasphemous content in a WhatsApp group. Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where even unproven allegations can stir mobs and violence. Syed Muhammad Zeeshan was convicted under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act and Anti-Terrorist Act by the court in Peshawar on Friday.</span>

Business Insider: Top US general predicts that much of the world&#x27;s armies, navies, and air forces &#x27;will be robotic&#x27; in 15 years, if not sooner 
* The top US general says technology is changing the ways that wars are being fought. 
* He said that robots will play a huge role in the world&#x27;s armies, navies, and air forces within the next decade or so. 
* Gen. Mark Milley also highlighted the role of artificial intelligence as a military application. 
Technology is changing the ways that war is being fought, and the top US general predicts this will lead to an increasing use of robots in armies, navies, and air forces. 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told the Eurasia Group Foundation on a podcast that the world is undergoing a &quot;fundamental change&quot; in the &quot;character of war.&quot; 
Unlike the &quot;nature of war,&quot; which Milley described to mean human dynamics and intra-country relationships, he clarified that the character of the war incorporates items like tactics, weapons, technologies, organizations, and management.

* The German lender’s shares retreated for a third consecutive day and have now lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month. 
* The emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS, in the wake of the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, triggered contagion concern among investors, which was deepened by further monetary policy tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. 
Deutsche Bank shares fell on Friday following a spike in credit default swaps Thursday night, as concerns about the stability of European banks persisted. 
The Frankfurt-listed stock was down 14% at one point during the session but trimmed losses to close 8.6% lower on Friday afternoon. 
The German lender’s Frankfurt-listed shares retreated for a third consecutive day and have now lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month. Credit default swaps — a form of insurance for a company’s bondholders against its default — leapt to 173 basis points Thursday night from 142 basis points the previous day.

                              <span>EurAsian Times: Russian Pilots ‘Spill The Beans’ On How They Intercepted US MQ-9 Reaper Drone Over The Black Sea 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu awarded the Order of Courage to the pilots that ‘downed’ the US MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea.
Last week, the Russian Defense Ministry said a US MQ-9 drone plunged into the Black Sea after engaging in sharp maneuvering, noting that Russian fighter jets sent to intercept it did not come into contact with it nor used weapons against it. 
The ministry said the air control of the Russian Aerospace Forces recorded the drone’s flight in the Crimean peninsula’s region in the direction of the Russian border.

Meeting is part of high-profile tour as Brazil’s president attempts to repair country’s reputation after the Bolsonaro era 
One of them wants the world to know his country is battling its way back to its former glory after three years of zero-Covid lockdowns and a long and humiliating history of foreign exploitation. 
The other wants to signal his country is bouncing back from four chaotic years under a far-right populist who took a sledgehammer to its place in the world. 
The two revival-seeking politicians – China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – will meet in Beijing next week during a high-profile tour that is part of the latter’s efforts to repair his country’s overseas reputation after Jair Bolsonaro’s era of antagonism and isolation.

                              <span>The Hill: Pentagon chief: Putin-Xi meeting sends ‘very troubling message’ 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday said Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia sends a “troubling message.” 
Xi earlier this week concluded his three-day visit to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a visit seen by the West as Beijing doubling down on its support for the Kremlin in its war in Ukraine. 
“Xi’s visit to Putin and remaining there for a couple of days I think sends a very troubling message, a message of support,” Austin told lawmakers on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee. 
While the U.S. military has not assessed Beijing as yet providing any military weapons or equipment to Moscow, “certainly just showing support by his presence there, I think, is very troubling,” Austin said.

France 24: China says again drove away US warship in South China Sea; US says asserting navigational rights 
China’s defence ministry said on Friday that it yet again had to monitor and drive away the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Milius that entered its territorial waters in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands. 
“We sternly demand the U.S. to immediately stop such provocative acts, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen incidents,” a spokesperson said in a statement from the Ministry of National Defence. 
The U.S. Navy said the guided-missile destroyer was asserting its navigational rights and freedoms.  “Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations,” the U.S. Navy 7th fleet said in an emailed statement.

Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich told NBC News that Russian jets have violated the airspace of At Tanf Garrison roughly 25 times this month, including Wednesday. 
Armed Russian jets have flown over a U.S. military garrison in Syria nearly every day in March, violating a 4-year-old agreement between the U.S. and Russia and risking escalation, according to the U.S. general in charge of air operations in the region. 
 Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, combined forces air component commander for U.S. Central Command, told NBC News on Wednesday that the most recent Russian overflight of At Tanf Garrison (ATG) happened just a few hours earlier, and that Russian jets have violated the airspace roughly 25 times so far this month, compared to zero times in February and 14 in January.
“It is a substantial increase,” he said, explaining that at this rate they are “on track to be double what it has been in the past.”

Ottawa (AFP) - President Joe Biden laid out a vision of world-leading US-Canadian economic cooperation in a speech to Canada&#x27;s parliament Friday, and announced that the giant neighbors had reached a deal on curbing illegal migration.
Standing ovations by Canadian lawmakers punctuated Biden&#x27;s roughly half-hour speech in Ottawa that was thick on praise for North American unity -- a sentiment matched earlier when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered his own address.
&quot;Americans and Canadians are two peoples, two countries, in my view sharing one heart,&quot; Biden said, getting cheers when he vowed Canada will &quot;always be able to count on the United States.&quot;

                              <span>Uganda has passed one of the most extreme anti-LGBTQ laws in the world, and U.S. evangelical groups had their hands all over it.
The East African nation has long pursued criminalizing homosexuality, and a draft version calls for the death penalty for &quot;serial offenders&quot; and other cases involving gay sex, and American religious organizations have invested millions of dollars to deepen homophobic views commonly held in the region, reported the Washington Post. 
&quot;In 2020, London-based OpenDemocracy found that more than 20 American religious organizations advocating against LGBTQ rights, safe abortion, access to contraceptives and comprehensive sex education had spent at least $54 million furthering their agendas in Africa since 2007,&quot; wrote foreign affairs columnist Ishaan Tharoor. &quot;Close to half that figure was spent in conservative, predominantly Christian Uganda alone, where religious advocates advocate for gay &#x27;conversion therapy&#x27; and tout supposed success stories of &#x27;ex-gay&#x27; people.&quot;

Evangelical pastor Scott Lively and other Americans delivered a series of lectures in Uganda almost 15 years ago that inflamed homophobia in the country, according to local LGBTQ rights activists, and his address to parliament promoted the idea that homosexuality was  a Western-imported “disease” that could be spread to the country’s children.

“This recasting of homosexuality as akin to pedophilia, alongside the widespread use of similar language, is meant to legitimize the response and crackdown by governments and institutions,” said Caleb Okereke, a Nigerian journalist.
Those same tactics are spreading back in the U.S., where Republican lawmakers have been targeting LGBTQ rights under the guise of protecting children from sex abuse, and Uganda serves as a warning.
“Ugandans have been radicalized into hatred for LGBTQ persons,” said Frank Mugisha, director of the LGBTQ rights group Sexual Minorities Uganda.</span>

                              <span>During an appearance on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe,&quot; newly-hired contributor John Kasich (R-OH) laughed at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his most recent stumble as he appears to be in the process of establishing his credibility as a possible GOP presidential candidate.
Speaking with the &quot;Morning Joe&#x27; co-hosts, the former GOP Ohio governor hammered some of his fellow Republicans for not backing Ukraine and for parroting Russian talking points before he was asked about the Florida governor who changed his tune on Ukraine just days ago.
&quot;Why would Ron DeSantis puppet or just repeat Kremlin talking points by calling an invasion from a war criminal, a guy the ICC has called a war criminal, why would Ron DeSantis get on TV and say...&quot; host Joe Scarborough started with Kasich interjecting, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, Joe.&quot;
With Scarborough continuing and noting DeSantis called the unprovoked invasion &quot;...a border dispute,&quot; Kasich continued, &quot;He&#x27;s walked it all back,&quot; and then started laughing.

&quot;I think he realized -- look, when you run for president you&#x27;ve got to have broad knowledge, except, I guess, when it came to Trump, who didn&#x27;t have broad knowledge,&quot; Kasich joked. &quot;If you&#x27;re going to run for president, you better know what you think about these international issues. You better think about how you feel about a whole range of domestic issues.&quot;
&quot;The first thing you&#x27;ve got to do is pass that test,&quot; he lectured. &quot;If the media thinks you can&#x27;t pass that test, you get hurt. DeSantis, I think made a mistake and he&#x27;s tried to walk it back. You can make a mistake, but you can&#x27;t make too many mistakes or you begin to be counted out.&quot;

Since February, at least 150 people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed by IS attacks targeting truffle hunters or by landmines left by the extremists, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Syria&#x27;s desert truffles fetch high prices in a country battered by 12 years of war and a crushing economic crisis.
&quot;At least 15 people, including seven civilians and eight local pro-regime fighters, were killed by IS fighters who slit their throats while they were collecting truffles on Thursday,&quot; said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.

                              <span>Mohamed ElBaradei was director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from 1997 until 2009. In an interview with FRANCE 24, he reflected on the US-led invasion of Iraq 20 years ago this week, which he opposed. &quot;If I now look in hindsight, it was not really about weapons of mass destruction. It was about regime change,&quot; he said. ElBaradei added: &quot;They (the US) thought the best pretext was to say that Saddam Hussein was linked to al Qaeda and had WMDs (...) They didn&#x27;t really have any evidence. It was all about belief. And they started a slew of deception and misinformation.&quot;</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
