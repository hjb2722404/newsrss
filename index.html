    Reuters: Europe to be hit hardest in global slowdown -OECD 
* Europe is set to take the brunt of a global slowdown next year. 
* But the world should avoid an outright recession. 
* That’s according to new estimates from the OECD. 
* Organisation boss Mathias Cormann says there are just too many headwinds: 
&quot;It is sadly a statement of the obvious that the global economy continues to face significant challenges. Russia&#x27;s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression continues to rage. Global growth is slowing down. It continues to slow down and confidence has weakened. Inflation has become broad based and persistent, and in response central banks have been raising policy rates and global financial conditions have tightened significantly.&quot; 
The OECD says the euro zone will grow just 0.5% next year.  Regional powerhouse Germany is expected to do even worse, with a contraction of 0.3% forecast.  Outside the euro zone, the UK is set to do worse still.

Business Insider: Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle push Biden administration to provide Ukraine with lethal &#x27;Gray Eagle&#x27; drones 
* Lawmakers are asking the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with MQ-1C &quot;Gray Eagle&quot; drones. 
* The drones, made by General Atomics, can carry four Hellfire missiles. 
* &quot;The long-term upside of providing Ukraine with the MQ-1C is significant,&quot; lawmakers wrote. 
More than a dozen US senators from both major parties are pushing the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with a fleet of advanced, armed drones that they argue would &quot;increase the lethality&quot; of the country&#x27;s armed forces, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. 
The MQ-1C, or &quot;Gray Eagle,&quot; is a successor to the Predator drone manufactured by General Atomics that boasts the ability to carry four Hellfire missiles and remain airborne for up to 27 hours before refueling. It has a range of 2,500 nautical miles and can cruise at 25,000 feet.

Breaking Defense: After missile scare, Poland accepts German offer for Patriot defenses 
Christian Thiels, a spokesman for the German Ministry of National Defense, said that assistance for Poland could be provided at any time, including with Eurofighters, though the details are still being sorted out. 
WARSAW — Poland today accepted an offer from Germany to deploy additional Patriot air defense systems there, following the deaths of two Polish civilians who were likely struck by an errant missile during a Russian barrage of Ukrainian cities. 
“With satisfaction, I accepted the proposal of the German Minister of Defense to deploy additional Patriot missile launchers in our country,” Mariusz Błaszczak, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, wrote early this morning on social media. 
“During today’s telephone talks with the German side, I will suggest that the system should be located at the border with Ukraine.”

WNU Editor: No specifics on the deployment, but since each Patriot unit requires 90 personnel to operate it, I can assume they will be German. 
Yup. German soldiers on Polish soil. 
But my big worry is that from the Kremlin&#x27;s point of view, they will see this deployment as the first step by NATO to shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft in eastern Ukraine. And heaven help us all if that happens.

Maritime Executive: Russian Jets Make &quot;Unsafe&quot; Low-Altitude Pass Over NATO Task Force
NATO&#x27;s Allied Maritime Command has accused Russian air forces of making an &quot;unsafe, unprofessional&quot; low-altitude overflight past NATO warships in the Baltic Sea.  
On Thursday morning, the warships of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 were carrying out an exercise in the Baltic Sea. 
Two Russian fighters approached at an altitude of 300 feet and overflew the force at a distance of just 80 yards, according to the command. They refused to respond to communications, NATO said.

   Epoch Times: US to Activate New Space Force Command in Indo–Pacific Amid Tensions With North Korea, China 
The United States Space Force will activate its first component command in the Indo–Pacific this week, aimed at deterring aggression in the region, as tensions with China and North Korea continue to rise. 
The U.S. Indo–Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) said on Twitter that the new Space Force unit will be activated Tuesday, making INDOPACOM the first combatant command to host a Space Force unit since its inception in 2019. 
The Space Command aims “to deter conflict and, if necessary, defeat aggression, deliver space combat power for the joint/combined force, and defend U.S. vital interests with allies and partners,” according to its website.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe on Tuesday told his U.S. counterpart that Taiwan is at the core of China&#x27;s core interests and was a &quot;red-line&quot; that must not be crossed. 
&quot;The resolution of Taiwan is a matter for Chinese people, no external force has the right to interfere,&quot; Wei said at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of a gathering of Southeast Asian defence chiefs in Cambodia. 
Wei said the United States must respect China&#x27;s core interests and hoped it could adopt a rational, practical policy towards China, and get China-U.S. relations back on track.

Reuters: Pentagon chief raises concern about Beijing&#x27;s &#x27;dangerous&#x27; behavior with Chinese counterpart 
PHNOM PENH (Reuters) -U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday emphasized the need to improve crisis communications during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart while raising concern about &quot;increasingly dangerous&quot; behavior by Chinese military aircraft. 
The roughly 90-minute meeting in Cambodia, described as &quot;productive and professional&quot; by a U.S. official, was the pair&#x27;s first since a visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August enraged China, which regards the island as its territory. 
In his second face-to-face meeting with Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe this year, Austin discussed the importance of &quot;substantive dialogue on reducing strategic risk and enhancing operational safety,&quot; Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder said in a statement after the meeting.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: AP Fires Reporter Who Risked Triggering WWIII With Polish Missile Misinformation 
Five days after the Associated Press cited an anonymous &#x27;senior US intelligence official&#x27; in a story that claimed a Russian missile killed two Polish civilians, one of the two reporters behind the story was fired. 
Reporters James LaPorta (fired) and John Leichester (not fired) share the byline on the now-retracted report, which sparked an entire news cycle that included talk of invoking &#x27;Article 5&#x27; - the mutual defense agreement between NATO members - and which would have obligated other members to engage in collective defense, aka WWIII. 
As the day went on, President Biden popped out of a NATO / G7 briefing, and mumbled that &quot;it&#x27;s unlikely&quot; the projectile was fired from Russia. NATO then chimed in, saying it was more likely that the missile was fired by Ukrainian forces in self-defense (or was it?).

WNU Editor: The AP is the world&#x27;s largest news wire service. What they report is important. I do not think this former AP reporter really understands how his &quot;false&quot; report almost put the world on the brink of a nuclear crisis. I also have to wonder what were his editor&#x27;s were thinking. They must have approved this report. 
One final note. Who was the anonymous US intelligence official who fed this AP reporter this false information? I would like to know who that person is.</span>

Tensions rise over plans to fine ethnic Serbs in Kosovo who refuse to surrender Belgrade-issued plates 
A row over car number plates in Kosovo is threatening to erupt into open unrest and one of the most serious regional crises in years as tensions between Serbia and its breakaway former province continue to mount. 
The EU, US and Nato have expressed alarm after more than eight hours of emergency talks in Brussels on Monday failed to resolve the dispute over Kosovo’s plans to fine ethnic Serb residents who refuse to surrender their Belgrade-issued plates.

Jerusalem Post: Elbit&#x27;s micro-suicide drone swarms can hunt enemies in urban combat 
As drones become more versatile, they can conduct more missions in cities, which also leads to questions about the use of tech in war.  
A new drone from Israel’s Elbit Systems called Lanius combines a number of technologies that put it at the forefront of how drones are transforming war. 
At the same time, reports about the drone may raise questions about how this technology may make war more controversial as “robots” play a larger role in it. 
The more armies and defense companies invest in new technology that enables combat to take place remotely — without soldiers interacting with civilians, for instance — the more it seems like “robot wars.”

                              <span>Iran has begun producing uranium enriched to 60 percent at its Fordo plant, which was reopened in 2019 amid the breakdown of a nuclear agreement with major powers, reports said Tuesday. An atomic bomb requires uranium enriched to 90 percent, so 60 percent is a significant step towards weapons-grade enrichment. Iran has always denied ambition to develop an atomic bomb, insisting its nuclear activities are for civilian purposes.</span>

What seemed impossible was made possible, largely due to the unity of the G77 and China and the role of the Egyptian Presidency. Also important were efforts by civil society groups who put pressure on the United States, the main blocker to having the fund.

It would be the second formal address to the New Zealand parliament made by any head of state, with the first being by former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard in 2011.

Zelensky has addressed several parliaments – including Australia&#x27;s in March.

Arrangements are still being made, but the address is expected to take place before parliament adjourns for the summer break.</span>

&quot;The country remains outrageously divided, very, very, sort of evenly divided between the two parties, and we&#x27;ll see that same pattern fall through to the next Congress.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney says former US president Donald Trump is &quot;a lot weaker&quot; than he was two weeks ago.

&quot;He is still the likely Republican nominee, no question about that, but he is not the same candidate that he was two weeks ago,&quot; Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

&quot;We probably thought he was going to sail to his re-nomination should he decide to run, but that midterm election was crushing to him and he has not recovered from it yet.

&quot;So there&#x27;s a lot of folks who are thinking about running who would never have run against him if they perceived him to be in a position of strength, he is not there right now, he is dramatically weakened.&quot;</span>

I learned that she and her family fled Kharkiv to the Kirovohrad Oblast when the war first started (her inlaws live there). 
Kirovohrad Oblast is in central Ukraine, west of the Dnipro river. 
My cousin is busy trying to find missing Ukrainian soldiers via through social media. Needless to say her list is long and heartbreaking. 
Behind every missing soldier there is a family worried sick. Desperate on finding any information on what has happened to their loved one. 
This war is hitting home right now.</span>

                              <span>CNN: Turkey launches deadly aerial campaign over Syria in response to Istanbul bombing
Eleven people have been killed in Syria, including one journalist, after Turkish warplanes carried out an “air operation” in the country and neighboring Iraq late Saturday, according to an official from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 
There have not been any casualties reported from the Iraqi side.  Turkey’s new cross-border offensive, dubbed “Operation Claw-Sword” by its defense ministry, targets the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), PYD People’s Defense Units (YPG), and Union of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK), reported state-run news agency Anadolu.

Straits Times: TSMC founder says congratulating China’s Xi on party congress was ‘personal’ 
TAIPEI - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co founder Morris Chang said the congratulations he offered Chinese President Xi Jinping about the congress that his ruling Communist Party recently held were his own “personal” view. 
“Taiwan’s Presidential Office told me beforehand that if there was an opportunity, there was no need to avoid meeting or greeting him,” Mr Chang said on Monday at a press conference in Taipei held to brief journalists on his role as the island’s envoy to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit last week in Thailand. 
“I later congratulated Xi on the success of the 20th party congress and talked about my own health condition, which were all my personal ideas,” Mr Chang said, when asked if the government in Taipei had asked him to convey the sentiments.

Update #2: Taiwanese envoy explains why he congratulated China’s Xi (RT)   
WNU Editor: Taiwan&#x27;s business elite and China&#x27;s political class have always been talking and meeting each other. This is how China respects its policy of not recognizing Taiwan, but finds a way to talk to them in another way. That is why in this meeting with President Xi, Morris Chang made it very clear that this was a personal meeting, not an official one. 
I saw these type of meetings first hand numerous times in Fujian when I was working there in the 1980s. They were always talking to each other, and it was made easier not only because of business, but also due to family ties between Fujian province and Taiwan (they both face each other cross the Taiwan Strait).</span>

FOX News: China increases ability to strike U.S. with sub-carried missiles  
U.S. Pacific Fleet leader says China&#x27;s new missiles can reach U.S. from its own waters. 
China has a new missile loaded onto submarines that can strike the continental U.S. from the South China Sea, according to reports. 
U.S. Navy Admiral Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S. Pacific Fleet told a group of military reporters in Washington on Friday that China’s Jin-class submarines are &quot;equipped with JL-3 intercontinental ballistic missiles,&quot; Bloomberg reported. 
&quot;They were built to threaten the United States,&quot; the admiral said. &quot;We keep close track of those submarines.&quot;

Zero Hedge: US-China Backchannel Forum To Halt &quot;Downward Trajectory&quot; In Ties Revealed 
A significant and unexpected new Wall Street Journal report has revealed that a few days prior to the Xi-Biden meeting last week at the G20 summit in Bali, the two countries embarked upon a private back-channel dialogue of top policy advisers and business executives in New York, which was approved by both governments. 
The meeting was described by Retired Adm. Mike Mullen as seeking to prevent the continued &quot;downward trajectory&quot; in US-China relations &quot;at a dangerous time.&quot; Beijing is relying on an American businessman described as an &quot;old friend of China&quot; with a long successful track record of positive dealings in China: insurance executive Maurice &quot;Hank&quot; Greenberg. &quot;As the two great powers of the time, we need to try to turn this around,&quot; Mullen commented of the closed-door talks earlier this month.

China&#x27;s defense ministry agreed to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for the first time since China held unprecedented military drills surrounding Taiwan last month. 
China had halted all regular military dialogue with the U.S. following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit to Taiwan in August. 
Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe is now scheduled to meet face-to-face with Austin while the pair attend a regional security forum in Southeast Asia this week, Reuters reported Sunday. 
A spokesman for China&#x27;s defense ministry alluded to the meeting in a statement to reporters this weekend.

Voting will take place on Nov. 23, says EP spokesperson  European Parliament will vote on a resolution on Nov. 23 that will designate Russia a “state sponsor of terrorism,” a parliament spokesperson said Friday. 
“On Wednesday, members will be voting on a resolution dubbing Russia a country sponsor for terrorism given massive step up of Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine,” said Delphine Colard during a press briefing.

WNU Editor: The expectation is that this resolution will pass .... MEPs set to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism (News European Parliament). 
This is an incredibly dangerous development. This will kill all relations between the EU and Russia. It will also lay the groundwork for some of NATO&#x27;s EU members (Poland and the Baltic states) to invoke Article 4, which Russia will regard as a step towards invoking Article 5 .... a declaration of hostilities between NATO and Russia. 
I do not think the US will join in passing such a resolution. To do so will kill all back-channels to make sure that there will be no nuclear escalation. 

To say that this crisis is continuing to escalate and spiral out of control is an understatement.

A series of videos that surfaced on social media last week has ignited a debate over whether Ukrainian forces committed war crimes or acted in self-defense as they tried to capture a group of Russian soldiers who were then killed. 
The videos show the grisly before-and-after scenes of the encounter earlier this month, in which at least 11 Russians, most of whom are seen lying on the ground, appear to have been shot dead at close range after one of their fellow fighters suddenly opened fire on Ukrainian soldiers standing nearby. 
The videos, whose authenticity has been verified by The New York Times, offer a rare look into one gruesome moment among many in the war, but do not show how or why the Russian sold…</span>

* A quarter of all Americans could face energy emergencies this winter if temperatures dip below averages. 
* Power grids from the Great Lakes to Louisiana, New England, Carolinas, and all of Texas are the most at risk for power supply shortfalls during high-demand periods 
The US heating season has officially begun, and new warnings show that a quarter of all Americans could experience energy emergencies this winter if temperatures fall below average due to tight fossil fuel supplies.  
Power grids from the Great Lakes to Louisiana, New England, Carolinas, and all of Texas are the most at risk for power supply shortfalls during high-demand periods, according to Bloomberg, citing a new report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a regulatory body that manages grid stability.

Daily Mail: Ukraine says negotiating with Russia would be &#x27;capitulation&#x27;: Zelensky&#x27;s presidential advisor condemns West&#x27;s &#x27;bizarre&#x27; attempts to persuade them to enter peace talks as they refuse to stop offensive against Putin&#x27;s forces 
* Mykhaylo Podolyak condemned West&#x27;s efforts to persuade Ukraine to negotiate 
* This would mean the country &#x27;who is recovering its territories is losing,&#x27; he said 
* He also warned against trusting any Russian suggestions of peace negotiations 
* Podolyak said this is merely an attempt to stall to allow Russian units to regroup 
* The comments from Zelensky&#x27;s adviser came as stunning footage emerged showing the moment a Russian tank was blown sky high by Ukrainian explosives  
The West&#x27;s attempts to persuade Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow are &#x27;bizarre&#x27; and amount to asking for its capitulation, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has declared. 
&#x27;When you have the initiative on the battlefield, it&#x27;s slightly bizarre to receive proposals like: &#x27;&#x27;you will not be able to do everything by military means anyway, you need to negotiate,&#x27;&#x27; said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak. 
This would mean that the country &#x27;that recovers its territories, must capitulate to the country that is losing,&#x27; he added during an interview in the presidency building in Kyiv this week.

Politico: Top Ukrainian aide says Russia didn’t ask for a ‘short truce,&#x27; clarifying Zelenskyy remark 
Andriy Yermak also said a military campaign for Crimea will happen, but wouldn’t say when. 
Halifax, Nova Scotia — Russia has not directly asked Ukraine for a quick fighting break in the war, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday, clarifying a comment by his boss the day before. 
On Friday, Zelenskyy told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum that Kyiv rejected Russia’s preference for a “short truce,” leaving open the question of whether Moscow made the request of the Ukrainian administration. 
Andriy Yermak, who heads the Ukrainian presidential office, stated in a virtual interview that the Kremlin did not propose such a pause to the Ukrainian government. “We have not [had] any official application from the Russian side about some conversations, some negotiations,” he said.

                              <span>WNU Editor: For the past few months I was wondering why the Russian military had not bombed the Motor Sich plant in the city of Zaporozhye. Every other major Ukrainian factory that can help in the war effort has been destroyed, which is now why all Ukrainian military equipment that needs to be repaired is being shipped to Poland. But not the Motor Sich factory. 
It is a huge factory complex that provides parts for aircraft, and since the start of the war it was always a target because it was assembling engines for aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. There have been strikes near the factory where aircraft are being shipped, but the factory itself was not targeted. 
 It was only after I learned that the Chinese had invested an enormous amount of money into the company, and in this factory specifically, did I appreciate why it was off limits to Russian military strikes .... Chinese Intrigue Behind Ukraine’s Seizure of Aviation Firm Motor Sich (Polygraph). The Russians do not want to antagonize their good relations with Beijing. 
But it looks like that all changed when Ukrainian President Zelensky ordered the nationalization of major factories that can help in the war effort, the Motor Sich plant included .... After accusing its president of collaborating with Russia, Ukraine nationalizes Motor Sich (Aviacionline). And as for compensation, I learned through my Chinese sources that they were told by the Kyiv government to buzz-off. They were going to get nothing. 
It took only 10 days after nationalization and Chinese investors being told that they were going to get nothing, that the plant was destroyed .... Russia targets Ukrainian aircraft engine plant (RT). The timing tells me that after being told that they were not going to get compensated, Beijing signaled Moscow that they could go ahead.</span>

                              <span>RFE: UN Condemns Attack On Russian-Controlled Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Plant As Moscow, Kyiv Trade Blame 
The UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog has condemned attacks on the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, as Moscow and Kyiv traded blame. 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi on November 20 said that &quot;powerful explosions&quot; hit the nuclear plant on the evening of November 19 and again early on November 20, and demanded that whichever country was behind the attacks cease them immediately. 
Such attacks on Europe&#x27;s largest nuclear plant, Grossi said, risked a major nuclear disaster.

WNU Editor: According to Russian sources. Ukraine was targeting a power line that links to the plant. 
The Ukraine government argument is that Russia is bombing the nuclear plant to make sure that there will be no electricity for Ukraine. So if Kyiv is to be believed, Russian soldiers are bombing an installation that is guarded by Russian soldiers. 
 Sighhhh .... 
The UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog has 4 personnel at the site. When this war is over is when we will learn officially on who they believed was responsible for this attack.

 “With sick, parental, and education leaves, many units reach the staffing level of only 60% of what they have on paper,&quot; German MP  stressed. 
 German armed forces are currently facing severe shortages of ammunition, the Bundestag’s commissioner for the armed forces, Eva Hoegl, revealed on Sunday. The German Army lacks certain basic personal equipment to fight a war, she shockingly noted during an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “Without munitions, it’s all nothing,” Hoegl said. Furthermore, she called on the German administration to focus on replenishing the arms depots, particularly during the heightened security risks across the European region from the ongoing Russian offensive in Ukraine.

Update: German army has €20 billion ammo shortfall – top MP (RT)   
WNU Editor: Germany has the wealth and industrial base to quickly build-up its military. And while they are spending some money now (link here), there is a lack of political will, and I also suspect most Germans feel uncomfortable to see Germany re-arming. 
But two days of ammunition?!?!?!? That is crazy.</span>

                              <span>The Daily Skeptic: Ukrainian Public Opinion on the War 
Because casualty figures are so uncertain, it’s unclear whether the war in Ukraine qualifies as the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II. After all, approximately 130,000 people died in the Yugoslav wars. 
What is clear is that it’s the most intense conflict. Tens of thousands of people have died in just the eight months since Russia’s invasion began. If the conflict continues, it will soon surpass the Yugoslav wars in total casualties; and it may already have done so. 
On top of all the deaths, Ukraine has seen a massive exodus of refugees, along with catastrophic damage to homes, industry and physical infrastructure. The cost of rebuilding the country has been estimated at several hundred billion dollars – similar to Ukraine’s entire GDP before the war (which may fall by more than a third this year).

WNU Editor: Denis Kireev was part of the Ukrainian delegation that met Russian negotiators at the beginning of the war. He was advocating compromise and finding a peaceful solution to end the conflict. When this became known by ultra-nationalists, he was labeled a Russian spy, accused of treason, and immediately executed (link here). 
Dennis Kireev is not the only one to learn first hand on what happens if you want peace through negotiation. Since the start of the war I have heard of numerous stories and reports on what happens to those who want Ukraine to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. Let us just say that the authorities will not be kind to you.

And that is why no one in Ukraine is going to publicly advocate for negotiations. And they are certainly not going to say so to a stranger who calls them on a phone.</span>

Egg shortages and rationing in the UK are expected to last beyond Christmas, an industry body has warned, as the poultry industry grapples with spiraling costs and its worst ever bout of bird flu. 
Lidl is limiting customers to three boxes of eggs each, while Asda is restricting purchases to two boxes per shopper.
Tesco is also considering rationing eggs, after bird flu resulted in shortages on some supermarket shelves. Other supermarkets are sourcing eggs abroad, including Italy.

DAKAR (Reuters) -The world&#x27;s longest-ruling leader, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea, staged a vote on Sunday to extend his 43-year-rule of a tiny, authoritarian African state where once plentiful oil wealth has been in a rapid decline.

The women and youth-led movement has proven hard to put down. 
 On Monday, at the start of their first match in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, members of the Iran men’s national soccer team stood silently as their national anthem played.

That 8 billion mark is an estimate — there is no real-time census of everyone alive on Earth at every given moment, which means there’s a margin of error on either side of 8 billion. But someone will be or already is Baby 8 Billion. 
He or she is most likely to be born in India, which had more than 23 million births last year — 13 million more than second-place China, which India will soon pass as the world’s most populous country.

The 40-page report, which was co-published with Harvard Law School&#x27;s International Human Rights Clinic, posits that &quot;rather than accepting continuing stagnation&quot; while trying to reach a deal within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), proponents of a legally binding instrument for banning killer robots should try something new.

The decision was taken at a hearing in the city of Ryazan where Krivanek complained she had endured conditions &quot;like hell&quot; in a penal institution similar to the kind of prison colony to which U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner is currently being transferred.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will meet Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and South Korean President Yoon Suk-Yeol during an upcoming trip to Asia to discuss how to stem North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program, a White House official said on Wednesday.
The leaders will meet in Cambodia on Sunday, Nov. 13, when Biden visits Asia for meetings with ASEAN and the Group of 20 industrialized nations.
&quot;The three leaders would work to &quot;continue enhancing trilateral cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific, particularly in regard to our joint efforts to address the ongoing threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,&quot; Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House National S…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk&#x27;s relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
&quot;I think that Elon Musk&#x27;s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at,&quot; Biden said.
&quot;Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I&#x27;m not suggesting that. I&#x27;m suggesting they&#x27;re worth being looked at.&quot;
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk&#x27;s ventures including Twitter were &quot;not true.&quot;
Musk&#x27;s purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world&#x27;s richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla&#x27;s global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

                              <span>Russia ordered its troops to withdraw from the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday in a further major blow to its campaign amid a Ukrainian counter-offensive.
&quot;Begin to pull out troops,&quot; Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia&#x27;s commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the &quot;difficult decision&quot; of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its &quot;special military operation&quot; and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow&#x27;s forces since the offensive began on February 24.
Ukraine&#x27;s troops have for weeks been capturing villages en route to the city near the Black Sea and Kremlin-installed leaders in Khers…</span>

Soldiers of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade broke their silence following a particularly harsh battle not far from the city of Donetsk in the Donbas region. &quot;As a result of the &#x27;carefully&#x27; planned offensive by the &#x27;great commanders&#x27;, we lost about 300 people [..] 50 percent of vehicles,&quot; write the authors of the open letter, which was widely shared on Telegram, the main communication app used by Russian military and political …</span>

Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran&#x27;s border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country&#x27;s strict hijab dress rules for women.
The crackdown on nationwide protests since her death has killed at least 304 people, including 41 children and 24 women, according to a combined toll issued…</span>

                              <span>A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides &quot;direct evidence&quot; of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to &quot;May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard,&quot; the statement said.
&quot;This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel,&quot; Garfinkel noted, calling it &quot;a landmark in the history of the human ability to write&quot;.
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first &quot;entire verbal sentence&quot; written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She &quot;is now on her way to a penal colony,&quot; lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.

                              <span>(Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that U.S. midterm elections would not improve the &quot;bad&quot; relations between Moscow and Washington, as it dismissed allegations Russia was meddling in the U.S. vote, Russian state media reported.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

                              <span>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday&#x27;s talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia&#x27;s invasion in February, and the alliance&#x27;s future, Sunak&#x27;s office said.
&quot;As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted,&quot; Sunak said in a statement.
&quot;I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come,&quot; he added.
&quot;But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries.&quot;
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister&#x27;s first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain&#x27;s &quot;steadfast support&quot; and solidarity for Ukraine.

                              <span>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show &quot;Drag Race,&quot; it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; that has inspired spin-offs including &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race: Canada vs. the World.&quot;
&quot;The prime minister&#x27;s visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise,&quot; local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau &quot;talks to the queens about Canada&#x27;s inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens,&quot; whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell&#x27;s streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

                              <span>The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped &quot;fancy vivid pink&quot; diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie&#x27;s auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer&#x27;s premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie&#x27;s Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
