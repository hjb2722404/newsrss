                              <span>Donald Trump is continuing to feel the competition with Ron DeSantis by declaring it would be a “mistake” for the Florida governor to run for president in 2024 and threatened to expose “unflattering” things about him.

&quot;I would tell you things about him that won&#x27;t be very flattering — I know more about him than anybody — other than, perhaps, his wife,” the former president told Fox News Digital.

The comments come after Donald Trump last week referred to the Florida governor as &quot;Ron DeSanctimonious&quot; when reacting to his re-election campaign advertisement.

Both Ron DeSantis and the former president continue to be seen as the two most favoured candidates for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2024.

While neither Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis have declared a run for the White House, the former president told his supporters he has a “big announcement” coming on November 15.</span>

The US House Speaker will be leaving the United States to attend the COP27 in Egypt on Thursday.
 
“That’s really, really strange and probably an indicator that she knows she’s not going to be Speaker of the House come January,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“Whether or not it is an omen of her impending retirement remains to be seen. 

“It’s going to raise more questions, I think, than answers.”</span>

Daily Express: World’s largest nuclear submarine leaves Gibraltar to make way for Black Sea 
The USS Rhode Island left port in the British overseas territory amid concerns of a Russian false flag operation. 
The world’s largest nuclear submarine has been spotted leaving Gibraltar under intense protection from the Royal Marines as it reportedly heads towards the Black Sea. 
The USS Rhode Island’s departure comes as fears grow over what Vladimir Putin will do after another humiliating retreat. 
Yesterday, the Russian President called for civilians to leave Kherson in the south of Ukraine due to the advancing counter-offensive on the occupied city.

WNU Editor: I am skeptical that Turkey will permit the USS Rhode Island to cross the Bosporus Strait to Enter the black Sea. Turkey has made it very clear that they will permit no warships to cross the strait with the current war now underway. 
But should it cross and enter the Black Sea. I will consider such a move as proof to me that US nuclear forces are now at Defcon 2.</span>

   EurAsian Times: HIMARS Pounding Brings Russia On Edge Of Major Military Defeat; Moscow Admits Losing Ground In Kherson 
For a few weeks now, Russia has de facto admitted that its hold on the right bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region is tenuous. 
Russia’s new commander in Ukraine, General Sergei Surovikin, in his first interview after taking over command, admitted that the Ukrainian counter-offensive in the southern region of Kherson had made the situation for the Russian army “tense.” 
Russia subsequently ordered the evacuation of its citizens from the right bank of the Dnieper river, offering them refuge on the left bank and elsewhere in Russia.

WNU Editor: I am skeptical of the above report. There are a number of bridges that are still operational across the Dnieper river. They would have long been knocked out by Ukraine if the HIMARs were that effective. My guess is that Russia&#x27;s anti-missile systems are very effective, and if true I am willing to bet that this is just one more worry for the Pentagon. 
As to the claim that Ukraine has not lost a single HIMARS. It is true that the only video images that I have seen of HIMARs being destroyed by Russian forces are few and very blurry. But it is also true that Russia is censoring a lot of their battlefield successes in Ukraine, reason being that they do not want the other side to know how they are conducting their military operations.</span>

The Russian-Ukrainian war is increasingly becoming a proving ground for the use of different types of drones in various domains. While the world has witnessed the efficiency of unmanned systems since the beginning of the war, the recent attack shows for the first time that loitering munitions can be effective in naval warfare too.  
On November 04, 2022, Russian news agency Ria Novosty shared a video on its Telegram channel showing Russian forces striking a Ukrainian Gyruza-M-class patrol boat with a Lancet loitering munition. 
According to the footage, the gunboat was stationary, and its engines appeared to be at stop status, and the Lancet drone struck the ship from the port side. 
While the location of the attack has not been officially confirmed by either side, respected Twitter user “Capt_Navy,” who is a former officer in the Russian Navy, claimed that the incident occurred in the waters of the Kakhovsky Reservoir (on the Dnieper River).

SCMP: US says it wants to get defence talks with China ‘back on track’ 

* White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan urges renewed military-to-military communication, which Beijing cut off after Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s trip to Taiwan 
* Such talks &#x27;can help create more stability and reduce the risk of misunderstanding&#x27;, he says 
Washington&#x27;s top national security official urged Beijing on Monday to resume defence talks with the United States, which China cut off after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan over the summer. 
&quot;Since the elevated and aggressive actions of the Chinese military around Taiwan started in August, we have not had the military-to-military communication that we believe can help create more stability and reduce the risk of misunderstanding,&quot; National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. 
&quot;We hope to get that back on track.&quot;

WNU Editor: Not going to happen. Everyone I know in China has been telling me the same thing this year. Beijing does not trust the Biden administration anymore, and they especially do not trust National Security advisor Jake Sullivan. But China has responded to Jake Sullivan albeit through their equivalent of a think tank .... US needs to ‘act with sincerity’ on Taiwan to restart China defence talks, analysts say (SCMP).</span>

The battle we engaged in with international terrorist groups like Al Qaeda wasn’t just with their legions of foot soldiers but with their highly effective propaganda arms as well. The U.S. and our allies considered those propagandists fundamental cogs in a terror group’s machinery, and just as culpable as any other terrorist. So we held them accountable when innocent civilians were killed.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Forty-two percent of America’s young-but-cynical Generation Z are dealing with a mental health condition, a new survey finds. A range of these issues were largely identified during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The analysis by Harmony Healthcare IT suggests tens of millions of Gen Z young adults started dealing with a mental health problem in the months immediately following the start of the global pandemic in March 2020. The Indiana-based data management company’s survey highlights a staggering percentage of young adults diagnosed with anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic.

WNU Editor: 42% diagnosed with a mental health condition. 57% are on some form of medication. These numbers make my mouth drop. And when these young adults get older, you know that the problems are going to get worse. 
Bottom line. If your country&#x27;s young are this sick, you just know that the economic and national security implications are going to be huge in the future.</span>

Reuters: Analysis-North Korea&#x27;s missile launches show no scarcity of weapons funding, materials despite sanctions 
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea&#x27;s record year of missile launches has shown its willingness to pour resources into producing and deploying more weapons than ever - and sanctions have done little to hinder their development, analysts say. 
Last week the country fired more than 80 missiles, including its latest short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and a new variant of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), by far the North&#x27;s most launches in such a short period. 
Although North Korean weapon costs are not known, ICBMs in other countries can cost tens of millions of dollars, and SRBMs such as Russia&#x27;s Iskander up to $3 million.

Everyone is predicting a Republican tsunami, but no one knows how bad the results will be for the Democrats. I personally think it will be bad, but I wonder if it will make any difference in the end. The Republican party has a long history of letting its supporters down, and my gut tells me that they are going to do it again.
The energy crisis continues to worsen. Government policies have made this into a disaster, and I do not see the people who put us into this disaster approving policies that will go against their green agenda. The only hope that we have is to vote these people out, but I doubt that is going to happen anytime soon. U.S. voters hate Congress, but they love their representative.

Wall Street Journal: China&#x27;s Xi Jinping to Visit Saudi Arabia Amid Global Reshuffling 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is planning to visit Saudi Arabia before the end of the year, according to people familiar with preparations for the trip, as Beijing and Riyadh seek to deepen ties and advance a vision of a multipolar world where the U.S. no longer dominates the global order.
Officials are completing the details for a summit between Mr. Xi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that would underline Beijing’s growing influence in the Middle East, where the U.S. long reigned supreme, and growing links between the oil-rich Saudis and Washington’s top global rivals. 
 In the works for months, the trip is tentatively scheduled for the second week of December, these people said.

WNU Editor: This is big news. The Crown Prince invited Chinese President Xi earlier this year (link here), and this acceptance by the Chinese President to travel to Saudi Arabia sends a signal not only to everyone in the Middle East, but to the West, and specifically to the United States. 
As to what will be discussed at this summit. I expect a number of major business deals will be announced. Laying the groundwork for Saudi Arabia to join BRICs. Exploring a financial mechanism whereby China can buy Saudi oil without using the US dollar. And .... I am putting myself out on the limb with this one. A future joint military exercise between the two nations.</span>

(MENAFN) Serbian Leader Aleksandar Vucic has compared the expected fight for Kherson between Russian and Ukrainian troops to the Battle of Stalingrad throughout World War II, cautioning that aftershocks from the war would be felt far outside the war zone. 
“Challenging times are ahead of us. Next winter will be even harsher than this one because we’re facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the conflict in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson,” Vucic announced in an interview with Pink TV on Sunday. 
Both sides might use thousands of tanks, aircraft and artillery pieces in the attack for the main city, he expected.

The SUN: SUB BLAZE Nuclear-armed Navy submarine aborted top secret mission due to life-or-death fire beneath the waves 
A NUCLEAR-armed Navy submarine had to abort a top secret mission because of a life-or-death fire beneath the waves. 
HMS Victorious was carrying Trident 2 missiles when the electrical blaze broke out. 
The £3billion Vanguard-class nuclear submarine shot to the surface as the captain declared “emergency stations”. 
Every member of the 130-plus crew, including those off-duty, was ordered into action. 
Naval sources insisted the fire was swiftly contained.

Update #2: British nuclear submarine caught fire – The Sun (RT)   
WNU Editor: What would have happened if this electrical fire got out of control and it destroyed the sub before word got out that there was a fire. Would the UK blame Russia? 
The Kremlin has already pointed the finger at the UK for the Nord stream pipeline attacks, and attacks on Russian targets in Crimea. I can understand why the UK government would interpret the disappearance of a UK nuclear submarine as Russian retaliation? With tensions currently this high anything is possible right now.</span>

France 24: Iran has ‘tested satellite launcher successfully’ amid rising hostility with US 
Iran announced Saturday the successful test flight of a rocket capable of propelling satellites into space, three months after launching a satellite with the help of Russia. 
This comes amid rising tensions with Western countries as Tehran is alleged to have provided Moscow with military equipment to help its Ukraine war efforts. 
The United States has repeatedly voiced concern that such launches could boost Iran&#x27;s ballistic missile technology, leading  to the potential delivery of nuclear warheads.  But Iran insists it is not seeking nuclear weapons and that its satellite and rocket launches are for civil or defensive purposes only.

Financial Times: Posthaste: Why the loonie could sink to 70 cents before the dust settles 
Average Canadian borrower can expect to spend an extra $2,500 a year just on debt 
When the going gets tough, the American dollar gets going. 
That’s the way it’s been for ages — when markets get rocky and there are few places to hide, like now, the U.S. dollar is the port in the storm investors turn to. 
For example, in the depths of the financial crisis, the greenback gained 23 per cent; during the global pandemic it was up 10 per cent. Now as the global economy grapples with searing inflation and pending downturn, the U.S. dollar is once again standing strong, up 16 per cent since the summer of 2021, say TD economists Beata Caranci and James Orlando in a recent report. 
Among the developed nation currencies that have depreciated against the U.S. dollar, the loonie has held up pretty well, say the economists.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Sky-High Electricity Is Biden’s New Pain Point Before Elections 
(Bloomberg) -- For months now, high gasoline prices have been arguably the most visible political pain point for President Joe Biden.In most towns, they can be seen every few blocks on signs at filling stations. It’s the fundamental commodity Americans need to go to work, buy groceries and get around. 
But in the runup to the US midterm elections, another energy cost is coming into focus: skyrocketing electricity bills.
It’s a topic that led off a recent gubernatorial debate in California, home to some of the nation’s priciest power. In Maine, politicians have clashed over whether renewable energy is making electricity more expensive. In New York, the Republican candidate for governor is urging the state to reverse its ban on natural gas drilling to lower utility bills.

Update #1: &quot;People Are Fed Up&quot;: Soaring Electricity Bills Become New Pain Point For Biden (Zero Hedge)  
Update #2: High energy prices dog Democrats heading into midterms (Houston Chronicle)   
WNU Editor: I am willing to bet that soaring home heating oil prices (primarily in the US northeast), rising gasoline prices (basically everywhere), and rising electricity prices (also basically everywhere) will motivate a lot of voters to the polls to punish the Democrats. When your pocket book is being directly impacted as many are now facing with high energy prices, you are not a happy person. 
And the Americans are not alone. I know in my case where I live (Montreal) my home heating bill (I heat with oil) will, if current prices do not change, rise from $5000/year Canadian to a minimum of $12,000 Canadian this year. And I am pissed!!! But I should not complain. Diesel is now $3.07/liter Canadian in the Maritimes, or about $9/gallon US!!!!! (link here)</span>

Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister has warned the pacifist country needs to step up its military force amid an increasingly &#x27;severe&#x27; situation in the region, after North Korea&#x27;s latest provocation this week saw it fire a missile near the island nation in a record year for launches.

The remarkable demonstration included some of the world&#x27;s biggest and most advanced military vessels from the US, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.

VOA/Reuters: Japan Hosts Multilateral Display of Naval Unity amid East Asia Tension 
YOKOSUKA, Japan — Japan hosted its first international fleet review for seven years on Sunday with ships from 12 other nations in a show of unity as North Korea fires record numbers of missiles and China increases its pressure on Taiwan. 
The naval parade in Sagami Bay near Tokyo involved 38 vessels, 18 from friendly countries such as the United States, South Korea, Britain, Australia, Singapore, India and Thailand. 
Thirty-three aircraft flew overhead, including submarine-hunting patrol planes and helicopters.

VOA/Reuters: North Korea Says Launches Were Simulated Attack, as South Recovers Missile Parts 
Seoul, South Korea — North Korea said Monday that its recent missile launches were simulated strikes on South Korea and the United States as the two countries held a &quot;dangerous war drill,&quot; while the South said it had recovered parts of a North Korean missile near its coast.
Last week, North Korea test-fired multiple missiles, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile, and hundreds of artillery shells into the sea, as South Korea and the United States carried out six-day air drills that ended Saturday.

   Zero Hedge: Biden Admits The Truth: &quot;No More Oil Drilling&quot; As Energy Stocks Set To Soar 
It has been a great year for energy stocks as the chart below clearly reveals... 
... and it will be an even better year (and decade) for energy stocks. 
Why? Not because of what Goldman trader Michael Sullivan wrote last week explaining why Energy has (finally) become everyone&#x27;s favorite sector (more than two years after we first told our readers to go balls to the wall long XOM):   
“Energy continues to lead. When oil is up. When oil is down. When yields are up, or when they are down. When the US is threatening Windfall Profits Taxes or considering limits on product exports. Whether the market is hiding in defensives or shifting to more offensive positioning ... maybe energy equities are leading because the market sees a pretty good set-up for oil:

OilPrice.com: Europe May See Forced De-Industrialization As Result Of Energy Crisis 
European industries including ferroalloys, fertilizer plants and specialty chemicals are shutting down as a result of the ongoing energy crisis. 
Certain industries may not come back, even if the energy crisis eases.     An increasingly tight regulatory environment is another reason for de-industrialization in Europe. 
The European Union has been quietly celebrating a consistent decline in gas and electricity consumption this year amid record-breaking prices, a cutoff of much of the Russian gas supply, and a liquidity crisis in the energy market. 
Yet the cause for celebration is dubious: businesses are not just curbing their energy use and continuing on a business-as-usual basis. They are shutting down factories, downsizing, or relocating. Europe may well be on the way to deindustrialization.

Bloomberg: Raging Markets Selloff in Five Charts: $36 Trillion and Counting 
(Bloomberg) -- Whether super-safe US Treasuries or the riskiest emerging equities, global stocks and bonds have lost a record $36 trillion in value over the past nine months in a wild selloff that engulfed assets right across the risk spectrum. 
With the year heading into its last quarter, there is likely more pain ahead. Central banks are in full fire-fighting mode, making clear they intend to raise interest rates further to douse inflation, even if that leads to economic recession. 
From the look of it, one could be forgiven for stashing cash under the mattress. Indeed, in the latest Bank of America Corp.’s fund manager survey, participants said their exposure to cash was at all-time highs.

   Al Mayadeen: Zelensky office calls for strikes on Iran over &#x27;UAV supply&#x27; to Russia 
An advisor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s calls for conducting strikes on Iran over its alleged supply of drones to Russia. 
Ukrainian Presidential Adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Saturday that it was necessary to conduct strikes on Iran due to Tehran allegedly supplying drones to Russia. 
Ukraine and its western allies have long been accusing Iran of supplying drones to Russia in the midst of the war. However,  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said earlier today that his country did, indeed, give a small batch of drones to Russia, but that was before the Ukraine war broke out.

Gryshchenko&#x27;s troops are keeping watch.</span>

                              <span>In an interview with FRANCE 24, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo discussed the sanctions imposed on Moscow in the wake of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;The sanctions are working and that&#x27;s why Russia is working so hard to evade them,&quot; he said. Adeyemo also discussed the cap on the price of Russian oil announced by the G7. He confirmed that this &quot;will happen&quot; on December 5 and predicted a knock-on effect among other buyers of Russian oil, such as China and India, who will likely demand lower prices as a result.</span>

She explains that current pledges remain largely insufficient and calls on G20 countries – responsible for more than 75 percent of carbon emissions – to ensure climate justice. Her message to all those disappointed with current climate action: Elect leaders who will be sure to make it a priority.</span>

                              <span>Residents in Kyiv have been warned to prepare for the worst as Ukraine faces continuing energy shortfalls. 

The city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko recently told media that their enemies are &quot;doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die”.

“And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations,” Mr Klitschko said. 

Kyiv launched hourly rotating blackouts across the city and its surrounds on Sunday.

Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine&#x27;s power infrastructure which has put a strain on the nation&#x27;s energy supply.</span>

                              <span>Giant Ukrainian Flag Unfurled at Sydney&#x27;s Bondi Beach in Show of Solidarity
A giant Ukrainian flag was unfurled at Sydney’s beach suburb of Bondi on November 5, as part of the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, in a show of solidarity for the war-affected country.
Ukrainian community members and locals were filmed carrying the 8 metre by 12 metre flag through Marks Park before holding it above their heads and singing the Ukrainian national anthem.
Organisers said the flag was part of the global “Artists Support Ukraine” movement, and was aimed at raising funds for the Ukraine Crisis Appeal.

“If we had a meaningful penalty, death penalty ... you would stop crime and drugs in the country immediately”, Mr Trump said while holding a rally in Florida.

“Right now if you get caught they give you a jail for half a day, they don&#x27;t do anything” he added.</span>

The Department of Defense (DOD) may be facing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a critical gap in its national security arsenal. Congress has authorized the creation of an institution dedicated to the study and research of irregular warfare (IW), and the education of officers and civilian professionals charged with defending against non-standard threats and executing competent IW campaigns and strategies. 
Unfortunately, initial indications are that this opportunity created by Congress — which comes at precisely the right moment to prepare the nation for competition in the 21st century, in which IW may play an oversized role — might not be realized.

&quot;The Raising of the Cross&quot; oil sketch from the 1640s was long thought to have been the work of a follower of the 17th century master, known for his famous works like &quot;The Night Watch&quot; and &quot;The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp&quot;.
But now the Bredius museum in The Hague, where the sketch has been on display since it was bought in 1921, has revealed, thanks to new scientific techniques, it was in fact painted by Rembrandt.
&quot;The quality of the details are so well done that I am convinced that this is a Rembrandt,&quot; said Johanneke Verhave, who restored the sketch.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), prompting the United States and South Korea to extend air drills that have angered Pyongyang.
Despite an initial government warning that the apparent ICBM had flown over Japan, triggering warning alarms for some residents, Tokyo later said this was incorrect.
The launches came a day after the North fired a daily record 23 missiles, including one that landed off the coast of South Korea for the first time, and drew swift condemnation from Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.
Since Monday, South Korea and the United States have been conducting one of the largest air exercises ever, with hundreds of …</span>

LAHORE (Reuters) -Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was shot in the shin on Thursday when his anti-government protest convoy came under attack in the east of the country in what his aides said was a clear assassination attempt by his rivals.
Khan, ousted as prime minister in a parliamentary confidence vote in April, was six days into a protest procession bound for Islamabad, standing and waving to thousands of cheering supporters from the roof of a container truck, when the shots rang out.
Several in his convoy were wounded in the attack in Wazirabad, nearly 200 km (120 miles) from the capital. Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said a suspect had been arrested.

Both Mexico and Belize dropped their coastal tropical storm warnings as the former hurricane weakened and headed west at 10 miles per hour (16 kilometers per hour), according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.
Forecasters warned that the tourist-popular coast of Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula should continue monitoring the situation as the maximum sustained winds decreased to around 45 mph (75 kph).

KYIV (Reuters) -Russian attacks were reported across large areas of Ukraine on Thursday, with heavy shelling in numerous regions damaging infrastructure, including electricity supplies to Europe&#x27;s largest nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said.
The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days&#x27; worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said.
Russian strikes were also reported in Kriviy Rih, in central Ukraine, and in Sumy and Kharkiv, in the northeast. Heavy fighting was ongoing in the eastern reg…</span>

Hours later, 30-year-old Jung Joo-hee was among 156 people, most of them in their teens and twenties, killed in the South Korean capital as they celebrated Halloween free of COVID restrictions for the first time in three years.
On Thursday, the young woman&#x27;s family buried her ashes in a peaceful family plot outside Seoul, with a planted sapling and bouquets by her grave stone, in a sombre ceremony of prayers and tears.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea unsuccessfully fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during a new salvo of launches Thursday, the South Korean military said, with Washington urging all nations to enforce sanctions on Pyongyang.
The launches prompted South Korea and the United States to extend their ongoing joint air drills, the largest-ever such exercises, citing North Korea&#x27;s &quot;provocations&quot;.
People in parts of northern Japan were ordered to seek shelter during the North&#x27;s latest launches, which included two short-range missiles and followed a blitz of projectiles fired Wednesday.

                              <span>Days before the polls close in the 2022 midterm elections, actions by Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are already being seen through the prism of the expected 2024 GOP presidential nomination contest.
DeSantis is starring in a new ad for GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who is facing an uncharacteristically tough re-election in deep-red Utah as he&#x27;s being challenged by independent Evan McMullin, who won Lee&#x27;s vote for president in 2016.
The ad, paid for by the far-right Club for Growth, is the first out-of-state ad featuring DeSantis backing a fellow Republican, according to Breitbart News.
Trump then re-endorsed Lee in a statement posted to his Truth Social website.

                              <span>Thousands of Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s supporters called Wednesday for the Brazilian military to intervene and keep the right-wing president in power after he lost re-election over the weekend to leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
After days of silence, Bolsonaro on Tuesday gave a short speech in which he neither accepted defeat nor congratulated Lula on his win, though his chief of staff took the podium afterward to say the president had &quot;authorized&quot; the transition to a new government.
Since then, his supporters have rallied in front of military installations in Brazil&#x27;s major cities to call for action.
&quot;Federal intervention now!&quot; chanted some of the thousands who gathered in front of the Southeastern Military Command in the Latin American country&#x27;s biggest city, Sao Paulo, on Wednesday.

                              <span>The White House said Wednesday it was increasingly concerned over Moscow&#x27;s talk of using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, after a media report said top Russian military officials had discussed how and when to use such a weapon.
&quot;We have grown increasingly concerned about the potential as these months have gone on,&quot; said White House national security spokesman John Kirby.
Kirby did not confirm a New York Times report that said high-level Russian military officials recently discussed when and how they might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.
The report, which cited unnamed US officials, said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not take part in the discussions, and there was no indication that the Russian military had decided to deploy the weapons.
But Kirby said any comments on th…</span>

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a hurricane warning for Honduras&#x27; Bay Islands, the coast of Belize and Mexico&#x27;s Yucatan area stretching from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya.
Lisa was moving westward in the Caribbean Sea at a speed of 24 kilometers (15 miles) per hour with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and even higher gusts, said the NHC.
&quot;Additional strengthening is forecast as Lisa approaches Belize. Weakening is expected after the center makes landfall,&quot; it added.

Russia has started a draft of men in the country. Many of them have fled and those who couldn&#x27;t were sent to fight with sparse and “barely usable” equipment and little food. It has resulted in soldiers looking for creative ways to get out. 
In a report by the independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe, covered by the Daily Beast, reporters spoke to the wives of three men sent to Ukraine last month into a &quot;living nightmare.&quot;

                              <span>One person was killed and another sent to hospital after shooting broke out outside Woburn Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Toronto, CP24 reports. 
One person was found with gunshot wounds and was taken to the hospital and later died. Another teen boy was taken to the hospital but his condition is not known. 
Toronto Police Service (TPS) duty inspector Lori Kranenburg said that both victims are believed to be teenagers but she could not confirm if either victim was a student at the school. 
“It appears that there were several shots fired, but I don’t have an exact number. At this time we’re reviewing video and canvassing the area,” Kranenburg said.
Video circulating online apparently shows the events that led up to the shooting. The video shows one person backing away as three people walk towards him while words are exchanged. Shots then ring out.

Sunak had argued that &quot;pressing domestic commitments&quot; would keep him away from COP27 in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh -- after inheriting an economic crisis from predecessor Liz Truss.
But that fuelled doubts about Sunak&#x27;s interest in the planetary emergency, and critics said the inexperienced leader was passing up an opportunity to rub shoulders with the likes of US President Joe Biden and European peers.
&quot;There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy without investing in renewables,&quot; Sunak wrote on Twitter.

With around 84 percent of the vote counted at 0755 GMT, according to the Central Elections Committee, Netanyahu could be set for a dramatic comeback.
&quot;We are close to a big victory,&quot; he told supporters of his right-wing Likud party at a rally early Wednesday.
But his main rival, caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, told his own supporters in Tel Aviv that &quot;nothing is decided&quot;, and that his centrist Yesh Atid party &quot;will wait patiently... for the final results&quot;.

The Russians have been firing salvos from the south end of the road ever since being routed and retreating from the village in the first month of war in March.
The Ukrainians have been trying to press a more recent counteroffensive past the Russian positions into areas around the Crimea peninsula the Kremlin seized in 2014.

                              <span>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro once took a stab at predicting the outcome of his 2022 re-election bid: &quot;Prison, death or victory.&quot;
Victory it was not. Death came in the form of an end to his presidency, which he grudgingly accepted Tuesday -- two days after the election was declared for his opponent.
And prison?
&quot;You can be sure that option... does not exist,&quot; the far-right leader told members of his crucial evangelical support base in August 2021.
Analysts, however, believe a future behind bars may be a very real prospect for the bellicose Bolsonaro, even if it may take years.
Almost from the start of his controversial mandate in 2019, Bolsonaro racked up accusations and investigations for everything from spreading disinformation to crimes against humanity.

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea&#x27;s military said.
The launch comes after Pyongyang on Tuesday demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, calling them a provocation that may draw &quot;more powerful follow-up measures.&quot;
Broadcaster YTN reported that an air raid warning was issued on the South Korean island of Ulleung around the time of the missile launch. A spokesman for South Korea&#x27;s military said they were checking to see whether the air raid warning was related to the missile launch.
The United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day.
North Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills.

                              <span>&quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Daniel Radcliffe described why he spoke out author J.K. Rowling in a new interview.
Radcliffe was discussing the open letter he released in 2020, in which he criticized Rowling’s views on gender identity.
“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that,&quot; Radcliffe told IndieWire.
&quot;And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important,” he explained.
IN OTHER NEWS: Trump Organization&#x27;s criminal fraud trial put on hold
In his June 2020 open letter posted at The Trevor Project, Radcliffe wrote, &quot;Transgender women are women.&quot;
&quot;Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I,&quot; Radcliffe explained.</span>

                              <span>U2&#x27;s Bono on Tuesday released his memoir &quot;Surrender,&quot; detailing the journey from his youth in Dublin to fronting one of the world&#x27;s most prominent rock bands.
The introspective book is organized across 40 different U2 songs, including 40 original drawings.
The 62-year-old artist born Paul David Hewson is a long-time humanitarian well-known for lending his voice to a variety of causes, including the fight against poverty and AIDS.
In his more than 500-page book, Bono delves in to those ambitions but also his growth as a teenager struck by tragedy -- his mother died suddenly when he was 14 -- and an account of his heart operation in 2016.
He also waxes on the perplexities and finer points of songwriting, and &quot;the pseudo-religious part of being a rock star, how we put the messy in messianic.&quot;
&quot;U2&#x27;s music was never really rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll,&quot; he writes in the book. &quot;Under its contemporary skin it&#x27;s opera -- a big music, big emotions unlocked in the pop music of the day.&quot;
The rocker is promoting the memoir with a 14-date book tour entitled &quot;Stories of Surrender,&quot; which kicks off in New York this week and includes stops in Chicago, London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and, of course, Dublin.
&quot;When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I&#x27;d previously only sketched in songs,&quot; Bono said in a statement when the book&#x27;s publication was announced earlier this year.
&quot;Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept,&quot; he continued. &quot;I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist.&quot;
&quot;Surrender is the story of one pilgrim&#x27;s lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way.&quot;

                              <span>The Italian opposition has voiced fears for public freedoms after the new far-right government stepped up fines and jail terms against the organizers and followers of illegal rave parties.
At the new cabinet&#x27;s first meeting on Monday the draft legislation was approved, raising concern it could be used arbitrarily to shut down any type of public demonstration.
&quot;It&#x27;s a major error. Raves have no place in such a document. This calls into question public freedoms,&quot; Democratic Party secretary and former prime minister Enrico Letta posted on Twitter.
Writer Erri di Luca saw a &quot;serious danger for open and free musical shows&quot;.
On Monday, police confiscated audio equipment worth 150,000 euros (dollars) when they intervened at a rave in the northern city of Modena.
A day earlier, police did not move…</span>

                              <span>The White House said Tuesday Iran was willingly taking part in killing Ukrainians by providing drones to Russia for the war, and voiced concern it would also ship missiles to Moscow.
By arming the Russians, the Iranian regime &quot;is involved in killing innocent Ukrainians,&quot; White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.
&quot;At its core, this is a regime in Tehran that is openly and willingly making themselves an accomplice to the murder of innocent Ukrainian people on Ukrainian soil.&quot;
Kirby noted Iran&#x27;s provision of attack drones to Russia, which have been deployed in recent weeks to damage Ukraine infrastructure.
But he would not confirm reports that Tehran could also send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
&quot;We remain concerned about the potential of Iran to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles,&quot; Kirby told reporters.
&quot;We haven&#x27;t seen that bear out, but it&#x27;s a concern that we have,&quot; he said.</span>

                              <span>Blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day, research estimated Tuesday, suggesting that the omnipresent pollution poses a bigger danger to the world&#x27;s largest animal than previously thought.
The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood.
Now a modeling study published in the journal Nature Communications has estimated how much is being ingested by whales.
A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements.
&quot;It&#x27;s basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale,&quot; said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study&#x27;s first author.

                              <span>October 2022 is set to be the hottest month of October in France since records started in 1945, national weather agency Meteo-France said in a statement. 
With an average temperature close to or even just above 17 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit) - three to four degrees above normal levels - last month was far warmer than the previous record in October 2001, when temperatures averaged 16.3C.
The second half of the month saw an exceptionally long and intense period of unseasonably high temperatures, with the southwestern city of Bordeaux registering on Oct. 16 the latest 30C since records started.
Meteo-France said that due to climate change, periods of unusual heat late or early in the year were set to become more frequent.
Beach resorts across Europe have extended their season as the unseasonable warmth kept tourists coming to the seaside.
