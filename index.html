                              <span>Prince William and Princess Catherine’s popularity in the United States is more about their “personality and persona” rather than their position in the Royal Family, TalkTV royal editor Sarah Hewson says. 

Prince William’s popularity in the United States has soared after a new Gallop poll found he was more popular with the American public than President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. 

“They have nothing to do with the Democrats or the Republicans, and so you see both of these featuring very highly in those polls,” Ms Hewson told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

Ms Hewson said there was a major “cleanup operation” on the website while Prince Harry embarked on his mini tour of Asia.  

“This happened three years ago but it does just give us this very visual representation of just how much their status has changed,” she told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

Many of the country&#x27;s historians have denounced a growing tolerance for Adolf Hitler in India, particularly since Narendra Modi&#x27;s Hindu nationalist government came to power in 2014. Hitler’s book Mein Kampf remains one of the country&#x27;s bestsellers. FRANCE 24 brings you this report by Nabeel Ahmed, Deepika Singh, Lea Delfolie and Khansa Juned.</span>

Mint Press: Taliban’s Massively Successful Opium Eradication Raises Questions About What US Was Doing All Along  
The Taliban government in Afghanistan – the nation that until recently produced 90% of the world’s heroin – has drastically reduced opium cultivation across the country. Western sources estimate an up to 99% reduction in some provinces. This raises serious questions about the seriousness of U.S. drug eradication efforts in the country over the past 20 years. And, as global heroin supplies dry up, experts tell MintPress News that they fear this could spark the growing use of fentanyl – a drug dozens of times stronger than heroin that already kills more than 100,000 Americans yearly.
 
 
The Taliban Does What the US Did Not 
It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. 
In April of last year, the ruling Taliban government announced the prohibition of poppy farming, citing both their strong religious beliefs and the extremely harmful social costs that heroin and other opioids – derived from the sap of the poppy plant – have wrought across Afghanistan.

WNU Editor: How is it that the U.S., after spending years and billions to eradicate Afghanistan&#x27;s opium production, completely failed .... but the Taliban, with no money and armed with little more than sticks, succeeded within a year. 
I think the answer is obvious. Past Western-backed Afghan governments and the U.S. were not serious in eradicating Afghanistan&#x27;s poppy fields</span>

 China on Sunday vowed &quot;resolute and forceful measures&quot; over a weekend trip by Taiwan Vice President William Lai to the United States it said it was closely monitoring.  
Lai – the frontrunner in Taiwan&#x27;s presidential elections next year – is officially making only transit stops in the United States en route to and from Paraguay, where he will attend the inauguration of president-elect Santiago Pena. 
Taiwan is claimed by China, which has vowed to take the island democracy one day – by force, if necessary – and ramped up political and military pressure. 
&quot;China is closely following the development of the situation and will take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; an unnamed spokesperson for the foreign ministry said in a statement published online.

A total of 31 percent of eligible voters in the U.S. support or strongly support American military forces heading to the battlefields of Ukraine, polling conducted exclusively for Newsweek by Redfield &amp; Wilton Strategies has revealed. 
A quarter of respondents neither supported nor opposed the idea of sending U.S. soldiers to Ukraine, with 34 percent against the suggestion. Just under one in ten respondents did not know.

The Pentagon said it had no comment to make when contacted by Newsweek about the results of the poll.

After months of grueling advances through minefields, small villages and open steppes, Ukrainian forces are making some progress along two major lines of attack, according to analysts, Ukrainian officials and Russian military bloggers. 
The advances, while small in terms of territory taken, are compelling Moscow to redeploy forces, military analysts say. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, called the advances “tactically significant,” adding that the situation would create new challenges for Russian forces spread across the vast front line.

Russia&#x27;s defence ministry has said that Ukraine had tried unsuccessfully to strike the Crimean Bridge across the Kerch Strait with S-200 rockets, but that no damage or casualties had been caused. 
The 19-km bridge, which links Russian-annexed Crimea to Russia, has come under repeated attack from Ukrainian forces since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. 
&quot;The Ukrainian missile was detected in a timely manner and was intercepted in the air by Russian air defence systems. No damage or casualties were reported,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.

Bloomberg: Biden fears China&#x27;s economic problems are ‘ticking time bomb&#x27; posing danger to world 
Throws barbs at Xi Jinping in fundraising speech 

President Joe Biden blasted China’s economic problems as a “ticking time bomb” and referred to Communist Party leaders as “bad folks,” his latest barb against President Xi Jinping’s government even as his administration seeks to improve overall ties with Beijing. 
In comments that included several major inaccuracies about the world’s second-largest economy, Biden said at a political fundraiser Aug. 11 that China was in “trouble” because its growth has slowed and it had the “highest unemployment rate going.”
He also blasted Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative as the “debt and noose,” because of the high levels of lending to developing economies associated with the global investment program.

Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine: USAF, Northrop Test New Tech That Lets the B-2 Update Mission Parameters ‘In Seconds’ 
 Northrop Grumman and the Air Force successfully demonstrated a new mission update system for the B-2 bomber in a two-day event at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., last month. 
The system receives new mission parameters and feeds them directly into the B-2’s computers without the need for the pilots to manually input the data. 
The Integrated Airborne Mission Transfer (IAMT) demonstration started July 18 after B-2 No. 1086, the Spirit of Kitty Hawk, was fitted with Northrop’s Multi-Mission Domain (MMD) open-mission architecture, meant to make adding new mission capabilities easier.

                              <span>Retired mailman and Vietnam veteran Thomas Leonard lived in the historic former capital of Hawaii for 44 years until this week, when a rapidly moving wildfire burned down his apartment, melted his Jeep and forced him to spend four terrifying hours hiding from the flames behind a seawall.“I’ve got nothing left,” Leonard said Thursday as he sat on an inflatable mattress outside a shelter for those who fled the blaze that decimated the town of Lahaina. “I’m a disabled vet, so now I’m a homeless vet,” he added with a small laugh.</span>

                              <span>Elon Musk has suggested that his much-hyped cage fight with Mark Zuckerberg will take place in Italy. Musk said progress was being made with efforts to arrange the encounter, which is hoped to raise millions of euros for two Italian children&#x27;s hospitals. Any location will &quot;pay respect to the past and present of Italy&quot;, said Musk, who also outlined plans for promoters, and confirmed that he and Zuckerberg, and not UFC, will manage the event. Zuckerberg has not yet commented publicly on the fight.</span>

RT:  Zelensky holds ‘closed talks’ with top British generals

 
The discussions took place amid growing Western disappointment with the slow progress of Kiev’s counteroffensive  
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says he has held talks with the UK&#x27;s top military leadership and has stated that more weapons are being readied for delivery to Kiev. 
 In a video address published to his Telegram channel on Wednesday, Zelensky described the meeting as “closed, but productive.” He did not, however, elaborate on any specific details of the talks, stating only that new packages of military aid are being prepared for Ukraine, including air defense systems.

                              <span>CNN: ECOWAS orders ‘immediate activation’ of standby force in Niger  
West African leaders on Thursday ramped up the rhetoric against Niger’s coup leaders, ordering the “activation” and the “deployment” of a regional standby force to restore constitutional order in the coup-hit country. 
Meeting in Abuja, Nigeria after the expiration of the one-week ultimatum they gave to the Niger’s military junta, leaders from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a deployment “to restore constitutional order in the Republic of Niger,” according to a statement read by Omar Alieu Touray, President of the ECOWAS Commission. 
 It was not immediately clear what the “deployment” and “activation” of the force would entail. 
The statement also emphasized a “determination to keep all options on the table for the peaceful resolution of the crisis.”

Fired officials will be replaced by former and injured soldiers. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he fired all regional military recruitment bosses amid reports of corruption. 
The dismissed officials will be replaced by soldiers who have been on the front lines or who have been hurt in combat, as “they can be entrusted with this recruitment system,” Zelenskyy said. 
“This system should be run by people who know exactly what war is and why cynicism and bribery in times of war constitutes high treason,” he added, as Ukraine digs in against a Russian offensive in the northeast while also trying to reclaim territory captured by Moscow’s invading forces in the country’s south and east.

Heads of state from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are preparing for a summit on Thursday to discuss their standoff with the junta, which defied an Aug. 6 deadline to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum.

The first lavishly equipped Launch Edition with all-wheel drive will bend your bank balance to the tune of €83,190 in Europe. Prices for the base version with no gizmos hover around €70,000.

&quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters,&quot; Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage&#x27;s exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage&#x27;s complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…</span>

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland&#x27;s trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.

The South American country, which saw unemployment tick up to 6.9% in the first quarter, is set for primary elections on Sunday where the conservative opposition is expected to outperform the ruling Peronist coalition.

Ukraine has not taken direct responsibility for the string of attacks, including on the capital Moscow, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that &quot;war&quot; is coming to Russia.
Polls show the former stand-up comedian&#x27;s crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country&#x27;s most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.
Offering a rare glimpse at Ukraine&#x27;s homegrown explosive drones, Prytula recently shared images of himself with a fleet in an undisclosed location.

This year&#x27;s anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
&quot;Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory,&quot; Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …</span>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree &quot;a national disgrace&quot; after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.
Organisers had insisted the event would continue but on Monday the World Organization of the Scout Movement said Seoul had told …</span>

The US sailors and Marines entered the Red Sea on Sunday after transiting through the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the US Navy&#x27;s Fifth Fleet said in a statement.
They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing &quot;greater flexibility and maritime capability&quot; to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.
The US military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
