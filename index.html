Indictment for leaking confidential information carries a penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment and, in extreme cases, the death penalty, legal experts say.</span>

Hamas said  it cannot find the munition that hit the site and has declined to provide detail to support its count of 471 casualties.</span>

                              <span>A premature baby squirms inside a glass incubator in the neonatal ward of al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip. His life hinges on the constant flow of electricity, which is in danger of running out imminently unless the hospital can get more fuel for its generators. ​​Once the generators stop, hospital director Iyad Abu Zahar fears that the babies in the ward, unable to breathe on their own, will perish. Doctors treating premature babies across Gaza are grappling with similar fears. At least 130 premature babies are at “grave risk” across six neonatal units, aid workers said.</span>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House on Monday said Iran was in some cases &quot;actively facilitating&quot; rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed proxy groups on U.S. military bases in Iraq and Syria, and President Biden has directed the Department of Defense to brace for more and respond appropriately. 
White House spokesman John Kirby said there had been an uptick in such attacks over the last week, and especially over the last few days, but the U.S. would not allow its interests in the region to &quot;go unchallenged.&quot;

                              <span>Washington Post: Ukrainian spies with deep ties to CIA wage shadow war against Russia 

KYIV — The cluttered car carrying a mother and her 12-year-old daughter seemed barely worth the attention of Russian security officials as it approached a border checkpoint. 


But the least conspicuous piece of luggage — a crate for a cat — was part of an elaborate, lethal plot. Ukrainian operatives had installed a hidden compartment in the pet carrier, according to security officials with knowledge of the operation, and used it to conceal components of a bomb. 


Four weeks later, the device detonated just outside Moscow in an SUV being driven by the daughter of a Russian nationalist who had urged his country to “kill, kill, kill” Ukrainians, an explosion signaling that the heart of Russia would not be spared the carnage of war.

Final results show sizeble gains for the far-right Swiss People’s Party, and important losses for the Greens. 
The far-right and euroskeptic Swiss People’s Party (SVP) came out as a clear leader in Switzerland’s national elections, according to final results released late Sunday. 
The SVP, which has centered its campaign on anti-immigrant rhetoric in an election dominated by domestic issues, has won 28.6 percent of the vote in the Parliament’s lower chamber, the National Council — up from 25.6 percent four years ago — winning 62 seats, nine more than in 2019. 
While the centrist The Center party maintained its score at 14.6 percent (29 seats), the liberal FDP party suffered a small loss, losing one seat.

Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza following Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an open warning against Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon, discouraging them from invading Israel as his country is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza. 
The expected ground invasion follows Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities.

While visiting troops in northern Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu said if Hezbollah were to launch a war and invade Israel, &quot;it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating.&quot;

The Biden administration has pressed Israel to delay its imminent invasion of Gaza to allow for the release of more hostages held by Hamas and for aid to reach Gaza, according to two sources briefed on the discussions. 
The release of two Americans held by Hamas Friday signaled that more of roughly 200 people believed to be kidnapped by the militant group may be freed after they were taken during the group’s deadly attacks launched against Israel two week ago. 
“The [administration] pressed Israeli leadership to delay because of progress on the hostage front,” and the need to get trucks of aid into Gaza, one person familiar with the discussions said.

CNN — The battle to decide who will run crisis-wracked Argentina is heading to a run off vote next month between left wing candidate Sergio Massa and far right libertarian Javier Milei, according to data released by Argentina’s National Electoral Chamber after the first round of voting on Sunday.
After polls closed Massa received the highest number of votes – 8,877,325, accounting for 36.33% of the total, data revealed. Milei received 7,373,876 votes – roughly 30.18%.

Third place candidate Patricia Bullrich got 23.82% and conceded defeat late Sunday night.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Joe Biden met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet during his visit to Israel, the U.S. president assured them: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, and I am a Zionist.&quot; 
The politicians and generals gathered in the ballroom of the Tel Aviv hotel nodded in approval, according to a U.S. official knowledgeable of the closed-door remarks, even as Israel bombarded Gaza in retaliation for a devastating attack by Palestinian Hamas militants and with a ground invasion looming. 
Biden, who is of Irish Catholic descent, has used similar words in the past to profess his affinity for Israel. But the moment, which has not been previously reported, illustrates how Biden&#x27;s decades as one of the leading &quot;Friends of Israel&quot; in American politics seem to be guiding him during a defining crisis of his presidency.

Stars and Stripes: Nearly 70% of US troops are overweight or obese, research report says  
WASHINGTON — Almost seven out of every 10 U.S. troops are either overweight or obese, according to a new report, which also warns the growing trend could compromise military readiness and undermine national security. 
The American Security Project, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that studies modern national security issues, conducted the study and found 68% of active-duty service members fall somewhere between overweight and obese on the body mass index, which is a long-used but controversial method of assessing a person’s body classification by height and weight. 
A person between 25 and 30 on the BMI is considered clinically overweight and more than 30 is considered obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.

FOX News: McConnell calls China, Russia, Iran new &#x27;axis of evil&#x27; that US must deal with: &#x27;This is an emergency&#x27; 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says Israel-Hamas war is a &#x27;worldwide problem&#x27; posing &#x27;immediate threat&#x27; to US

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Sunday deemed China, Russia and Iran the new &quot;axis of evil&quot; amid wars in Ukraine and Israel, while addressing U.S. funding of allies&#x27; responses to those duel conflicts. 
In a new sit-down interview with &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; host Shannon Bream, McConnell, the highest-ranking Senate Republican, agreed with fellow Republican Kentuckian Sen. Rand Paul that the $1.5 trillion deficit is &quot;entirely too big.&quot; 
But while Paul remarked last month that the U.S. under the Biden administration was borrowing heavily from China just to send aid to Ukraine, McConnell instead emphasized Sunday that the deficit also expanded during the prior administration under former President Donald Trump.

Times of Israel: US warns Iran against escalation, boosts military readiness, pulls some Iraq staff 
Pentagon bolsters regional air defenses as tensions boil over Israel-Hamas war, following attacks on US troops in Iraq, Syria by pro-Tehran militias 
The United States has warned Iran and its allies against any regional escalation in the wake of Israel’s war with Hamas, two top US officials said Sunday, hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region. 
With tensions mounting, Washington also announced Sunday it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq. 
“We are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks against our own personnel, our own people,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS News. “We expect there is a likelihood of escalation.”

The court declared Section 2(1)(d) of the Army Act, which elaborates on persons subject to the act, to be in violation of the constitution and “of no legal effect”.</span>

                              <span>China&#x27;s Middle East special envoy, Zhai Jun, has expressed concern about the situation in Gaza, stating that the risk of a large-scale ground conflict is growing. He highlighted the conflict spilling over into neighboring regions, including along the Israeli-Lebanese and Israeli-Syrian borders. Zhai called on the international community to be vigilant and take immediate action to avoid a serious humanitarian disaster. China is willing to promote dialogue, achieve a ceasefire, restore peace, and support a two-state solution.</span>

                              <span>Two journalists in Iran have been sentenced to up to seven years in prison for collaborating with the US government and other charges. Niloufar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi were imprisoned for over a year following their coverage of Mahsa Amini&#x27;s death in police custody. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has condemned the decision and called for their release. The journalists were charged with collaborating with the US government, colluding against national security, and propaganda against the system. Their detentions have sparked international criticism over the security force crackdown after Amini&#x27;s death.</span>

                              <span>The world-renowned Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai has told FRANCE 24 how Israel is now a &quot;traumatised society&quot; after the events of October 7. Likening the plight of Israelis to the American population after 9/11, he said the savage attack on civilians by Hamas is even worse than what happened in the Yom Kippur War of exactly 50 years ago, during which he himself was injured. Gitai is however highly critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he calls for &quot;peaceful solutions&quot; to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span>

&quot;Trump and his team are actively planning to pull the United States out of NATO — or, barring that, kneecap the collective defense provisions at the heart of the alliance,&quot; writes Rolling Stone editor-in-chief Noah Shachtman.
&quot;As this, and the damning tapes of Trump/Pratt conversation show, Donald Trump is the biggest internal threat to America&#x27;s national security we have had since the Civil War,&quot; warns political scientist Norman Ornstein of The Atlantic, pointing to the Rolling Stone piece and the revelations about Trump&#x27;s remarks to an Australian national in which he allegedly divulged U.S. nuclear submarine secrets.

                              <span>Former President Donald Trump is pushing for a major American foreign policy change in his second administration that would likely upend decades of global national security infrastructure.
Sources tell Rolling Stone that Trump is planning to pull the United States entirely out of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance unless it caves to his demands that include one that would seem to undermine the entire purpose of the alliance.
In addition to his standard calls for other NATO countries to chip in more for their defense spending, Trump also reportedly wants to rip up the strategic doctrine that an attack on one NATO country represents an attack on all NATO countries.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
&quot;When he was in office, Trump would repeatedly scoff at this collective-defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, known as Article 5,&quot; the publication writes. &quot;One former senior administration official recalls to Rolling Stone a moment in the Oval Office in mid-2018 when the then-president started reading from a written list of smaller NATO countries, some of which he argued most Americans had never even heard of before.&quot;
Tearing up Article 5 would be a major boon for the likes of Russia, which attacked non-NATO member Ukraine in 2022 but notably has not attacked other NATO members on its border such as Estonia and Latvia.
Dr. Aaron Stein, a Black Sea Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, tells Rolling Stone that Trump&#x27;s plan would be a &quot;tremendously stupid endeavor&quot; and added that &quot;trading away allies based on ignorance, and Trump is ignorant about this issue, is just silly for broader U.S. national security.&quot;</span>

&quot;I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused,&quot; added the co-founder of the tech mega gathering created in 2009 in Dublin but held in Lisbon since 2016.
A spokesperson for the organization said: &quot;Web Summit will appoint a new CEO as soon as possible, and Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon will go ahead as planned.&quot;
This year&#x27;s edition from November 13 to 16, is set to bring together some 2,300 startups and more than 70,000 participants, say organizers.
Several companies, including tech giants Google and Meta, which is behind Facebook and Instagram, as well as event headliners have announced they are boycotting the gathering since Cosgrave&#x27;s remarks.
He had written on X, formerly Twitter, that he was &quot;shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders &amp; governments&quot; in support of Israel.
&quot;War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are,&quot; he wrote on October 13.
Since shock Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, which left 1,400 dead, Israel has launched devastating air and ground bombardments of Gaza. The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.
The boycott by Meta and Google followed other exits by companies and tech figures, including Intel, Siemens and US comedian Amy Poehler and X-Files actor Gillian Anderson.</span>

                              <span>A first anniversary in office is normally a moment for a leader to celebrate, but Britain&#x27;s Rishi Sunak hits the milestone this week with a mountain to climb to retain power in a general election expected next year.

Two by-election losses to the main opposition Labour Party on Thursday underscored how Sunak, 43, has failed to revive the Conservatives&#x27; beleaguered fortunes during his first 12 months in charge.
&quot;The more people see of Sunak, the less they like him in some ways,&quot; Tim Bale, author of a book about the right-wing Conservatives since Brexit, told AFP.
&quot;He doesn&#x27;t really project authority, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily give the impression that he&#x27;s in control of events.
&quot;He looks, in part, as if he&#x27;s sort of lurching from one policy initiative to another in a desperate attempt to curry …</span>

Simmering racial divisions were exposed earlier this month when just over 60 percent of Australians voted against a referendum to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders within the 1901 constitution.
In the wake of the result, many Indigenous leaders embarked on a &quot;week of silence&quot;, asking for time to grieve what they saw as a crushing rejection at the hands of Australia&#x27;s white majority.
Some leaders ended that silence in a scathing open letter addressed to the government, criticizing the &quot;appalling and mean-spirited&quot; outlook of milli…</span>

                              <span>A teenage Iranian girl, who fell into a coma earlier this month following an alleged encounter with officers over violating the country’s hijab law, is said to be &quot;brain dead&quot;, Iranian state media reported on Sunday.
&quot;Follow-ups on the latest health condition of Armita Geravand indicate that her health condition as brain dead seems certain despite the efforts of the medical staff,&quot; the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said.
Iranian authorities have denied claims by rights groups that the 16-year-old was hurt after a confrontation on Oct. 1 with officers enforcing the mandatory Islamic dress code in the Tehran metro.

The report on Geravand could revive nationwide protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini last year in the custody of morality police.

                              <span>Hurricane Norma slammed into Mexico&#x27;s northwestern coast Saturday afternoon as a Category 1 storm, bringing dangerous rain and flooding, authorities said.
The storm came ashore about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of the resort city of Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California coast, gradually weakening from a Category 3 as it approached land.
Norma was moving northeast at 9 kph, packing winds of up to 130 kph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported at 2100 GMT. 
Norma was expected to bring rainfall of up to 45 centimeters (18 inches), producing &quot;flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain,&quot; the NHC said.
&quot;Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions&quot; would affect the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for the next couple of days.
Hotel employees in Cabo San Lucas urged guests to stay indoors until authorities give the all-clear, Gustavo Matamoros, a hotel worker, told AFP.
Local authorities say about 60,000 tourists are staying in the area, most of them international visitors.
Footage from Milenio TV showed flooded streets as Norma arrived. No casualties have been reported by authorities.
Norma should continue to weaken to a tropical storm as it moves toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday.
Two people died last week when Hurricane Lidia struck the western states of Jalisco and Nayarit.

“Of course, Iran is behind this,” Mr Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

“When the history books are written, those will be the opening.”

Officials say 4,741 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the conflict as Israel’s military claims the number of people held hostage has risen to 212.</span>

                              <span>Agriculture Minister Murray Watt says every life taken in the conflict between Israel and Hamas is a “terrible thing”.

The Agriculture Minister says since the beginning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Labor government have “condemned Hamas’ attack on innocent Israeli lives”.

“We’ve said consistently that Israel has a right to defend itself,” Mr Watt told Sky News Australia. 

“But that doesn’t get away from the fact that every life in this conflict is worth something.

“We don’t want to see any more lives lost than absolutely needed.”</span>

                              <span>Nine Republican candidates have officially entered the race to become the next House speaker after the withdrawal of Jim Jordan. 

Several have signed a loyalty pledge to support the winner of the first vote, aiming to avoid the vote-counting confusion that followed Mr Jordan’s candidacy. 

This comes after earlier this month, former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted. 

“If we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern, and every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” Republican Representative Michael McCaul said. 

A secret vote with the GOP conference is scheduled for Tuesday as Republicans are encouraged to sign a unity pledge, promising to support whoever wins the vote.</span>

The decision to remove the sanctions clears the way for the Prime Minister to visit Beijing next month.

Mr Tyrrell said Chinese wine consumption has dropped by about 60 per cent because “they can’t get the wine that they really like to drink”.

“As more and more Chinese people have travelled over the last 10 years, they’ve got to know Australia, they like Australia, they like Australians and got a great taste for Australian wine, so we really need to be back in that market,” he told Sky News Australia.

Mr Tyrrell hopes China’s economy will grow and Australian wine sales will grow with it.</span>

Shortly after the convoy entered, a blast was heard and seven people were wounded. The Israeli military said one of its tanks accidentally fired and hit an Egyptian position near the border. The Egyptian military said the blast caused minor injuries and that an investigation is underway. The convoy carried medical and food supplies, and distribution of the supplies began on Sunday. However, aid officials are warning of a humanitarian disaster as supplies run low.</span>

The Anti-Defamation League recorded a 55% rise in antisemitic incidents in the US compared to the same period last year. There have also been spikes in anti-Israel rallies and antisemitic harassment on messaging apps. Similarly, the Council on American-Islamic Relations reported an increase in anti-Muslim incidents in the past week. In the UK, anti-Muslim attacks have increased sixfold, while France and Germany have also seen a rise in antisemitic incidents.</span>

Qatar played a significant role in delicate talks involving multiple countries to secure the release of the captives. When Hamas released two captives, the Raanan family, US officials thanked Qatar for their involvement. Families of the remaining hostages hope this is just the beginning. The hostages have likely been split into small groups, and it is unclear why the Raanans were released first, although their American nationality may have played a role.</span>

                              <span>Scientists at the University of Bristol have used supercomputer climate models to predict the formation of a future supercontinent called Pangea Ultima, which is expected to occur 250 million years from now. This continent will bring extreme temperatures, rendering it uninhabitable for mammals. The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth&#x27;s climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.</span>

                              <span>An international team of experts has analyzed ancient superdeep diamonds found in mines in Brazil and Western Africa to gain new insights into the early evolution of complex life on Earth. These rare diamonds, formed within the supercontinent Gondwana, provide information about the formation and movement of supercontinents. The research reveals that supercontinents played a role in concentrating deep oceanic plate subduction. The diamonds formed deep beneath Gondwana and were carried to the surface during volcanic eruptions.</span>

                              <span>Qatar has become a key player in efforts to release hostages held by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, earning praise from French President Emmanuel Macron.

The country&#x27;s close ties with Hamas, including financial backing, and its respected status with the US contribute to its effectiveness in hostage negotiations.</span>

                              <span>BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) — Argentina&#x27;s general election vote was being counted on Sunday evening, with early signals suggesting the under-fire Peronist ruling coalition was performing better than expected, while all eyes remained on far-right libertarian radical Javier Milei. 
Argentines flocked to the polls on Sunday to vote in a tense national election where wild-haired outsider Milei has hogged the limelight amid the country&#x27;s worst economic crisis in two decades and rising anger with the traditional elite.</span>

                              <span>A secret recording revealed by &quot;60 Minutes Australia&quot; exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. 
Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a &quot;favor&quot; for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do,&quot; admitting not only to the bribery but also that it&#x27;s frequent behavior for him. 

&quot;It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings,&quot; The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

                              <span>While appearing on ABC&#x27;s This Week, host Jonathan Karl pressed Scott on his claim that U.S. &quot;weakness&quot; led to the terrorist attacks.

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?be allowed to run for office?


	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	&quot;And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that&#x27;s beyond the pale, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; the ABC host asked.


	&quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost,&quot; Scott opined.

                              <span>ABC News: US moves carrier to Middle East following attacks on US forces 
There have been incidents involving drone and rocket attacks on U.S. bases. 
The Pentagon announced late Saturday that it will send an aircraft carrier and air defense systems to defend U.S. military troops in response to a growing number of attacks on U.S. facilities, presumably by Iranian-backed groups as tensions mount amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. 
Additional U.S. military forces in the U.S. have also been placed in a higher state of readiness for a possible future deployment to the Middle East on short notice.

                              <span>Insider: Israel is now fighting on 3 fronts as airstrikes and violence escalate across the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and Syria 
 * Israel is now waging war on three fronts — the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and Syria. 
 * As the conflict spreads, the US is beefing up its military presence in the region. 
 * US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it was in response to &quot;recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces.&quot; 
Following the Palestinian militant group Hamas&#x27; attacks on Israel on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on the group. 
Now, that conflict is spilling over into the neighboring countries of Lebanon and Syria as Israel ramps up airstrikes on the two Arab states. 
The US has sent more military assets to the region to bolster Israel&#x27;s forces following what US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called &quot;recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces.&quot;

Hamas fighters and Israeli forces engaged in limited clashes inside Gaza on Sunday as the Israeli military ramped up airstrikes on the Palestinian enclave ahead of what its spokesperson described as the “next stage” of its war on the militant group. 
Hamas claimed its fighters had destroyed two Israeli military bulldozers and a tank in an ambush near the Gazan city of Khan Younis, forcing Israeli troops to retreat without their vehicles. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed its forces had been operating inside Gaza during the incident, and said an IDF tank struck militants who had fired on its troops.

I haven’t seen such relentless interrogation of Palestinian leadership before, esp. in Arabic. 
On Saudi Arabia’s main TV channel, Hamas leader is clearly startled by the intensity of the questions &amp; responses to his answers. 
Crucial points in next tweets: 
One of the most significant ones to Hamas leader by the Saudi TV interviewer is why Hamas expects Arab countries to back them up when Hamas hadn’t consulted them before carrying out an operation akin to declaration of war.

WASHINGTON — As the U.S. Defense Department prepares to release its annual China Military Power report (CMPR), officials said the Chinese military has been engaged in &quot;a centralized and concerted campaign&quot; to perform risky behaviors in the Indo-Pacific region to &quot;coerce a change&quot; in operational activities by the U.S. and its allies. 
Meanwhile, Washington has renewed its call for military-to-military communication with China to prevent inadvertent conflicts. Senior defense officials from the two countries are expected to join their counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for meetings in mid-November in Jakarta, Indonesia.

China and the Philippines on Sunday accused each other of causing collisions in a disputed area of the South China Sea, the latest in a string of maritime confrontations between the two countries that have heightened regional tensions. 
In a statement, Philippine authorities said a Chinese Coast Guard ship carried out “dangerous blocking maneuvers” that caused it to collide with a Philippine vessel carrying supplies to troops stationed in Ayungin Shoal, also known as Second Thomas Shoal, in the Spratly Islands chain. 
China’s move was “provocative, irresponsible and illegal” and “imperiled the safety of the crew” of the Philippine boats, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said.

Former governor of New Jersey, and confidante of Donald Trump, Chris Christie filed the official paperwork for his presidential run on June 6, just one day after Trump&#x27;s vice president Mike Pence, data from the Federal Election Commission shows. 


Even later-comers to the 2024 field are North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, well-known professor and activist Cornel West (running as an Independent) and, on the Democratic side, host of the talk show The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, who was born in Turkey and would have to challenge the requirement that the president has to be a natural-born citizen.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Bidenomics Rejected: Trump Ahead In Swing States, Leads Among Young Voters 

Less than 13 months from the 2024 election, a new set of polls has delivered alarming news for backers of incumbent President Joe Biden, with voters in swing states and even younger voters giving the edge to former President Donald Trump. The key driver: voter rejection of Bidenomics. 


According to a Morning Consult/Bloomberg poll, Trump is up four points among voters in seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On a state-by-state breakdown, Trump has the upper hand in five of them. He&#x27;s tied with Biden in Michigan, while Biden leads in Nevada by 3.

                              <span>Gallup: Media Confidence in U.S. Matches 2016 Record Low 

* 32% have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in media’s news reporting 


* New high of 39% have no confidence at all, compared with 27% in 2016 


* Democrats’ trust is down 12 points since last year; lowest since 2016 


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The 32% of Americans who say they trust the mass media “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to report the news in a full, fair and accurate way ties Gallup’s lowest historical reading, previously recorded in 2016. Although trust in media currently matches the historical low, it was statistically similar in 2021 (36%) and 2022 (34%). 


Another 29% of U.S. adults have “not very much” trust, while a record-high 39% register “none at all.” This nearly four in 10 Americans who completely lack confidence in the media is the highest on record by one percentage point. It is 12 points higher than the 2016 reading, which came amid sharp criticism of the media from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump -- making the current assessment of the media the grimmest in Gallup’s history. In 2016, U.S. adults were most likely to say they had “not very much” trust (41%).

* No consensus at the Cairo Summit on the Israel-Palestinian violence. 
* The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened Saturday, allowing the transportation of humanitarian aid. 
* Clashes between Israel and Hamas continue, with Israeli airstrikes killing 19 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian media. 
* Israel issued a warning advising its citizens against traveling to Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, and if they are in those countries to leave as soon as possible. 
A Cairo summit hosted by Egypt Saturday failed to reach an agreement on how to contain the violence between Israel and Hamas. 
Arab leaders condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza while mostly Western countries said civilians should be shielded, but with Israel and senior U.S. officials absent there was no consensus on how to resolve the conflict.

The Israeli military on Saturday stepped up warnings to Gazan residents and continued preparations for an offensive in the war-torn territory, including for ground operations, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. 
The IDF again instructed the roughly 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza to evacuate, threatening that “no matter where you are,” there will be “significant combat.” 
Residents in Gaza reported that Israeli planes rained red leaflets on neighborhoods Saturday, urging residents to evacuate. Those with cell phones also received the message digitally, according to social media reports.

The Guardian: Chinese ship is focus of investigation into damaged pipeline, Finland says

 
Police focusing on Newnew Polar Bear cargo ship that was in the area when gas pipeline was damaged 
Finnish police have said a Chinese ship whose movement coincided with the time and place of the suspected sabotage of a pipeline between Finland and Estonia that was damaged this month is now the focus of their investigation. 
After a leak led to the shutdown of the Balticconnector pipeline on 8 October, Finnish authorities have been investigating the damage they say was caused by “external” activity. 
On Friday, they said their focus was on the Newnew Polar Bear, a cargo ship that reportedly came under Chinese ownership this year. Between 2017 and 2022 it was known as the Baltic Fulmar, the Finnish broadcaster YLE reported.

And he laid out a dark vision of what would happen should that aid, along with America’s larger commitment to defending democracy, not be delivered.

Argentina votes on Sunday in one of the most open presidential elections for decades. 
The effects of a deep economic crisis have proved fertile ground for an unorthodox far-right front-runner, with wild hair, big sideburns and a totally radical approach to ruling the country. 
Javier Milei was, until recently, a relative unknown. An economist, pundit and rock fan, he came top in recent primaries and polls now put him ahead in Sunday&#x27;s first round.
He is very clear about wanting to shake things up. At one campaign event, he wielded a chainsaw to send a message that he intends to slash spending to improve Argentina&#x27;s economy.

China has developed an arsenal of more than 500 operational nuclear warheads and is set to double that number by the end of the decade, exceeding previous Pentagon estimates, according to a Defense Department report. 
The figures, released in an unclassified public report to Congress on Thursday, are part of a broad assessment of China’s military goals and developments in the past year, and highlight the rapid advances in Beijing’s multi-decade plan to build a nuclear weapons arsenal that rivals that of the United States.

“Clearly, there will be discussion on how to progress that along with other matters that are relevant to the relations,” Mr Husic told Sky News Australia.

                              <span>The United Nations is planning to send a second convoy of trucks into Gaza, hoping to scale up relief deliveries in the coming week. The first convoy of 20 trucks arrived on Saturday, but further deliveries have been delayed due to Israeli demands for aid verification. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths stated that negotiations are underway for another convoy of 20 to 30 trucks. The UN emphasizes the importance of continuous aid to meet essential needs in Gaza, where Israel has imposed a total siege.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
