“Personalities matter in diplomacy and she was Britain’s number one sort of chief diplomat for so long.

 Bloomberg: Turkey Seeks to Be First NATO Member to Join China-Led SCO 
(Bloomberg) -- Turkey is seeking membership to the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attempts to forge alliances with friendly countries in the East. 
Erdogan made the announcement after attending the SCO summit in Uzbekistan on Friday where he held talks with leaders including China’s President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
A successful bid would make Turkey the first member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to join the bloc. 
 “Our relationship with these countries will be moved to a much different position with this step,” Erdogan said about the SCO when he spoke with reporters in the city of Samarkand where the summit was held, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.

                              <span>The Guardian: ‘They have no fear and no mercy’: gang rule engulfs Haitian capital  
Violence has spread from the poorest slums to the city centre as up to 200 gangs carve up Port-au-Prince 
Jean Michel thought his neighbourhood in the north of Port-au-Prince, far from the capital’s infamous slums, would shield his family from the violence engulfing the Haitian capital. 
But in May young men started coming into town on motorcycles, armed with assault rifles. By June, they were seizing control of the area. And in July the bandits had become the de facto authority, snatching up children to join their ranks and raping any women who took their fancy.

                              <span>CNN: Hungary can ‘no longer be considered a full democracy,’ says EU Parliament 
Hungary can “no longer be considered a full democracy,” the European Parliament said in a statement following its adoption of a report on Thursday. 
The Parliament said the situation has “deteriorated such that Hungary has become an ‘electoral autocracy.’” 
“Overall, [The European Parliament] expresses regrets that the lack of decisive EU action has contributed to a breakdown of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary, and turning one of its member states into hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,” the report read. 
“There is increasing consensus among experts that Hungary is no longer a democracy,” the report added.

                              <span>Reuters: Bank holdups snowball in Lebanon as depositors demand their own money 
Beirut, Lebanon — Three Lebanese banks were held up by depositors seeking access to their own money frozen in the banking system on Friday, adding to a spate of holdups this week spurred by frustration over a spiraling financial implosion with no end in sight. 
A man with a gun that turned out to be a toy was arrested after holding up a Lebanese bank in the southern city of Ghazieh, a security source said. 
Also on Friday morning, an armed man entered a branch of BLOM bank in the Lebanese capital&#x27;s Tariq al-Jdideh neighborhood seeking his deposit, the bank told Reuters in a statement, adding that the situation was under control.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is gravely ill after undergoing surgery last week for a bowel obstruction and has canceled all public meetings, being too weak to even sit up, The New York Times reported on Friday. 
Khamenei’s health deteriorated early last week when he began experiencing severe stomach pains, the report said, citing four people familiar with the matter. 
The supreme leader had surgery at a makeshift clinic set up in his home, and his office canceled all public appearances for the rest of the week.

                              <span>BBC: World Bank: Global rate hikes could trigger 2023 recession 
Interest rate hikes by central banks around the world could trigger a global recession in 2023, the World Bank has said. 
Central banks have raised rates &quot;with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades&quot; to tackle soaring prices, it said. 
 Raising rates makes borrowing more expensive to try to bring down the pace of price rises. 
But it also makes loans more costly, which can slow economic growth. 
The warning from the World Bank comes ahead of monetary policy meetings by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which are expected to increase key interest rates next week.

                              <span>Great Britain has not buried a monarch since the death of King George VI in 1952. So, royal watchers anticipate Monday&#x27;s funeral for Queen Elizabeth II will be a blend of grand spectacle and personal grief not seen in generations. Correspondent Seth Doane talks with former BBC anchor Jon Sopel and professor Pauline Maclaren about what to expect from Monday&#x27;s service at Westminster Abbey, which has been decades in the planning. (Watch the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II live on CBS Monday, September 19 beginning at 5:30 a.m. ET, or online at cbsnews.com, and on the CBS News mobile app. You may also stream live via Paramount+.)</span>

“We have people from such a broad range, every state and territory being represented here – people from Indigenous backgrounds, people from different backgrounds that reflects our multicultural nation,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Australia in an exclusive interview ahead of his meeting with King Charles III. 

“I’m very proud to have had the opportunity to be here, and it does say something about the late sovereign, Her Majesty, that … this planning was put in place a long while ago,&quot; he said.

“Her Majesty had input into the service that will take place on Monday, including the nature of the representation and that’s why we have followed the protocol to the letter, including the invite to ten Australians who’d made a contribution to their community.”</span>

                              <span>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says Queen Elizabeth II developed a relationship with Australia “that was so important”.

“Her first visit was almost two months long and she visited dozens of cities and towns right around our vast continent, it was the first of her 16 visits,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Australia in an exclusive interview ahead of his meeting with King Charles III. 

“And during that period she met, of course, prominent Australians, but she also met everyday Australians.”

Mr Albanese said this was part of a six-month world tour around the Commonwealth.

“During that period, Queen Elizabeth was a regular visitor to our shores and she engaged with some 16 prime ministers, 16 governors-general, so this was a period of massive change in which the Queen was a constant reassuring presence.”</span>

“It is part of a series of meetings the British PM is having with world leaders as they come to attend the Queen&#x27;s funeral, including with the US President Joe Biden,” Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says. 

“Given the timing of the meetings, we have been told these are unlike other traditional bilats and there will be no official readout.”</span>

“One has to question, do they need that many people there, given that this is a network that has been pushing the republic with gusto for so long.”</span>

Videos posted on social media showed protesters shouting anti-government slogans after gathering in Saqez, hometown of Mahsa Amini, from nearby cities in Iran&#x27;s Kurdistan province as they mourned the 22-year-old who died in a hospital in the capital Tehran on Friday.
&quot;Death to the dictator&quot; - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, chanted the crowd, while some women took off their headscarves. Police were seen firing tear gas and one man was shown on a video with an injury to the head that someone could be heard saying was caused by birdshot. R…</span>

                              <span>BELGRADE (Reuters) - Police clashed with right-wing protesters on Saturday as several thousand people joined an LGBTQ march in Serbia to mark the end of EuroPride week, an event staged in a different European city each year.
Police clashed with two right-wing groups trying to disrupt the march, Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said, adding that 10 police officers were slightly injured, five police cars damaged and 64 protesters arrested.
&quot;I am very proud that we managed to avoid more serious incidents,&quot; Brnabic, who herself is Serbia&#x27;s first gay prime minister, told reporters.
Following protests by nationalists and religious groups, the government had banned the march last week. But faced with calls by European Union officials and human rights activists, it allowed a shortened route for the march.
Those participating walked several hundred metres to the Tsmajdan stadium where a concert took place.
The United States&#x27; ambassador to Serbia, Christopher Hill, and the European parliament&#x27;s special rapporteur for Serbia, Vladimir Bilcik, joined the march.
Previous Serbian governments have banned Pride parades, drawing criticism from human rights groups and others. Some Pride marches in the early 2000s met with fierce opposition and were marred by violence.
But recent Pride marches in Serbia have passed off peacefully, a change cited by EuroPride organisers as one reason Belgrade was chosen as this year&#x27;s host. Copenhagen was the host in 2021.
Serbia is a candidate to join the EU, but it must first meet demands to improve the rule of law and its record on human and minority rights.

                              <span>Oktoberfest, Germany&#x27;s famed beer festival which draws millions of visitors from around the world, opened Saturday in Munich after a two-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In its 200-year history, the world&#x27;s biggest folk festival has been cancelled just 26 times, mostly due to World Wars I and II but also twice due to cholera outbreaks.
The last time the festival was held in 2019, the 6.3 million guests drank more than 7.3 million liters of German beer.
Munich mayor Didier Reiter kicked off the ceremony by opening a beer keg with a hammer blow and offering the first tankard to the head of the regional government Markus Soeder.
The festival will run until October 3 with no restrictions and no face masks will be necessary.
Oktoberfest generates about 1.2 billion euros in income. Beer occupies cult status in Germany and especially in Bavaria, where Munich is located.
Germans are among Europe&#x27;s heaviest beer drinkers with an annual average consumption of 84 liters in 2021.
On Friday, the German Brewers&#x27; Federation DBB told the government of the numerous challenges it was facing due to the war in Ukraine, including skyrocketing energy prices and disruptions in the supply chain.
&quot;The government must react... Without speedy state intervention and aid, hundreds of enterprises in the German beverages sector will disappear and thousands will become jobless.&quot;

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s weather agency on Saturday warned of a &quot;very dangerous&quot; typhoon heading towards the country&#x27;s southern Kyushu island, urging residents to evacuate before powerful wind hits the area.
Typhoon Nanmadol was carrying gusts up to 270 kilometers on Saturday near the remote Minami Daito island, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Okinawa island, the weather agency said.
The storm is expected to approach or make landfall on Sunday in the southern Kagoshima prefecture in Kyushu, then move north the following day before heading towards the main Japanese island.
&quot;There are risks of unprecedented storms, high waves, storm surges, and record rainfall,&quot; Ryuta Kurora, the head of the Japan Meteorological Agency&#x27;s forecast unit, told reporters.
&quot;Maximum caution is required,&quot; he said, urging residents to evacuate early.
&quot;It&#x27;s a very dangerous typhoon.&quot;
Kurora said the weather agency was likely to issue the highest alert for Kagoshima later in the evening.
&quot;The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse,&quot; he said, also warning of flooding and landslides.
Japan is currently in typhoon season and is hit by around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.
Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.

                              <span>The British government urged people on Saturday not to travel to join the queue to file past the coffin of Queen Elizabeth as the huge demand means people are having to stand in line for at least 24 hours to reach her lying-in-state.
Tens of thousands of people have already filed past the coffin in a steady, solemn stream, queuing for hours through the dark and cold to pay their respects to Britain&#x27;s longest-reigning monarch - a testimony to the affection in which she was held.
On Saturday the culture department said it would pause entry to the queue if demand became too high, adding at 1 a.m. (0000 GMT): &quot;Please do not travel.&quot;
The death of the queen on Sept. 8 at her summer estate in the Scottish highlands has sparked an outpouring of emotion across the country and 10 days of highly chor…</span>

Officials say the project is the world&#x27;s first intercontinental relocation of cheetahs, the planet&#x27;s fastest land animal.
The five females and three males were moved from a game park in Namibia aboard a chartered Boeing 747 dubbed &quot;Cat plane&quot; for an 11-hour flight.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over the release at Kuno National Park, a wildlife sanctuary 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of New Delhi selected for its abundant prey and grasslands.

Lee spoke to AFP just days after making history as the first foreign-language performer to win the Emmy for best actor in a drama with &quot;Squid Game&quot; -- the most-watched Netflix show of all time.
&quot;As a piece of work that is not in English that we&#x27;re able to bring to the global audience, we&#x27;re very happy about that,&quot; said Lee.

Speaking to reporters after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Uzbekistan, Putin blamed what he called &quot;the green agenda&quot; for the energy crisis, and insisted that Russia would fulfil its energy obligations. &quot;The bottom line is, if you have an urge, if it&#x27;s so hard for you, just lift the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, which is 55 ...</span>

                              <span>This rare Wisconsin home has never changed hands – until now. 
A pastoral Mount Pleasant mansion built by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1954 has gone up for sale for the first time – and its broker has been inundated with calls. 
“I don’t expect it to last into the weekend,” said Re/Max Newport Elite’s Anthony Veranth Crain’s company in Chicago of the low-slung property, which hit the market on Saturday.  By Tuesday, he said, he had already scheduled a dozen screenings. 
The six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is asking $725,000 for the “rare opportunity to own a work by America’s most prominent architect.”  Buyers should expect to pay a bit above the list price, as Veranth warns that the home, while well-maintained over the years, needs roof repairs, among other updates.  Including those in the payment puts the figure between $900,000 and $1 million, he told Crain’s. 
Built by Wright for the family behind consumer chemicals company Johnson Wax, the 3-acre property is currently owned by a trust linked to the great-granddaughter of company founder Samuel Curtis Johnson.  This great-granddaughter, Karen Johnson Boyd, commissioned the house from Wright and lived there until her death in 2016. Her widower, Bill Boyd, died in 2020. 
Members of the Johnson family were big fans of Wright and commissioned him at least two other properties: their headquarters and a vacation home. 
The main house is 4,978 square feet and sits on a ravine bluff overlooking Wisconsin’s Root River.  It is located approximately 77 miles north of downtown Chicago. 
“The dramatic and expansive Great Hall cantilevered over the ravine, emphasizing the continuity between indoors and outdoors”, claims the list of the complex, “blending with nature and maximizing the views”.  All but one of the six bedrooms have an en-suite bathroom and a balcony overlooks the main living space.

Dozens have been killed on both sides in border clashes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan that involved heavy artillery along disputed areas and a reported drone attack on a village in Tajikistan. 
The reports about heavy casualties came after the leaders of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan early on September 16 said they had agreed to a cease-fire and ordered their troops to withdraw as reports of clashes raised security concerns in Central Asia. 
The Kyrgyz Health Ministry said 24 people were killed and 87 wounded in the clashes. It said early on September 17 that five injured children were among the wounded and they have been sent to Bishkek for treatment.

Why Chile’s attempt to rewrite its constitution failed, and what US reformers can learn from it.
 On September 4, 13 million Chileans went to the polls not to elect political leaders and government officials, but to decide through a national referendum whether they would adopt a new proposed constitution.

                              <span>King Charles III has held a final vigil for his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.  

The siblings stood at all four corners of the coffin for 15 minutes while members of the public filed past. 

The Queen’s children stood silently as the public gathered to pay their respects. 

The tradition is known as the ‘Vigil of the Princes’, and Princess Anne is the first woman to stand guard. 

Prince Andrew wore his military uniform after being given an exemption from the ban to wear it at the final vigil as a “special mark of respect”.</span>

WNU Editor: Since the start of the war I have been reading and watching continuous news reports that that sanctions are going to wreck the Russian economy. And now we have the above CNN report quoting US officials admitting that sanctions are not wrecking the Russian economy, but they are confident that it will in 2023. 
In the meantime the European economy is in a recession. The U.S. is technically in a recession. Inflation is very real, and there are now growing fears that the energy crisis in Europe is going to cause widespread unrest this winter. From my vantage point it looks like sanctions are hurting the West, not Russia. 
And as for the push by many in Washington to up the sanctions by designating Russia as a state sponsor of terror. Russian President Putin has made it very clear that such an announcement by the U.S. will be seen by the Kremlin as a declaration of war against Russia by Washington.</span>

The government has placed the Russian oil giant&#x27;s three refineries in Germany under trusteeship as it seeks to manage the impact of the energy crisis. 
The German government has taken the German subsidiary of Russian oil giant Rosneft under state control, putting it into the trusteeship of the Federal Network Agency regulator.
Rosneft Deutschland accounts for about 12% of Germany&#x27;s oil processing capacity and is one of the largest oil processing companies in the country, the Economy Ministry said in a statement.

WNU editor: European governments are telling its citizens to not worry this winter. That the EU will make sure that homes and businesses are heated, electricity is supplied, and the costs will be manageable. 
But in the real world we see governments like Germany seizing energy assets without compensation, getting ready for rationing, and preparing for unrest.

AFP: Xi, Putin look to challenge world order at regional summit 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping looked to rally Asian leaders behind a new &quot;international order&quot; as they met Friday for a summit aimed at challenging Western influence. 
But cracks in summit solidarity quickly appeared, with India&#x27;s prime minister telling Putin it was &quot;not the time&quot; for the conflict in Ukraine and the forces of two countries -- Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -- engaged in fierce border clashes while their leaders were in attendance. 
The meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in ex-Soviet Uzbekistan brought Putin and Xi together with the leaders of SCO members India, Pakistan, and four Central Asian nations, as well as the presidents of Iran and Turkey. 
Putin and Xi met on Thursday for their first face-to-face talks since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February, and on the Chinese leader&#x27;s first trip abroad since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pepe Escobar, The Saker: The Kharkov game-changer 
Wars are not won by psyops. Ask Nazi Germany. Still, it’s been a howler to watch NATOstan media on Kharkov, gloating in unison about “the hammer blow that knocks out Putin”, “the Russians are in trouble”, and assorted inanities. 
Facts: Russian forces withdrew from the territory of Kharkov to the left bank of the Oskol river, where they are now entrenched. A Kharkov-Donetsk-Luhansk line seems to be stable. Krasny Liman is threatened, besieged by superior Ukrainian forces, but not lethally. 
No one – not even Maria Zakharova, the contemporary female equivalent of Hermes, the messenger of the Gods – knows what the Russian General Staff (RGS) plans, in this case and all others. If they say they do, they are lying.

WNU Editor: I personally believe that the Russian military retreat from Kharkiv was a major setback for Russia. It showed how over-extended the Russian military is with the current force deployment in Ukraine, and it put into question President Putin&#x27;s strategy on how to fight this war from even his most loyal supporters. 
Having said that .... others disagree. 
In the above post Pepe Escobar makes the case that the Western media&#x27;s attention on this front of the war is ignoring the bigger picture which is the enormous loss of men and material on the Ukrainian side, and Russia&#x27;s continued advances in the Donbas where much of Ukraine&#x27;s and Russia&#x27;s top military forces are now fighting. 
Needless to say. The above post is a must read.</span>

Disconnection Event © Gerald Rhemann 

Tivoli Southern Sky Guest Farm, Khomas, Namibia, 25 December 2021

Comet Leonard was discovered by G.J. Leonard on 3 January 2021. It made its closest pass on 12 December 2021 and, having left the Solar System, won’t be seen from Earth again. On 25 December 2021, a dramatic tail disconnection event happened. A piece of Comet Leonard’s tail was pinched off and carried away by the solar wind. 

“Astronomy, myth and art come together beautifully in this shot. It holds great value to scientists, as it elegantly captures a disconnection event. Yet this photograph, which was taken on Christmas Day, seems to tell an otherworldly story too – it could be the Star of Bethlehem, an angel or a fairy soaring through the night sky.” – Imad Ahmed

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea on Friday denounced North Korea&#x27;s first-use nuclear doctrine announced this month as &quot;escalatory and destabilizing&quot; and Washington vowed to continue to deploy and exercise strategic assets to deter and respond to Pyongyang.
The countries issued a joint statement after a meeting of the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) at vice ministerial level in Washington, the first convening of the body since 2018.
The statement said the countries &quot;expressed their serious concern over the DPRK&#x27;s escalatory and destabilizing messaging related to nuclear weapons use, including its adoption of the new nuclear policy law&quot; and &quot;committed to continue efforts to employ all elements of both countries&#x27; national power to strengthen the Alliance deterrence posture.&quot;
&quot;The United States committed to strengthen coordination with the ROK to continue to deploy and exercise strategic assets in the region in a timely and effective manner to deter and respond to the DPRK and enhance regional security,&quot; the statement said, referring to South Korea and North Korea by the initials of their official names.
Last week, North Korea officially enshrined the right to use preemptive nuclear strikes to protect itself in a new law that leader Kim Jong Un said makes its nuclear status &quot;irreversible&quot; and bars denuclearization talks.

                              <span>Sixty-two million years ago, a mother gave birth to a baby. Overcoming the shock of birth in a matter of minutes, the baby began to explore the world around it. The baby started to suckle from its mother, a natural instinct shared by all animals of its kind, the mammals.

Each day it grew, and after a month or two, it began feeding for itself on a diet of shoots and leaves. It would have become independent shortly after, but tragedy struck. After only two-and-a-half months, it died. 
But this baby’s story doesn’t end there. Because 62 million years later, its distant cousins (humans) would discover its skeleton, fossilised in the harsh desert of New Mexico, in the south west of the US. 
It’s classified as a species of early mammal, a bear-like animal called Pantolambda bathmodon. The group…</span>

                              <span>TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia&#x27;s president on Friday decreed a law imposing prison terms for spreading false information or rumours online, a move immediately denounced by the main journalists&#x27; union as an assault on freedom of speech.
President Kais Saied had said he would uphold the rights and freedoms won by Tunisians in a 2011 revolution that brought democracy after his moves last summer to seize most powers and shut down the elected parliament.
His new law on Friday, issued as a presidential decree, provided for prison terms of five years for spreading false news, false information or rumours with the aim of attacking others, harming public security or generating terror.
If the target of the false information or rumours is an official, the prison term can be 10 years, his new law said.
&quot;The decree is a new setback for rights and freedoms. The penalties for publishing in any networks are a strong blow to the revolutionary values that granted freedom to all journalists and all Tunisians,&quot; said Mahdi Jlassi, the journalists&#x27; union head.
Jlassi added that the new law was reminiscent of those used by the late autocratic president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to crack down on dissenting opponents.
Since Tunisia&#x27;s 2011 revolution, its media has become one of the most open of any Arab state, with even the state-owned news agency frequently reporting criticism of the authorities.
Activists on social media sites criticised Saied&#x27;s decree, describing it as an effort to destroy those hard-won freedoms. Others mocked it, saying they would only publish sports news or art on their social media accounts.
Saied&#x27;s critics accuse him of having launched a coup last summer when he seized executive authority, moving to one-man rule with a series of decrees that he enshrined in a constitution passed by a referendum in July.
Saied has denied acting unlawfully and says his actions were needed to save Tunisia from years of stagnation and political paralysis.

LONDON (Reuters) - London&#x27;s police force said the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth will be the biggest security operation it has ever undertaken as prime ministers, presidents and royals come together on Monday to pay their respects to Britain&#x27;s longest-reigning monarch.
The queen&#x27;s funeral is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people to London&#x27;s streets, echoing other important events in Britain&#x27;s history, including her coronation in 1953, the funeral of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965 and the death of Princess Diana in 1997.
Stuart Cundy, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner, said the force was preparing for events ranging from terrorism threats to protests and crowd crushes.

LONDON (Reuters) -The entry to an already miles-long queue to see Queen Elizabeth lying in state in London resumed after a pause on Friday, with the government saying the current wait-time is over 24 hours, in temperatures set to plummet to 7 degrees celsius (45°F).
Elizabeth died in Scotland aged 96 last week, prompting an outpouring of emotion https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/king-charles-siblings-hold-vigil-by-late-queens-coffin-2022-09-15/ that drew tens of thousands out to see her coffin on its journey to London, and that has now led many more to join the long line to pay their final respects during a four-day lying-in-state ceremony.

                              <span>A young Iranian woman, who was in a coma after being arrested by the Islamic republic&#x27;s morality police, died on Friday, state media reported.
&quot;Unfortunately, she died and her body was transferred to the medical examiner&#x27;s office,&quot; state television reported.
Mahsa Amini, 22, was on a visit to Tehran with her family when she was detained by the specialist police unit that enforces the strict dress code obligatory for women since shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979.
In a statement Thursday, Tehran police confirmed Amini had been detained with other women for &quot;instruction&quot; about the rules.
&quot;She suddenly suffered a heart problem while in the company of others receiving guidance (and) was immediately taken to hospital with the cooperation of the emergency services,&quot; it said.
Earlier, President Ebrahim Raisi ordered the interior minister to open an inquiry into the case.
Several lawmakers said they would raise the case in parliament while the judiciary said it would form a special task force to investigate.
Amini&#x27;s death comes amid growing controversy both inside and outside Iran over the conduct of the morality police, known formally as the Gasht-e Ershad (Guidance Patrol).
In July, a video of a woman standing in front of one of the force&#x27;s vans pleading for her daughter&#x27;s release went viral on social media.
The veiled woman kept holding on to the van as it pulled off, only being thrown clear after it gathered speed.
The mandatory dress code, which applies to all nationalities and religions, not just Iranian Muslims, requires women to conceal their hair and neck with a headscarf.
Over the decades, women have increasingly pushed back, particularly in the big cities, wearing their headscarves far back on their head to reveal their hair.</span>

After the start of Moscow&#x27;s invasion on February 24, signals have emerged that many Russian soldiers have no clear idea of the war&#x27;s goals with some initially thinking they were simply being mustered for maneuvres.
&quot;The Russian army is an army of lies,&quot; General Thierry Burkhard, chief of the French armed forces, told AFP as early as May.
&quot;People lied by saying that the Ukrainian army wouldn&#x27;t fight, that Russia&#x27;s forces were ready for war, that their leaders knew how to command,&quot; he said.
Six months into the invasion, Western analysts still describe the Russian army as riddled with falsehoods and corrup…</span>

While organic matter has been found on the Red Planet before, the new discovery is seen as especially promising because it came from an area where sediment and salts were deposited into a lake -- conditions where life could have arisen.
&quot;It is very fair to say that these are going to be, these already are, the most valuable rock samples that have ever been collected,&quot; David Shuster, a Perseverance return sample scientist, told reporters during a briefing.

France&#x27;s DGAC civil aviation authority said 16 airports were operating a skeleton service, as were traffic control centers guiding planes overflying French territory at high altitude.
But several regional airports were closed and the DGAC warned of &quot;cancellations and significant delays across the country&quot;.
At Paris&#x27; enormous Charles de Gaulle hub, only a few cancellations were listed on departures boards among morning flights mostly going ahead, and staff in high-visibility vests were directing passengers.

                              <span>Hundreds of foreign royals and leaders are expected to attend the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London on Monday in one of the biggest diplomatic gatherings in decades.
Westminster Abbey has space for around 2,000 people, so only heads of state and one or two guests have reportedly been invited to Britain&#x27;s first state funeral for six decades.
A handful of countries have meanwhile not been invited to the funeral due to political considerations -- sparking a furious outburst in at least one case.
Here are some of the key guests, and some who did not make the list:

                              <span>At least eight people have been killed by torrential overnight rains and floods in the central Italian region of Marche, authorities said on Friday, as rescuers continued to search for four people missing. 
Around 400 millimeters of rain fell within two to three hours, inundating the streets of several towns around the region&#x27;s capital Ancona on the Adriatic coast.
&quot;It was like an earthquake,&quot; Ludovico Caverni, the mayor of the town of Serra Sant&#x27;Abbondio, told RAI state radio.
Footage released by fire brigades showed rescuers on rafts trying to evacuate people in the seaside town of Senigallia, while others attempted to clear an underpass of debris.
Stefano Aguzzi, head of civil protection at Marche&#x27;s regional government, said the downpour was far stronger than had been forecast.
&quot;We were given a normal alert for rain, but nobody had expected anything like this,&quot; he told reporters. The head of the national civil protection agency Fabrizio Curcio was heading to Ancona to assess the damage, while party chiefs campaigning for Italy&#x27;s September 25 election expressed their solidarity.
Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party said it would suspend campaigning in Marche &quot;in a sign of mourning&quot; and in order to allow its local activists to fully participate in efforts to help the flood-hit communities.

                              <span>Ukraine’s breakthrough counterattack, explained.
 In the spring and summer of 2022, the war between Ukraine and Russia settled into a stalemate. The first phase of the war had been a rapid invasion that drew new battle lines across Ukraine; the next phase saw those battle lines harden and change very little over a long period of fighting. But in September, that chapter came to an end. For the first time in several months, Ukraine scored a major victory and won back significant territory from Russia.
Ukraine pulled off this victory by taking advantage of a surprising weakness in the Russian army: the difficulty it has had maintaining its ranks of skilled soldiers, especially compared to the training and resources Ukraine’s army has received from its allies. Reports suggest that Russia’s army has suffered catastrophic losses in the war and that it has attempted to replace those more highly trained forces with large numbers of mercenaries, prisoners, and men over 40. It’s an army that was stretched thin and vulnerable to the multi-pronged attack Ukraine launched in September.



Russia still controls a large amount of territory in southern Ukraine, including two major cities. But Ukraine’s victory outside of Kharkiv signals a new chapter in the war — one where, remarkably, Ukraine seems to have a shot at driving out the Russians completely.

Some 22 individuals and two entities were added to the Treasury&#x27;s blacklist, including justice officials in occupied Crimea and members of Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Kadyrov&#x27;s family.
In a parallel move, the Treasury and US Commerce Department banned the export of quantum computing services, hardware and software to Russia and Belarus in a move the Treasury said would degrade Moscow&#x27;s ability to rebuild its military after heavy losses in the continuing war with Ukraine.

                              <span>A young Iranian woman is in a coma and fighting for her life after being arrested in Tehran by the Islamic republic&#x27;s morality police, campaigners said Thursday.
The woman, named as Mahsa Amini, 22, was on a visit to the Iranian capital with her family when she was detained by the special police unit that enforces the strict dress rules for women, including the compulsory headscarf.
Her brother Kiaresh told the Iran Wire news website that while he was waiting outside the police station for her to be released an ambulance drove out taking her to hospital.
He was told that she had had a heart attack and a brain seizure and was now in a coma.
&quot;There were only two hours between her arrest and being taken to hospital,&quot; he said.

Rockets bombing skyscrapers, rolling tanks, soldiers shooting soldiers, children squatting with fearful faces in air-raid shelters and in front of destroyed houses: The scenes depicted in the drawings of the travelling exhibition now on display in a German state parliament are a lot to take in.
They were drawn by children living through Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, which began more than half a year ago.
One is signed &quot;I want peace.&quot;
The drawings are on display along with numerous historical paintings by Polish children from 1946 who portrayed their c…</span>
