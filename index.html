One police officer is reported to have died in the incident.

The shootout marks the gravest escalations of violence in Kosovo in years.

The capital of Serbia, Belgrade has yet to comment on the involvement.</span>

The capsule, carrying the celestial specimen, parachuted into the Utah desert after a six-year joint mission between NASA and the University of Arizona. The sample was collected from the asteroid Bennu, which is considered a &quot;near-Earth object&quot; and holds valuable insights into the origins of our solar system. The recovery team aims to keep the sample free from terrestrial contamination before distributing it to scientists worldwide.</span>

They highlighted the potential consequences of a shutdown, including unpaid military members, travel disruptions, and program closures. Despite efforts to reach a resolution, there is no indication that the GOP is moving towards a deal. Biden emphasized the importance of funding the government and called on Republicans to fulfill their responsibilities. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also warned about the impact on air traffic controllers and urged House Republicans to keep the government running.</span>

The bill, which required a human driver to be present in autonomous vehicles weighing over 10,001 pounds, was passed by a majority in both houses of the state legislature. However, Newsom stated that the bill was unnecessary given the existing regulatory framework governing autonomous technology.</span>

                              <span>The Nevada Republican Party has approved rules for their presidential caucus that many believe are designed to benefit former President Donald Trump. The rules would prevent candidates from participating in the caucus if they participate in the state-run primary two days earlier, and would also restrict super PACs from supporting candidates in the caucus. The move reflects Trump&#x27;s influence on state parties and his frontrunner status in Nevada.</span>

The president&#x27;s job approval rating is 19 points underwater. 
President Joe Biden&#x27;s job approval rating is 19 points underwater, his ratings for handling the economy and immigration are at career lows. A record number of Americans say they&#x27;ve become worse off under his presidency, three-quarters say he&#x27;s too old for another term and Donald Trump is looking better in retrospect -- all severe challenges for Biden in his reelection campaign ahead. 
Forty-four percent of Americans in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll say they&#x27;ve gotten worse off financially under Biden&#x27;s presidency, the most for any president in ABC/Post polls since 1986. Just 37% approve of his job performance, while 56% disapprove. Still fewer approve of Biden&#x27;s performance on the economy, 30%.

                              <span>Tensions between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hezbollah are at their highest level in years.

Both states believe the other is interfering with their territory.

Israel and Lebanon don’t have an agreed border but the United Nations patrols the boundary between the countries, known as the Blue Line.

The Israeli Defence Forces argue Hezbollah placing their yellow flag inside the military buffer zone and building lookout posts around 100 yards away is a violation of the agreement with the UN.

Israel is currently divided by government plans to overhaul its judicial system and one theory is Hezbollah sees this as an opportunity to test Israel.

Lebanon has also accused Israel of regularly flying through its airspace without permission to bomb Iranian targets in neighbouring Syria.</span>

                              <span>A landslide in western Sweden caused a sinkhole on a major highway to Norway, leading to several accidents and injuries. The sinkhole, measuring 500 meters wide, appeared on the E6 highway near Goteborg. Four cars and a bus skidded off the road and crashed, resulting in three people being hospitalized. The cause of the landslide is unknown, but construction activities and heavy rain in the area may have contributed. Swedish police have initiated a preliminary investigation into the incident.</span>

The mission, a collaboration between NASA and the University of Arizona, aims to bring back the largest asteroid sample ever returned to Earth. The sample was collected from the carbon-rich asteroid Bennu, which has a small chance of striking Earth in the late 22nd century. The spacecraft spent nearly two years orbiting the asteroid before successfully collecting the sample in October 2020.</span>

Indian and Chinese immigrants account for 6% each of total immigration, with the number of Indians increasing by 4.8% and Chinese immigrants increasing by nearly 3%. While Mexicans still have the highest number of immigrants, there was a slight decrease from the previous year. The increase in immigrants from Afghanistan and Venezuela was significant due to asylum seekers and refugees. Experts argue that the increase in immigrant population is relatively low and necessary to address demographic and workforce challenges.</span>

Daily Mail: Is the world running out of patience with Zelensky&#x27;s &#x27;blank cheque&#x27; demands? Poland stops giving arms and US gives a fraction of what Ukraine&#x27;s leader asked for as he visits Canada today to win support 
* Zelensky landed in the capital Ottawa late Thursday and will address parliament 
* It comes after Biden offered more weapons but refused to give ATACMS missiles 
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa today as he scrambles to rally more international support for his troops fighting Russia. 
Mr Zelensky landed in the capital late on Thursday, and will today have talks with Mr Trudeau before addressing the Canadian parliament. 
The Ukrainian leader will hope for a positive outcome after a difficult visit to Washington, where US president Joe Biden offered warm words of support and weapons - but rejected a request for longer range ATACMS missiles.

WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland&#x27;s prime minister told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday not to &quot;insult&quot; Poles, maintaining harsh rhetoric towards Kyiv after the Polish president had sought to defuse a simmering row over grain imports.
Poland decided last week to extend a ban on Ukrainian grain imports, shaking Kyiv&#x27;s relationship with a neighbour that has been seen as one of its staunchest allies since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year.

                              <span>NBC News: Biden tells Zelenskyy that U.S. will send Ukraine ATACMS long-range missiles

 
Some in Washington had resisted supplying the weapons system, known as “attack-ems,” out of fear that it would widen the war with Russia. 
President Joe Biden has told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the United States will provide a small number of long-range missiles to aid the war with Russia, three U.S. officials and a congressional official familiar with the discussions told NBC News on Friday. 
The officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, did not say when the missiles would be delivered or when a public announcement would be made. 
For months, Ukraine has asked for the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which would give Kyiv the ability to strike targets from as far away as about 180 miles, hitting supply lines, railways, and command and control locations behind the Russian front lines.

The crowd gathered in the city&#x27;s Hyde Park railed against the proposal, which if it passes on October 14, would give Indigenous peoples the right to be consulted on policies that affect them, a measure dubbed the Voice.
&quot;I&#x27;m here because I believe that everyone should be voting no. This Voice is causing so much division in the whole of Australia. And we don&#x27;t need it,&quot; Faye Bevan, who attended the rally, told AFP.
Some protesters held signs with slogans such as &quot;Vote no to the Voice of division&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t trust the Voice, I&#x27;m voting no&quot;. Others carried placards referring to a range of conspiracy ideas, such as about human …</span>

                              <span>A fire at a golf ball factory in Taiwan killed at least six people, three of them firefighters who died in an explosion, authorities said Saturday.
The fire, which began Friday evening and raged all night, injured more than 100 people, most of them workers, the Pingtung county government told local media.
One firefighter and three other people are missing.
Taiwan&#x27;s President Tsai Ing-wen visited the scene on Saturday morning and expressed condolences to the victims&#x27; families. She said an investigation into the cause of the tragedy is underway.
&quot;I want to thank everyone for their hard work and please stay safe,&quot; Tsai told emergency response personnel.
She also stopped at the morgue to pay respects to the victims and visited the injured at a hospital.
An official with the Pingtung Fire Department told local media that chemical peroxide stored inside the factory could have been the cause of the one large and several smaller explosions.
Several people were trapped inside due to the blasts, which caused a section of the factory roof to collapse.</span>

                              <span>Pope Francis on Saturday hammered home his message that European governments must do more to care for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, saying &quot;those who risk their lives at sea do not invade, they look for welcome&quot;.
Closing a meeting of bishops and young people from around the Mediterranean in French port city Marseille, he added that migration is &quot;a reality of our times, a process that involves three continents around the Mediterranean and that must be governed with wise foresight, including a European response&quot;.
The pope&#x27;s remarks -- given in front of President Emmanuel Macron, whose government plans tougher measures to control migration -- follow his insistence on arrival in France Friday that &quot;people who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued&quot;.
The way Europe addresses large numbers of arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa has shot up the political agenda since last week, when thousands of people landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa over just a few days.
The pope also appeared to weigh in on French domestic politics, targeting two of Macron&#x27;s projects in assisted dying and inscribing the right to abortion in the constitution.
Old people risk being &quot;pushed aside, under the false pretences of a supposedly dignified and &#x27;sweet&#x27; death that is more &#x27;salty&#x27; than the waters of the sea,&quot; Francis warned.
He also spoke of &quot;unborn children, rejected in the name of a false right to progress, which is instead a retreat into the selfish needs of the individual&quot;.</span>

The hawkish prime minister said that alarm over Tehran&#x27;s clerical leaders was driving Israel closer to the Arab world, with his government on the &quot;cusp&quot; of a historic breakthrough with Saudi Arabia.
Netanyahu, who has repeatedly used the UN stage to issue dark warnings about Tehran, briefly gave pause at the General Assembly when he appeared to threaten nuclear attack if Tehran pursues its own atomic bomb.
&quot;Above all -- above all -- Iran must face a credible nuclear threat. As long as I&#x27;m prime minister of Israel, I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,&quot; Netanyahu said.

                              <span>Donald Trump is taking advantage of the “weakness” in his opposing field, says UC Irvine Professor of Political Science Louis Desipio.

His comments come as the former US president campaigns for the 2024 presidential election.

“He’s not even campaigning very hard at this point which is a pretty dramatic statement,” Professor Desipio told Sky News Australia.

“There will be another Republican presidential debate coming up and that will give an opportunity for somebody to lead the pack.

“I don’t have high hopes that any of them will be able to do that much better than they did in the first presidential debate.”</span>

                              <span>The deadlock between the House Republicans is representative of the “failure” of the US government, says UC Irvine Professor of Political Science Louis Desipio.

His comments come amid fears a government shutdown is looming.

“Usually these shutdown controversies are when one party has one view and another party has another view,” Professor Desipio told Sky News Australia.

He said this time it is because a small far-right group within the Republican party are rejecting anything their leader Kevin McCarthy proposes.

“I think in the short term at least, it bodes pretty ill for the likelihood that the United States government will be open a week from Monday. “</span>

General Assembly on Friday that Israel is “at the cusp” of a historic breakthrough leading to a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia, without outlining a clear path over the significant obstacles facing such an accord.
He struck an optimistic tone throughout his roughly 25-minute address — and, once again, used a visual aid. He displayed contrasting maps showing Israel&#x27;s isolation at the time of its creation in 1948 and the six countries that have normalized relations with it, including four that did so in 2020 in the so-called Abraham Accords.
“There’s no question the Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are at the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough, an historic peace between Israel and …</span>

Keir Starmer, whose party has for months been consistently well ahead in opinion polls, has just completed a foreign tour aimed at boosting his international stature.
On his return to London, he was quizzed about remarks made several days ago, which largely went unnoticed at the time.
At a centre-left forum in Montreal, he declared that he did not want to &quot;diverge&quot; from European Union rules, sparking reaction from heavyweights in the ruling Tory party.

The Ukrainian army claimed responsibility for the strike, saying it took place at around 0900 GMT.
Ukraine has targeted Crimea throughout Russia&#x27;s offensive but attacks on military installations there have recently intensified as Kyiv vows to recapture the peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.
&quot;The headquarters of the fleet have been hit in an enemy missile attack,&quot; Mikhail Razvozhayev, the governor of Crimea&#x27;s largest city Sevastopol, said on social media.

                              <span>A lopsided majority of Brazil&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled Thursday against an effort to restrict native peoples&#x27; rights to protected reservations on their ancestral lands, in a win for Indigenous activists and climate campaigners.
Indigenous leaders in bright feather headdresses and body paint exploded in celebration outside the high court building in Brasilia as Justice Luiz Fux became the sixth on the 11-member court to side with the native plaintiffs in the landmark case, giving them victory.
The judges voted one by one and in the end, the tally was a 9-2 win for Indigenous people opposed to the restriction.

Then it went up in flames, allegedly torched by land-grabbers trying to reclaim the territory for cattle pasture.
Launched in 2019 by environmental research group Rioterra, the reforestation project took 270 hectares (665 acres) of forest that had been razed by cattle ranching on a protected nature reserve in the northern state of Rondonia and replanted it with 360,000 trees.
The idea was ambitious, says Rioterra&#x27;s project coordinator, Alexis Bastos: save a corner of the world&#x27;s biggest rainforest, fighting climate change and creating green jobs along the way.

Trump, who is said to have snarled about seeing a severely wounded veteran sing at an event held during his presidency at a military base, is now being called out on his alleged comments by Gen. Mark Milley.
Now, other conservatives are joining Milley in criticizing the former president.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Retired Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe said the incident reminds him &quot;of the time Trump mocked a reporter with a physical disability and a speech impediment.&quot;
&quot;Or when he dissed Senator McCain for having been captured in war and having endured torture,&quot; Tribe added. &quot;Who revels in such cruelty? The Man Who Would Be King, that&#x27;s who. No thank you!&quot;
Conservative attorney and anti-Trump activist George Conway answered Tribe&#x27;s question, saying, &quot;Who is such a person? A malignant narcissist—a soulless, conscienceless, and morally bereft individual relentlessly driven by pathological levels of narcissism, sociopathy, sadism, and Machiavellinism.&quot;
In a separate post, Conway wrote, &quot;There is no nice way to put it. P01135809 is pure scum,&quot; referring to Trump&#x27;s assigned booking number from his recent arrest in Georgia.
Former GOP campaign consultant Rick Wilson also said, &quot;Trump&#x27;s loathing for an injured war hero speaks more volumes about his low, repulsive character than almost any of the other stories of his public or private behavior. I&#x27;ve read damn near every account of his degenerate, foul life, and this one still shocks.&quot;
Former Trump supporter David Weissman on Thursday added, &quot;Trump continues to show his distain of American war heroes. This two time impeach and indicted a--hole is no patriot.&quot;</span>

In his memo, he stated he would officially be stepping down in November – and then used the opportunity to complain about the &quot;elites&quot; he has had to deal with by writing: &quot;Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.”

Murdoch created Fox News, which he launched in October of 1996. His massive empire also includes the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal, along with dozens of other media outlets in the U.S. and around the world.
&quot;I have decided to transition to the role of Chairman Emeritus at Fox and News,&quot; his letter, addressed to &quot;Dear Colleagues,&quot; reads. One of his sons, Lachlan Murdoch, &quot;will become sole Chairman of both companies.&quot;

                              <span>Moroccans continue digging out victims from this month’s 6.8-magnitude earthquake in the Atlas Mountains. The death toll now stands at nearly 3,000 people. Many more have been left homeless. Morocco’s government has so far only accepted aid from a handful of countries, but Moroccans overseas are stepping up. In Spain, they’re collecting supplies to send to victims, but it isn’t always easy.</span>

Scientists there are finding out why, and looking for ways to use this knowledge to help reefs in other parts of the world.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.
