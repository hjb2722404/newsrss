EU leaders gathered to discuss a last-minute compromise with Hungary to support the sanctions which would see the EU place an embargo on Russian oil.

“There is no compromise at this moment at all … there is no agreement at all,” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.</span>

                              <span>The French Government has blamed “industrial-scale” ticket fraud for the chaotic scenes at the Champions League final in Paris.

It comes after up to 40,000 British fans went to the stadium without tickets or with counterfeits.

French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the chaos of the event only came at the entrance of the Liverpool supporters. 

Liverpool FC have called for an UEFA formal investigation into the organisation of the event. 

“If we don’t respond to what happened and learn the lessons from this next time, people might not be so lucky,” Liverpool Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram said.</span>

* Al Qaeda is &quot;delighted&quot; at the Taliban&#x27;s control of Afghanistan, an expert has claimed. 
* Professor Michael Semple said the Taliban was guaranteeing Al Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;continued personal survival&quot;. 
* His analysis is supported by a UN report, suggesting the relationship &quot;remains close&quot;. 
The Taliban&#x27;s control of Afghanistan is guaranteeing the &quot;continued personal survival&quot; of Al Qaeda, an expert has claimed, with a United Nations report supporting the claims. 
A report from a UN monitoring team published Thursday says the relationship between the two groups &quot;remains close&quot;, with Al Qaeda described as being &quot;pleased with&quot; the Taliban&#x27;s takeover. 
The UN says Al Qaeda is using the takeover to increase their numbers and funding, as well as to &quot;inspire Al Qaeda affiliates globally.&quot;

Reuters: EU fails to agree Russian oil ban despite onslaught on outskirts of Sievierodonetsk 
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian and Russian forces battled on Monday on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, the last city still held by Kyiv in Ukraine&#x27;s Luhansk province and the focus of Moscow&#x27;s offensive in the country&#x27;s east. 
But even as the Russian onslaught raged, EU leaders made clear they would fail to agree on a Russian oil import ban at a summit in Brussels, prompting swift criticism from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said they were too soft on Moscow. 
Russian shelling has reduced much of Sievierodonetsk to ruins, but the Ukrainian defence has slowed the wider Russian campaign across the Donbas region.

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]     The big day is fast approaching for a 16-strong team of students taking the MBA programme at City University of Hong Kong’s College of Business.   On May 30 from 7-9pm, after close to eight months planning and preparation, they will be hosting a high-profile online event featuring senior figures connected to the world of fashion.   Fellow CityU students, along with design professionals, environmentalists and interested members of the public will be able to sign in free on various social media channels to hear invited speakers discuss the topic “From Fashion Conscious to Fashion Conscience”, focusing on what the industry must do to build a more sustainable future.   Pulling everything together has been a major organisational challenge, which was exactly the intention.     That’s because this SHARP Forum, as it’s billed, is one of a series of four, with each overseen by a different group within the MBA class. The other three are focusing on sustainable finance, green building and artificial meats. And, as the key element in a compulsory credit-bearing course, each event is specifically intended to provide practical, experiential learning by exposing the students to wide range of issues - some foreseeable, others unexpected - for which solutions must be found.       The two MCs on Monday night will be Mirjam Wong, otherwise a regional IT project manager with a leading global cosmetics company, and Adrian Chong, who since last September has been policy manager for an international accountancy association.     Understandably at this stage, both are feeling a few butterflies. But those should be calmed after the last few rehearsals and technical run-throughs and by knowing they have a strong line-up of speakers, a topical subject, and back-ups just in case of the odd glitch.   “Even when you plan as well as possible, something will go wrong on the day, especially when technology is involved,” says Wong, who also served as the research coordinator. “But you have to be ready…</span>

   Zero Hedge: Greece Alerts Its Tankers In Gulf After Iran Threatens More &#x27;Retaliation&#x27; Seizures 
The government of Greece has issued an alert warning all Greek ships currently sailing in Persian Gulf waters to adapt and remain aware of heightened threats against them following last week&#x27;s seizure of two Greek oil tankers by Iran&#x27;s military. Maritime tanker monitors suggest at least a dozen Greek tankers are currently in waters near Iran. 
The alert told vessels to immediately &quot;adapt to the unacceptable situation and reality created by the Iranian government’s tactic,&quot; according government spokesman Ioannis Oikonomou at a Monday press briefing in Athens, per Bloomberg reporting.

Pacific Island countries have agreed not to sign a region-wide trade and security deal with China after a high-level meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his counterparts from 10 Pacific nations in Fiji. 
 China was seeking a wide-ranging deal that covered free trade, police cooperation and disaster resilience.  Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said Pacific nations were united in their approach after the decision was announced on Monday afternoon.

                              <span>Reuters: Taiwan jets scramble as China air force enters air defence zone 
TAIPEI, May 30 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Monday reported the largest incursion since January by China&#x27;s air force in its air defence zone, with the island&#x27;s defence ministry saying Taiwanese fighters scrambled to warn away 30 aircraft in the latest uptick in tensions. 
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for the past two years or so of repeated missions by China&#x27;s air force near the democratically governed island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone, or ADIZ, close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. 
Taiwan calls China&#x27;s repeated nearby military activities &quot;grey zone&quot; warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan&#x27;s forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwan&#x27;s responses. 
The latest Chinese mission included 22 fighters, as well as electronic warfare, early warning and antisubmarine aircraft, the Taiwan ministry said.

Dr. Subhash Kapila, Eurasian Review: Pakistan On Brink Of Civil War As Ousted PM Khan Weaponizes ‘Street Power’ – OpEd 
 Pakistan today in May 2022 tethers on the brink of a Civil War being generated by Constitutionally ousted former PM Iman Khan whose megalomaniacal impulses prompt him to challenge both the Constitution of Pakistan and the Pakistan Army by weaponizing “Street Power” in a bid to return to power in Islamabad – and raising grave implications for Pakistan and South Asia. 
Pakistan today is witnessing a clash of narratives wherein saner voices within Pakistan are voicing alarm on the irreparable damage that can be inflicted by ousted PM Imran Khan with his ‘Disruptive Strategy’ of weaponising ‘street power’ and Pakistan’s politically immature younger generation mesmerised by Imran Khan’s flamboyance providing the huge turnouts at Imran Khan’s ‘Jalsas’ and now the Long March already in Islamabad precincts.

Denmark has joined the list of countries refusing to pay for Russian gas using a ruble conversion scheme, prompting the country’s state-run gas company on Monday to warn that Gazprom could cut off gas exports in retaliation. 
Denmark is the latest country to refuse the Kremlin’s demands for opening Western currency accounts alongside a ruble account to allow for payments for gas that are essentially made in rubles. 
Poland and Bulgaria were the first countries to refuse the scheme, resulting in a Gazprom move to cut off supplies, followed by Finland.

                              <span>Reuters: U.S. will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach Russia, says Biden 
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - The United States will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia, President Joe Biden said on Monday, as Ukraine pushes for longer-range weapons system to help in its fight.
Ukrainian officials have been asking allies for longer-range systems including the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS, that can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of miles away. 
&quot;We&#x27;re not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that strike into Russia,&quot; Biden told reporters after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware.

Politico: As Putin health rumors swirl, Lavrov denies Russian leader is seriously ill  
It’s at least the third time the Kremlin has been forced to deny rumors of the president’s ill health. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has denied that Vladimir Putin is seriously ill in the wake of numerous reports suggesting that the Russian leader has cancer. 
“You know, President Putin appears in public every day. You can see him on the screens, read his speeches, listen to his speeches,” Lavrov said, speaking to French media TF1. “I don’t think sane people can discern any sort of symptom of disease in this man.”
Lavrov’s remarks are not the first time the Russian government has been forced to deny reports about Putin’s health.

WNU Editor: There are reports that Putin successfully defeated cancer a few years back. But aside from that, for someone who is going to 70 years old this year, from what I have seen so far Putin looks physically OK.

                              <span>CNN: Colombia&#x27;s presidential vote headed for a runoff 
Bogota (CNN)Colombia&#x27;s presidential election appears destined for a runoff, after preliminary results on Sunday showed no candidate had garnered over 50% of the votes. 
With 98% of the votes counted, early results showed left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro with just over 40% of the votes, the populist former mayor of Bucaramanga Rodolfo Hernandez with 28%, and right-wing candidate Federico &quot;Fico&quot; Gutierrez with 23%. 
Petro and Hernandez are now expected to face each other during a second round of voting on June 19th.

WNU editor: My friend who follows Colombian politics very closely tells me that the second round of voting is going to be close, but the odds favour left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro to win with about 51% - 52% of the vote. My gut tells me that it is 50 - 50 right now.

Politico: Time is ticking to replace the Pentagon’s 1970s-era Doomsday planes  
Built to survive a nuclear attack, these Air Force aircraft are expected to fly well past their 50th birthday. 
ABOARD AN E-4B DOOMSDAY PLANE — Inside a military aircraft designed to survive a nuclear war, an area once used as a first class lounge now contains six blue passenger seats next to two sleeping bunks. 
Maj. Ted DeBonis, maintenance squadron commander, says it’s a break area for the 12 aircraft mechanics who accompany the plane on every hop, waiting to fix it anywhere in the world. 
It’s an unusual setup for a military aircraft. But a flying maintenance hangar is the kind of thing you need when you’re operating a plane that’s been around since the Carter administration.

Simon Tisdall, The Guardian: The Donald and the Kremlin Don: how Trump’s toxic legacy helps Putin 
From Afghanistan to North Korea, Joe Biden is running short of time to repair the damage done by his predecessor in the White House 
Even by Donald Trump’s chaotic standards, the “comprehensive peace agreement” for Afghanistan signed by the US in Doha in February 2020 was a huge own goal. 
The pact posited no binding ceasefire, no power-sharing requirements, and no political roadmap. In return for some mumbo-jumbo about al-Qaida, Trump pledged total, unconditional US and Nato withdrawal within 14 months. 
This was not peacemaking. This was capitulation. The Taliban could hardly believe their luck.

WNU Editor: This is what &quot;Trump derangement syndrome looks like in the UK&quot;. 
It is amazing to me on how utterly detached from any true sense of reality some people in the West have become even as disaster looms. That it is not President Biden&#x27;s fault, but the fault of Trump and Putin who are working together to discredit Biden&#x27;s global leadership and policies.
And while I find this type of analysis paranoid and bizarre, I am willing to bet that this Guardian opinion post written by one of its chief correspondents is shared by many in London and in Washington DC. That the disaster that we are seeing is not the fault at all of our current leaders, but the fault of others.</span>

                              <span>A European Union embargo on Russian oil would affect the country’s crude oil exports – a cornerstone of the national economy – but it may not do much damage until the restrictions take effect.
For now, analysts say, Russian oil production is proving resilient as European buyers and others seize the opportunity to buy crude at a price of around $30 a barrel against Brent crude. , the international standard.
Kpler, a company that tracks oil transportation, estimates that Russian oil production actually increased by around 200,000 barrels per day in May, to 10.2 million barrels per day, from April.  Still, that was about 800,000 barrels per day below February levels.
Kpler predicts that if the European Union reaches an agreement on the embargo, Russian production would fall by another million…</span>

He was 81 years old.
His death, in a hospital, was announced by his family on Facebook.  No cause was specified.
A dust-poor boy from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, Mr. Rice fell in love with the ocean shores of Florida while on a family vacation in the 1940s.

With five laps to go, Ericsson, a 31-year-old Swedish driver, held a nearly three-second lead over Pato O’Ward, the 23-year-old Mexican driver for Arrow McLaren SP.  But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion competing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps remaining.
In a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson veered left and right to disrupt the slipstream and repel an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.

                              <span>Ripple (XRP) has announced a $100 million investment in the carbon trading segment, CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Cointelegraph’s Joseph Hall in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting, which ended Thursday. 
Garlinghouse noted the growing profile of the cryptocurrency at the international summit, comparing his experiences over the past few years.  “As leaders around the world learn how these technologies can really benefit their constituents, benefit their economies, they are going to use them. […] I think we see that happening every day,” Garlinghouse said.
He went on to say that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are “underappreciated, despite the fact that there is obviously a lot of hype in some parts of the NFT market.”  Specifically:

“The tokenization of various assets is underestimated.” 

Garlinghouse cited the trade in carbon credits, which is often “challenged” by fraudulent activities, such as a use case for tokenization thanks to its transparency and traceability.  “It could really revolutionize carbon credit markets, the efficiency of carbon credit markets,” Garlinghouse said.  Ripple is investing $100 million in the segment, he added.

Cryptocurrency will have real-world use cases in 2022, Garlinghouse continued.  Cross-border transactions are an example that Ripple is working on.  Currently, cross-border transactions are “generally quite slow, quite expensive, and frankly very error-prone,” while the XRP blockchain has been “a very efficient and inexpensive bridge,” he said.
“I don’t think we live in a one-channel world,” Garlinghouse said.  “It’s a multi-channel world, there will be a lot of different utility use cases.”  Ripple will continue to focus on businesses, but other cryptocurrency foundations are also looking at consumer use cases, he explained.

About a quarter of women serving in the Canadian military said they had been sexually assaulted during their military career, according to a government census.  And the government has set aside nearly $800 million to settle class actions by current and former service members involving sexual misconduct.

This is how we got Covid vaccines and therapies in record time.  What’s rotten is that applications for new uses of generic drugs are reviewed to different standards than new treatments.  That’s what the FDA did this month when it rejected a Covid Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) request by physicians for the antidepressant fluvoxamine.

The media has derided some doctors as charlatans for advocating off-label drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.  Early in the pandemic, studies suggested that both antiparasitic drugs could be beneficial.  David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minne…</span>

I am appalled at MaskChoice Northampton’s continued disrespect for the health and safety of our community.  The recent guest column in the Gazette (“A Call for Optional Masking in Schools,” May 21) is another ill-informed screed against masking that could have kept our students safe had the mask mandate remained in place. square.
Scores of Northampton students, staff and families have fallen ill after the mask mandate was removed.  That’s why the warrant was returned.  You had your say and the masks were removed to the detriment of more than a hundred high school students alone.
MaskChoice Northampton is not a choice.  This reflects a common care deficit for your wider community, those who are vulnerable and those who are not.  A speech-language pathologist is not a pediatric care provider or medical professional.  Few of our city’s pediatricians or public health providers agree with your short-sighted desire to rekindle the outbreak of disease that always follows mandatory mask removal. 
I can only hope you don’t succeed in your quest to put children and families at risk, including my own student who ultimately experienced a case of COVID after being exposed by an official count more than 20 times at the high school despite wearing his mask.
I wish you and your families good health and safety at school.  The safety that is in place for the rest of us finally due to the renewal of the mask mandate in place at Northampton Public Schools.

They assumed that their investments would eventually pay off, in the form of a grandchild.  But over time, they say, the newlyweds showed little interest in producing one.
After anxiously waiting for six years, they decided to file a complaint.
They are demanding that their son and daughter-in-law have a grandchild within a year or pay $650,000 in damages.  A first hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Monday in a court in northern India.
“I feel very sorry for them because I am also an Indian and I can understand their pain,” said the couple’s lawyer, Arvind Srivastav…</span>

Ukrainian soldiers yesterday launched a counteroffensive in Kherson, the key city that Russia has used as a staging base for its operations in southern Ukraine.  Ukrainian forces attempted to delay Russian efforts to conquer and cut off a strategic swath of eastern Ukraine. Follow the latest war updates.
The announcement of the Ukrainian counter-offensive – “Wait, Kherson, we are coming!”  the military said yesterday morning on Twitter – signaled what could turn out to be a new chapter in a war that has geopolitical, economic and humanitarian significance.
In recent weeks, Russian forces, stretched and suffering heavy casualties as they gained ground in the eastern Donbass region, have focused their efforts on fortifying defensive positions in the south.  …</span>

                              <span>An explosion rocked the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol early Monday, sending plumes of smoke into the sky just outside the office of the head of the pro-Kremlin region, according to Ukrainian and Russian officials.
It was unclear who was responsible for the blast, which Ukrainian and Russian officials said appeared to target the region’s proxy leader, Yevgeny Balitsky.  If Ukrainian partisans were behind the explosion, it would be one of the most brazen acts of insurrection since Russian forces occupied the southern Ukrainian city at the start of the war.

US blocks Russian bond payments
At midnight on Wednesday, the Biden administration dropped an exemption in sweeping sanctions against Russia that had allowed the country to continue paying off foreign debts during its war with Ukraine.  The Treasury Department posted the ad a few hours before the deadline.  Russia is now racing toward a landmark it intends to avoid: a default on its foreign debt for the first time in more than a century.  Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said Tuesday the exemption was still intended to be temporary.  Still, the decision represents an escalation of US sanctions against Russia as Western countries try to increase pressure on its economy.

58.7K Ether transferred to FTX in May
On May 30, the Ether address allegedly associated with Three Arrow Capital – a Singapore-based crypto hedge fund, sent 32,000 ETH worth $60 million to the FTX crypto exchange in the space of a hour, string the data show. 
The bulk transfer, which follows the fund’s 26,700 ETH deposit on the same exchange earlier in May, raised suspicions that it would empty the Ether reserve.  This is mainly because, in theory, investors transfer crypto to their exchange wallets only when they want to sell it for other assets.

Since then, there have been only one mass shooting in Australia, and gun homicides decreased nearly 60 percent.  Correspondent Seth Doane talks with Australian politicians, and with a victim and gunowner, about the sweeping changes. (A previous version of this story was broadcast on March 13, 2016.)</span>
