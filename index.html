                              <span>China is attempting to “split the United States’ strategic focus” between Europe and Asia following recent fears China may send weapons to Russia, USSC’s Foreign Policy and Defence Research Fellow Tom Corben says.

“I think there is a portion of that rationale that’s about distracting the United States from honing its focus even more on the Asia-Pacific,” Mr Corben told Sky News Australia.

“Which is something Biden administration officials have stressed throughout this war – that the Asia-Pacific remains a high priority.

“So from a Chinese perspective, aiding Russia in a way that prolongs the war even if it doesn’t resolve it is a way of sapping US and Western attention, if not military resources.”</span>

                              <span>Reuters: U.S. stages joint air exercises with Asian allies after North Korea&#x27;s ICBM launch 
SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States held joint air exercises bilaterally with South Korea and Japan involving strategic bombers on Sunday, a day after North Korea fired a Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in a &quot;sudden launching drill&quot;.
South Korea&#x27;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the exercise, in which South Korea&#x27;s F-35A, F-15K and U.S. F-16 fighters escorted American B-1B bombers, demonstrated the allies&#x27; &quot;overwhelming&quot; defence capabilities and readiness posture. 
&quot;(The exercise) strengthened the combined operation capability and affirmed the United States&#x27; ironclad commitment to the defence of the Korean Peninsula and the implementation of extended deterrence,&quot; the South&#x27;s military said in a statement.

Face The Nation: China considering providing &quot;lethal support&quot; to aid Russian invasion of Ukraine, Blinken says 
Washington — As the attempted Russian takeover of Ukraine nears its one-year mark, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS News on Saturday that China is actively considering providing lethal support, including weapons and ammunition to aid Moscow in its war against Ukraine. 
&quot;We&#x27;ve been concerned from day one about that possibility,&quot; Blinken said in an interview with &quot;Face the Nation&quot; moderator Margaret Brennan on Saturday. 
Pressed on the type of lethal aid China is considering, Blinken spoke in general terms.  &quot;There&#x27;s a whole gamut of things that — that fit in that category, everything from ammunition to the weapons themselves.&quot;

                              <span>BBC: Ukraine war: Russia must be defeated but not crushed, Macron says 
French President Emmanuel Macron has said he does not want to see Russia crushed by a defeat in Ukraine. 
Speaking to French media, Mr Macron urged Western nations to increase military support for Kyiv and said he was prepared for a protracted war. 
&quot;I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,&quot; he said. 
But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to &quot;crush&quot; the nation. 
The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow. 
&quot;I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,&quot; Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche. 
&quot;Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.&quot;

   Bloomberg: China’s Alleged Election Meddling Creates Problem for Trudeau 
(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said China has been attempting to interfere in Canada’s democracy for years, but Canadians can have “total confidence” in the integrity of its election results. 
Trudeau was responding to a Globe and Mail report that said Canada’s intelligence agency has evidence China employed “a sophisticated strategy” to try to disrupt the country’s federal election in 2021. 
The newspaper reported that Chinese diplomats worked through proxies to persuade Chinese-Canadians to vote against certain Conservative Party candidates. Chinese officials expressed a preference to see Trudeau’s Liberal Party win a minority government, according to the intelligence reports.

* US Rep. Ronny Jackson, the White House doctor who served the Trump and Obama administrations, called Joe Biden&#x27;s latest health exam a &#x27;cover up&#x27; 
* Jackson claimed it was evident that Biden was suffering from a mental health &#x27;decline,&#x27; as the president has experienced a slew of public gaffes

A former White House doctor criticized Joe Biden&#x27;s latest physical report as &#x27;alarming,&#x27; saying it makes no mention of his &#x27;declining&#x27; mental health. 
US Rep. Ronny Jackson, who served the Trump and Obama administrations, said Biden&#x27;s latest health report was nothing but a &#x27;cover-up&#x27; after the president&#x27;s physical concluded that he was a &#x27;healthy&#x27; and &#x27;vigorous&#x27; 80-year-old who is fit for office.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan and China will hold security talks next week, Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said after meeting his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. 
The agreement to hold the security talks, the first to be held in four years, came after Hayashi and China&#x27;s top diplomat Wang Yi spoke ahead of the conference. 
 &quot;It is important for us to have frank discussions precisely because there are a number of pressing matters in our relationship&quot;, Hayashi said to reporters, highlighting a territorial spat in the East China Sea and increasing Chinese and Russian military presence around Japanese waters as some of the issues that need to be discussed.

From the very beginning of the Ukraine conflict I have been following developments on both sides. My concern has always been the larger implications in geopolitics and economics. Because globalism has pushed most nations into interdependency, an ongoing war in Ukraine could very well set off a chain of dominoes that tests America’s already unstable financial system and supply chain. 
I should note that I really don’t care about the Ukrainian government or the Russian government and I have no interest in which side “wins.” I, like many people, think Ukraine has nothing to do with the American public and is purely a proxy war being pursued by NATO. It is my belief that certain international interests (globalists) are keen for the conflict to continue regardless as they seek to exploit it as a crisis of opportunity.

Reuters: EU Presses for Joint Arms Purchases to Help Ukraine 
MUNICH (Reuters) -The European Union is urgently exploring ways for its member countries to team up to buy munitions to help Ukraine, following warnings from Kyiv that its forces need more supplies quickly, diplomats and officials said. 
EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the idea of joint procurement of 155-millimetre artillery shells – badly needed by Kyiv – at a meeting in Brussels on Monday. 
EU officials and diplomats say a joint approach would be more efficient than member states placing individual orders. Larger orders would also help industry invest in extra capacity, they said.

WNU Editor: So the EU wants to set-up a structure and process (and bureaucracy) to coordinate among all the member states a joint plan to buy munitions to help Ukraine. 
Here is an easy prediction. 
It is going to take months by the time the EU has assembled something that makes sense, and even longer to have the funds allocated to help industry build-up the facilities to make munitions and arms for Ukraine. The war could possibly be over by the time the EU has produced one shell.</span>

AMMAN (Reuters) - An Israeli rocket strike early on Sunday hit a building in central Damascus&#x27;s Kafr Sousa neighbourhood near a large, heavily guarded security complex close to Iranian installations, killing five people, witnesses and officials said. 
The rare, targeted strike damaged several buildings in the densely populated district close to Omayyad square in the heart of the capital, where multi-storey security buildings are located within residential areas. 
A police official said on state media that there were several casualties and injured.  An Israeli military spokesperson declined to comment.  Citing a military source, state media said Israel had carried out air strikes targeting several areas in the capital shortly after midnight, causing five deaths and 15 injuries among civilians, and damage to several residential buildings.

— Wopke Hoekstra (@WBHoekstra) February 18, 2023
   DW: The Netherlands expel Russian diplomats, close trade mission 
The Dutch move to kick out a number of Russian diplomats was sparked by concerns over espionage but is also based on a row over diplomatic visas.
The Netherlands on Saturday ordered &quot;a number&#x27;&#x27; of Russian diplomats to leave the country within two weeks. 
Russia&#x27;s trade office in Amsterdam would also have to close by Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Wopke Hoekstra said. 
He accused Russia of trying to post spies in the Netherlands, which is also home to international institutions, including the International Criminal Court and the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW. 
 &quot;Russia keeps trying to secretly get intelligence agents into the Netherlands under cover of diplomacy. We cannot and shall not allow that,&quot; Hoekstra said.

Joe Biden’s presidential administration has formally concluded that Russia has committed crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine, US vice-president Kamala Harris said on Saturday, and pledged that those involved “will be held to account”. 
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference five days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, Harris said: “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity.”

North Korea has launched a long-range ballistic missile into the sea off Japan&#x27;s west coast after warning of a strong response to upcoming military drills by South Korea and the United States. 
Japanese authorities said the missile plunged into waters inside Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone on Saturday more than an hour after it was launched, suggesting the weapon was one of Pyongyang&#x27;s largest missiles. 
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisihda said the missile appeared to have been an ICBM-class, referring to an intercontinental ballistic missile.

                              <span>Reuters: Blinken warns China&#x27;s Wang Yi against aiding Russia in Ukraine, article with video 
MUNICH (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday warned top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, saying in an interview after the two met that Washington was concerned Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Moscow. 
The top diplomats of the two superpowers met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich, just hours after Wang scolded Washington as &quot;hysterical&quot; in a running dispute over the U.S. downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon. 
Relations between the two countries have been fraught since Washington said China flew a spy balloon over the continental U.S. before American fighter jets shot it down on President Joe Biden&#x27;s orders. The dispute also came at a time when the West is closely watching Beijing&#x27;s response to the Ukraine war.

Zero Hedge: No Military Winner Likely In Ukraine Conflict, Will End In Future Negotiations: Gen. Milley 
Coming off of meetings in Brussels this week with NATO military partners, Joint Chiefs chairman Mark Milley was interviewed by the Financial Times, discussing his vision for the potential end-game in Ukraine, as well as recent reports of weapons and ammo stockpiles in the West being fast depleted while arming Kiev. In his view, neither side is likely to prevail, in what will be a protracted conflict eventually ending in negotiations.
&quot;It will be almost impossible for the Russians to achieve their political objectives by military means,&quot; Milley asserted. &quot;It is unlikely that Russia is going to overrun Ukraine. It’s just not going to happen.&quot; But he also conceded that it will be &quot;very, very difficult for Ukraine this year to kick the Russians out of every inch&quot; of territory now captured and controlled by Kremlin forces.

WNU Editor: Good point (see tweet below). 

Wow, that&#x27;s the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff admitting Ukraine won&#x27;t win.
Kind of begs the question why they torpedoed the negotiations early last year, as per the Naftali Bennett revelations. We might arrive at roughly the same result with countless deaths on top. https://t.co/3rALmuFu0i

A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pressing President Joe Biden directly to send F-16 warplanes to Ukraine as the fight against Russia’s invasion enters its second year. 
Five House members argued modern jets — which Kyiv has sought, but the administration has so far not agreed to — “could prove decisive for control of Ukrainian airspace this year” in a Thursday letter to Biden obtained by POLITICO.

Reuters: Ukraine war spurs European demand for U.S. arms, but not big-ticket items 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European demand for U.S. weaponry is soaring, but instead of big-ticket items like jets and tanks, shopping lists are focused on cheaper, less-sophisticated items such as shoulder-fired missiles, artillery, and drones that have proven critical to Ukraine&#x27;s war efforts. 
Countries close to Russia like Poland, Finland and Germany are striking deals to build U.S. weapons in Europe, negotiating new deals to buy arms and looking to speed up existing contracts, according to interviews with military officials and industry executives, and a Reuters review of recent announcements by governments and defense manufacturers. Demand is centered around basic weapons and munitions: 155-millimeter artillery rounds, air defenses, communications equipment, shoulder-fired Javelin missiles and drones, nearly a dozen European military attachés in Washington told Reuters in a series of recent interviews.

Fighting is being reported along the entire front lines. There are also numerous reports that the Russian Army that was called up in September and have been training for the past few months have left their camps, and are now being deployed not far from the front lines.  I concur with the Military Summary channel&#x27;s opinion that the expected Russian offensive will only happen after President Putin gives his State of The Union speech on February 21.</span>

Allies with available battle tanks should send them now to Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday, as NATO partners struggle to muster the heavy vehicles pledged for Kyiv. 
&quot;Those who can send such battle tanks should really do so now,&quot; Scholz told the Munich Security Conference, adding he would be &quot;intensively campaigning&quot; for allies to move on the issue. 
Scholz&#x27;s call marked a dramatic reversal of roles as he had for months been under pressure from allies to approve the delivery of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine.

Air Force Magazine: Russian Air Force ‘Has Lot of Capability Left’ One Year On From Ukraine Invasion 
While the red stars on the aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, have not been very visible in recent months, Russia’s air force remains largely intact despite its grinding war in Ukraine, according to independent analysis and official comments.
The fighting in Ukraine has been dominated by artillery exchanges, and neither side has been able to establish air superiority. But as Russian forces begin a new offensive, there are mounting concerns among Ukrainian allies that Moscow may be preparing to make greater use of its fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. 
Though U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III sought to dispel fears that Ukraine will face a qualitatively different Russian air threat, he did acknowledge that Russia still has lots of aircraft, which could put additional stress on Ukraine’s air defenses.

NEAR BAKHMUT, Ukraine/MUNICH (Reuters) -Ukrainian soldiers fighting to hold off a Russian push on the small eastern city of Bakhmut pleaded for more weapons from the outside world as senior Western leaders met in Munich on Friday to assess the year-long war shaking Europe. 
&quot;Give us more military equipment, more weapons, and we will deal with the Russian occupier, we will destroy them,&quot; said Dmytro, a serviceman standing in the snow near Bakhmut which Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary group is attacking. 
Nearly one year into the invasion, President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s troops are intensifying assaults in the east.

Space News: Defense giants are hungry for space companies 
TAMPA, Fla. — Large defense companies are itching to buy space assets as part of the market is on the verge of a shake-out, executives discussing deal-making in the industry said Feb. 8. 
Phillip Ingle, a managing director in Morgan Stanley’s investment banking division, highlighted large “appetite for the big primes to get their hands on attractive space assets” during the SmallSat Symposium in Mountain View, California. 
U.S. Department of Defense budgets orientated “towards space are growing much more healthfully than other parts of the defense budget,” Ingle said, encouraging primes “to grow their space businesses because that’s where a lot of the growth is.” 
Defense giants Raytheon and L3 Harris have set up venture capital arms in recent years to capture emerging technology, he noted, following the steps of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Space News: Analyst: U.S. military space budget likely to get another boost in 2024 
Congress has supported significant spending increases due to concerns about Russian and Chinese anti-satellite weapons  
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration in its budget proposal for fiscal year 2024 is likely to seek a significant increase for the U.S. Space Force, the National Security Space Association’s head of legislative affairs Mike Tierney said Feb. 16. 
The White House is expected to release the president’s federal budget proposal for fiscal year 2024 on March 9. 
Tierney during an online forum said he has not seen any actual numbers but “things are starting to trickle out in the rumor mill.” 
“What we’re hearing is another substantial increase for the Space Force in the ‘24 request,” he added. 
Tierney, a veteran budget analyst, predicts the increase could be anywhere from $3 billion to $6 billion above what was requested in fiscal year 2023. 
Funding for military space programs — including the Space Force and other space programs across DoD — grew from $17.7 billion in 2021 to $21.8 billion in 2022, Tierney said. In fiscal year 2023, the Pentagon requested $26.9 billion and Congress upped it to $28.5 billion

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic&#x27;s presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society&#x27;s political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

                              <span>Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men&#x27;s World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
&quot;Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,&quot; Murangira said.
&quot;They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.&quot;
&quot;Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.&quot;
Rwanda&#x27;s soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda&#x27;s Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men&#x27;s event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in France.

The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children&#x27;s hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.
The vast majority of children are suffering from &quot;moderate to severe malnutrition,&quot; complicated by other ailments including pneumonia, malaria and the stomach flu…</span>

                              <span>Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”
“Fine, but first let’s distinguish between a sin …</span>

                              <span>Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the &quot;toxicity&quot; of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, &quot;and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes&quot;, Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was &quot;now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire&quot;, Cumming said.
&quot;So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I&#x27;m now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!&quot;
The queen&#x27;s death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

                              <span>A man was crushed to death by a &quot;telescopic&quot; urinal in central London on Friday, despite the efforts of ambulance crews, an air ambulance and firefighters.
Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London&#x27;s West End, the city&#x27;s theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a &quot;telescopic urinal&quot; when he became trapped, police said.
&quot;We&#x27;re sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene,&quot; Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
&quot;Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.&quot;
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.</span>

                              <span>Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
&quot;We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,&quot; said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
&quot;Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,&quot; added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a &quot;quagmire.&quot;
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte&#x27;s removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo&#x27;s arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country&#x27;s south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru&#x27;s vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

                              <span>NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran&#x27;s government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
&quot;The victim publicized (the) Iranian government&#x27;s human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution,&quot; Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran&#x27;s head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

                              <span>A British teenager was on Friday sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for videos promoting racist violence that have been linked to two mass killings in the United States.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and a &quot;propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology&quot;.
&quot;You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you,&quot; Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

                              <span>All roads lead to Rome, as the saying goes, and the most prestigious is the Appian Way, the strategic highway for the Roman Empire now hoping to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
A paved road of more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) begun in 312 B.C. by Roman statesman Appius Claudius Caecus, the &quot;Via Appia&quot; is an archaeological treasure trove, where an ongoing excavation hopes to uncover the actual starting point of the road in Rome.
The artery leading south to the key port of Brindisi at Italy&#x27;s heel provided a gateway to the eastern Mediterranean, especially Greece, and was of strategic importance for the armies and merchants of a quickly expanding Rome.
This week, archaeologists showed off progress in their attempt to dig deep enough to unearth the beginning of the road, hidden far b…</span>

Sharma is the custodian of a temple dedicated to Nathuram Godse, who on January 30, 1948, gunned down a figure celebrated the world over as an apostle of non-violent struggle.
For generations, the young religious zealot -- hanged the following year -- was roundly despised as the archvillain of India&#x27;s long struggle to free itself from British colonial rule.
But since the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi nearly a decade ago, an alternate history forged in Hindu nationalist ideology has left Sharma no longer a &quot;lone warrior&quot; in worshipping the assassin.

&quot;Do you swear to always be loyal to the motherland?&quot; a group leader said.

Some parents watched as their children took the oath in the presence of officials, war veterans and local leaders of the militaristic youth group.

A truck-sized asteroid that suddenly loomed out of the darkness a few days ago -- with the Earth in its sights -- sailed harmlessly past us on Thursday, space scientists said.
Despite what we&#x27;ve seen in movies like &quot;Armageddon,&quot; no global mission to blow it up or knock it off course with nuclear weapons was required.
Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.
Phew.
The rock, which was spotted for the first time on Saturday by an amateur stargazer in Crimea, came closest to the southern tip of South America at around 0029 GMT Friday, according to scientists who were tracking it.
At its nearest point, the asteroid was just 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) from Earth&#x27;s surface -- just a quarter of the heigh…</span>

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
&quot;IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS,&quot; he wrote. &quot;SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!&quot;
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

&quot;FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!&quot;
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a &quot;genius&quot; at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.</span>

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved its Doomsday Clock forward to 90 seconds before midnight.
The clock has been maintained since 1947 and is used as a metaphor for the likelihood that we&#x27;ll blow ourselves up. Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, &quot;It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.&quot;
In 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. Today it&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>Hundreds of campaign groups on Thursday condemned the appointment of an oil boss to lead UN climate talks in the United Arab Emirate, saying it threatened the meeting&#x27;s &quot;legitimacy&quot;.
The UAE named Sultan Al Jaber, chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), to head the crucial COP28 climate meeting in November, sparking an outcry from activists.
He is the first CEO to take the role at the UN summit.
NGOs and civil society organisations from around the world said in an open letter Thursday the &quot;decision threatens the legitimacy and efficacy of COP28.
&quot;This is no cause for celebration,&quot; it added in the letter to UN chief Antonio Guterres and Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), under which all climate nego…</span>

                              <span>An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
&quot;Before encountering Earth, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth&#x27;s orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun,&quot; NASA said in a statement. &quot;After its encounter, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth&#x27;s and Mars&#x27; orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.&quot;
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world&#x27;s telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.</span>

The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt&#x27;s former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, &quot;decorated with scenes of daily life,&quot; belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.
It was found in the pyramid complex of Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty, who reigned some 4,30…</span>

                              <span>“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…</span>
