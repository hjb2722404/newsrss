China is desperate to know if Air Force’s new B-21 stealth bomber is capable of unmanned flight 
The Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber that debuted Dec. 2 is safely back in its hangar in California, but you can bet China’s keyboard warriors are furiously clicking away trying to unravel its secrets via cyber-espionage.  
You, me and military officers in China and other bad guy countries all want to know four big secrets about the B-21.  
First, can the B-21 fly without pilots? Original acquisition documents called for the B-21 bomber to be &quot;capable of manned and unmanned operations.&quot; Military drones take the man or woman out to save weight and increase endurance flight time. No one doubts the Air Force pilots can stick it out for long missions. Back in 2001, two B-2 bomber pilots logged a 44-hour mission from Missouri to Afghanistan and back. Bomber pilots train in simulators for 72-hour missions (and you thought the center seat on Southwest Airlines was tough.)

Politico: ‘We better watch out’: NASA boss sounds alarm on Chinese moon ambitions 
In an interview with POLITICO, Bill Nelson expressed confidence the U.S. can win the moon race. But he warned there is little time to lose. 
The race to the moon between the United States and China is getting tighter and the next two years could determine who gains the upper hand. 
So says NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, who warns that Beijing could establish a foothold and try to dominate the most resource-rich locations on the lunar surface — or even keep the U.S. out. 
“It is a fact: we’re in a space race,” the former Florida senator and astronaut said in an interview. “And it is true that we better watch out that they don’t get to a place on the moon under the guise of scientific research. And it is not beyond the realm of possibility that they say, ‘Keep out, we’re here, this is our territory.’”

Japan monitored the operations after the Chinese naval group, which included missile destroyers, sailed between the main Okinawa island and Miyakojima island into the Western Pacific from the East China Sea on Dec. 16, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Defence said in a press release.

German media has mocked a &quot;tone-deaf&quot; video put out by Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht. She was slammed for discussing the war in Ukraine as people set off fireworks. 
German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht came under fire on Monday for what has been considered a tone-deaf video published on her social media account. 
 Lambrecht shared the video on Instagram, in which she appears on a street in Berlin during chaotic New Year&#x27;s celebrations. 
Her reflections of the &quot;war raging in the middle of Europe&quot; — in reference to the already 10-month-long war in Ukraine — have been called insensitive with the backdrop of loud fireworks blasting behind her. 
German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel said the address failed to &quot;hit the right tone,&quot; instead painting the war as an &quot;exciting professional experience.&quot;

BBC: Ukraine must get long-term support, warns Nato chief 
Western countries must be prepared to provide long-term support to Ukraine as Russia shows no signs of relenting, Nato&#x27;s secretary general has said.
Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that military support would ensure the survival of Ukraine as a sovereign country and force Russia to sit down and negotiate an end to the war. 
Russia&#x27;s leader accuses the West of using Ukraine to destroy his country. 
Russian missiles and drones have hit Ukraine on New Year&#x27;s Eve and Day. 
Russia&#x27;s partial mobilisation programme, ordered in September, showed Moscow had no desire to end the war at present, Mr Stoltenberg told Radio 4&#x27;s World at One programme.

WNU Editor: If the West cuts weapons and ammo supplies to Ukraine, I can see the Ukraine Army collapsing in the eastern part of the country in a few weeks. That is what NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is warning about, and why he wants the West to ramp up war production .... Western allies must lift arms production for Ukraine, Nato chief says (The National).

Insider: CIA staff made a &#x27;suicide pact&#x27; to resign if Trump fired director Gina Haspel, former aide says 
* CIA staff pledged to quit if Donald Trump fired its director, Alyssa Farah Griffin said. 
* She spoke about the &quot;suicide pact&quot; in testimony to the January 6 committee. 
* At the time, Trump was said to be considering replacing Gina Haspel with supporter Kash Patel. 
CIA staff had a &quot;suicide pact&quot; to resign if Donald Trump fired director Gina Haspel, a former aide to the president told the House&#x27;s January 6 select committee. 
Alyssa Farah Griffin said that the threat of a mass walkout stopped Trump from replacing Haspel with supporter Kash Patel, according to transcripts released by the committee in late December. 
&quot;I will share one thing that I cannot confirm myself, but it&#x27;s worth looking into,&quot; said Farah Griffin, a former director of communications at the White House. 
She gave the testimony in April 2022.  &quot;I have been told that they tried to fire Gina Haspel, the CIA director, and install Kash Patel.&quot;

WNU Editor: If true. And what we now know from the Twitter files. President Trump should have fired Gina Haspel. The US would be in a far better place today with no blood and vision at the top.
In the end Gina Haspel was replaced (fired?) by the Biden White House. And there was no mass resignation.</span>

Times of Israel: US Air Force temporarily deploys six fighter jets to Israeli airbase  
IAF says that during deployment at Nevatim, American F-15s and Israeli F-35s and spy planes will hold joint drills 
The United States Air Force on Monday deployed six fighter jets to an Israeli Air Force base in southern Israel, as part of a military tactic to constantly disperse its aircraft at various airbases. 
According to the IAF, during the deployment at the Nevatim Airbase, the six F-15s would conduct joint drills with Israel’s fleet of F-35 stealth fighters and a squadron of intelligence-gathering Gulfstream G550 planes. 
The drills, set to take place this week, would simulate strikes deep in enemy territory, the IAF said.

Nasrallah canceled a Friday speech after the Lebanese terror group said he had fallen ill with influenza. 
Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was rushed to intensive care after suffering a stroke, according to reports from Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. 
The reports came after Nasrallah canceled a planned Friday speech, with the Lebanese terrorist organization announcing through its affiliated media he had fallen ill with influenza and was unable to speak well. 
Saudi journalist Hussein al-Gawi contradicted Hezbollah&#x27;s statement, claiming that Nasrallah indeed suffered a second stroke instead of falling ill as was reported. 
The Hezbollah leader was reportedly hospitalized at the Great Prophet Hospital in Beirut.

At the end of a year in which the number of journalists killed in connection with their work rose again, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has compiled and analyzed the figures for journalists killed during the past 20 years – two especially deadly decades for those in the service of the right to inform. 
What with murders, contract killings, ambushes, war zone deaths and fatal injuries, a staggering total of 1,668 journalists have been killed worldwide in connection with their work in the last two decades (2003-2022), according to RSF’s tallies based above all on its annual round-ups. This gives an average of more than 80 journalists killed every year. The total killed since 2000 is 1,787.

* Xi addressed the nation for New Year and made his first comments on Covid 
* China abandoned its stringent, long-held zero-Covid policy earlier this month  
* There has been a considerable &#x27;exit-wave&#x27; of infections but Chinese citizens are revelling in their new found freedoms  
Chinese President Xi Jinping today called for unity amid a &#x27;new phase&#x27; in its approach to combating the pandemic in his first comments to the public on COVID-19 since abandoning stringent lockdown rules. 
China&#x27;s abrupt switch earlier this month from the &#x27;zero-COVID&#x27; policy that it had maintained for nearly three years has led to infections sweeping across the country unchecked.  
It has also caused a further drop in economic activity and international concern, with Britain and France becoming the latest countries to impose curbs on travellers from China.

                              <span>BBC: Third of world in recession this year, IMF head warns 
A third of the global economy will be in recession this year, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. 
Kristalina Georgieva said 2023 will be &quot;tougher&quot; than last year as the US, EU and China see their economies slow. 
It comes as the war in Ukraine, rising prices, higher interest rates and the spread of Covid in China weigh on the global economy. 
In October the IMF cut its global economic growth outlook for 2023. 
&quot;We expect one third of the world economy to be in recession,&quot; Ms Georgieva said on the CBS news programme Face the Nation. 
&quot;Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,&quot; she added.

George Friedman, Geopolitical Futures: The State of Play in Ukraine 
The war in Ukraine seems permanent. Neither side appears capable of destroying the opposing force or articulating what it would take to reach a peace agreement. The Russians are speaking to Belarus, India and anyone else they might find, but no one can help enough on the battlefield or in the munitions factory to turn the tide. The Ukrainians are speaking to the United States, NATO and anyone else who will listen so that they will continue to receive weapons – perhaps even some new ones. But Ukraine hasn’t broken Russia yet, concerned as it is with preventing the collapse of the country, and doing so may prove difficult. On the battlefield, there is movement on both sides, but movement doesn’t carry with it the taste of victory. When, then, do wars end if the leadership will not concede?
History shows there are several answers to that question.

Taiwan News: Majority of Taiwanese would defend nation if China attacks

Taiwan  TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A majority of Taiwanese are willing to defend Taiwan if China uses force against the nation, according to a Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TDF) released on Friday (Dec. 30).

However, if China invades Taiwan to annex it, 71.9% of respondents say they were willing to fight, while 19.3% refused to defend the nation. 
The survey polled adults aged 20 and over in Taiwan, excluding Kinmen and Matsu, and was conducted from May 18-23, 2022. Altogether, 825 and 439 effective samples were completed via telephones and mobile phones, respectively. The maximum sampling error is plus or minus 2.76%.

Yonhap News Agency: Yoon says S. Korea, U.S. in talks over joint nuclear exercises 
SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk Yeol has said South Korea is in talks with the United States to carry out joint planning and joint exercises involving U.S. nuclear forces to counter North Korea&#x27;s nuclear threats. 
In an interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper published Monday, Yoon said the idea of the U.S. providing a nuclear umbrella or extended deterrence to South Korea is not enough to reassure the South Korean public. 
The interview was published a day after North Korean state media reported leader Kim Jong-un called for &quot;an exponential increase&quot; of his country&#x27;s nuclear arsenal, while calling South Korea &quot;our undoubted enemy.&quot;

VOA/Reuters: Syrian Army Says Israel Attacks Areas Around Southern Damascus  
The Syrian army said Israel conducted a rocket attack Sunday evening on targets in the vicinity of Damascus. 
A Syrian army statement said the attack came from the Golan Heights and that it downed most of the missiles. 
An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment.
 In a briefing to supporters of his party on Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Israel was taking action &quot;almost weekly&quot; to prevent Iranian entrenchment in Syria.

                              <span>Moon Of Alabama: Lack Of Good Analyses Contributes To The Decline Of The &#x27;West&#x27; 
What really hit me last year was the dearth of correct analyses in main stream media and in politics with regards to the war in Ukraine. 
Little if anything is based on facts. More than 90% of the published output is propaganda. 
The &#x27;western&#x27; plan was to draw Russia into Ukraine to then &#x27;kill&#x27; it by economic sanctions. As Biden said when he announced those:       
We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.  
And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.

The Hill: Officials say US forces killed almost 700 suspected ISIS members in 2022 
U.S. forces killed almost 700 suspected Islamic State operatives in 2022, including the leader of the group, dozens of regional leaders and hundreds of fighters.  
U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a release on Thursday that it conducted 313 operations against ISIS over the past year, killing 466 operatives in Syria and at least 220 operatives in Iraq. Officials also detained 215 operatives in Syria and 159 operatives in Iraq.  
The release states that no U.S. forces were injured or killed in the operations, a majority of which were conducted with the United States’s allies in the two countries.

Russia’s president has broken years-long tradition, addressing the nation from a military HQ 
Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his traditional New Year&#x27;s Eve address on Saturday, speaking to the nation about the challenges the country has faced over the past year and the achievements it has made. 
The address venue differed drastically from the traditional Kremlin courtyard stand-up shots of the president, with Putin this year recording the annual message at the Southern Military District HQ. During his visit, he also met with top military brass and gave state awards to distinguished soldiers.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Russia that “no one will ever forgive you” for spreading terror following a series of missile attacks on the day of New Year’s Eve.  
Zelensky said in an address on Saturday that the missile attacks will not mark the end of the year but the outcome of Russia’s fate in that it will not be forgiven. 
He mentioned that Russia launched missile attacks during the war at other holidays like Easter and Christmas.  
“They call themselves Christians, they are very proud of their Orthodoxy. But they are following the devil. They support him and are together with him,” he said.

                              <span>Reuters: Bolivia protesters burn cars, clash with police after governor arrested 
SANTA CRUZ/LA PAZ (Reuters) - Protesters in Bolivia&#x27;s Santa Cruz, a relatively wealthy farming region, attacked buildings, burned cars and blocked highways as part of a 24-hour strike on Friday following the arrest of the regional governor, a right-wing opposition leader. 
As night fell, protesters in parts of the provincial capital torched cars and tires and hurled fireworks toward police, who used tear gas to try to disperse the crowds. 
Pedro Vaca, Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), said in a post on Twitter he was receiving reports of &quot;severe attacks&quot; on the media, attributed to police deployments.

A 97-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has filed an appeal against the guilty verdict she was given for her role in the deaths that took place at her place of work during World War II.
The appeal means that Germany&#x27;s highest criminal court, the Federal Court of Justice, has to examine whether a procedural error was made.
&quot;The verdict is thus not legally binding,&quot; the lower court in Itzehoe in northern Germany said on Wednesday.
Identified only as Irmgard F under German privacy laws, she was found guilty on December 20 of complicity in more than 10,500 cases of murder and given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in northern Germany.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is &quot;very sick&quot;, his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis&#x27; announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden &quot;worsening&quot; of his health.
&quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church,&quot; Francis said in Wednesday&#x27;s surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.

Its promoters reckon it is revolutionizing human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.
Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
The European Union is likely to pass legislation next year -- the AI Act -- aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
Looming large in the debates has been China&#x27;s use of biometric data, facial recognition and other technology to build a powerful system of control.

Uruguay, a country where horses are not considered food but companions, has seen a rise in equine meat exports, prompting efforts to rescue horses destined for slaughter.
In 2020, the small South American nation was the seventh-largest exporter of horse meat, according to the OEC economic data site, with Belgium, Russia, France and Japan among the top importers.
Most of Uruguay&#x27;s tens of thousands of race, sports and work horses end up on someone&#x27;s plate somewhere else in the world after they become injured, old, or their owners simply cannot care for them anymore.

Yellow-band disease -- named for the colour it turns corals before destroying them -- was first spotted decades ago and has caused widespread damage to reefs in the Caribbean. There is no known cure.
But it was detected for the first time off Thailand&#x27;s eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.
&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything like this before,&quot; said marine scientist Lalita Putchim, of Thailand&#x27;s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources.

&quot;I can confirm that in the last few hours there has been a deterioration due to advancing age. The situation at the moment remains under control, monitored continually by doctors,&quot; spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.
This came after Pope Francis said in a surprise announcement in Italian at the end of his weekly general audience: &quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church.&quot;

In early 2022, he joined thousands of Cubans whose migration has amounted to the largest exodus in the Caribbean nation&#x27;s history.
Gonzalez, a 34-year-old barber, said he could no longer bear the hardships of a country going through its worst economic crisis since the 1990s, or the communist regime he had never embraced.
In Cuba, &quot;you lose hope,&quot; he told AFP from Miami, Florida, which he reached after a weeks-long odyssey across multiple countries.
That hopelessness, shared by many young people in Cuba, has pushed emigration to the United States to the highest levels on record.

After two years in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, many had hoped 2022 would herald a brighter future. Those hopes were dashed just a few weeks later with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The past 12 months have also been punctuated by record climate disasters, the overturning of federal abortion rights in the United States and the death of Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II.

Instead, 2022 was marked by a new war, record inflation and climate-linked disasters. It was a &quot;polycrisis&quot; year, a term popularized by historian Adam Tooze.
Get ready for more gloom in 2023.
&quot;The number of crises has increased since the start of the century,&quot; said Roel Beetsma, professor of macroeconomics at the University of Amsterdam.
&quot;Since World War Two we have never seen such a complicated situation,&quot; he told AFP.
After the Covid-induced economic crisis of 2020, consumer prices began to rise in 2021 as countries emerged from lockdowns and other restrictions.

                              <span>Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#x27;s inauguration will be secured by &quot;100 percent&quot; of the capital district&#x27;s police force, an official said Tuesday amid widespread fears of violence.
Over the weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly placing explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia&#x27;s airport, hoping to sow &quot;chaos&quot; ahead of the inauguration Sunday.
The suspect was a supporter of Brazil&#x27;s outgoing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and told authorities he wanted to &quot;prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil&quot; under leftist Lula.
The device did not explode.
On Sunday &quot;there will be a mobilization of 100 percent of the police forces of the Federal District (of Brasilia) to ensure the safety not only of the president, but also of foreign delegations and the public,&quot; Lula&#x27;s future security minister Flavio Dino told reporters.
Lula backers have expressed fear on social media of riots or attacks on inauguration day, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend events in Brasilia.
But Dino sought to give assurances the event will be &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;peaceful,&quot; encouraging Brazilians to turn out to celebrate.
He added there had been &quot;no change&quot; to plans for the ceremony, in response to speculation that Lula might do his inauguration parade in a closed car instead of the traditional vintage convertible.
After Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9 percent of the vote in a runoff election in October, supporters of the vanquished president blocked roads and demonstrated outside military barracks demanding the armed forces prevent Lula&#x27;s inauguration.
On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators clashed with the police and set fire to buses and cars in Brasilia.
&quot;Small terrorist and extremist groups will not put the institutions of Brazilian democracy up against a wall,&quot; said Dino.
Bolsonaro, who has limited his public appearances after the defeat, has not confirmed that he will follow the tradition of handing over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday&#x27;s ceremony.

                              <span>A human rights attorney raised alarm Monday over the expansion plans of Toka, an Israeli cyber firm that sells hacking technologies capable of finding, accessing, and manipulating security and smart camera footage.
Co-founded by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) cyber chief Yaron Rosen, Toka &quot;sells technologies that allow clients to locate security cameras or even webcams within a given perimeter, hack into them, watch their live feed, and even alter it—and past recordings,&quot; Haaretzreported, citing internal documents it obtained and reviewed with a technical expert.
&quot;One can imagine video being manipulated to incriminate innocent citizens or shield guilty parties.&quot;

                              <span>Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, and as the ensuing war raged, the year saw some of the worst natural disasters on record, including wildfires in southern Europe and floods that submerged a third of Pakistan. The death of the UK’s Queen Elizabeth II spelled the end of an era, and a brave new protest movement emerged in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.

Russia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe 
Early in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion. But Russia meets a tougher resistance than expected. And after a failed attempt to take the capital Kyiv, the Russian …</span>

                              <span>Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. 
A friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov&#x27;s death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov&#x27;s friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have &quot;consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.&quot;
Antov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. 
From the BBC: &quot;Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov&#x27;s account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: &#x27;It&#x27;s extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.&#x27; The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a &#x27;patriot of my country&#x27; and backed the war.&quot;

&quot;Every war ends in a diplomatic way,&quot; Kuleba said in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&quot;
Kuleba suggested the summit could be mediated by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, a vocal advocate of diplomatic talks to end an invasion that has killed thousands of civilians, devastated Ukraine&#x27;s infrastructure, and sparked a massive humanitarian crisis.
&quot;The United Nations could be the best venue for holding this summit, because this is not about making a favor to a certain country,&quot; the f…</span>

More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago -- they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 -- before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding program, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as &quot;vulnerable&quot;, with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild -- with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand&#x27;s wild wetlands.
But since 2011, more than 150 captivity-bred birds …</span>

Ron DeSantis
Will Donald Trump&#x27;s former apprentice, popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis, turn on his one-time mentor by challenging him for the Republican nomination for president?
Trump is already gearing up for a potential battle with his MAGA (Make America Great Again) disciple, whose stock has soared among Republicans.
DeSantis won a landslide re-election in November&#x27;s midterms, in which Trump loyalists fared badly. The property mogul has coined a nickname for the self-styled anti-woke warrior: &quot;Ron de Sanctimonious&quot;.

When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia&#x27;s threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine.
&quot;We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis&quot; in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.
And on the year that humanity welcomed its eighth billion member, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the planet was on a &quot;highway to climate hell.&quot;

                              <span>Far from the humble sticking plaster, medical firms and researchers are seeking to create the &quot;ultimate dressing&quot; -- artificial skin they hope will revolutionize the treatment of severe burns.
For the last 18 months, researchers from the French firm Urgo have been working towards achieving this Holy Grail of wound treatment, which would save serious burn victims from the painful and repeated skin grafts they currently endure.
The 100-million-euro ($106,000-million) &quot;Genesis&quot; project hopes to have a product ready by 2030.
Guirec Le Lous, the president of Urgo&#x27;s medical arm, told AFP that it is a &quot;crazy&quot; project.
&quot;Are we capable of designing artificial skin in a laboratory? No one in the world has succeeded,&quot; he said.

Writing before the mid-term election, New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg explained that hundreds of documents he&#x27;s sifted through, in addition to former Robert Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann&#x27;s details, revealed enough to show what Putin was after when he worked to swing the 2016 election for Trump.

                              <span>(Reuters) - SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Monday that the company is now close to having 100 active Starlinks, the firm&#x27;s satellite internet service, in Iran, three months after he tweeted he would activate the service there amid protests around the Islamic country.
Musk said, &quot;approaching 100 starlinks active in Iran&quot;, in a tweet on Monday.
The billionaire had said in September that he would activate Starlink in Iran as part of a U.S.-backed effort &quot;to advance internet freedom and the free flow of information&quot; to Iranians.
The satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the government&#x27;s restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms amid protests around the country.
The Islamic Republic has been engulfed in protests that erupted after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for wearing &quot;unsuitable attire&quot;.

                              <span>Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.
Following his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.
&quot;The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset,&quot; parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.
Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel&#x27;s history.
While the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu&#x27;s right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Both live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.
Netanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.
However, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.
His incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) -China will stop requiring inbound travellers to go into quarantine starting from Jan. 8, the National Health Commission said on Monday in a major step towards easing curbs on its borders, which have been largely shut since 2020.
China&#x27;s management of COVID-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.
Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China&#x27;s economy, fuelling last month the mainland&#x27;s biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
