It follows talks between the AFP, Asian and European authorities in Vietnam last month.

Bikie gang members have increased their presence in South East Asia to control illicit supply chains, trafficking corridors and money laundering.

Around 70 per cent of the transnational serious organised crime threats impacting Australia come from overseas.</span>

                              <span>Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts says it is in the interest of China and Australia to “stabilise” the relationship between the two countries. 

China&#x27;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Australia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Penny Wong and delivered a four-point list of actions Australia must take to get the relationship between the two countries back on track.

Mr Watts said the meeting was “constructive”.

“What Foreign Minister Wong made clear to Minister Wang Yi was while Australia’s government has changed, Australia’s policy settings and our national interests haven’t,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

“There’s just no way that any Australian government is going to give up their sovereignty completely and become a vassal state to China, which is exactly what they want,” he told Sky News Australia.

He said Australia “needs to go back to China with our own set of demands”.

“To say, first and foremost, you need to release Australian and indeed all political prisoners.

                              <span>Daily Mail: Voters in Japan overwhelmingly back slain ex-prime minister Shinzo Abe’s party, handing the Liberal Democrats a parliamentary SUPER-majority that could now see the world’s third-richest country greatly expand its army and global role 
* Ruling party the Liberal Democrats - who have been in government 62 of the past 67 years - are set to gain 
* Added seats could allow Shinzo Abe&#x27;s proposed constitutional changes to pass, sealing late ex-PM&#x27;s legacy 
* Mr Abe, 67, was shot dead with an improvised shotgun while campaigning in Nara, western Japan last Friday 
 * Queen was &#x27;deeply saddened&#x27; by &#x27;sudden and tragic&#x27; loss of Abe, who served as Japan&#x27;s PM from 2012 to 2020 
* Suspect Tetsuya Yamagami was escorted out of Nara Police Station to be taken to the local prosecutor&#x27;s office 
* GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: This story contains graphic content which some readers may find distressing 
The Japanese Liberal Democrats won a landslide victory at national elections held two days after Shinzo Abe, the party&#x27;s ex-leader and Japan&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, was assassinated at a campaign event. 
Prime minister Fumio Kishida&#x27;s ruling party - which has governed Japan for 62 of the past 67 years - was set to win more than 70 of 125 seats in the upper house alongside right-wing allies Komeito. 
Though a change in government via the more powerful lower house was not at stake, today&#x27;s elections are thought to be a referendum on Japan&#x27;s leaders - and the legacy of its slain ex-PM.

                              <span>“The problem is that Kim’s ideals aren’t wrong,” she said.  “But the way she does it is.”
In five and a half seasons, Kim’s long slide to perdition has become undoubtedly the narrative keystone of the series.  It has not always been so.  When it started, “Saul,” a prequel to “Breaking Bad,” seemed mostly focused on transforming slippery but fundamentally decent Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Albuquerque’s sleaziest lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Kim’s ultimate role was then uncertain, even for the screenwriters.
“We had no idea when we started how important his character was going to be,” said showrunner and co-creator Peter Gould.  “If you watch the pilot of the show, she probably has three lines of dialogue.”
It soon became clear, however, that the character of Seehorn, who started (outwardly) as a straight arrow with a promising legal career, would be an integral part of Jimmy’s makeover.  Like Jimmy, Kim was breaking badly.  Unlike Jimmy, however, Kim never appears in “Breaking Bad,” leading many fans to assume the worst.  The stakes were always potentially higher for her than for the guy with her name in the title.
That seems like a lot to bear, given that “Saul” is one of TV’s most critically acclaimed series.  But if so, Seehorn, 50, who has been performing on screens and on stages since the ’90s, handles it with grace.  Unlike the purse-lipped, inscrutable Kim, Seehorn isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, either professionally or, ultimately, in conversation.  She has no problem, for example, talking at length about a rash.  She’s funny and has a blinding, spontaneous smile that made me wonder if I’d ever seen Kim Wexler’s teeth (despite all those teeth-brushing scenes).

By John Taylor Williams

There is something ineffable about the appeal of the far reaches of Cape Cod for generations of writers, artists and architects.  Maybe it’s just that, as Thoreau observed, “one man can stand there and put all of America behind him.”  Perhaps – and this was certainly true for the first part of the 20th century – it was the remoteness and isolation of the place, the feeling that as the land stretches out towards the Atlantic, in one long, twisting branch, the current conventional world slips away, allowing you to rethink, reinvent, and get away with all sorts of things.  Perhaps some sort of pre-modern way of life – with so few conveniences and material comforts – attracted the urban cliques that gravitated to…</span>

Not that anything particularly wonderful is happening;  rather the opposite.  At this point in the show, the idea of ​​just going out into the city at night — to watch the traffic, the sunset, or the people on the streets — was more appealing than any fantasy portrayed on stage.
Known for its illusionistic extravaganzas, Momix, which was founded 42 years ago by choreographer Moses Pendleton, drew inspiration from Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice in Wonderland’ for its latest.

Manhattan Center ballroom Friday afternoon.  “And I think we need theater and the arts now more than ever.”
Clinton was speaking at the seventh BroadwayCon — an annual haven for the most avid theater fans — where she hosted a panel celebrating women on Broadway.  It was the first in-person edition of the three-day event, which continues through Sunday, since 2020. (The 2021 edition was virtual.)
The event allows musical theater fans — many of whom are dressed up as favorite characters like Elphaba from “Wicked” and Anne Boleyn from “Six” — to meet and take photos with the stars of their favorite sho…</span>

As an actor, Caan could certainly go big and exteriorize a character’s inner workings (he does a lot around the eyebrows), and Kilgannon has his outsized moments.  Yet what makes the character work is the poignant deadpanness that conveys how brutally life has hollowed him out.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: At 79, Biden Is Testing the Boundaries of Age and the Presidency 
WASHINGTON — When President Biden leaves Tuesday night for a four-day swing through the Middle East, he will presumably be more rested than he would have been had he followed the original plan. 
The trip was initially tacked onto another journey last month to Europe, which would have made for an arduous 10-day overseas trek until it became clear to Mr. Biden’s team that such extended travel might be unnecessarily taxing for a 79-year-old president, or “crazy,” as one official put it. 
Aides also cited political and diplomatic reasons to reorganize the extra stops as a separate trip weeks later. But the reality is that managing the schedule of the oldest president in American history presents distinct challenges. And as Mr. Biden insists he plans to run for a second term, his age has increasingly become an uncomfortable issue for him, his team and his party.

Farmers in the Netherlands have formed their own version of Canada’s &quot;Freedom Convoy,&quot; blocking highways with tractors, setting bales of hay on fire and taking other actions to protest the government’s recent goal to cut emissions that could force some farms to shutter. 
&quot;Where is our prime minister? This country is on fire and the farmers are standing up to the government,&quot; a spokesman for the protests said while standing on top of a hay bale in the town of Eerbeek last week, the Guardian reported. 
Roughly 40,000 protesters gathered in central Netherlands to protest plans to curb the emissions of nitrogen and ammonia last month. Weeks later, the protests have continued across the country with no sign of abating.

Warzone/The Drive: U.S. Says Russia’s Prized Kerch Bridge Is A Fair Target For Ukrainian Forces 
The $3.5B bridge Russia built to connect with Crimea is a major strategic and economic asset that Moscow seems very concerned with protecting. 
Days after Russian forces were spotted preparing the Kerch Strait Bridge — which connects mainland Russia to Crimea — for missile attacks, statements made by U.S. defense officials signaled that the prized piece of Russian infrastructure is a fair target in their minds. The acknowledgment, however, doesn’t change the fact that the Ukrainian military still doesn’t possess a weapon with a range long enough to strike the bridge from within unoccupied territory.

Authorities are urging people to evacuate after a large fire ignited at a natural gas plant in Oklahoma. 
The Grant County Sheriff&#x27;s Office advised anyone who lives within a 2-mile radius of the ONEOK plant in Medford to evacuate Saturday afternoon. It is unclear when people will be able to return. 
&quot;Please avoid any travel into or through Medford on U.S. Highway 81 at this time,&quot; the sheriff&#x27;s office said earlier, citing an &quot;active incident&#x27; at the plant.

Orthodox Times: Canada has imposed sanctions on Patriarch of Moscow Kirill 
Canada has imposed sanctions on Patriarch of Moscow Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, as part of a series of measures the country took to target “agents of Russian disinformation and propaganda” over the invasion of Ukraine. 
These measures were immediately criticized by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who stated that “sanctions against the Patriarch would only be imposed by Satanists.” 
Patriarch Kirill has put the Church at the service of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he calls a “miracle” as he shares his vision of a conservative, sovereign Russia and supports the war in Ukraine. 
In addition to Canada, the United Kingdom also imposed sanctions on the 75-year-old Patriarch in June.

CNBC/Reuters: Canada to return repaired Nord Stream 1 turbine, expand sanctions on Russia 
* Canada will return a repaired turbine to Germany that is needed for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, its minister of natural resources said. 
* The repaired turbine could help to ensure continued flows of energy until Europe can end its dependency on Russian gas. 
 * In addition to the special permit for the turbine, Canada said it would expand sanctions against Russia’s energy sector to include industrial manufacturing. 
Canada will return a repaired turbine to Germany that is needed for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline and could help to ensure continued flows of energy until Europe can end its dependency on Russian gas, Canada’s minister of natural resources said. 
The Canadian government said in a statement on Saturday it was issuing a “time-limited and revocable permit” to exempt the return of turbines from its Russian sanctions and also announced new measures against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Chinese counterpart Wang Ji have held their first talks in months.

United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailed the &quot;constructive&quot; hourslong talks with China&#x27;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Indonesia&#x27;s resort island of Bali on Saturday. 
Coming on the heels of a G20 summit, it was the first in-person talks directly between the two countries since October.
&quot;Despite the complexities of our relationship, I can say with some confidence that our delegations found today&#x27;s discussions useful, candid and constructive,&quot; Blinken said after the talks that lasted five hours.

19FortyFive: Russia’s War in Ukraine Means More U.S. Forces Are Headed to Europe 
On June 29, the Biden administration announced that in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it was broadly expanding U.S. military forces based permanently or on a rotating basis in Europe. 
This comes as eastern European NATO member states request a more robust force capable of outright defeating a Russian invasion, not merely serving as sacrificial ‘trip-wires’.
Prior to that statement, Putin’s aggression had already spurred Washington to increase U.S. military personnel in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000 (mostly non-combat) troops, some of whom will now be staying in the region in one fashion or another (A detailed yet simplified outline of the U.S. force structure in Europe can be found below). 
The new force structure may also contribute to ambitious plans by NATO to increase its so-called high readiness forces from 40,000 to 300,000 troops.

                              <span>Reuters: U.S. to send $400 million in weapons to Ukraine, including more HIMARS  
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden signed a new weapons package worth up to $400 million for Ukraine on Friday, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and more ammunition. 
The new U.S. aid is meant to bolster Ukraine as it confronts heavy pounding by Russian artillery.
Since the Feb. 24 invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a big chunk of territory across Ukraine&#x27;s southern flank above Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Russia is slowly pushing Ukrainian forces out of two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine which it has recognized as independent states. 
A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the additional HIMARS would bring the total number of these systems to 12.

He said people are seeing “broad national outrage” and voters are looking for leadership that will rein in sales of assault weapons. 

“This is not just something that should be shrugged off as part of our culture, it’s a systemic failure and it needs to be addressed with serious policy initiative,” Mr Smith told Sky News Australia.</span>

                              <span>&quot;This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,&quot; he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv&#x27;s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy&#x27;s predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an &quot;offended liver sausage&quot; when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Jeffrey Hall, special lecturer in Japanese studies at Japan’s Kanda University of International Studies, noted the growing online speculation that the group in question is the Unification Church, officially now known on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification that was founded by Sun Myung Moon, whose members are known colloquially as &quot;Moonies.&quot;

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine&#x27;s ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia&#x27;s attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of &quot;distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.&quot;
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. &quot;Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,&quot; Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations &quot;absurd.&quot;
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.</span>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms. There have been some cases in recent years where people illicitly made weapons themselves in Japan. But still, gun crime is very rare in Japan: last year th...</span>

Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…</span>

Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess&#x27;s enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America&#x27;s greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

Huge crowds had surrounded the leader&#x27;s home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President&#x27;s Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
&quot;The president was escorted to safety,&quot; the source added. &quot;He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit.&quot;

From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham&#x27;s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God&#x27;s order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president&#x27;s offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president&#x27;s office said.

CBC: Canada caught between allies as Germany presses for return of Russian turbine  
The Trudeau government must decide whether to upset NATO ally Germany or wartime ally Ukraine 
Canada faces a tough choice this weekend between angering Germany and offending Ukraine as it ponders the fate of a large turbine that has been undergoing repairs in the workshops of Siemens Energy Canada. 
The turbine normally drives gas through the Nord Stream One pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany. Last month, while undergoing scheduled maintenance at a Siemens Energy facility in Montreal, the turbine was caught up in sanctions the Trudeau government brought against its owner, Russian oil and gas giant Gazprom.

                              <span>PJ Media: Is He Running? Trump Plane Gets a Fresh Coat of Paint 
In 2016, Donald Trump loved to stunt on his political opponents by landing his massive, branded jet behind them just as they were giving speeches during campaign stops at airports. 
Now, a new video documents “Trump Force One” getting a fresh coat of paint, leaving the gleaming Boeing 757 resplendent with a waving American flag on the tail. 
Trump linked the video in a post on his Truth Social media platform, writing, “During my four years in the White House, I didn’t use everybody’s favorite airplane, the Boeing 757 we campaigned on for our big 2016 WIN. Now it has been completely modernized and renovated, and looks GREAT, all done in the Great State of Louisiana, and coming back to the skies in the Fall of 2022, or maybe sooner. Get ready!”

Daily Mail: Fury as left-wing activists ShutDownDC offer $200 bounties for intel on locations of SCOTUS judges who overturned Roe v Wade after targeting Brett Kavanaugh during steakhouse dinner 
* A left-wing activist group is encouraging social media users to tweet the location of any of the conservative Supreme Court Justices are spotted out and about 
* ShutDownDC is promising a bounty of $50 for anyone who shares a &#x27;confirmed sighting&#x27; and a further $200 if they are still in that location half an hour later 
* The tweet specifically targets Justices Kavanaugh, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Coney Barrett or Roberts 
* Twitter forbids users encouraging others to harass individuals or groups 
* Earlier this week Brett Kavanaugh was eating dinner when activists showed up at the steakhouse where he was forcing him to leave via the back door 
* Incident comes less than a month after a man was charged with turning up at his home and threatening to kill him 
A left-wing activist group is encouraging users on social media to tweet the location of any of the conservative Supreme Court Justices in exchange for money. 
The justices were the majority who voted to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision last month. 
Since then, pro-abortion activists have repeatedly protested outside the justices&#x27; homes and, in some cases, confronted them in public.

&quot;In purchasing power parity, they spend about one dollar to our 20 dollars to get to the same capability.” 
The Air Force officer responsible for all aspects of contracting for the service has issued a stark warning about China’s rapid gains in defense acquisition, with the result that its military is now getting its hands on new equipment “five to six times” faster than the United States. This is the latest sobering evidence from a U.S. defense official suggesting that the Pentagon needs to urgently overhaul the way it goes about fielding new weapons, while China increasingly appears to be jockeying for the lead in the development of all kinds of high-end military technologies as part of its broader drive to become a preeminent strategic power.

Space.com: Satellites spot construction of Russian anti-satellite laser facility: report  
Anti-satellite technologies are on the rise as space becomes an increasingly vital domain for military activities. 
Recent Google Earth images reveal construction at what appears to be a sophisticated laser system at a Russian space facility designed to blind adversary satellites. 
The construction is taking place at the Russian Ministry of Defense&#x27;s Krona space facility near Zelenchukskaya in Russia&#x27;s far southwest, home of the massive RATAN-600 radio telescope. The existence of this new complex was brought to light in an in-depth open source investigation (opens in new tab) published by The Space Review that analyzed public satellite imagery, solicitation documents from Russian industrial contractors and Russian financial documents.

Severe recruiting shortages in all branches of the service are too serious to ignore. 
Enlisted bonuses as high as $50,000 have not helped much. And the Army has met only 40 percent of its 2022 goal, so it reduced end strength by 22,000 soldiers. 
Traditional, patriotic families are the prime “market” for military recruiting. Pentagon officials and professional marketers, therefore, should objectively consider whether woke Defense Department policies have alienated that core constituency.

Americans&#x27; confidence in newspapers and television news has plummeted to an all-time low, according to the latest annual Gallup survey of trust in U.S. institutions. 
Why it matters: The erosion of trust in media is one of the most significant signs of deepening polarization in America. 
* Political party affiliation has become the primary driver of opinions about the media&#x27;s trustworthiness, as Gallup has noted. 
* A 2021 poll from Pew Research Center found that Republicans are far less likely to trust media sources that are considered &quot;mainstream.&quot;

Marking the CIA&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Biden said he had been involved with the agency for 52 of those years, first as a junior senator on a 1975 committee set up to investigate mind control experiments and other abuses by the agency.

Nearly every facet of life was disrupted. Canadians who typically work from home crowded into cafes and public libraries that still offered internet access and hovered outside hotels to catch a signal. 
Canada’s border services agency said its mobile app for incoming travelers was affected. Retailers’ cashless pay systems went down, while banks reported issues with ATM services.

The last episodes of the last season of “stranger thingswhich debuted Friday on Netflix, included several tragic send-offs.  One of the most powerful was the farewell between Millie Bobby Brown’s Eleven and her “Daddy”, the white-haired mad scientist Dr. Martin Brenner, played by Hollywood veteran Matthew Modine.
Brenner, who helped Eleven hone her telekinetic powers at the infamous Hawkins National Laboratory, was the show’s main (human) villain until he was mauled by a Demogorgon at the end of Season 1. But he made a surprise return this season, and Modine brought his unique sense of intellectual menace to the flashbacks that filled the origin stories of Eleven and the villainous Vecna ​​(Jamie Campbell B…</span>

New aerodynamic regulations were introduced at the start of the year, intended to allow cars to follow more closely and to make overtaking easier, making racing more exciting.
A side effect is porpoising, a violent up and down motion caused by airflow blockage under cars, which can also be affected by bouncing when they hit the ground repeatedly.
It was difficult for the drivers.  AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly said he feared “finding himself with a cane at 30” if changes were not made.


“It’s not healthy, that’s for sure,” he said.  “With literally no suspension it goes through your spine. Ultimately my team says we can compromise the setup or compromise my health for the performance.

The reason, he said, was an ongoing disagreement over the number of spam bot accounts on the platform.  Now, the question of what constitutes a spam bot account, and how many currently exist on Twitter, is likely to be at the heart of legal battles between Mr Musk and Twitter over the difficult settlement.
What are spambots?
Although sometimes referred to as “bots”, “spam” or “fake accounts”, all refer to inauthentic accounts that mimic the way people use Twitter.  Some spam accounts are automated, but others are managed by people, which makes them difficult to detect.

It’s the $400 Steam Deck, as utilitarian a console as that sounds.  The handheld device, a chunky black plastic slab with an integrated game controller, has the guts of a supercomputer and a touchscreen.  It’s like a gaming computer and a Nintendo Switch had a child.
Valve, the Bellevue, Wash. company known for its Steam online game store, started taking orders for the Steam Deck last year, and the consoles arrived recently.

                              <span>Dr. Joyce C. Lashof, who fought for health equity and broke down barriers as the first woman to lead a state public health department and the first to serve as dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, died June 4 in an assisted living community in Berkeley.  She was 96 years old.
His daughter, Carol Lashof, said the cause was heart failure.
Over a long and varied career, friends and family members said, Dr. Lashof has always prioritized the fight for social justice.  In the 1960s, she founded a community health center to provide medical care in a low-income Chicago neighborhood.

One hundred and forty-one days.  This is how long Griner has been in limbo.
What terrible uncertainty and fear she must feel, facing a decade in a Russian prison if convicted.  Griner captured that emotion in her recent letter to President Biden.  “I’m terrified to be here forever,” she wrote.  She added, “Please don’t forget me.”

                              <span>Former NHL general manager and scout Craig Button compared Bedard to Steve Yzerman, the Hall of Famer who captained the Detroit Red Wings to the Stanley Cup three times.  “Connor has all the skills, but what impresses me is his intensity like Stevie Y, a killer instinct,” said Button, who follows the entry draft and junior hockey for the TSN network. in Canada.
Such talk could easily turn a 16-year-old’s head, but Bedard seems to be used to it.  He’s been hearing it at least since he was 12, the first year he started skating with NHL players in their off-season practices.  “I skated with them once that summer and I was that annoying little boy there,” he said.  “When I was 14 I skated with them regularly, almost every day they had ice.”
Soon, Vancouver-based pros like Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins of Edmonton, the 2011 first overall pick, would be texting Bedard when rounding up players for practices and scrimmages.  Those sessions gave Bedard a sense of the skill and speed of NHL play, but the business side of the league, especially pre-draft interviews, stresses out a lot of talented teenagers.
Thus, Newport Sports Management, the agency representing Bedard, organized for its client interviews with three general managers of the NHL: Don Sweeney of the Boston Bruins, Kyle Davidson of the Chicago Blackhawks and Yzerman, now at the front office of the Red Wings. .
For Bedard, the most intense was a one-on-one interview with Yzerman.  “We talked for 45 minutes and he asked a lot of questions,” Bedard said.  “In the end it probably became more of a conversation than an interview. I asked him a few questions and he gave me advice on the game and the league.

                              <span>Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s lawsuit blaming China for COVID-19 was dismissed Friday when a federal judge ruled his court has no jurisdiction over foreign governments.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in a 38-page ruling, wrote that a federal law setting rules for when a sovereign foreign entity could be sued in U.S. courts doesn’t allow any part of the lawsuit filed by Schmitt in April 2020 to continue.

“All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh wrote.

Schmitt’s office filed a notice of appeal immediately after Limbaugh made his ruling.

When Schmitt filed the lawsuit, he claimed China was responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to cause a global pandemic by covering up the initial infection…</span>

&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,&quot; Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…</span>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
&quot;Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world&quot;, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France&#x27;s condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called &quot;absolutely unforgivable&quot;.
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …</span>

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
&quot;We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this,&quot; he said.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia&#x27;s largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney&#x27;s west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia&#x27;s east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
&quot;The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,&quot; state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia&#x27;s most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
&quot;We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,&quot; Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia&#x27;s annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia&#x27;s east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum.
Shouts of &quot;When will you stop the war&quot; and &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop the war&quot; were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

DW: Russia targets EU, cutting off Kazakhstan&#x27;s oil exports 
This week, Moscow halted crude oil exports from Kazakhstan via a Black Sea port. Kazakhstan is the EU&#x27;s fifth-largest supplier and this effectively reduces oil imports. 
The search is now on for alternative routes.  In a telephone conversation on July 4, Kazakhstan&#x27;s president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev assured EU Council President Charles Michel of his country&#x27;s support in helping the 27-nation bloc overcome its current energy crisis. 
Only a day later, a district court in Novorossiysk — Russia&#x27;s biggest Black Sea port — ordered a pipeline coming from Kazakhstan and exporting oil to Europe shut for a month.

NASA has issued a fierce condemnation of the Russian space agency after three cosmonauts displayed anti-Ukraine propaganda aboard the International Space Station. 
The trio were seen holding flags of the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic — two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine that are only recognised as independent states by Moscow and Syria. 
They also said the capture of the region was &#x27;a liberation day to celebrate both on Earth and in space.&#x27;

Reuters: Taiwan slams &#x27;provocative&#x27; China for sending fighters across Taiwan Strait 
TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese fighter jets crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday in what the island&#x27;s government slammed as a provocation, as a senior U.S. senator visited Taipei for a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen that China condemned. 
China claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up military and political pressure to try and force the island to accept Chinese rule. 
Taiwan&#x27;s Defence Ministry said the Chinese aircraft &quot;intentionally crossed the median line of the strait in a provocative move, which has seriously damaged regional peace and stability&quot;.

RT: Kremlin clarifies Putin’s remark on Ukraine  
Russia is using ‘only a fraction’ of its military capability in the neighboring country, spokesman said  
President Vladimir Putin’s observation that Russian troops in Ukraine “haven’t even really started anything yet” simply states that Moscow is far superior in its military strength, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified on Friday. 
On Thursday, Putin dared Western leaders who seek Russia’s defeat on the battlefield in Ukraine to deliver on the threat. “Let them try. We haven’t even really started anything yet,” he claimed. 
The president “simply reminded [his audience] that the military potentials [of Ukraine and Russia] were incommensurable,” Peskov said. 
“Russian strength is so vast that only a small fraction of it is engaged in the special military operation,” the official said.  Western expectations that Ukraine can defeat Russia militarily are “absurd and only add to the suffering of the Ukrainian people,” he added.

The US is making plans for a direct war against Russia and its ally Belarus, the head of Belarusian military intelligence warned on Thursday. The scenario is becoming more likely as the proxy war in Ukraine and other ways to hurt the two nations are failing, he claimed. 
“The territory of Poland as well as the Baltic states is being turned into a staging ground, from which the US plans to unleash a new bloody conflict in Europe, targeting the Russian Federation and its allies,” 
Major General Ruslan Kosygin said.

                              <span>Biden&#x27;s Energy Department in April announced the sale of 950,000 Strategic Petroleum Reserve barrels to Sinopec, the trading arm of the China Petrochemical Corporation. 
In 2015, a private equity firm Hunter Biden cofounded bought a $1.7 billion stake in Sinopec Marketing.

 On Wednesday, Reuters revealed that more than 5 million barrels of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves were sent overseas as part of President Joe Biden’s latest release initiated in March. 
Some of that oil went to India, some to the Netherlands, and some was sent to China where the president’s son has engaged in years of potentially criminal business activity embroiling the Biden White House in scandal since the 2020 campaign.

CNN: Biden will rescind Afghanistan’s designation as a major non-NATO ally 
CNN — President Joe Biden in a letter to Congress on Wednesday said that he will officially rescind Afghanistan’s designation as a major non‑NATO ally. 
In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the President wrote: “In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent to rescind the designation of Afghanistan as a Major Non‑NATO Ally.” 
In 2012, the United States named Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally, which cleared the way for the two countries to maintain a defense and economic relationship. Then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the designation during a visit to Kabul.

                              <span>Columbia University will not participate in the upcoming U.S. News &amp; World Report ranking of colleges across the country, after a Columbia math professor questions the accuracy of the data that secured its No. 2 spot in the influential rankings, the university announced Thursday evening.
The deadline for submitting data for the rankings is Friday, and a university spokesperson said officials needed more time to analyze the data and respond to criticisms raised by Professor Michael Thaddeus.
In a scathing 21-page review Dr Thaddeus posted on his website in February that he not only challenged the data behind the grade, but fueled debate over whether university rankings – used by millions of prospective students and their parents – are valuable or even accurate.

                              <span>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com &quot;Love Actually,&quot; asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist&#x27;s ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 &quot;Morning @snb19692,&quot; tweeted Grant. &quot;Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?&quot;
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:
