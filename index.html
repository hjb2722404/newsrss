                              <span>An IDF spokesperson has claimed Israeli troops plan to “dismantle totally” all of Hamas’ military infrastructure in Gaza. 

Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told Sky News Australia the country was involved in a war it “did not start”. 

“It started by Hamas crossing into our communities and butchering more than one thousand of our civilians,&quot; he said.  

“In response to that we are going to dismantle, totally, all of the military infrastructure in Gaza which facilitated this attack and we are going to dismantle Hamas from ever being capable of doing it again.” 

The Lieutenant’s comments follow a targeted ground raid by Israel’s military in northern Gaza on Thursday. 

A wider offensive is expected.</span>

                              <span>Since the attack carried out on Israel by Hamas on October 7, the internet has been flooded with thousands of images of the conflict and even more rumours. However, many of the videos and photos circulating are actually false. Two of these images recently went viral. The first image supposedly shows a camp for Israeli refugees illegally constructed in Palestinian territory. The second is said to show a Palestinian flag being held aloft by football fans. In reality, both of the images were generated by AI.</span>

The leaders expressed grave concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation and called for continued, safe, and unhindered access to reach those in need. While EU leaders have condemned Hamas&#x27; attack, they have struggled to present a unified message, with some emphasizing Israel&#x27;s right to self-defense and others expressing concern for Palestinian civilians.</span>

The beetle infestation has even spread to urban areas, requiring the removal of pine trees from residents&#x27; gardens.</span>

Ukrainian and British firms had reported that Ukraine had suspended use of the corridor due to a possible threat from Russian warplanes and sea mines. However, Kubrakov stated that all available routes established by the Ukrainian Navy are valid and being used by civilian vessels. The corridor was launched in August as a &quot;humanitarian corridor&quot; to bypass the de facto blockade in the Black Sea after Russia quit a U.N.-brokered deal.</span>

                              <span>CNBC: U.S. GDP grew at a 4.9% annual pace in the third quarter, better than expected 
* Gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a 4.9% annualized pace in the third quarter, ahead of the 4.7% estimate. 
* The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending. 
* While the report could give the Fed some impetus to keep policy tight, traders were still pricing in no chance of an interest rate hike when the central bank meets next week.
The U.S. economy grew even faster than expected in the third quarter, buoyed by a strong consumer in spite of higher interest rates, ongoing inflation pressures, and a variety of other domestic and global headwinds.

* Footage shows the elaborate tunnels Palestinian Islamist fighters are using 
* Heavily armed militants can be seen navigating the tunnels 
* Missiles, machine guns, ammunition and rocket propelled weapons are visible 
Chilling footage has emerged showing the elaborate tunnel systems that Hamas terrorists have been using to move weapons, hostages and stage attacks on Israel. 
The footage gives insight into the claustrophobic conditions the Palestinian Islamist fighters have been operating in. 

It shows militants using metal rods and shovels to dig the tunnels. 
Many of them appear to be quite cramped and dark with footage showing the fighters slightly slouching as they move through the tunnels guided by headtorches.

Rolling Stone: Trump Plots to Pull Out of NATO — If He Doesn’t Get His Way 
At the very least, the former president wants to put the U.S. on “standby” mode — and undermine NATO’s principle of collective defense

Donald Trump wanted to pull the United States out of NATO during his first term, but was repeatedly talked out of it by senior administration officials. 
For a possible second term in the White House, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner is already discussing how he could actually get it done, if his demands aren’t met by NATO. He and his policy-wonk allies are also gaming out how he could dramatically wind down American involvement to merely a “standby” position in NATO, in Trump’s own words.

New Delhi said in a statement that it attaches “high importance to this case” and will “take up the verdict with Qatari authorities.” 
Local media has reported that the eight men, who worked with a private company in Qatar, were arrested for spying in August 2022, but Reuters could not independently confirm the charges.

Slovakia&#x27;s new populist Prime Minister Robert Fico said Thursday that his government was stopping military aid to Ukraine, in the first Western reversal of the kind. 
 Fico told MPs that the country would &quot;no longer supply weapons to Ukraine&quot;, repeating promises made during his election campaign, but would still supply humanitarian aid to its war-torn neighbour. 
&quot;I will support zero military aid to Ukraine... An immediate halt to military operations is the best solution we have for Ukraine. The EU should change from an arms supplier to a peacemaker,&quot; he added. 
Russia immediately dismissed the impact Slovakia&#x27;s decision to halt military aid to Ukraine would have on the 20-month-old conflict.

Tel Aviv — Israel carried out an hours-long, overnight ground raid into the northern Gaza Strip, the country&#x27;s military said Thursday, as part of &quot;preparations for the next stages of the war&quot; with the Palestinian militant group Hamas. 
The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released video of the raid showing a bulldozer leveling a raised bank amid explosions and tank fire in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The timing of a long expected full-scale Israeli ground invasion remained unclear Thursday, but the consequences of Israel&#x27;s relentless airstrikes, which started immediately after Hamas&#x27; brutal terror attack on Israel, have already been catastrophic for the 2.3 million people trapped inside Gaza.

                              <span>Reuters: Biden says he has &#x27;no confidence&#x27; in Palestinian death count 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he has &quot;no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using&quot; for the death toll in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, where the health ministry says over 6,500 have been killed in Israeli attacks. 
Biden was asked at a White House press conference whether the death count, which the ministry says includes some 2,700 children, meant Israel was ignoring U.S. appeals to reduce civilian deaths in its bombardment of the coastal enclave. 
 &quot;What they say to me is I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I&#x27;m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war,&quot; Biden said.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says civilian casualties are inevitable 
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that Israel will continue to hurt “innocent civilians” in its onslaught on Gaza. 
“This is war. It is combat. It is bloody, ugly and it’s going to be messy and innocent civilians are going to be hurt going forward,” Kirby said when asked if the US thought Israel’s bombardment was a disproportionate response to the Hamas attack on southern Israel. 
“I wish I could tell you something different and wish that there wasn’t going to happen, but it is going to happen. And that doesn’t make it right, doesn’t make it dismissible,” Kirby added.

The United States needs more submarines if it is to deter China in the Indo-Pacific, particularly given the Chinese navy’s growing undersea fleet. But the question remains — can America build and maintain the number of submarines it needs?  The end of the Cold War gave rise to a balancing act within the world of U.S. naval acquisitions — how to make cuts under falling defense budgets while retaining a sufficient industrial base for the future.

The British Navy has dropped the custom of employing Chinese laundry workers on warships over fears they may spy for Beijing, according to a report. 
Hundreds of Chinese laundrymen have worked on British ships since the 1930s, but the majority were taken on from Hong Kong to wash and press sailors&#x27; uniforms and officers&#x27; white tablecloths.

Russia&#x27;s defense ministry scrambled an Su-27 fighter jet to intercept two US B-1B strategic bombers over the Baltic Sea on Tuesday afternoon in an aerial standoff as tensions continue to mount between the two nations in the wake of Putin&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 
The report from the Russian state-run news agency RIA cited a government source in the defense ministry. 

That source said that the American warplanes &#x27;performed a U-turn&#x27; after the Su-27 jet arrived at the scene.

                              <span>Reuters: Turkey&#x27;s Erdogan says Hamas is not terrorist organisation, cancels trip to Israel 
ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, in his strongest comments yet on the Gaza conflict, said on Wednesday the Palestinian militant group Hamas was not a terrorist organisation but a liberation group fighting to protect Palestinian lands. 
NATO member Turkey condemned the civilian deaths caused by Hamas&#x27;s Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel, but also urged Israeli forces to act with restraint in their response. Ankara has strongly criticised Israel&#x27;s bombardment of Gaza. 
&quot;Hamas is not a terrorist organisation, it is a liberation group, &#x27;mujahideen&#x27; waging a battle to protect its lands and people,&quot; he told lawmakers from his ruling AK Party, using an Arabic word denoting those who fight for their faith.

                              <span>BulgarianMilitary.com: 155 mm shells price is growing – $8.6 million for 1,000 units 
The head of the NATO military committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, announced the current prices of conventional artillery 155-mm ammunition, which can really just shock. Because according to him, now their price is 8000 thousand euros for one piece of ammunition. 
This “price” is much higher than the current estimates, which were formed based on the Rheinmetall contract for last year, according to which one 155-mm projectile costs 3.3 thousand euros. 
The reasons for such a gallop in the price from 2 thousand euros at the level of 2021 to four times are quite clear: the need for a huge amount of artillery ammunition against the background of their relatively small current production. That is a deficit.

China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines, according to the Pentagon&#x27;s latest report on China&#x27;s military, giving it land and sea attack options that were once the sole province of U.S. and Russian vessels.

France 24: Putin oversees Russian rehearsal of &#x27;massive retaliatory nuclear strike&#x27;

 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday oversaw ballistic missile drills remotely, the Kremlin said, hours after Russia moved to revoke its ratification of a landmark nuclear test ban treaty.   
Moscow&#x27;s defence minister Sergei Shoigu also said Russia&#x27;s forces would also be practising a &quot;massive&quot; retaliatory nuclear strike. 
The drills came 20 months into Moscow&#x27;s Ukraine offensive -- which has raised some fears of nuclear war -- and hours after Russia moved to revoke a key nuclear arms control treaty. 
&quot;Under the leadership of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armed forces, Vladimir Putin, a training exercise was conducted with the forces and equipment of ground, sea and air components of nuclear deterrent forces,&quot; the Kremlin said in a statement.

Israel has reacted angrily to comments made by the UN secretary general about the Gaza war at the Security Council.

António Guterres said on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas&#x27;s deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that it was important to recognise they &quot;did not happen in a vacuum&quot;. 
Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan accused him of &quot;justifying terrorism&quot; and demanded his immediate resignation.

On Wednesday, Mr Guterres rejected &quot;misrepresentations&quot; of his statement. 
&quot;I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council as if, as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas,&quot; he said. &quot;This is false. It was the opposite.&quot;

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military is taking new steps to protect its troops in the Middle East as concerns mount about attacks by Iran-backed groups, and it is leaving open the possibility of evacuations of military families if needed, officials tell Reuters. 
The measures include increasing U.S. military patrols, restricting access to base facilities and hiking intelligence collection, including through drone and other surveillance operations, officials say, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The U.S. military is also beefing up monitoring from guard towers on U.S. military facilities, hiking security at base access points and increasing operations to counter potential incoming drones, rockets and missiles, the officials say.

LONDON (Reuters) - A major cyber attack on a financial services payments system could lead to global losses of $3.5 trillion, with much of it not covered by insurance, commercial insurance market Lloyd&#x27;s of London said on Wednesday. 
The United States would suffer losses of $1.1 trillion over a five-year period from such an attack, which would cause widespread disruption to global business, according to a systemic risk scenario developed by Lloyd&#x27;s and the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies.

China would face $470 billion in losses and Japan $200 billion over the same period, Lloyd&#x27;s said.

Newsweek: Blasts Rock Crimea Hours After Zelensky Vows Full Fire Control Over Region 
Multiple Crimea-based Telegram channels on Tuesday reported the sounds of explosions near Sevastopol hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared his military forces would soon have full fire control capabilities over Crimea. 
Newsweek could not independently verify the source of the explosions, but Sevastopol&#x27;s governor, Mikhail Razvozhayev, confirmed that at least one blast had occurred in the region. He did not indicate if the explosion came as a result of Kyiv&#x27;s forces or from Russia&#x27;s military.

The mercenary group Redut, which operates under the control of Russia’s Defense Ministry, has started recruiting women for combat roles in the “Borz” volunteer battalion for deployment to Ukraine, according to journalists at iStories. 
Redut posted its announcement on the social network Vkontakte, offering a starting monthly salary of 222,000 rubles ($2,355). Candidates without firearm skills are being offered a month-long boot camp in Donetsk. 
Redut says compensation for battlefield injuries ranges from 1 to 3 million rubles (roughly $21,000), while death benefits reach 5 million rubles (about $53,000). Mercenaries who complete their contracts are granted the status of combat veterans.

                              <span>A year has come to be a long and treacherous road in politics, as witnessed by the turbulence of late. But Rishi Sunak has survived his first as Prime Minister. Mr Sunak will have lasted more than seven times as long as Liz Truss’s fleeting tenure when he marks his first anniversary in No 10 on Wednesday. But No 10 is eager to dispel suggestions that there will be celebrations of any kind as he faces entrenched unease among Tories, a stuttering economy and crises abroad. Mr Sunak may have steadied the ship after his predecessor’s chaotic 49-day spell as prime minister, but he remains lagging a distant second behind Labour in the polls.</span>

With more than 40% of the 5,700 reported killed in Gaza being children, the UN is calling for a ceasefire.

He is now involved in a lawsuit by the New York Attorney General, alleging that Trump and his company deceived banks and insurers by inflating his wealth.

The Pentagon has deployed Lt. Gen. James Glynn and other officers to assist Israel with the challenges of urban warfare, but they will not be on the ground if an incursion into Gaza occurs.</span>

The Islamabad High Court extended his protective bail after prosecutors from the anti-graft agency raised no objections. Sharif&#x27;s convictions remain in force, but the court has barred authorities from arresting him until Tuesday, when he is due to appear in court. His legal team plans to pursue appeals against the convictions, with the aim of overturning them.</span>

                              <span>A Montana man pleaded not guilty to federal charges of threatening to assault and murder former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Richard Lee Rogers of Yellowstone County entered the plea during his initial appearance in federal court. Rogers is charged with threats to injure and murder a member of Congress, as well as making harassing telephone calls. The threats allegedly occurred in February and were intended as retaliation for McCarthy&#x27;s actions as House speaker.</span>

The unauthorized protesters were quickly dispersed by security personnel. Unapproved public protests are banned in Egypt, and Tahrir Square is heavily monitored due to its symbolic significance.</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg: Finland Says Hong Kong-Flagged Ship Anchor Breached Pipeline 

Finnish authorities raised a ship anchor on Tuesday from the seafloor in the area where an underwater gas pipeline was damaged earlier this month, saying a Hong Kong-flagged vessel appears to have caused the incident. 
The National Bureau of Investigation displayed pictures at a news conference of what it said was a 6-ton anchor that appears to be missing one of its arms, potentially belonging to the Hong Kong-flagged vessel “Newnew Polar Bear.” 
An investigation is proceeding into whether the damage was intentional, officials told reporters in Vantaa, just outside of Helsinki.

Sweden welcomes the move, though the length of the Turkish approval process remains unclear. 
BRUSSELS — The Turkish government on Monday submitted Sweden&#x27;s NATO accession bid to the country&#x27;s parliament for ratification, ending a months-long guessing game over whether Ankara intended to postpone its approval process further.
&quot;The Protocol on Sweden&#x27;s NATO Accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey,&quot; the presidency posted on social media platform X. 
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson hailed the move. Welcome that President Erdoğan signed Sweden’s ratification protocol to NATO and submitted it to the Grand National Assembly of [Turkey]. Parliamentary procedures will now commence. We are looking forward to becoming a member of NATO,&quot; his office posted on the same platform.

In 2007, during his famous speech in Munich, the Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed to the inevitable rise of a multipolar world. 
He started out by defining the opposite state: 
   However, what is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term, at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making. 
   It is world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within.

Axios: Top Biden official: Israel-Gaza war &quot;could spiral&quot; into bigger conflict 
In a 7,000-word tour of the globe&#x27;s future, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan writes that amid Middle East peril, America needs a long-term &quot;sustained sense of confidence in our capacity to outcompete any country.&quot; 
Driving the news: &quot;In the decade ahead, U.S. officials will spend more time than they did the past 30 years talking with countries that they disagree with, often on fundamental issues,&quot; Sullivan writes in the cover story of the forthcoming issue of Foreign Affairs, shared first with Axios. 
Why it matters: &quot;The world is becoming more contested, and the United States cannot talk only with those who share its vision or values,&quot; Sullivan writes. 
 * &quot;The coming era of competition will be unlike anything experienced before.&quot;

                              <span>Washington Post: China’s top diplomat to visit D.C. amid tensions over South China Sea, Israel 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Washington this week, the State Department said Monday, the highest-level visit by a Chinese official since tensions spiked early this year after a Chinese spy balloon floated across American airspace. 
The three days of meetings, starting Thursday, are the latest sign that Beijing is laying the groundwork for a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in San Francisco next month, which would be his first trip to the United States since 2017.

WNU Editor: There is a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in San Francisco next month, a summit that a Chinese leader would usually attend. But my gut is telling me that President Xi will not attend this summit even though the media is saying otherwise .... A top Chinese diplomat will visit Washington ahead of a possible meeting between Biden and Xi (AP). Current U.S. - China relations are in the toilet, and the leadership do not want to give any credit to the Biden administration, and they certainly do not want to meet President Biden. 
But in the event that President Xi does go to the US next month, I will see this as a signal that the Chinese are seeing the entire global order unraveling, and are making this trip as a last attempt to reverse this deterioration of global relations.

USA Today: Poll: Americans overwhelmingly back aid to Israel and Ukraine but split on US role in the world

 
The debate over military aid and global leadership has opened a generation gap and a partisan divide, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk poll finds. 
Most Americans support sending additional military aid to Israel and Ukraine, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but a divide is deepening between those who see U.S. global leadership as crucial and those who want to pull back from the world to focus on problems at home instead. 
The survey found double-digit support for aid to Israel in its battle against the terrorist group Hamas, 58%-35%, and majority support for sending more aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, 51%-43%. 
Additional military aid to Taiwan, which faces a continuing threat from China, was backed by a smaller margin, 43%-39%. 
The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Oct. 17-20 by landline and cell phone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

&quot;Trump and his team are actively planning to pull the United States out of NATO — or, barring that, kneecap the collective defense provisions at the heart of the alliance,&quot; writes Rolling Stone editor-in-chief Noah Shachtman.
&quot;As this, and the damning tapes of Trump/Pratt conversation show, Donald Trump is the biggest internal threat to America&#x27;s national security we have had since the Civil War,&quot; warns political scientist Norman Ornstein of The Atlantic, pointing to the Rolling Stone piece and the revelations about Trump&#x27;s remarks to an Australian national in which he allegedly divulged U.S. nuclear submarine secrets.

	&quot;But it starts at home,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;And I&#x27;d like to ask any Democrat senator here that would like to speak to Rashida Tlaib. She still has a tweet up condemning Israel for a hospital attack.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

	&quot;We are here together, not to talk about the problems at home, which are many,&quot; Graham shot back.

Sources tell Rolling Stone that Trump is planning to pull the United States entirely out of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance unless it caves to his demands that include one that would seem to undermine the entire purpose of the alliance.
In addition to his standard calls for other NATO countries to chip in more for their defense spending, Trump also reportedly wants to rip up the strategic doctrine that an attack on one NATO country represents an attack on all NATO countries.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
&quot;When he was in office, Trump would repeatedly scoff at this collective-defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, known as Article 5,&quot; the publication writes. &quot;One former senior administration official recalls to Rolling Stone a moment in the Oval Office in mid-2018 when the then-president started reading from a written list of smaller NATO countries, some of which he argued most Americans had never even heard of before.&quot;
Tearing up Article 5 would be a major boon for the likes of Russia, which attacked non-NATO member Ukraine in 2022 but notably has not attacked other NATO members on its border such as Estonia and Latvia.
Dr. Aaron Stein, a Black Sea Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, tells Rolling Stone that Trump&#x27;s plan would be a &quot;tremendously stupid endeavor&quot; and added that &quot;trading away allies based on ignorance, and Trump is ignorant about this issue, is just silly for broader U.S. national security.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The United States warned Iran or its allies against any &quot;escalation&quot; in the wake of Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas, two top US officials said Sunday, hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region.
With tensions mounting, Washington also announced Sunday it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq.
&quot;We are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks against our own personnel, our own people,&quot; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS News. &quot;We expect there is a likelihood of escalation.&quot;
&quot;No one should take advantage of this moment to escalate to further attacks on Israel or, for that matter, attacks on us on our personnel.&quot;

                              <span>The organiser of the Web Summit, one of the tech sector&#x27;s leading events, announced his resignation Saturday following a backlash over his online posts following the Hamas attacks on Israel.
&quot;Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event,&quot; Paddy Cosgrave of Ireland explained in a brief statement sent to AFP.
&quot;I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused,&quot; added the co-founder of the tech mega gathering created in 2009 in Dublin but held in Lisbon since 2016.
A spokesperson for the organization said: &quot;Web Summit will appoint a new CEO as soon as possible, and Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon will go ahead as planned.&quot;
This year&#x27;s edition from November 13 to 16, is set to bring together some 2,300 startups and more than 70,000 participants, say organizers.
Several companies, including tech giants Google and Meta, which is behind Facebook and Instagram, as well as event headliners have announced they are boycotting the gathering since Cosgrave&#x27;s remarks.
He had written on X, formerly Twitter, that he was &quot;shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders &amp; governments&quot; in support of Israel.
&quot;War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are,&quot; he wrote on October 13.
Since shock Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, which left 1,400 dead, Israel has launched devastating air and ground bombardments of Gaza. The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.
The boycott by Meta and Google followed other exits by companies and tech figures, including Intel, Siemens and US comedian Amy Poehler and X-Files actor Gillian Anderson.</span>

Two by-election losses to the main opposition Labour Party on Thursday underscored how Sunak, 43, has failed to revive the Conservatives&#x27; beleaguered fortunes during his first 12 months in charge.
&quot;The more people see of Sunak, the less they like him in some ways,&quot; Tim Bale, author of a book about the right-wing Conservatives since Brexit, told AFP.
&quot;He doesn&#x27;t really project authority, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily give the impression that he&#x27;s in control of events.
&quot;He looks, in part, as if he&#x27;s sort of lurching from one policy initiative to another in a desperate attempt to curry …</span>

Simmering racial divisions were exposed earlier this month when just over 60 percent of Australians voted against a referendum to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders within the 1901 constitution.
In the wake of the result, many Indigenous leaders embarked on a &quot;week of silence&quot;, asking for time to grieve what they saw as a crushing rejection at the hands of Australia&#x27;s white majority.
Some leaders ended that silence in a scathing open letter addressed to the government, criticizing the &quot;appalling and mean-spirited&quot; outlook of milli…</span>

                              <span>A teenage Iranian girl, who fell into a coma earlier this month following an alleged encounter with officers over violating the country’s hijab law, is said to be &quot;brain dead&quot;, Iranian state media reported on Sunday.
&quot;Follow-ups on the latest health condition of Armita Geravand indicate that her health condition as brain dead seems certain despite the efforts of the medical staff,&quot; the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said.
Iranian authorities have denied claims by rights groups that the 16-year-old was hurt after a confrontation on Oct. 1 with officers enforcing the mandatory Islamic dress code in the Tehran metro.

The report on Geravand could revive nationwide protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini last year in the custody of morality police.

                              <span>Hurricane Norma slammed into Mexico&#x27;s northwestern coast Saturday afternoon as a Category 1 storm, bringing dangerous rain and flooding, authorities said.
The storm came ashore about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of the resort city of Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California coast, gradually weakening from a Category 3 as it approached land.
Norma was moving northeast at 9 kph, packing winds of up to 130 kph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported at 2100 GMT. 
Norma was expected to bring rainfall of up to 45 centimeters (18 inches), producing &quot;flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain,&quot; the NHC said.
&quot;Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions&quot; would affect the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for the next couple of days.
Hotel employees in Cabo San Lucas urged guests to stay indoors until authorities give the all-clear, Gustavo Matamoros, a hotel worker, told AFP.
Local authorities say about 60,000 tourists are staying in the area, most of them international visitors.
Footage from Milenio TV showed flooded streets as Norma arrived. No casualties have been reported by authorities.
Norma should continue to weaken to a tropical storm as it moves toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday.
Two people died last week when Hurricane Lidia struck the western states of Jalisco and Nayarit.

Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a &quot;favor&quot; for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do,&quot; admitting not only to the bribery but also that it&#x27;s frequent behavior for him. 

&quot;It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings,&quot; The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

                              <span>New court documents reviewed by the New York Times reveal Donald Trump&#x27;s Australian pal, Anthony Pratt, told a lot of people about life at Mar-a-Lago post-presidency. Among the things he said, involved trashing Trump behind his back. 
Pratt, the Australian billionaire that Trump revealed classified information to, told around 45 people about the classified info as well as a number of things about his presidential pal.  
Not only did Trump tell his wife, Melania, to strut around the property in a bikini, but Pratt paid Trump tens of thousands of overages for ticket prices for events at the country club.

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?be allowed to run for office?


	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	&quot;And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that&#x27;s beyond the pale, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; the ABC host asked.


	&quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost,&quot; Scott opined.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
