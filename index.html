Sunak stated that the UK remains committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 but believes in a more proportionate approach. The decision comes amid concerns that the country&#x27;s climate action is progressing slowly, and as world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss climate issues.</span>

The cause of the explosion is still unclear, but it is suspected to be either a mine or an explosion in the engine room. The crew of 12 was safely evacuated by the Romanian Agency for Saving Life at Sea. The Romanian naval forces have deployed a vessel to search for mines in the area.

The advanced tank has been under development and undergoing trials over the last half decade. In a joint statement from Israel’s Ministry of Defense and the IDF, it was presented as a key to the future of the IDF, incorporating the latest sensors, artificial intelligence, networking and active protection system — technological, rather than structural advancements.

Moscow Times: Moscow’s Last European Neighbor to Ban Russian Cars 
Norway will be the last European nation that borders Russia to ban Russian-registered vehicles amid an uproar over an EU directive on import restrictions. 
Over the past week, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland have implemented bans on passenger vehicles with Russian license plates. 
“Norway will introduce restrictions on importing and using Russian-registered cars in Norway,” Eivind Vad Petersson, Norway’s Foreign Ministry state secretary, said Tuesday.

A top NATO official warned that rising ammunition prices could mean that Western countries do not spend enough on the military to sufficiently arm Ukraine. Washington and its allies have pledged nearly $100 billion in weapons to Kiev since the Russian invasion last year. 
On Saturday, the chair of NATO’s military committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer said alliance members need to spend more on defense to account for the rising prices. “Prices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up. Right now, we are paying more and more for exactly the same,” he said. “That means that we cannot make sure that the increased defense spending actually leads to more security.”

Since that NYT publication a number of military blogs and main stream news stories have been reporting on the high cost of armaments, including the above post from the Libertarian Institute. No one is saying &quot;war profiting&quot;, but this is &quot;war profiting&quot;.

The weapon’s payload of metal fragments struck a market, piercing windows and walls and wounding some victims beyond recognition. 
Less than two hours later, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russian “terrorists” for the attack, and many media outlets followed suit. Throughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly and systematically attacked civilians and struck schools, markets and residences as a deliberate tactic to instill fear in the populace.

PIndia: &quot;“Ukraine is like a drowning man, it can drag us into the depths”: Polish President Andrzej Duda

 

The Polish President asserted that it has to first protect its own interest otherwise if Ukraine (drowning man) causes harm to it, they would not be able to help it. 
On Tuesday (19 September), Polish President Andrzej Duda likened Ukraine to a drowning man while defending his government’s decision to impose a grain embargo on Ukrainian agricultural products. 
During a media briefing outside the UN headquarters in New York, he targeted Ukraine for going against them at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and challenging their decision to ban grain imports from Kyiv.

Azerbaijan on Wednesday announced it had ended its military operation in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, after separatist Armenian forces agreed to lay down their arms and hold reintegration talks. 
Baku and the ethnic Armenian authorities in Karabakh said a ceasefire deal had been brokered by Russian peacekeepers to stop the fighting a day after Azerbaijan launched an &quot;anti-terrorist operation.&quot; 
The separatists said they had committed to a &quot;full dismantlement&quot; of their forces and the withdrawal of Armenian army units from the region, at the centre of two wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

A U.S. Government Accountability Office report found that the Pentagon&#x27;s assessments of conditions at barracks &quot;are unreliable&quot; and &quot;observed barracks that pose potentially serious health and safety risks – such as broken windows and inoperable fire systems – and that do not meet minimum [U.S. Department of Defense] standards for privacy and configuration.&quot;

                              <span>The Atlantic: Ukraine Isn’t the Reason the U.S. Is Unprepared for War 
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the United States has provided Kyiv with more than $43 billion worth of security assistance. Opponents of aid to Ukraine have argued that the United States is drawing down inventories of systems and ammunition that are already in short supply for its own forces, and which would be needed in any high-intensity conflict. 
Our country could very well lose a large-scale war for lack of weapons and ammunition—but not because of aid to Ukraine. In a major conflict, the U.S. would run out of munitions in a few weeks, and in less than a week for some crucial categories. The quantity of weapons we are providing Ukraine is marginal compared with necessary weapons that we have not stocked. As Mackenzie Eaglen of the American Enterprise Institute has argued, “Over the past nine fiscal years, budget after budget has traded away combat power, truncated needed weapons early, and permanently closed production lines.”

Foreign Policy: China’s Defense Budget Is Much Bigger Than It Looks

 
The actual number could be more than double the current Western estimate. 
U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan recently revealed that U.S. government estimates put the Chinese annual defense budget at around $700 billion. That is far higher than previous estimates and almost on par with the United States’ 2023 defense budget of just over $800 billion. 
Sullivan’s number stands in stark contrast to other estimates of Chinese defense spending. One of the most respected independent sources of defense data, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, pegs China’s military budget for 2022 at only about $290 billion. The new, much higher number also completely contradicts the widespread assertion that U.S. defense spending is so lavish that it amounts to more than that of the next 10 countries put together.

Warzone/The Drive: Alarming Navy Intel Slide Warns Of China’s 200 Times Greater Shipbuilding Capacity

 
The Office of Naval Intelligence is sounding the alarm about the huge gap in U.S. and Chinese shipbuilding capacity and its implications.  
A U.S. Navy briefing slide is calling new attention to the worrisome disparity between Chinese and U.S. capacity to build new naval vessels and total naval force sizes. The data compiled by the Office of Naval Intelligence says that a growing gap in fleet sizes is being helped by China&#x27;s shipbuilders being more than 200 times more capable of producing surface warships and submarines. This underscores longstanding concerns about the U.S. Navy&#x27;s ability to challenge Chinese fleets, as well as sustain its forces afloat, in any future high-end conflict. 
In a statement to The War Zone, the U.S. Navy has confirmed the authenticity of the slide, seen in full below, which has been circulating online.

Wang Yi and Sergey Lavrov say they share a commitment to a ‘multipolar world’ in their discussion in Moscow. 
China’s foreign minister has held talks with his Russian counterpart in Moscow as the two countries inch closer amid fraying ties with the West over the Ukraine war and the militarisation of the Pacific. 
Wang Yi opened his talks with Sergey Lavrov by hailing “strategic cooperation” between the two countries and their shared commitment to a “multipolar world” and a “more just world order”.

Acting Marines Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith today issued a two-day stand down for all Marine aviation units, following a six-week stretch that saw two fatal accidents followed by a 24-hour jet-hunt for a missing stealth fighter. 
In a press release, the Marine Corps said that with “three Class-A aviation mishaps over the last six weeks,” Smith “directed all Marine Corps aviation units to conduct a two-day pause in operations this week to discuss aviation safety matters and best practices.

Zero Hedge: Milley &amp; Stoltenberg Agree: &#x27;We Must Prepare Ourselves For A Long War In Ukraine&#x27; 
Two top Western officials have just said that NATO is preparing to settle in for a &quot;long war&quot; in Ukraine, as the prospect for peace negotiations retreats further and further on the horizon. 
 First, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in an interview published Sunday by Germany&#x27;s Funke Media Group said the alliance is committed to seeing military support to Kiev through, and that this is the only way to achieve peace. &quot;Most wars last longer than expected when they first begin. Therefore, we must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,&quot; he said, and added: &quot;We must recognize that if Zelensky and the Ukrainians stop fighting, their country will no longer exist. If President Putin and Russia stop fighting, we will have peace.&quot;

* Qin Gang was China&#x27;s top diplomat until July, when he was abruptly fired 
* He has not been seen in public for over a month 
* CCP investigators reportedly told officials he fathered a baby in the US during an extramarital affair 
China&#x27;s former top envoy to Washington was abruptly ousted from his post as minister for foreign affairs after an internal Communist Party investigation found he had fathered a child during an extramarital affair in the US. 
Qin Gang, 57, disappeared from public view in July and was stripped of his title as foreign minister without explanation. 

But senior party officials were told the former envoy to the United States was removed from his prestigious post as minister of foreign affairs for &#x27;lifestyle reasons&#x27;, a euphemism for sexual misconduct, after CCP investigators found he had fathered a child with his mistress in the US.

                              <span>Politico: Azerbaijan launches attack in Nagorno-Karabakh, announces ‘evacuation’ of Armenian population 
The escalation follows weeks of bloody clashes and comes three years after a full-scale war with Armenia over the Caucasus region. 
Azerbaijan has announced a major new military offensive in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, declaring an “evacuation” of ethnic Armenians in “the dangerous area” and opening up a crisis that risks spiralling into all-out war. 
The escalation comes after months of fruitless negotiations and amid growing speculation that Turkey-backed Azerbaijan has been gearing up to use force to bring a decades-long frozen conflict to an end. A war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020 killed thousands on each side. Over the past months, Azerbaijan has been tightening a supply blockade of food and medicines into the ethnic Armenian enclave that lies entirely within its territory.

KYIV, Ukraine — Two weeks after replacing its defense minister, Ukraine dismissed all six of its deputy ministers Monday, deepening the housecleaning at a ministry that had drawn criticism for corruption in procurement as the military budget ballooned during the war.

Henry told politicians at the Union of B.C.

                              <span>Canada&#x27;s government has expelled a top Indian diplomat.

The expelled diplomat was the head of the Indian Intelligence in Canada.

The expulsion came after claims India’s government was involved in the killing of a Canadian Sikh leader.

It comes after Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed credible allegations of a potential link between India and the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June.

Nijjar had been branded a terrorist by Indian media for his advocacy to form an independent Sikh homeland.</span>

Authorities have reported the destruction of nearly a thousand buildings.

The desperate search for survivors continues as international aid enters the country.

The city has been overwhelmed with the scale of the disaster and rescue volunteers are struggling to help every family with missing relatives.

There was very little specialised equipment and few skilled rescuers on the ground in the crucial first few days.</span>

His comments come after the Biden administration unfroze Iranian funds and released five Iranian prisoners in exchange for five American prisoners.

“It’s tough – it really is,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia.

“It is rewarding terrorism, it is paying ransom, it is going to encourage additional action like this in the future.

“It’s just a real difficult situation when innocent Americans are being held by governments overseas.”</span>

“Consultations between the SVR and the CIA are of a rare but regular nature,” Naryshkin said, when asked if a direct communication link between the two intelligence services still exists and whether it could be “used again.”

She had gotten divorced the year before and left the house in a small town in Holguín, in eastern Cuba, where she had lived with René Ferias, her husband of 22 years. 
A few days later, at dawn on Jan. 26, Ferias attacked her with a machete and killed her. “Imagine seeing your daughter hacked to pieces by a nasty man, who had not even been her husband for over a year, because he found out that she had another relationship,” said her mother, Nancy Alberteris.</span>

The paint spread to the Pariser Platz, the square at the foot of the monument, with bright footprints extending along the roadway.
Fourteen people were arrested at the site, police told AFP, without any indication of acts of violence.
The demonstrators wanted to send the message that it is &quot;time for political change&quot; in order to &quot;move away from fossil fuels&quot;, according to the statement.
&quot;We must get out of petrol, gas and coal no later than 2030. It is high time that (German Chancellor) Olaf Scholz speaks clearly,&quot; Last Generation spokesperson Marion Fabian said in the statement.

Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the West&#x27;s scramble to arm Ukrainian homeland defenders have been a bonanza for arms-makers.

                              <span>Tens of thousands of Swedes thronged central Stockholm on Saturday to mark 50 years since King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the throne.
To the sound of military bands and under a sunny sky, the 77-year-old monarch, clad in a sober suit and tie, enjoyed the public acclaim along with Queen Silvia, 79, wearing a canary yellow ensemble, as six horses led the royal procession.
The crowd broke into applause as they passed and waved Swedish flags to mark the milestone for Carl Gustaf, who was the world&#x27;s youngest monarch when he was crowned aged 27 in September 1973 after the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf.
The king is the longest reigning monarch in Sweden&#x27;s history and also the European monarch with the second-longest reign, behind his cousin Queen Margrethe of Denmark who took the throne…</span>

The plane ran out of landing strip and crashed, killing all 12 passengers and two crew, he said.
Initial investigations indicated the passengers were all Brazilian men traveling to the region for sport fishing, the state government said in a statement.

The Jazlah plant in Jubail city applies the latest technological advances in a country that first turned to desalination more than a century ago, when Ottoman-era administrators enlisted filtration machines for hajj pilgrims menaced by drought and cholera.
Lacking lakes, rivers and regular rainfall, Saudi Arabia today relies instead on dozens of facilities that transform water from the Gulf and Red Sea into something potable, supplying cities and towns that otherwise would not survive.
But the kingdom&#x27;s growing desalination needs –- fueled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s dreams of …</span>

At a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a visit to the island, Giorgia Meloni said the bloc needed to work together to face the challenges of uncontrolled migration. 
It is &quot;the future that Europe wants for itself that is at stake here, because the future of Europe depends on Europe&#x27;s capacity to face major challenges,&quot; Meloni said.
Between Monday and Wednesday, around 8,500 people -- more than the island&#x27;s entire local population -- arrived in 199 boats, according to the UN migration agency.

                              <span>BRASILIA (Reuters) - On his first trip to Cuba during his third term in office, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called the embargo imposed by the United States on the island &quot;illegal&quot; and denounced the island&#x27;s inclusion on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Former U.S. President Donald Trump included the island nation on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and though the Biden administration has reversed other Trump-era measures, it has so far not removed Cuba from the list. &quot;Cuba has been an advocate of fairer global governance.

                              <span>The impeachment inquiry into president Joe Biden is less like the Donald Trump impeachments and more like today&#x27;s version of the Benghazi hearings, according to an Atlantic writer.
Kevin McCarthy recently announced an impeachment inquiry into Biden, which was cheered by right-wingers who sought to score political points or churn up more evidence. Some on the Republican side have cautioned away from jumping into the impeachment, seeking to prevent going into a political process without evidence of any presidential wrongdoing. 
Atlantic staff writer David A. Graham pointed out how similar this process is to the Benghazi scandal that helped to tank Hillary Clinton&#x27;s poll numbers.

                              <span>Comedian and YouTube personality Russell Brand is pushing back at new accusations that he sexually assaulted three women and a teenager according to the BBC.
The sexual assault report was &quot;part of a joint investigation by the Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches,&quot; with the BBC reporting, &quot;Four women are alleging sexual assaults between 2006 and 2013 ... At the time of the alleged assaults, Brand was a presenter for BBC Radio 2, Channel 4, and an actor in Hollywood films. Other claims made as part of the investigation include allegations about Brand&#x27;s controlling, abusive and predatory behaviour.&quot;
Late Friday night, Brand took to his social media platforms to defend himself, claiming his liaisons were all &quot;consensual.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

The BBC reported that Brand claimed, &quot;Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.&quot;
He continued, &quot;These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I&#x27;ve written about extensively in my books I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual.&quot;
ALSO IN THE NEWS: &#x27;He’s probably guilty, but it doesn’t matter&#x27;: Trump fans aren&#x27;t scared off by 4 criminal indictments

The report adds Brand added he believes he&#x27;s the victim of as a &quot;co-ordinated attack&quot; and will be looking into the &quot;very, very serious&quot; allegations.

Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, died a few days after her arrest by religious police for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women in force since shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Her family says she died from a blow to the head but this is disputed by Iranian authorities.
Anger over her death rapidly expanded into weeks of taboo-breaking protests which saw women tearing off their mandatory headscarves in an open challenge to the Islamic republic&#x27;s system of government under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

                              <span>A Belgian court on Friday handed out sentences ranging up to life in prison to eight men for the 2016 jihadist bombings in Brussels, ending the country&#x27;s largest-ever criminal trial.
The suicide bombings on March 22, 2016 at Brussels&#x27; main airport and on the metro system killed 32 people and were claimed by the Islamic State group.
French citizen Salah Abdeslam and Belgian-Moroccan Mohamed Abrini – already sentenced to life in jail by France for a 2015 massacre in Paris – were the highest-profile of six culprits found guilty of murder in July.
Abrini, who was one of the intended bombers but decided not to blow himself up at the last moment, was given a 30-year jail term.
The court ruled not to give Abdeslam an additional term after he was sentenced in Belgium to 20 years in 2018 over a shootout.
The attacks – near the headquarters of both NATO and the EU – were part of a wave of attacks claimed by the Islamic State group in Europe.
Hundreds of travelers and transport staff were maimed and seven years on, many victims, relatives and rescuers remain traumatized.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez, also known as &quot;El Raton&quot; or &quot;The Mouse,&quot; was indicted earlier this year on drug trafficking charges linked to the fentanyl crisis plaguing the United States.
His father was convicted in 2019 of running what was believed to be the world&#x27;s biggest narcotics syndicate and is serving life in a supermax prison in the state of Colorado.
Garland hailed the extradition as &quot;the most recent step in the Justice Department&#x27;s effort to attack every aspect of the cartel&#x27;s operations.&quot;

                              <span>President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France&#x27;s envoy to Niger is living like a hostage in the French embassy and accused military rulers of blocking food deliveries to the mission.
The ambassador is living off &quot;military rations&quot;, Macron told reporters in the eastern town of Semur-en-Auxois.
&quot;As we speak, we have an ambassador and diplomatic staff who are literally being held hostage in the French embassy,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are preventing food deliveries,&quot; he said, in an apparent reference to Niger&#x27;s new military rulers. &quot;He is eating military rations.&quot;
Niger&#x27;s military leaders told French ambassador Sylvain Itte he had to leave the country after they overthrew President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
But a 48-hour ultimatum for him to leave, issued in August, passed with him still in place as the French government refused to comply, or to recognise the military regime as legitimate.
The coup has been condemned by France and most of Niger&#x27;s neighbors.
Macron said the envoy &quot;cannot go out, he is persona non grata and he is being refused food&quot;.
Asked whether France would consider bringing him home, Macron said: &quot;I will do whatever we agree with President Bazoum because he is the legitimate authority and I speak with him every day.&quot;
France keeps about 1,500 soldiers in Niger, and said earlier this month that any redeployment could only be negotiated with Bazoum.
The country&#x27;s new leaders have torn up military cooperation agreements with France and asked the troops to leave quickly.
Macron has for weeks rejected the call to remove the French ambassador, a stance backed by the EU which has described the demand as &quot;a provocation&quot;.
Like France, said EU foreign affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali last month, the EU &quot;does not recognize&quot; the authorities that seized power in Niger.
The impoverished Sahel region south of the Sahara, has suffered what Macron has called an &quot;epidemic&quot; of coups in recent years, with military regimes replacing elected governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea as well as Niger.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
