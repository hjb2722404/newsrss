                              <span>A new commemorative coin celebrating the King’s 75th birthday and paying tribute to his passion for the natural world has been unveiled by the Royal Mint. To mark the occasion, the Mint is looking for 75 people turning 75 years old this year, to give them a special £5 coin, in honour of the King’s birthday. To honour the King’s lifelong commitment to sustainability, a special birthday coin has also been made from a blend of silver recovered from industrial and medical x-ray films. Those celebrating their 75th birthday in 2023 can submit their name and contact details via the Royal Mint to be in with a chance of receiving an uncirculated £5 commemorative coin. The winners will be drawn at random and asked to provide photographic evidence of age. They will be contacted via email from early December 2023.</span>

                              <span>Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has gained a considerable amount of ground over Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, according to the latest Newspoll.

In the first major poll since the Voice referendum was defeated, the Coalition now leads Labor on the primary vote.

The poll reports the primary vote for the Coalition is at 37 per cent whilst Labor trails behind now at 35 per cent.

On two-party preferred voting the Coalition has also tightened the gap at 48 per cent, coming in close to Labor’s 52 per cent.

This latest data has marked the closest contest since the election.</span>

                              <span>Massive explosions are hitting Gaza City and its surroundings as Israel continues on with its deadliest campaign to destroy Hamas following the terrorist group&#x27;s unprovoked attack on October 7.

The IDF on Sunday said its troops were “encircling Gaza city” and conducting “widespread strikes”.

Health officials in the Palestinian territory claimed 53 people died in two blasts at refugee camps.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his rejection for a ceasefire on Sunday until the some 240 hostages taken by Hamas on October 7 are released.

&quot;There will be no ceasefire without the return of the hostages. This should be completely removed from the lexicon,&quot; Mr Netanyahu said.

&quot;We say this to our friends and to our enemies. We will simply continue until we defeat them. We have no alternative.&quot;</span>

Reuters: Pro-Palestinian crowds try to storm air base housing U.S. troops in Turkey 
ADANA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish police used tear gas and water cannon as hundreds of people at a pro-Palestinian rally on Sunday tried to storm an air base that houses U.S. troops, hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due in Ankara for talks on Gaza. 
Turkey, which has stepped up its criticism of Israel as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened, supports a two-state solution while hosting members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Since the Israel-Hamas war started, protests have erupted across the country. 
Earlier this week, the IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation, an Islamist Turkish aid agency, organised a convoy to travel to the Incirlik air base in the Adana province in southern Turkey to protest Israeli attacks on Gaza and U.S. support for Israel.

Reynolds will appear at a DeSantis rally in Iowa on Monday. DeSantis has focused heavily on Iowa, believing a strong showing in the state could help him close the gap with Trump.

                              <span>The Israeli army said Sunday its land assault on the Gaza Strip had split the Palestinian territory in two, with &quot;significant&quot; strikes continuing in its war against Hamas. Israeli airstrikes hit two refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip on Sunday, killing at least 45 people, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. The strikes came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his Middle-eastern tour with an unannounced visit to Iraq, as Washington tries to prevent a regional spillover. Tensions increased with neighbouring Lebanon as an Israeli strike in the south of the country killed three children and their grandmother, Lebanese authorities said.

                              <span>More than 20 people were killed in Sudan after shells hit a market in a suburb of the capital, Khartoum. The fighting between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo has been ongoing since April. The conflict has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and 5.5 million people being displaced, according to estimates by the United Nations. The actual toll is believed to be higher as many of the wounded and killed do not reach hospitals or morgues.</span>

The US Supreme Court revoked the national right to abortion last year, leaving it up to individual states to decide. Ohio currently has a law that would ban abortions after a heartbeat is detected, but it is temporarily suspended due to legal challenges.</span>

It was a striking public rebuke that signaled an emerging rift between the military and civilian leadership at a challenging time for Ukraine. The public censure of Zaluzhny came a day after the president&#x27;s office replaced one of his deputies, the head of special operations forces, who after his firing said he had been blindsided by the dismissal.</span>

                              <span>PM Netanyahu disciplined on Sunday a junior member of his cabinet who appeared to voice openness to the idea of Israel carrying out a nuclear strike on Gaza. Netanyahu&#x27;s office said in a statement that the minister concerned - heritage minister Amihay Eliyahu from a far-right party in the coalition government - had been suspended from cabinet meetings &quot;until further notice&quot;.  &quot;Eliyahu&#x27;s statements are not based in reality. Israel and the IDF (military) are operating in accordance with the highest standards of international law,&quot; Netanyahu&#x27;s office said.</span>

                              <span>Protesters gathered outside the residence of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to express their anger at the failures that led to last month&#x27;s deadly attack by Hamas gunmen. The protest coincided with a poll showing that over three-quarters of Israelis believe Netanyahu should resign. Netanyahu has not taken personal responsibility for the failures that allowed the surprise assault, which has led to growing public fury and criticism of the government&#x27;s response. A majority of Israelis blame Netanyahu for the attack, according to the poll.</span>

The man, who had driven his vehicle through the gates with his 4-year-old daughter inside, was arrested and the girl is unharmed. The airport had been closed since Saturday night when the armed man broke through a gate and fired shots. The man&#x27;s wife had previously reported a child abduction, and it is believed to be a custody battle. No one was injured during the standoff.</span>

Voters have doubts about Biden&#x27;s age and are dissatisfied with his handling of the economy and other issues.

The polls also show that voters across income levels feel Biden&#x27;s policies have hurt them personally, while they credit Trump&#x27;s policies for helping them.</span>

Another Palestinian was killed in Nuba during clashes with Israeli soldiers.

DNYUZ/New York Times: A Secret War, Strange New Wounds, and Silence From the Pentagon 
When Javier Ortiz came home from a secret mission in Syria, the ghost of a dead girl appeared to him in his kitchen. She was pale and covered in chalky dust, as if hit by an explosion, and her eyes stared at him with a glare as dark and heavy as oil. 
The 21-year-old Marine was part of an artillery gun crew that fought against the Islamic State, and he knew that his unit’s huge cannons had killed hundreds of enemy fighters. The ghost, he was sure, was their revenge. 
A shiver went through him. He backed into another room in his apartment near Camp Pendleton in California and flicked on the lights, certain that he was imagining things. She was still there.

 WNU Editor: This story hits close to home. My father commanded artillery units for the Soviet Army during the Second World War. Aside from suffering hearing loss, he was haunted by nightmares from that war for the rest of his life. My father&#x27;s best friend (and my Godfather) also served in such a unit, and he committed suicide 20 years after the war. Everyone blamed his war experience for his suicide.</span>

Anticipating a more robust financial year ahead, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has forecasted a 2.8 percent expansion in Russia’s GDP in 2023, a significant bounce-back from a 2 percent contraction experienced in the previous year. Siluanov attributes this hopeful outlook to full compensation for last year’s decrease and the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. 
Rebound from Economic Contraction 
The predicted growth in Russia’s economy marks a recovery from the challenging economic climate of 2022 when the nation grappled with a 2 percent economic decline. Siluanov, however, projects a promising 2.8 to 3 percent expansion in the upcoming year, viewing it as a reparation for the previous year’s downturn.

Update #1: Russia&#x27;s economic situation develops steadily – Putin (TASS)
 
Update #2: Russia brings back capital controls to shore up the ruble (CNN)

 
WNU Editor: The Western media likes to focus on the rise and fall and rise of the Russian ruble, but the Russian economy is more than just that. So here is my recap. The civilian economy is booming and it is causing problems (inflation, labor shortages, etc.). And as for that part of the economy that is dedicated to military production .... I cannot even express in words on how huge of an impact that is having on the economy as a whole. 
But the big story on the Russia economy that many in the West have not caught up on is the Kremlin&#x27;s priority to re-industrialize the country. I know the money is there to make it happen,  but the big problem that I see will be having the workers to make this all happen. 
Update #3: The Duran&#x27;s analysis on the Russian economy (see below) concurs with what I know is happening in Russia.</span>

AFP: &#x27;We&#x27;re losing&#x27;: Ukrainians reel from war chief&#x27;s stalemate warning 
In eastern Ukraine, where another gruelling winter is descending -- along with it a likely freeze in major frontline movements -- one Ukrainian soldier had a grim assessment of the conflict. 
The 35-year-old fighting near the war-battered town of Bakhmut went further than comments from Ukraine&#x27;s most senior military official, who conceded this week that the war with Russia had reached a stalemate. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve been saying that for some time now already. Step by step we&#x27;re losing the war,&quot; the serviceman, who uses the call sign &quot;Mudryi&quot; (Wise), told AFP. 
&quot;The longer this static war continues, the worse it is for us,&quot; he said in a phone interview.

WNU Editor: The above AFP news report is a sober read and confirms what I have been hearing. The failure of the counter-offensive to break the Russian lines coupled with tens of thousands of casualties has stunned everyone I know in Ukraine. They expected at least some advances. They certainly never expected a stalemate nor Russian advances in the northeastern part of the country.</span>

Kyiv Post: Zelensky’s Office Issues Warning After Zaluzhny’s ‘Stalemate’ Interview 
President Zelensky&#x27;s deputy chief-of-staff suggested that military officials should perhaps keep quiet about the situation on the front lines, lest they give the Russians an advantage.
Ihor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of the President&#x27;s Office, has advised military officials against publicly disclosing sensitive information about the situation at the front lines. 
Zhovkva&#x27;s comments came in response to an interview with Valery Zaluzhny, the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for The Economist. The interview also contained a link to a lengthy essay by Zaluzhny replete with military assessments. 
The deputy chief-of-staff suggested that by making comments &quot;we make it easier for the aggressor to work.&quot;

A Russian nuclear-powered submarine has conducted a ballistic missile test, with the projectile traveling several thousand kilometers from the northern to the easternmost part of the country, the Defense Ministry has said.
In a statement in the early hours of Sunday, the ministry said that the submarine ‘Emperor Alexander III’ had “successfully launched the Bulava sea-based intercontinental ballistic missile from the White Sea to the Kura test range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.” It added that the missile was fired underwater and that its warheads reached the target on time.

Military.com: The Army Suddenly, and Chaotically, Told Hundreds of Soldiers They Have to Be Recruiters Immediately 
 Without warning, hundreds of noncommissioned officers were ordered via email to report to the recruiting school at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in less than a week, with hundreds more set to start at the school in December -- a sudden unexpected move by the Army as the service scrambles to boost its recruiting force by 800 by the end of the year. 
The orders came after a breakdown in how the Army tracks how many recruiters it has coming through the pipeline along with retention of existing ones, according to Lt. Gen. Douglas Stitt, the Army&#x27;s top personnel officer. 
The sudden depletion of recruiters caught Army planners flat-footed, with officials unable to provide a clear explanation as to what went wrong. Now, NCOs will likely have to move during the holiday season and in the middle of the school year, sowing chaos for families.

Bulgarian Military: Trucks brought two dismantled F-16s to Ukraine from Poland – Rybar 
Rybar, a Russian think tank, asserts that two disassembled F-16s were transported into Ukraine from Poland on the night of November 3. 
The organization further reports that since the beginning of November, there has been an influx of no less than five dismantled F-16s into Ukrainian territories, inclusive of the two aforementioned jets delivered on November 3rd. 
In a recent delivery update shared on his X account [which was once Twitter], Rybar informs his followers that “the eagerly anticipated shipment is now in possession,” referencing the arrival of two F-16 jets delivered via truck transportation.

Daily Mail: Maps show devastating impact of America&#x27;s new super-nuke on Russian capital: B61-13 &#x27;gravity bomb&#x27; has 24 times more power than the one dropped on Hiroshima 
* The Biden administration is developing a new nuclear bomb - the B61-13 has the potential to cause significant devastation in Moscow 
* Simulation of bomb&#x27;s estimated maximum yield of 360 kilotons of TNT could see many deaths with more than 300,000 killed and hundreds of thousands injured 
* Development of the weapon is primarily intended as a deterrent and to provide assurance to allies 
Maps have been released depicting the destruction that could be unleashed should a new type of nuclear bomb being developed by the Biden Administration be dropped on Moscow. 
The Pentagon announced this week that it is developing a new nuclear &#x27;gravity bomb&#x27; that is 24 times more powerful than the nuke detonated in Hiroshima. 
The B61-13 is the 13th variant of the B61 family of &#x27;gravity bombs,&#x27; which fall to their target rather than being guided.

France 24: Gaza conflict &#x27;taking away focus&#x27; from Ukraine, Zelensky says

 
President Volodymyr Zelensky denied on Saturday that Ukraine&#x27;s war with Russia had reached a &quot;stalemate&quot;, pushing back at suggestions Western leaders were lobbying for peace talks. 
The sprawling frontline between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked. 
&quot;Time has passed, people are tired... But this is not a stalemate,&quot; Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv with EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. 
The Ukrainian leader also rejected the idea Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks would entail.

Thousands of people are newly displaced, with some crossing into China, as fighting intensifies between Myanmar&#x27;s junta and ethnic rebel groups in areas near the border. 
The junta launched a second day of air strikes on Wednesday, bombing territory in the northernmost Kachin state controlled by ethnic armed group Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a rebel spokesperson told AFP. 
Since Friday, the junta also has been battling an alliance of ethnic rebel groups across the neighbouring north-eastern Shan state.

Business Insider: Pentagon says there are no limits on how Israel uses US weapons as death toll climbs amid airstrikes in Gaza 
* The Pentagon says there are no limits on how Israel uses US-provided weapons in their attacks in Gaza. 
* A spokesperson said it&#x27;s up to the IDF how it uses the weapons. 
* Israeli airstrikes have devastated the Gaza Strip, and a new ground offensive could do further damage. 
The US is not putting any limits on how Israel uses US-provided weapons in its bloody war against Hamas that has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and destroyed parts of the Gaza Strip, the Pentagon says as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ramps up its retaliatory attacks in the area. 
On Monday, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told that &quot;we are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that [are] provided,&quot; Voice of America National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin reported. 
&quot;We&#x27;re not putting any constraints on that,&quot; she said.

Newsweek: Hezbollah Targets Israel With &#x27;Volcano&#x27; Rockets as Tensions Soar 
The militant group Hezbollah launched missile strikes against Israel on Saturday using rockets dubbed &quot;The Volcano,&quot; as tensions continue to soar along the country&#x27;s northern border with Lebanon. 
The Associated Press reported Saturday that Israel had launched airstrikes along the Lebanese border, as Hezbollah carried out several strikes of its own against Israeli military sites. 
One of these Israeli sites, known in Lebanon as Jal al-Allam, was struck by two large Burkan missiles, according to the AP. 
Translated as &quot;volcano&quot; in Arabic, Burkan missiles have an operational range of 500-2,000 meters and are outfitted with sizeable warheads that can weigh hundreds of kilograms.

                              <span>The Hill: Israel strikes Hezbollah targets in tense exchange on Lebanon border  
The Israeli military exchanged fire with Hezbollah militants on Saturday as skirmishes with the group continue at the Lebanon-Israel border. 
Israel launched airstrikes on multiple Hezbollah positions near the Lebanese border as the Iran-backed militant group launched rockets towards Israeli targets, the Associated Press reported.

Hezbollah has repeatedly threatened escalation amid Israel’s war with Hamas, an ally of the group, in Gaza. 
“What the Israelis do to Lebanon will also determine how we will act,” leader Hassan Nasrallah said Friday. “All options are on the table on the Lebanese front.”

                              <span>Politico.eu: Democracy in decline worldwide, new report says

 
Orbán, Trump and Erdoğan contribute to continuing downturn around the globe. 
The bedrock of democracy is trembling amid a surge of authoritarianism around the world, according to a report published Thursday. 
Hard-line rule by current and former leaders, including Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Donald Trump in the U.S. and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, has contributed to the downturn observed in the past few years, the Global State of Democracy 2023 report by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) has said.

NBC: U.S., European officials broach topic of peace negotiations with Ukraine, sources say

 
The conversations have included very broad outlines of what Ukraine might need to give up to reach a deal with Russia.  
WASHINGTON — U.S. and European officials have begun quietly talking to the Ukrainian government about what possible peace negotiations with Russia might entail to end the war, according to one current senior U.S. official and one former senior U.S. official familiar with the discussions. 
The conversations have included very broad outlines of what Ukraine might need to give up to reach a deal, the officials said. Some of the talks, which officials described as delicate, took place last month during a meeting of representatives from more than 50 nations supporting Ukraine, including NATO members, known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the officials said. 
The discussions are an acknowledgment of the dynamics militarily on the ground in Ukraine and politically in the U.S. and Europe, officials said.

CTV: Exhausted and disappointed with allies, Ukraine&#x27;s president and military chief warn of long attritional war 
Two articles published this week give a stark assessment of Ukraine’s prospects in its war with Russia. One – by the commander in chief of the Ukrainian military – admits the battlefield has reached a stalemate and a long attritional war benefiting Moscow beckons. The other portrays Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as exhausted by the constant effort to cajole and persuade allies to keep the faith. 
Ukraine’s military chief, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, says in a long essay and interview with the Economist that “just like in the First World War we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate.” 
He acknowledges: “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough,” but instead an equilibrium of devastating losses and destruction.

                              <span>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called on Israel to temporarily halt its military offensive in Gaza to allow for aid to enter the Palestinian enclave. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the idea unless the Hamas militants release the 240 hostages they are holding. Blinken has emphasized the need for Israel to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The US has dismissed international calls for a ceasefire but has sought to persuade Israel to accept localized pauses.</span>

The CEO, 39, said he plans to continuing his training for “a competitive MMA fight early next year.”</span>

Robert Card died from a self-inflicted gunshot, which likely occurred eight to 12 hours before his body was found in a tractor-trailer. Concerns about Card&#x27;s mental state had been raised prior to the shootings, and law enforcement agencies came under scrutiny for not finding his body sooner.</span>

The gallery, which operates a studio for North Korean artists, showcases the unique socialist realist style of North Korean art that appeals to a niche audience. China&#x27;s lax enforcement of the sanctions targeting North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program allows for the continued sale of North Korean art. The art is seen as a form of propaganda, with artists working directly for North Korea&#x27;s authorities to create art glorifying the state and its ideology.</span>

The phenomenon was captured in a photograph by aurora photographer Harlan Thomas, who described the orange hue as &quot;sublime.&quot; The last time such vibrant orange auroras were seen was during the Halloween storm of 2003.</span>

                              <span>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has stated that his militia is currently engaged in cross-border fighting with Israel along the Lebanon-Israel border and threatened further escalation. Nasrallah stopped short of announcing that his Lebanese militia would fully enter the war, but warned that Hezbollah is prepared for all options.  Nasrallah&#x27;s speech has been widely anticipated as an indication of whether the Israel-Hamas conflict could escalate into a regional war.</span>

                              <span>Record-breaking rain produced floods in a vast swath of Italy&#x27;s Tuscany region as Storm Ciaran pushed into the country overnight trapping residents in their homes, inundating hospitals and overturning cars. At least five people were killed, bringing the storm&#x27;s death toll in western Europe to 12 on Friday. Italian Civil Protection authorities said 200 millimeters (nearly 8 inches) of rain fell in a three-hour period, from the coastal city of Livorno to the inland valley of Mugello, and caused riverbanks to overflow. Video shows at least a dozen cars getting pushed down a flooded road.</span>

The purpose of these pauses would be to allow for the delivery of aid to the Palestinian enclave and facilitate the release of hostages. Blinken discussed the details of these pauses with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet, emphasizing the need to ensure that Hamas does not exploit the pauses for its own advantage.</span>

The woman&#x27;s husband reported her to the police after finding her with another man at their home, whom he discovered through surveillance cameras. Although Iranian law allows for appeals, the country has faced international criticism for its frequent use of the death penalty. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, warned that Iran was executing people at an &quot;alarming rate.&quot; Crimes such as adultery, sodomy, murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, and drug trafficking are all punishable by death in Iran.</span>

In mid-October, Minister Blair reported that a Chinese fighter jet had approached within five meters (approximately 16 feet) of a surveillance aircraft engaged in a United Nations mission.</span>

The site, now the third largest in Morocco, will provide insights into the lives of Roman settlers and romanised Moroccans during that time. The bath covers an area of over 2000 square meters and resembles imperial counterparts in Rome. The excavation is ongoing to uncover the port and other parts of one of the largest Roman towns in the country.</span>

With more than 2,000 movies per year, Bollywood is the biggest movie industry in the world. It evolved from performing arts and silent films to today&#x27;s big blockbusters. We speak to the exhibition&#x27;s co-curator Julien Rousseau, as well as Mahina Khanum, a Bollywood dancer and choreographer. Plus, we explore how India&#x27;s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is increasingly using the country&#x27;s cinema to push its Hindu nationalist agenda.</span>

USNI News: USS Gerald R. Ford, USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Operate Together in Eastern Med. 
For the first time in decades, two U.S. aircraft carriers sailed together in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, U.S. 6th fleet announced Friday.

Carriers USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) and USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) drilled for three days in the Mediterranean Sea along with USS Mount Whitney (LCC-20) and two Italian guided-missile frigates.
“Operating dual carrier strike groups alongside Allies and Partners in a dynamic environment demonstrates our capability and capacity to respond with agility decisively to any contingency,” Vice Adm. Thomas Ishee, commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet said in a Friday statement. 
“Our presence sends a clear signal about our commitment to deter aggression and promote stability throughout the region.”

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in his first speech since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, also threatened Israel&#x27;s main ally the United States, hinting his Iran-backed group was ready to confront U.S. warships in the Mediterranean.
&quot;You, the Americans, can stop the aggression against Gaza because it is your aggression. Whoever wants to prevent a regional war, and I am talking to the Americans, must quickly halt the aggression on Gaza,&quot; Nasrallah said.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says humanitarian pauses would also allow aid to get into Gaza amid Israel-Hamas war 
The White House is pushing for multiple pauses in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza so that aid can be let in, and people can be allowed to safely leave the region. 
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said at meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday that discussions about such pauses could facilitate getting hostages released. 

Israel on Friday put the latest number of hostages held by Hamas at 241.

                              <span>CNN: US intelligence currently assesses Iran and its proxies are seeking to avoid a wider war with Israel 
The US intelligence community believes – for now – that Iran and its proxies are calibrating their response to Israel’s military intervention in Gaza to avoid direct conflict with Israel or the US while still exacting costs on its adversaries. 
But the US is also keenly aware that Iran does not maintain perfect control of its umbrella of proxies – in particular over Lebanese Hezbollah, the largest and most capable of the various groups. Hezbollah is an ally of Hamas, the group that attacked Israel on October 7, and has long positioned itself as fighting against Israel. US officials are deeply concerned that the group’s internal politics may cause Hezbollah to escalate simmering tensions. 
The US also does not always have perfect visibility into the communications between Iran and its various proxies, according to sources familiar with US intelligence in the region.

WNU Editor: We shall see if Iran is committed to avoiding a wider war with Israel. But I am skeptical. I do not see any de-escalation in the Israel - Hamas war, and tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continues to remain high. The Houthis in Yemen have already declared war against Israel. It will not take much to spark this into a major regional war.</span>

Now she&#x27;s shaming the names who didn&#x27;t vote in favor. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
&quot;List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib,&quot; Greene said on Wednesday. &quot;This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC.&quot;

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn&#x27;t have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn&#x27;t running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn&#x27;t gaining a coalition in Congress.
&quot;I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger,&quot; she said. &quot;And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate.&quot;
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker&#x27;s swing and miss Wednesday.
&quot;Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib,&quot; tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: &quot;motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans.&quot;

And CNN&#x27;s Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: &quot;House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Sen. Tommy Tuberville&#x27;s (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville&#x27;s protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they&#x27;d be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn&#x27;t be there if it wasn&#x27;t for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It&#x27;s the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.</span>

Eric Smith, who had been doubling as both the top No. 1 and No. 2 Marine Corps leader since July, suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized on Sunday — leaving a three-star general to hold the prestigious post, according to a report published by Politico.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
The potential overextension of Smith and the stalling of more than 300 critical leadership roles was iced out by Tuberville&#x27;s blockade installed as a protest against the Pentagon&#x27;s policy to permit time off and reimbursement for abortions.

                              <span>A nonprofit organization that advocates for the freedom and independence of the press around the world has accused Israel and Hamas of war crimes committed against journalists in Palestine and Israel. Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court on Tuesday, asking its prosecutors to investigate the death of eight Palestinian journalists killed by Israeli forces amid bombardments of civilian areas in Gaza, and of one Israeli journalist killed while covering an attack on his kibbutz by Hamas on Oct. 7.

Kathy Hochul arrived in Israel with a photo of a Long Island native in hand to give to the president of the besieged country. Hochul, the Democratic governor of a state that has the largest Jewish population in the world outside of Israel, told the media in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack that she wanted to “bear witness” to the tragedy, show New York’s “unwavering” support of Israel and make sure that missing New Yorkers such as Omer ...</span>

                              <span>House Republicans, lead by newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), are demanding that the cost of the aid package to Israel be &quot;offset&quot; by $14 billion in cuts to IRS enforcement funding guaranteed in President Joe Biden&#x27;s Inflation Reduction Act — which is not only unrelated to the issue at hand, but experts say it would actually increase the deficit.
The fact that Republicans are demanding an increase in tax evasion as their condition of supporting a key U.S. ally&#x27;s military is not an accident, argued Talking Points Memo&#x27;s Josh Marshall on MSNBC Tuesday, but a sign of how low the GOP has sunk.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
