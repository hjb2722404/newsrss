                              <span>At least 10 people were killed, and a further 15 injured, in a series of stabbing attacks across two communities in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan on Sunday, September 4, authorities said.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the attacks took place across 13 different locations in the James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon areas of Saskatchewan on Sunday.

“At this stage in our investigation, we believe some of the victims have been targeted by the suspects and others have been attacked randomly,” Rhonda Blackmore, Assistant Commissioner of RCMP Saskatchewan, said.

Police issued a province-wide Dangerous Person Alert for two suspects, identified as Damien Sanderson and Myles Sanderson.

The search for both suspects was still underway as of Sunday night, police said.

“It is horrific what has happened in our province today,” Blackmore said.</span>

In an emotional send-off, Mr Hawkins’ teenage son Shane joined the band on stage taking over from his dad on drums for their hit song &#x27;My Hero&#x27;.</span>

“Saying that Harry and Meghan were happy to leave, that they were unhappy at their treatment during their brief time as royals and certainly some veiled threats.”</span>

                              <span>The New York Post has revealed Joe Biden spent 234 days on vacation out of 589 days since becoming president.

Republicans have been calling out President Biden for being away from the White House for two-thirds of August.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates hit back back at the criticism of Mr Biden’s travelling, saying &quot;presidency is a nonstop job that chief executives can do from anywhere in the world&quot;.

“Regardless of location, he has taken fewer vacation days than the modern norm,&quot; he said.

&quot;Being somewhere other than the White House is not the same thing as being on vacation. 

&quot;And President Biden is constantly focused on the numbers that are most important to the American people: lowering costs for families — like prescription drugs and energy — reducing the deficit to fight inflation, creating the most jobs of any year in American history and bringing manufacturing jobs back from overseas, growing the membership of NATO, and passing the most significant gun reform law in almost 30 years.”  

The 79-year-old&#x27;s critics have mocked the constant travels, arguing the country runs better when the president is &quot;away&quot;.

&quot;Out of the last 32 days, Joe Biden has spent 23 of those days on vacation. I’m not criticizing him for it. Our nation is better off with him away on his medical retreats—I mean vacations,&quot; said Breanna Morello.

&quot;41 per cent of Americans have picked up a side job while Joe Biden spent half of August on vacation,&quot; said Lance Gooden.</span>

(Bloomberg) -- European ministers will discuss special measures to rein in soaring energy costs, from gas-price caps to a suspension of power derivatives trading, as the bloc races to respond to the deepening crisis. 
The Czech Republic, which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency, is set to include those tools on a list of emergency intervention options to be discussed at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday, according to a draft document seen by Bloomberg News. 
Europe is fighting to stave off an energy catastrophe that’s threatening to become an economic, social, and even financial crisis too. 
Nordic authorities moved this weekend to bolster the liquidity of utilities struggling with collateral requirements, saying there was a risk of a “Lehman” moment.

Reuters: Turkish warship docks in Israel as bilateral ties warm 
 HAIFA, Israel (Reuters) - A Turkish warship has docked in Israel for the first such visit in more than a decade as relations between the U.S. allies improve following fierce feuding over the Palestinian cause. 
The frigate Kemalreis docked in Haifa on Saturday as part of NATO manoeuvres in the Mediterranean sea, a Turkish official said. 
An Israeli official said Ankara had submitted a preliminary request for the crew to disembark on shore leave.

Spanning the Trump and Biden administrations, Ambassador John Sullivan will retire entirely from a lengthy career in government service. 
His departure, which comes in the midst of an increasingly serious crisis over Russia´s war in Ukraine as well as disputes over detained Americans in Russia, had been expected this fall as he reached the usual length of time for U.S. ambassadors.

Washington Post: Chilean voters decisively reject leftist constitution 
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chileans on Sunday delivered a resounding rejection to a new leftist constitution that aimed to transform the country into a more egalitarian society. 
In a referendum, Chilean voters were asked to approve or reject a proposal to replace the country’s 1980 dictatorship-era constitution — considered one of the most market-friendly in the world — with one of the world’s most inclusive. 
The new charter envisioned a dramatic shift to the left in the South American nation, expanding the role of government and calling for an economic model that would narrow inequalities and help lift up the poor. 
But for many Chileans, the proposed changes were too drastic. 
With more than 95 percent of ballot boxes tallied Sunday night, about 62 percent of voters rejected the charter, while 38 percent approved it, according to Chile’s electoral authority.

Republic World:  Putin&#x27;s Visit To G20 Summit Will Be Decided On Many Factors Including Security: Kremlin  
Kremlin stated that the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the G20 summit would be determined after deciding &quot;all factors&quot;. 
As the ruthless war between Russia and Ukraine continues unabated, the Kremlin stated that the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the G20 summit would be determined after deciding &quot;all factors,&quot; which would also include security, Tass reported. Notably, the Bali Summit is scheduled to take place in Indonesia in November.

Update: Moscow speaks out on Putin’s G20 trip (RT)   
WNU Editor: The Indonesian President is already on the record that Putin will be traveling to Bali for the G20 Summit, but I will be surprised if Russian President Putin does go this November. The war in Ukraine and the Russian economy are the priorities for the Kremlin right now, not having a face to face meeting with leaders like Xi or Salman for a few hours. But then again, Putin does like these face-to-face meetings, and he may decide to go there anyway.</span>

RT: Russia is unreliable energy partner – Germany 
Chancellor Scholz says his country has been severely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict   German Chancellor Olaf Scholz claimed on Sunday that Russia cannot be considered a reliable energy supplier, and accused Moscow of breaching its contractual obligations. 
Speaking at a news conference with party leaders from the Greens and pro-business FDP, he said Moscow was always a reliable energy partner “even during the Cold War,” but that the rule no longer applies.

Towards the end of July, news emerged in the Russian media that Moscow and a number of its Eurasian allies are now reviewing a proposal to create an entirely new trading and pricing infrastructure for the international precious metals in order to both destroy London and New York’s monopoly over global precious metals pricing, and to stabilize the Russian gold market.

WNU Editor: Western sanctions is forcing Russia to develop alternative networks to sell its resources, precious metals included. Being a resource super power where much of the world needs Russian minerals to grow their economies, I am predicting Moscow will be successful in providing an entirely new trading and pricing infrastructure when it comes to precious metals. This new infrastructure will take time, but I would not be surprised to see it take shape next year, and the BRICS nations will be the first to use it.</span>

Space News: UK releases military ‘space power’ doctrine 
The UK military doctrine says space power is &#x27;part of a wider, whole-of-government strategy&#x27; 
WASHINGTON — The United Kingdom on Sept. 1 released “UK Space Power,” the military’s keystone doctrine publication focused on the space domain. 
The 91-page public document lays out in broad terms the role of the UK military in protecting space from foreign threats and provides “a basis for understanding the utility of the space domain in the military context,” the paper says.  A central message is that space is a global domain; and military, civil and commercial space activities are intertwined.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal arrived in Berlin late on September 3 for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other senior officials, becoming the first top-ranking Kyiv official to visit Germany in months. 
The visit signals an end to tensions between the two countries, as Kyiv has criticized Germany in the past for providing too little assistance in Ukraine’s struggle against a massive invasion by neighboring Russia since February. 
Scholz visited Kyiv in June, and shipments of weapons have increased since then.

France’s minister for energy transition said Friday that French electricity giant EDF has committed to restart all its nuclear reactors by this winter to help the country through the broad energy crisis aggravated by the war in Ukraine. 
Agnès Pannier-Runacher said the government is taking steps to “avoid restrictive measures” over energy use in the peak winter cold season, following a special government meeting over energy issues. 
France relies on nuclear energy for about 67% of its electricity – more than any other country – and on gas for about 7%.

WNU Editor: Many of these reactors were shut down for maintenance issues. Hence the concerns over safety. But France is still dependent for a quarter of its electricity needs from other sources, and there will be a cost albeit a smaller one when compared to the UK, Germany, etc..

Bloomberg: Microsoft Combat Goggles Win First US Army Approval for Delivery 
(Bloomberg) -- The US Army is taking delivery of a first batch of high-tech combat goggles made by Microsoft Corp., citing encouraging results from testing in the field. 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Douglas Bush has “cleared the Army to begin accepting” some of the 5,000 sets of goggles, spokesman Jamal Beck said in a statement. 
Their delivery had been placed on hold over concern about the device’s performance until more rigorous testing took place.  Based on the test results so far the service “is adjusting its fielding plan to allow for time to correct deficiencies and also field to units that are focused on training activities,” Beck said.

 Simple Flying: Putin Says &quot;There Has Not Been An Order Like This For A Long Time&quot; 
Vladimir Putin and Aeroflot CEO Sergei Aleksandrovsky discussed an order for 323 Russian-built aircraft in the Kremlin last Friday. 
Last Friday, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, had a meeting with Aeroflot CEO Sergei Aleksandrovsky. The meeting was held in Moscow at the Kremlin, focusing on Aeroflot&#x27;s work in passenger transportation.   
Straight down to business 
Simple Flying was, unfortunately, not invited to the August 26 meeting, but we do have the official transcript, which is a fascinating insight. It&#x27;s an all-business meeting, or at least the transcript is, with a critical point about halfway through, when Putin asks the Aeroflot CEO, &quot;What do you see in the mid-term?&quot; Aleksandrovsky replies that Aeroflot is focused on preparing domestic aircraft for operation and updating its strategy by tailoring it to the comprehensive transport development program until 2030. He then adds:

Zero Hedge: Sweden, Austria Start Bailing Out Energy Companies Triggering Europe&#x27;s &quot;Minsky Moment&quot; 
Last weekend, Credit Suisse repo guru published what may have been the most insightful snippet of the entire European energy crisis (to date) when he extended the infamous &quot;Minsky Moment&quot; framework to Europe, and specifically Germany, which he said &quot;can’t cover its payments without Russian gas and the government is asking citizens to conserve energy to leave more for industry.&quot; He then elaborated that &quot;Minsky moments are triggered by excessive financial leverage, and in the context of supply chains, leverage means excessive operating leverage: in Germany, $2 trillion of value added depends on $20 billion of gas from Russia… …that’s 100-times leverage – much more than Lehman’s.&quot; (Zoltan&#x27;s entire note is a must read for everyone with a passing interest in what comes next).

DW: Ukraine battles to avoid hyperinflation as war costs soar 
Ukraine&#x27;s central bank has been de facto printing money to pay its troops, but the measure is unsustainable. More international support is vital, but how much new cash could be raised domestically? 
As the war against Russia enters its seventh month, Ukraine is stuck between a financial rock and a hard place as it seeks to stay afloat while fighting off Moscow&#x27;s invading forces. 
Tax revenues have plummeted due to an economy in free fall while military spending has skyrocketed, leaving the government facing a budget shortfall of $5 billion (€5.02 billion) per month. 
To make up for the lack of cash, the country&#x27;s central bank has effectively been printing money — buying government bonds to the tune of $7.7 billion over the past six months. The Financial Times reported that the printing presses effectively created $3.6 billion in June alone.

(Reuters) - An estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague against the Czech government on Saturday, calling on the ruling coalition to do more to control soaring energy prices and voicing opposition to the European Union and NATO. 
Organizers of the demonstration from a number of far-right and fringe political groups including the Communist party, said the central European nation should be neutral militarily and ensure direct contracts with gas suppliers, including Russia. 
Police estimates put the number of protesters at around 70,000 by mid-afternoon.

Axios: U.S. restricts chip sales to China 
Graphics-chip maker Nvidia announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales to China, &quot;effective immediately.&quot;   
Driving the news: The U.S. government has imposed a new license requirement &quot;for any future export to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia&quot; in order to &quot;address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a &#x27;military end use,&#x27;&quot; per the filing.   
Why it matters: The new rule marks a significant escalation in the Biden administration&#x27;s efforts to prevent future supply chain crises and increase competition with China&#x27;s government — as tensions with Beijing continue to simmer following visits to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other U.S. officials this month.

 Popular Science: The Army’s Chinook helicopters are grounded. Here’s why.   
Four reported engine fires occurred over the past 90 days, the Army says. Here&#x27;s everything to know about these heavy lift helicopters and their recent problems. 
The US Army operates hundreds of large helicopters called Chinooks. The flying machine’s job is straightforward and unflashy: To transport people or equipment. But the Chinook fleet is not going anywhere right now, because the Army has grounded them. The problem leading to the grounding is a series of engine fires—there have been four reported fires over the past 90 days, according to an Army spokesperson. 
The news of the vast grounding was reported earlier this week by The Wall Street Journal. 
Here’s what to know about this unique military helicopter and why it was grounded.

Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations has said it’s “alarming” that no one from the 56-member Russian advance team and delegation headed by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has received a U.S. entry visa to attend a UN General Assembly debate in New York later this month. 
“This is even more alarming since for the last several months the authorities of the United States have been constantly refusing to grant entry visas to a number of Russian delegates assigned to take part in the official United Nations events,” Vasily Nebenzia said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 
Nebenzia said applications to attend the high-level UN meetings starting September 19 had been submitted to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

                              <span>Democratic strategist and frequent MSNBC guest Kurt Bardela despicably and directly equated the Republican Party with Nazi Germany and the Bolsheviks.
The Democrat made the remarks in the middle of the news day on MSNBC Reportsduring a discussion of the president Joe Biden attack the “MAGA Republicans” and say that they practice “semi-fascism”.
Bardella says at anchor Alex Witt that Biden is in the “third chapter” of his presidency, describing it as a “fight for the soul of democracy.”
“We’re looking at a very radical, extreme Republican party right now that mirrors what we’ve seen in other places like Nazi Germany, like other places like the Bolsheviks,” Bardella said.  He continued to fume without interruption or challenge.

Decades ago I was the editor of Rap Sheet, a West Coast hip-hop newspaper.  And since the 1990s, I had tracked how corporate record labels maximized the exploitation of black culture, while enriching hip-hop artists like Jay-Z and Diddy to billionaire or near-billionaire status.  I found that appalling. 

However, to be clear, none of this is new, as this kind of cultural and artistic exploitation is essential to capitalism, black or not.

                              <span>In June 2020, a military base was attacked by jihadists in Kafolo, in north-eastern Ivory Coast near the border with Burkina Faso, leaving 14 soldiers dead. Other attacks followed and the Ivorian authorities have been working to improve the security situation. Our correspondent Samuel Bernard was able to join the army on anti-terror patrols and meet local residents. In this border region, the Fulani people claim to be subject to special surveillance and denounce what they consider discriminatory measures. Security forces deny targeting any specific group in their fight against terrorism.</span>
