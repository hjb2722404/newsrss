                              <span>President Joe Biden’s comments concerning China is either an “incoherent gaffe” or the US President “playing three dimensional chess”, says Lowy Institute Senior Fellow Richard McGregor.

Mr McGregor said President’s Biden’s comments are contrary to the current US policy towards China. 

“I think it tells us frankly that Mr Biden believes if that Taiwan were attacked, then the US would be involved,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“In theory though, that’s not the US policy. The US policy is to be much more, you know, keep China guessing.”</span>

                              <span>New Zealand&#x27;s Reserve Bank is holding its May cash rate decision today and it&#x27;s expected to sharply increase interest rates.

Sky News Australia discussed the issue with Sky News Business reporter Edward Boyd.

&quot;Reserve Bank in New Zealand has been lifting the cash rate sharply, it&#x27;s at one and a half per cent right now, it&#x27;s going to get up to two per cent probably by the end of today.

&quot;We haven&#x27;t actually seen inflation start to come down in New Zealand and that&#x27;s a pretty good indicator for Australia as well. 

&quot;Our Reserve Bank&#x27;s lifting the cash rate and so far it hasn&#x27;t really had any impact on inflation – I think they&#x27;re going to need to lift it a lot more to start pushing down those inflationary pressures.&quot;
 
Mr Boyd said the RBA isn&#x27;t expecting inflation to start declining until the middle of next year.

&quot;It&#x27;s going to peak at about six per cent headline inflation at the end of this year and slowly start to fall in mid 2023.&quot;</span>

(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least three suspected ballistic missile Wednesday, just hours after as U.S. President Joe Biden wrapped up a visit to American allies South Korea and Japan, where he discussed the security threat posed by Kim Jong Un’s regime. 
The projectiles were fired at around 6 a.m., 6:37 a.m. and 6:42 a.m. from an area near Pyongyang’s airport and flew toward waters off North Korea’s east coast, the South’s Joint Chief of Staff said. 
Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said officials were looking at the whether at least one of the rockets was an intercontinental ballistic missile and told reporters two suspected ballistic missiles appear to have already splashed down outside of the country’s exclusive economic zone. 
Kishi said the launches were unacceptable.

The Guardian: YouTube removes more than 9,000 channels relating to Ukraine war  
Exclusive: Platform takes ‘unprecedented action’ to address content guideline violations since invasion 
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. 
The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. 
YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion.

WNU Editor: Fortunately my favorite Russian YouTube channels are operating. But I think it is only a matter of time before the platform is shut down by Google/Alphabet or the Kremlin.</span>

For thousands of years, there have been rules to control the types of weapons in warfare - for instance, the use of poison in armed combat was forbidden in Ancient Greece. 
But it wasn’t until the 19th century that international agreements were made to legally regulate the types of weapons that are allowed (and banned) in wars around the world. 
In the infographic below, Visual Capitalist&#x27;s Carmen Ang and Sabrina Fortin outlines the weapons that are banned or limited in war, according to international humanitarian laws that are outlined in the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).

Washington: US President Joe Biden said in a memorandum that he officially designated Colombia to be considered a major non-NATO ally to the United States.
“By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America… I hereby designate Colombia as a Major Non-NATO Ally of the United States for the purposes of the Act and the Arms Export Control Act,” Biden said in the memorandum on Monday. 
The designation will provide Colombia the opportunity to benefit from special access to US military and economic programs, but it does not provide security guarantees like those given to NATO members.

Veteran US statesman Henry Kissinger has urged the West to stop trying to inflict a crushing defeat on Russian forces in Ukraine, warning that it would have disastrous consequences for the long term stability of Europe. 
The former US secretary of state and architect of the Cold War rapprochement between the US and China told a gathering in Davos that it would be fatal for the West to get swept up in the mood of the moment and forget the proper place of Russia in the European balance of power. 
Dr Kissinger said the war must not be allowed to drag on for much longer, and came close to calling on the West to bully Ukraine into accepting negotiations on terms that fall very far short of its current war aims.

                              <span>Euronews: A record-breaking 100 million people have fled conflicts around the world, says United Nations 
The number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution has crossed the milestone of 100 million for the first time on record, propelled by the war in Ukraine and other deadly conflicts, the UN refugee agency said Monday. 
UNHCR said the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide approached 90 million by the end of 2021, propelled by new waves of violence or protracted conflict in countries including Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Myanmar, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Congo.

Claiming its one-China principle is different from China&#x27;s, the US is only retreating from its own promises and the common ground it reached with China, with the intention of obstructing China&#x27;s peaceful reunification and attempting to build Taiwan into an &quot;unsinkable aircraft carrier,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday at a press briefing in response to remarks from US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price on the one-China principle. 
Price said on Twitter on May 21 that China &quot;continues to publicly misrepresent US policy. The US does not subscribe to the PRC&#x27;s &#x27;one-China principle&#x27; - we remain committed to our longstanding, bipartisan one-China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, Three Joint Communiqués, and Six Assurances.&quot;

Update: China says US shipped $70 bln worth of weapons to Taiwan (TASS)   
WNU Editor: The key paragraph from the above Global Times article is the following ....  .... What&#x27;s more, the military ties between the two sides are becoming more frequent and open, and the scale of US arms sales to Taiwan is increasing, totaling more than $70 billion, which is in violation of the US commitment to gradually reduce arms sales to the island. The US side has also hyped the expansion of Taiwan&#x27;s so-called &quot;international space,&quot; trampling on its promises that the US has no intention of implementing &quot;two Chinas&quot; or a &quot;one China, one Taiwan&quot; policy.

Times of India: Explosive audio leak details China&#x27;s plan to invade Taiwan 
NEW DELHI: An unprecedented and explosive audio leak of a top-secret meeting of the Peoples Liberation Army has reveal China&#x27;s detailed plan to attack Taiwan. 
Experts say that the audio clip posted on the YouTube channel of Lude media appears authentic. This will be the first time since the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 that a recording of a top-secret meeting of a military command has been leaked. 
Apparently, &quot;allies&quot; within the Communist Party of China (CPC), especially the military (codename &quot;Thunder&quot;) carried out the recording of the meeting that took place on May 14. No wonder the knives are out to nail the source of the leak. The Lude media recording was also posted on the twitter account of Jennifer Zeng @jenniferatntd.

I do not know if this leak is real, or it is part of a disinformation campaign. But if it is true to say that it is disturbing is an understatement.

                              <span>Washington Post: International military aid for Ukraine accelerates, Pentagon says 
The Pentagon announced Monday that about 20 countries have pledged new security assistance packages for Ukraine, including new anti-ship missiles, additional attack helicopters and tanks. 
Forty-seven nations now have joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which was organized by the Pentagon to help address Kyiv’s immediate and long-term needs as it seeks to beat back the Russian military’s protracted invasion. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday singled out Denmark for providing Ukraine with a Harpoon launcher and missiles to help defend its coast, and the Czech Republican for agreeing to send helicopters, tanks and rocket systems. 
Other participating nations, he said, have donated artillery rounds and armored vehicles, or agreed to provide the Ukrainians with training and assistance to maintain its military systems. 
The group is scheduled to meet again June 15, on the sidelines of a meeting of NATO defense ministers.

                              <span>Yahoo: Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has been &#x27;slow and unsuccessful,&#x27; Pentagon says 
WASHINGTON — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to be hampered by consistent military assistance to Ukraine from allies in Europe and elsewhere, U.S. military leaders said on Monday after a meeting with allies who made new pledges of weaponry as the war in Eastern Europe is on the cusp of entering its fourth month. 
“We remain committed, resolved and united in our assistance to Ukraine,” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley said at a Pentagon briefing after a second meeting of the Ukraine Contact Group, a consortium that now includes nearly 50 nations, most of them in Europe, committed to defending Ukraine against the invasion that the Kremlin launched in late February.

WNU Editor: I understand the Pentagon needs to paint an optimistic picture on the war in order to maintain public support, but in the month of May I have been seeing consistent and critical Russian military successes on the battlefield. 
It was only last week that thousands of Ukraine&#x27;s best fighters surrendered en-masse at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, and there are now reports that thousands of Ukrainian fighters are about to be surrounded (if not already) at a key city in the Donbas .... Here’s how Russia is zeroing in on key Ukrainian stronghold Severodonetsk (The Print). And then there is this sobering on the ground report from Euronews on how dire the situation is becoming in eastern Ukraine (see video below). 
If this is slow and unsuccessful, then why the rush to send tens of billions in arms? Why escalate a greater involvement in this conflict? 
My gut tells me that the Pentagon leadership are very worried on the military situation that is unfolding right now, and are trying their best to assist the Ukrainians as best as they could to contain the Russian military and their offensive in the Donbas. But will it be enough? I have my doubts.</span>

Moscow Times: Russia Scrambles for Soldiers Amid Ukraine War Manpower Shortage 
Several mobile military enlistment offices could be seen Saturday on the sidelines of an annual half-marathon race in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. 
“Mobile selection point for contract service,” read the blue lettering on the side of one of the large trucks, which was suspended over an image of an aircraft carrier and a fighter jet. Another photograph from the event showed recruitment officers mingling with runners. 
Such recruitment points appear to be an increasingly common sight in Russian cities as the Kremlin struggles to redress the army’s manpower shortage in Ukraine without formally declaring war and announcing a full, or partial, mobilization.

                              <span>DALLAS — Jason Kidd, coach of the Mavericks, had a concise message for his players ahead of Game 3 of the NBA Western Conference Finals on Sunday night.
Open shots, he reminded them in the locker room, are easier to make than contested shots, so get in the paint and draw Golden State defenders.  Do that, and the space will open up around the perimeter.
“Attack, attack, attack,” Kidd said, his voice betraying great urgency.  “Make them work.”
It was a smart strategy, and sure enough, it worked.  The Mavericks generated a respectable number of 3-point clean looks.  The problem?  They couldn’t do much.  Luka Doncic, the team’s star point guard, offered a summary.


“Sometimes you feel like you’re open and everyone knows you can get a shot and then miss it,” he said.  “That depresses you a bit…</span>

Red Deer is the geographic midpoint between Alberta’s two major cities – Edmonton to the north and Calgary to the south – and loyalties may be split ‘about 52-48 for the Oilers’, according to a server’s calculations. a local Tim Hortons donut store.

In two samples, Haskins had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20% and 0.24% at the time of his autopsy, according to the report, more than double the legal limit of 0.08% in Florida.  Ketamine, a sedative that is also considered a recreational hallucinogen, was also found in Haskins’ system, according to the report.
Through an attorney, Haskins’ wife Kalabrya in a statement Monday asked for patience and privacy.

                              <span>But Osaka is uncertain, although she may travel to Berlin to play in the new grass-court event that will count towards her ranking.
“Overall, I feel like I’m going to stop telling myself I’m bad on these surfaces,” she said of grass and clay, “and at the place, keep your head down and keep working really hard, because I think that’s what I’ve been doing all year. I can’t expect everything to happen at once. I hope so that, gradually, I will have the results I want.
So far, she has four Grand Slam singles titles, all on hard courts, most recently at the 2021 Australian Open about 16 months ago.  The pecking order changes and is not in his favor.  After breaking down in tears mid-match at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., in March after a heckler rocked her in a second-round loss, she bounced back to reach the final of the Miami Open, where Swiatek beat her, 6-4, 6-0.
Osaka, who plays for Japan and is based in the United States, remains one of the biggest stars in the sport and the highest paid female athlete in the world by far.  She has enough lucrative long-term endorsement deals to justify recently break up with IMG to set up his own management agency with Stuart Duguid, his agent.
But Osaka will be ranked around world No. 40 after Roland Garros, and while his portfolio looks strong in redwood, how does that affect the bottom line and his place in the sporting landscape if a young player like Swiatek takes the real control of the sport and younger, possibly hungrier players like Anisimova continue to dominate Osaka at the start of major tournaments?
To what extent, in the age of social media, should results and stardom continue to align once the millions of followers are already acquired?
Osaka, left ankle wrapped, seemed genuinely determined to change her luck on Monday, digging into the corners and maintaining positive energy almost to the end.  But Anisimova has been more consistent on serve and more devastating from the baseline and, crucially, on the returns.

“I think we worked really well at bat,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.  “Gerrit Cole has great stuff.  It’s an ace.  He’s an ace for a reason and to be able to score some runs against him, I’m proud of our hitters.

The Celtics were quicker to drop balls, more active in disrupting passing lanes, and more coordinated in switches, limiting quality looks for Miami.  They were more pressing to get back on defense and turn in the paint, not allowing the Heat to push for quick breaks like they did on Saturday.  Boston’s defense was so effective that Miami only fired two 3-pointers in the first quarter, limiting its chances of closing the deficit until it was too late.  That was exactly the kind of energy Boston was sorely lacking in the first half of Game 3. Miami’s starters combined for 18 points.

According to the reasoning, the previous project would result in federal budget losses. 
The new draft law “On Mining in the Russian Federation”, dated May 20, appeared in the database of the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma.  The document has several significant changes from the previous version, present by the co-sponsors on April 29. 
While the text remains unchanged in general, the new draft misses the subsection on a register of mining operators, which companies should register in order to continue their work.  In the latest version, to start mining, crypto mining companies must register as sole proprietor or self-employed.  Companies would follow a standard procedure for company registration.

On April 7, the head of the State Duma’s Financial Markets Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, revealed that changes to the federal tax code regarding crypto should be adopted. by the end of summer parliamentary session.  It is unclear if they would include specifications regarding mining.

                              <span>Character is not a word often associated with Manchester City.  So smooth, so serene is the machine Guardiola has crafted in his six years with City that he rarely has to draw on his reserves of grit, grit and resilience.  Most of the time, the unrivaled technique and talent at Guardiola’s disposal is more than enough.
But with his season collapsing and only 15 minutes to save him, that’s precisely what carried City through, just as it saw Guardiola’s side salvage a point at West Ham last week: his ability to remain cool and collected under the most intense pressure.  .

Like someone who’s been telling the Liberals for years that their green energy hero Elon Musk is a pathological liar and a charlatan, it has been extremely annoying to hear conservatives now accuse Musk’s critics of not liking him because he is a free speech crusader or – lately – a kind of conservative.
My distrust of the CEO of Tesla Motors has nothing to do with his views on censorship or his politics – if he even has any.  Rather, it is his long experience of being pathologically full of shit.
Take the last performance in the endless musk circus.
An editor at Insider mentioned the publication reached out to Musk on Wednesday at 9 a.m. ET for comment on a narrative about him that he would be running.

Have you recently been asked to complete an online survey?  An end-of-year program feedback form, perhaps? 
They seem to be popping up like tulips these days.  Not only have I been asked many times this week, but I’m also part of a team that’s throwing one all over town.  This makes me think carefully about why we’re asking for 15 minutes of people’s time.
I work for the Northampton Public Schools Early Childhood Center.  We have a relatively new formal partnership between public schools and community preschools, child care centers and home child care programs.  It is publicly funded through the Department of Early Childhood Education and Care (EEC).

                              <span>Russian President Vladimir Putin survived an assassination attempt earlier this year, according to Ukraine&#x27;s intelligence chief.

Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online website Ukrayinska Pravda that the Russian president was targeted shortly after his nation invaded its neighbour. 

He went on to say the Russian leader was attacked by representatives from the Caucasus region, which sits between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.

“This is non-public information. (An) Absolutely unsuccessful attempt, but it really took place … it was about two months ago,” Mr Budanov said.</span>

                              <span>Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles says it is “important” that America has presence in east Asia, following President Joe Biden’s recent remarks about the United States’ willingness to defend Taiwan militarily against China. 

Mr Biden was asked whether the US would be willing to get its military involved to defend Taiwan during a press briefing before the Quad meeting on Monday, to which he responded: &quot;Yes - it&#x27;s a commitment we made&quot;.

When questioned if Australia would respond in the same way if China invaded Taiwan, Mr Marles said the Americans have made an “important statement”, however, he doesn’t think it’s wise to start “commenting on hypotheticals”. 

“It is important that the Americans have made the statement that they have because what it represents is an American presence in the region which is something which is very much in our national interest,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That’s what we want to encourage and that’s why the Quad is important and that’s why it was so important that Anthony Albanese attends the Quad so shortly after the election. 

“We work very closely with the United States. I think it’s important to not walk down hypothetical paths but it’s also very important to make clear that we stand with the United States, and that we have a very close alliance with the United States.”</span>

                              <span>Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany says Joe Biden&#x27;s gaffes are &quot;alarming&quot; and &quot;weird to watch&quot; after the White House was forced to clarify another remark made by the president.

President Biden had confirmed the United States would come to the defence of Taiwan if China were to invade the territory.

Mr Biden was asked whether the US would be willing to get its military involved to defend Taiwan during a press briefing on Monday, to which he responded: “Yes – it’s a commitment we made”.

The White House has since released a statement confirming Mr Biden’s comments do not reflect a change in US policy.

&quot;It&#x27;s always an unnamed, anonymous White House official that cleans up the blunder,&quot; Ms McEnany said. 

&quot;These gaffes are alarming. They&#x27;re weird to watch.&quot;</span>

The images show Mr Johnson toasting colleagues at Downing Street, bidding farewell to his then-communication chief.

The gathering allegedly occurred during the United Kingdom&#x27;s second lockdown, when households were unable to mix.

Mr Johnson has already been fined by the Metropolitan Police for attending a surprise birthday party held in 2020.</span>

RT: Lavrov unveils Russia’s geopolitical strategy 
Foreign minister tells students of Moscow’s economic and political plans and future of relations with the West   Moscow expects increased economic cooperation with China as the West becomes more dictatorial, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. Russia intends to build relations with independent countries and will decide how to deal with the West if and when it comes to its senses, he added. 
“Now that the West is taking the position of a dictator, our economic ties with China will grow even faster,” Lavrov told students at the Primakov School, an elite Moscow high school named after one of his predecessors.

For this reason, Russia should rely entirely on its own resources, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council underscored 
MOSCOW, May 20. /TASS/. The sanctions imposed on Russia will apparently stay in effect for a very long time, possibly, decades, and the special military operation in Ukraine is not the reason, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said at a meeting of the inter-departmental commission for creating a national system of protection from new infections in Moscow on Friday. 
&quot;We are well aware that the introduced sanctions will apparently stay in effect for a very long time. And this is not connected with Russia’s special operation in Ukraine. Obviously, these sanctions will last long, the way it was in the past, including the Soviet era. In other words, for decades,&quot; he stated.   Read more ....

It will not happen with Putin in power. It will also not happen if one of the Western demands is Russia gives-up Crimea. This is non-negotiable not only to the Kremlin, but also to almost every Russian citizen.</span>

 LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin quipped on Monday that he would have a serious talk to the West about its assertions that he was to blame for all the economic chaos sown by the conflict in Ukraine and the West&#x27;s crippling sanctions. 
Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands and displaced 14 million people, while the West&#x27;s attempt to isolate Russia as punishment and Moscow&#x27;s blockade of grain shipments from Ukraine&#x27;s Black Sea ports, have sent the price of oil, natural gas, grains, cooking oil and fertilisers soaring. 
At a televised meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin told Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Russia&#x27;s economy was doing well, despite the Western sanctions.

ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkey&#x27;s President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday Ankara would soon launch new military operations along its southern borders to create 30-km deep safe zones to combat terrorist threats from these regions. 
&quot;The main target of these operations will be areas which are centers of attacks to our country and safe zones,&quot; Erdogan said, without elaborating. 
Erdogan said the operations would be launched as soon as military, intelligence and security forces have completed their preparations.

                              <span>Al Jazeera/Bloomberg: Ruble surges as Russia considers looser capital controls  
The ruble’s rebound has left it more than 30 percent stronger against the dollar than it was before Russia invaded Ukraine. 
The ruble’s blistering rebound picked up pace on Monday, ratcheting up pressure on Russia to ease a key capital-flow control that’s underpinned the currency’s recovery. 
With the gains now threatening to hurt budget revenue and exporters, a decision to cut the share of hard-currency earnings that exporters convert into rubles could come as early as this week, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The mandated proportion could be reduced to 50% from 80% currently, the people said, who requested anonymity because the details of the plan aren’t public.

Update #1: Russian rouble leaps to near 7-year high vs euro (Reuters)  
Update #2: How Russia made its ruble the world’s top-performing currency (Quartz)   
WNU Editor: My friends/family/and contacts in Russia are telling me that the worse of the economic crisis has passed. That prices have stabilized and there are no shortages in the stores. Many foreign firms have left, but everyone is telling me that the economy has adjusted, and Western goods that are blacklisted are still entering the country from other countries like China. 
I am also reading reports that the Russian Central Bank is buying foreign currencies to halt the rise of the Russian ruble. I do not know who is buying rubles (my gut tells me that it is China), but it is a clear violation of Western sanctions. 
Bottom line. 
The upward trajectory of the Russian ruble was certainly not expected, and worse, the perception now is that Europe is facing dire economic consequences because of it. And while Ukraine President Zelensky is calling for more sanctions, I think some European leaders are beginning to understand that these measures are not working.</span>

RFE: France&#x27;s European Minister: A Ukraine EU Bid Would Take At Least 15-20 Years  
France’s European affairs minister said that any bid for Ukraine to join the European Union would take at least 15 to 20 years to complete, putting a damper on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy&#x27;s hopes of gaining a quick entry into the bloc. 
&quot;We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you&#x27;re lying,&quot; Clement Beaune told France’s Radio J on May 22. 
&quot;It&#x27;s probably in 15 or 20 years -- it takes a long time.&quot;  &quot;I don&#x27;t want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies,&quot; he added.

Ukraine’s president has given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. 
While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. 
The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas.

CNBC: IMF says global economy faces ‘confluence of calamities’ in biggest test since World War II 
* In a blog post ahead of this week’s World Economic Forum, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its “biggest test since the Second World War.” 
* In combining the Russia-Ukraine war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the spike in volatility in financial markets and persistent threat from climate change, the IMF said the world faces a “potential confluence of calamities.” 
The International Monetary Fund has warned against “geoeconomic fragmentation” as policymakers and business leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
In a blog post ahead of this week’s event, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its “biggest test since the Second World War,” with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine compounding the residual economic effects of Covid-19 crisis, dragging down growth and driving inflation to multi-decade highs.

   RT:  Russia halts electricity supply to another EU country 
Exports to Lithuania were stopped due to the nation’s &quot;inability&quot; to pay 
Russia has stopped supplying power to Lithuania, the country’s electricity transmission system operator Litgrid announced on Sunday. 
Inter RAO, which was the only importer of electricity from Russia to Lithuania, confirmed the suspension of deliveries. Earlier this month, Inter RAO’s Nordic branch also stopped supplying electricity to Finland.

   CNN: Biden admin considering sending US special operations forces to protect US embassy in Kyiv 
(CNN)The Biden administration is in the early stages of discussions about sending special operations forces into Ukraine to help guard the US Embassy in Kyiv, several US officials tell CNN. 
The discussions are in very preliminary stages and a proposal has not been presented to President Joe Biden for a decision, the sources added. 
For now, the embassy and its limited number of personnel are protected by State Department diplomatic security officials. 
The discussion centers around whether an increase in security is needed if the number of personnel increase, and whether special operations forces are best equipped to fulfill those requirements.

                              <span>WNU Editor: The key part from yesterday&#x27;s interview is this ....  .... Tom Cotton: It’s important that we support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this war of aggression by Vladimir Putin. So, first off I do understand the reservations some people had about the legislation. And there was some excessive or unnecessary measures. But a lot of that money went to support our own military and our own troops to replenish the stockpiles of our weapons that those troops need to defend themselves and protect our country. And not just support our allies in Europe but in the Western Pacific, Taiwan in particular. Second, I think it is important that we help the Ukrainians fight their own war. This is much like what Ronald Reagan did in Afghanistan… And finally, I think our main adversary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party is watching very carefully what is happening in Europe. If they see the United States and our allies falter in our resolve to support Ukraine in defending itself against an invasion by Russia, then I think Xi Jinping would believe that there is no way we would come to the aid of Taiwan.  
As to what is my take. 
China is watching closely the West&#x27;s response to the Russia - Ukraine war. But when it comes to Taiwan Beijing will act according to what is their national security interests, and if they feel threatened they will act irregardless on how the West will respond.</span>

* President Joe Biden kicked off his first full day in Japan by meeting with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace 
* He then met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at Akasaka Palace 
* At a press conference with Kishida, Biden was asked if he was &#x27;willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan&#x27;

Morawiecki.  Morawiecki, answering a question about his government’s energy policy Sunday at a meeting of a youth group, said coal-reliant Poland plans to switch to renewables and nuclear energy, while shedding oil and gas deliveries from Russia and at some point from “Arab” countries as well.

Insider: Sen. Mitt Romney suggests &#x27;NATO could engage&#x27; in Ukraine, &#x27;potentially obliterating Russia&#x27;s struggling military&#x27; if Putin used nuclear weapons 
* Sen. Mitt Romney warned a &quot;cornered and delusional&quot; Putin could use nuclear weapons. 
* In a New York Times op-ed, Romney suggested strategies to face Putin in such a scenario. 
* Romney said continued support of Ukraine was necessary to avoid the subjugation of other countries. 
Republican Sen. Mitt Romney suggested in a New York Times essay that &quot;NATO could engage&quot; in Ukraine, &quot;potentially obliterating Russia&#x27;s struggling military&quot; as an option against Russian President Vladimir Putin were he to deploy nuclear weapons. 
The Utah senator also suggested that the West confront China and other Russian-allied nations with an ultimatum. 
&quot;You are either with us, or you are with Russia — you cannot be with both,&quot; Romney wrote. 
&quot;Russia&#x27;s use of a nuclear weapon would unarguably be a redefining, reorienting geopolitical event,&quot; Romney continued. &quot;Any nation that chose to retain ties with Russia after such an outrage would itself also become a global pariah.&quot;

                              <span>Reuters: Russia makes early debt payment dash in bid to swerve default  
LONDON (Reuters) - Russia initiated payment on two of its external bonds on Friday in an attempt to stave off a looming sovereign default ahead of a key U.S. licence allowing such transfers expiring next week. 
The finance ministry said it channelled $71.25 million on coupon payout for dollar-denominated Eurobonds maturing in 2026 and 26.5 million euros ($28 million) on papers due in 2036. 
Russia has faced the prospect of sovereign default since Western capitals imposed sweeping sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 as well as Moscow introducing counter-measures. The country has been all but severed from the global financial fabric.

                              <span>Daily Mail: Female TV presenters and reporters in Afghanistan forced to cover their faces on air after new Taliban order 
 * Female news presenters in Afghanistan are being made to cover their face on TV 
 * It comes after an order from the Taliban&#x27;s Ministry of Vice and Virtue last week 
 * Women who resisted the rule were threatened with being sacked from their job 
 * It&#x27;s the latest in a series of restrictions put on women in the central Asian country 
Female TV presenters in Afghanistan have appeared on air with their faces covered after the Taliban ordered them to do so or face punishment. 
Some broadcasters had refused to follow the new rules when they came into force yesterday, but did so today under pressure from the country&#x27;s government. 
Women on TV in Afghanistan have presented programmes wearing hijabs, but a new edict ruling that all women must wear a face veil in public or risk punishment was extended to TV presenters from Saturday, meaning they now have to cover their mouths and nose as well.

WNU Editor: I would not be surprised if they are removed completely from the air in the coming months (or sooner).

This month, another threat emerged.  The weakening of the euro has raised expectations that it could reach parity with the US dollar.
Europe faces “a steady stream of bad news,” said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Credit Agricole.  “The euro is a pressure valve for all these concerns, all these fears.”
The currency, which is shared by 19 countries, has not fallen at or below a one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar in two decades.  At the time, in the early 2000s, the weak exchange rate undermine confidence in the new currency, which was introduced in 1999 to help bring unity, prosperity and stability to the region.  A…</span>

Other potential victims of such a ban would be things close to his heart: his populist campaign promises and financial sauce for culture warriors in Europe and the United States.
Both were fueled by Hungary’s profits on Russian crude.  Bursting with cash from cheap supplies of Russian oil and gas, Hungarian energy conglomerate MOL – one of central Europe’s largest and most profitable companies – announced last month that it would pay dividends of $652 million to its shareholders.

                              <span>Chinese consumers “are pissed off, they’re worried about the future,” Dunne said.  “It’s a double whammy that Tesla faces in China.”
Tesla shares are reacting in part to the same forces rocking stock markets around the world: the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, the threat of recession, supply chain chaos and soaring coronavirus. ‘inflation.  But Tesla shares have fallen far more than other Silicon Valley giants like Apple or Alphabet, the company that owns Google.
Tesla accounted for three-quarters of electric cars sold in the United States last year.  The company is several years ahead of its competitors in battery and software technology.  But two models — the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle — accounted for 95% of Tesla’s sales.  Its next consumer vehicle, a pickup truck, has been repeatedly delayed and isn’t expected until next year at the earliest.
It’s an axiom in the automotive industry that new models drive sales.  And competition from Hyundai, Ford and Volkswagen is growing, giving drivers a lot more choice.
Jesse Toprak, an auto industry veteran who is a chief analyst at Autonomy, a company that offers electric cars by subscription, said Tesla’s market share will fall below 40% by the end of 2023. , although its sales will continue to grow as the overall market expands.
“They’ll have a smaller slice of a bigger pot,” Toprak said.  “But their virtual monopoly on U.S. EV sales will slowly diminish.”
Tesla already faces stiff competition in Europe, where electric vehicles account for 13% of new car sales.  This foreshadows what could happen in the United States, where battery car sales are just starting to take off.  Volkswagen, which has invested heavily in electric vehicles, sold 56,000 battery cars in Western Europe in the first three months of the year, second only to Tesla, which sold 58,000, according to figures compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research in Berlin.

                              <span>But determining when and in whom the mutations first appeared requires many more virus samples from farm workers, local residents and mink, collected before and after the outbreak.  “That data doesn’t exist,” said Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.
Throughout 2020, testing has been difficult for Americans to access, and few patient samples have been sequenced.  Surveillance in animals was even worse; until this springfederal officials have explicitly recommended against routinely testing animals for the virus.
“Large-scale testing was not available and then there was a shortage of some supplies,” Dr Behravesh said.  “So we didn’t want there to be, you know, a mad rush to test animals.”
Without more samples, it’s impossible to rule out the possibility that the variant originated in humans, who then spread it to mink, the scientists said.
A bigger puzzle is how the taxidermist and his wife got it.  The most likely possibility, according to several experts, is that the variant was circulating more widely in the human population than previously known, and that the couple caught it from another infected person.
Another possibility, more speculative, is that they have recovered the variant from another animal species.  “Taxisdermists deal with other dead animals,” said Linda Saif, a virologist and immunologist at Ohio State University.
But because the cases were detected “weeks to months” after the two fell ill, testing every animal they might have come into contact with “was not feasible or not indicated”, he said. said Lynn Sutfin, Michigan DHHS spokeswoman.

The spacecraft was built for NASA to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station.  But before it can do that, it has to perform a test flight without astronauts to show that all of its systems are working properly.
“Today we feel really good and have great confidence in the vehicle,” Mark Nappi, vice president and commercial crew program manager at Boeing, said at a press conference hours after the launch. launch.
Two thrusters failed during a maneuver to place Starliner in a stable orbit, but the spacecraft was able to self-adjust with its remaining thrusters, and it continued on its way.  Engineers are investigating what went wrong.
