Berlin should borrow money to subsidize energy for companies or risk losing its industry, Robert Habeck cautions. 
Germany faces five difficult years of green industrial transition that &quot;will put a burden&quot; on people, Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned — while urging his government to approve fresh subsidies to safeguard the country&#x27;s industrial base. 
Reacting to a new report by the International Monetary Fund that projects Germany&#x27;s economy will shrink 0.3 percentage points this year, Habeck told German public broadcaster ARD on Wednesday evening, &quot;The data certainly isn&#x27;t good.&quot; 
Germany&#x27;s statistical office had already warned in May that the country entered into a recession. Some of Germany&#x27;s biggest companies have begun to ditch the fatherland, triggering fears of deindustrialization.

WNU Editor: I have a few friends in Germany. They cannot believe what is happening to their country. The German economy is being de-industrialized in front of everyone&#x27;s eyes. And now this .... Germany expected to be only major economy not to grow this year (Euronews/AP). 
It should be noted that there was a time when Robert Habeck, one of two co-leaders of the Greens, was the most popular politician in Germany (link here). Is he still the most popular politician in Germany? Not if this economic disaster continues.

 
Update: The Duran were the first to talk about the de-industrialization of Germany. Their analysis (below) on where this is leading to is a must see.</span>

Here is an easy prediction. 
The former finance minister will blame the West for stealing all the missing money. In particular France, a country that is already despised in much of the Sahel .... Why France faces so much anger in West Africa (BBC).</span>

                              <span>BBC: Niger coup: West African leaders threaten military intervention 
West African leaders have threatened military action against Niger&#x27;s military junta after it took power in a coup last week 
The leaders gave the junta seven days to reinstate President Mohamed Bazoum, who is being held captive. 
Earlier, the junta warned it would resist any &quot;plan of aggression against Niger&quot; by regional or Western powers. 
Meanwhile hundreds of coup supporters protested outside the French embassy in the capital Niamey. 
Leaders from Ecowas, the bloc of West African nations, held crisis talks in Nigeria on Sunday to discuss the latest coup - which follows army takeovers in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso. 
A statement read out after the summit said that Ecowas had &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for coups.

The regional bloc would &quot;take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order&quot; if its demands were not met within a week.

Reuters: Ukraine Extends Martial Law, Ruling Out October Parliament Vote 
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine&#x27;s parliament voted on Thursday to extend martial law by another 90 days until Nov. 15, ruling out the possibility of parliamentary elections being held in October. 
Ukraine brought in martial law on Feb. 24, 2022, the day Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour. 
The law, which bars 18- to 60-year-old men from leaving the country, has since been extended several times.

Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a member of parliament, said on the Telegram messaging app that an overwhelming majority of lawmakers voted to extend martial law in a session of the Verkhovna Rada parliament.

The heavy armor has stopped an attack by two tanks and several military vehicles, Russian media has reported . 

A single Russian tank supported by artillery has stopped a Ukrainian attack that involved around a dozen armored equipment pieces, Russian media reported on Saturday. A video of the battle first appeared on Telegram channels and was then posted by RIA Novosti. 
The fighting took place in Zaporozhye Region, where the Ukrainian troops sought to assault Russian defensive positions, the news agency reported. Russia’s aerial reconnaissance detected a Ukrainian column moving towards the frontline. “We had an armor piece in this area,” a Russian unit commander told RIA Novosti, adding that the tank’s crew was ordered to intercept the enemy and “engaged in a battle.”

WNU Editor: I think what we are seeing here is what happens when everything goes right for one side, and everything goes wrong for the other. 
On the Russian side we see a tank supported by drone observers (two of them), knowing where the mine fields are, followed with artillery and missile support. On the Ukraine side we see no drone observers, restricted in movement because they did not know where the mines are, and no artillery support.
 Luck (and bad luck) also probably played a role.</span>

ABC News Australia: Ukraine&#x27;s navy is no match for Russia, but it has made waves in the Black Sea by using unconventional warfare 
Throughout Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, battles have mainly been fought on land. 
But since this month&#x27;s attack on the Crimean Bridge, and the grain export agreement going from deal to no deal, all eyes have been on the Black Sea. 
An interesting power dynamic has been playing out in the maritime arena, which is usually dominated by the side with the biggest ships and navy. 
Ukraine went into the conflict casting a &quot;mere shadow&quot; in the water against Russia&#x27;s Black Sea fleet, said Alexey Muraviev, a leading analyst on the Russian military and associate professor at Curtin University. 
&quot;In terms of conventional naval warfare, the Ukrainian navy was no match for the Russians,&quot; he told the ABC.

Ukraine CNN  — At a secret makeshift military base a nondescript van and pickup truck tow two gray objects covered by tarpaulin mounted on trailers. 
 In the driving rain, they resemble something more akin to a Boston Whaler, rather than hiding one of Ukraine’s most closely guarded secrets.
Perched on the banks of a secret lake, CNN was given exclusive access to the base where much-vaunted sea – or surface – drones are tested.

Reuters: Russia Extends Conscription for Compulsory Military Service up to Age 30 
 (Reuters) -Russia&#x27;s lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to raise the maximum age at which men can be conscripted to 30 years from 27, increasing the number of young men liable for a year of compulsory military service at any one time. 
Last year, Russia announced a plan to boost its professional and conscripted combat personnel by more than 30% to 1.5 million, an ambitious task made harder by its heavy but undisclosed casualties in Ukraine. 
The new legislation, which comes into effect on Jan. 1, means men will be required to carry out a year of military service, or equivalent training during higher education, between the ages of 18 and 30, rather than 18 and 27 as now.

Reuters: More Wagner fighters move closer to Polish border, Poland PM says 
WARSAW (Reuters) - A group of a hundred soldiers from the Russian Wagner group have moved closer to the Belarusian city of Grodno near the Polish border, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday. 
Poland, a former Warsaw Pact member which has been a full member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance since 1999, has been concerned about the possible spillover of war on to its territory ever since Russian invaded Ukraine in February 2022. 
Earlier this month, Poland began moving more than 1,000 troops to the east of the country amid rising concerns that the presence of Wagner fighters in Belarus could lead to increased tension on its border.

Zero Hedge: US Was Behind Both Crimean Bridge Attacks: Seymour Hersh 
Legendary national security journalist Seymour Hersh has published a report this week alleging US intelligence helped the Ukrainians blow up the Kerch Bridge (or also, Crimean Bridge), which happened earlier this month and corresponded to President Putin refusing to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative deal. 
What&#x27;s more is that Hersh&#x27;s sources described that the US assisted in the initial, larger Kerch Bridge explosion which had initially temporarily disabled it in Octobe…</span>

New York Times: U.S. Hunts Chinese Malware That Could Disrupt American Military Operations 
The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to American military, intelligence and national security officials. 
The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People’s Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.

Warzone/The Drive: Northrop Grumman Bails On Next Generation Fighter Competition

 
Northrop Grumman has decided to focus on other opportunities, among them is the Navy’s own 6th generation fighter program.  
Northrop Grumman has removed itself from the running, at least as a prime contractor, to design and build a new sixth-generation stealthy crewed combat jet under the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. This is in line with a report last month that the field of NGAD combat jet competitors had shrunk from three to two, with the remaining pair widely believed to be Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company has left open the possibility of joining another NGAD team led by a different prime contractor. 
Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman&#x27;s CEO, spoke of her company&#x27;s current strategy around the Air Force&#x27;s multi-faceted NGAD program during an earning call earlier today. In May, the service announced it had formally released a classified contract solicitation for the engineering and manufacturing phase of the development of the NGAD combat jet. This aircraft is ostensibly intended to replace the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, but is expected to have significantly more expansive capabilities that go well beyond a traditional fighter concept.

                              <span>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Thousands of flag-waving Israelis renewed their protests nationwide after sundown on Saturday, capping a week of turmoil in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed through a highly-contested law that limited some Supreme Court power. 
From a remote intersection among the lush hills of the northern Galilee to the avenues criss-crossing the financial hub of Tel Aviv, protesters beating drums and blaring horns took to the streets on a hot evening at the end of Sabbath.</span>

According to a report from Rolling Stone, the fast-talking Ramaswamy, who has risen to double-digit figures in recent polls and is catching up with Trump rival Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), has found an audience that is intrigued by his presidential bid and that some Christian Nationalists like him -- they just wouldn&#x27;t vote for him.
As Rolling Stone&#x27;s Tim Dickinson wrote, a recent meet-up that included Pastors for Trump revealed a strong undercurrent of wariness of Ramaswamy due to his religion.

The police investigations into serious arson center around the deceased 45-year-old man and 22-year-old woman, a police spokesman said on Saturday, adding that the investigation is still in its early stages. 
The two jumped from the 12th floor of the 15-story building in the Kreuzberg district in a blaze that broke out on Friday afternoon. Flames were leaping behind them from the flat.</span>

Laura Nickel and Max Teske were working in the high school in Burg, a picturesque town in the eastern state of Brandenburg popular with tourists, when they noticed worrying behaviour among some of their students.
&quot;Right-wing extremism was on full display in the school,&quot; Nickel, 34, told AFP. &quot;From Hitler salutes to swastikas drawn on dictionaries and students&#x27; lockers, not to mention racist and homophobic language.&quot;
&quot;They were really the loudest pupils -- they did not hide,&quot; she added.
In April, the teachers sent an anonymous letter to the local press denouncing the behaviour they had witnessed.

The vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling India and Bangladesh hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest populations of Bengal tigers.
Their pelts, bones and flesh are bought by black marketeers as part of a broader illegal wildlife trade valued at an estimated $20 billion globally each year.
Research from big cat conservation group Panthera and the Chinese Academy of Sciences said tiger parts harvested in the Sundarbans have been exported to 15 countries, with India and China being the most common destinations.

The temperature on board the Fremantle Highway had dropped, a coastguard spokeswoman told dpa on Friday. The freighter, loaded with about 3,800 cars, was now lying stable about 17 kilometers north of the island of Terschelling. 
The ship is being held in position by a tugboat. Salvage crews briefly boarded the vessel and had established &quot;a new more robust towing connection,&quot; the coastguard said.</span>

                              <span>General Abdourahamane Tchiani is the new leader of Niger following a military takeover, state television reported Friday, two days after the country’s president was detained by members of his own guard.
Tchiani, the head of the Presidential Guard, has been named &quot;president of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland,&quot; a statement said.
Appearing on state television, the general said soldiers had seized power to the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel country.
The country’s elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, has been detained by the putschists since Wednesday morning.
Earlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron described the coup as &quot;dangerous&quot; for the region as Western powers scramble to preserve a key ally in the insurgent-stricken Sahel.
&quot;This coup is completely illegitimate and profoundly dangerous, for Nigeriens, for Niger and for the whole region,&quot; Macron said.
Macron said he had spoken to Bazoum, who is being held in his palace, and called for him to be reinstated.
Niger&#x27;s government had been seen by many in the international community as a bulwark against Islamist militancy in a vast, arid region that is beset by security challenges.
French and UN troops were in recent years forced to withdraw from neighboring Mali, but Paris still has 1,500 soldiers in Niger. Bazoum&#x27;s overthrow could put the future of their deployment in doubt.
Macron, speaking during a visit to Papua New Guinea, said it was imperative that the constitutional order be restored and vowed to support regional groupings like ECOWAS in mediation or sanctions against putschists.

                              <span>Japan said Friday that North Korea posed a more serious threat to its national security than &quot;ever before&quot;, as nuclear-armed Pyongyang rattles its neighbors with repeated missile tests and belligerent rhetoric.
In its annual white paper -- a rundown of the most pressing military threats and plans to ensure stability -- Japan&#x27;s defense ministry made a case for a significant hike in domestic defense spending as the world enters &quot;a new era of crisis&quot;.
While China&#x27;s growing military might and Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine were major focuses of the white paper, North Korea also ranked as a key concern for Japan.
&quot;North Korea&#x27;s military activities pose an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan&#x27;s national security than ever before,&quot; the document said.

                              <span>Representatives from various African and Caribbean entities joined forces at a historic event this week in the capital of Barbados, Bridgetown, to demand reparations for slavery and its legacy in today&#x27;s society.
The University of the West Indies (UWI), the Economic, Social and Cultural Council of the African Union (AU), Barbados&#x27; government, grant-making network Open Society Foundations and the Caribbean Pan African Network teamed up to &quot;call for reparations for historical crimes&quot;.
The meeting in Bridgetown, from Monday to Thursday, included strategy sessions and plenaries and marked the beginning of an &quot;intercontinental campaign&quot;, the UWI said in a statement, describing it as &quot;ground-breaking&quot;.
Attendees included ambassadors and representatives from AU member states and the Caribbean Community political and economic union (CARICOM).
&quot;This is a historic moment... humanity cannot go forward with all the toxic interferences of colonisation,&quot; Hilary Beckles, head of the CARICOM reparations commission, told a news conference on Thursday. &quot;We have to clean up this mess to allow humanity to function.&quot;
Outcomes of the meeting include a proposal for a roadmap for cooperation between the AU and CARICOM, the UWI statement said.
&quot;It is crucial to recognize how slavery, colonialism and racism intersect and impact the lives of Black people around the world,&quot; said AU official Youssouf Mandoha.

There are new, advanced types that can sense movement or destroy vehicles from hundreds of meters away. Most common, however, are older, simple weapons that were produced in the tens of millions and fill the armories of both the Ukraini...</span>

In a revised indictment, prosecutors accused Trump of seeking to erase security camera footage at Mar-a-Lago. 
Special counsel Jack Smith has brought three new felony charges against former President Donald Trump, including explosive claims that he asked an employee of his Mar-a-Lago club to delete security camera footage sought by investigators probing his handling of classified documents. 
In a 60-page superseding indictment unveiled Thursday, prosecutors also accused Trump of possessing a highly classified war plan that he shared with people lacking security clearances months after his presidency ended. 
And prosecutors added a third defendant: Carlos De Oliveira, a worker at Mar-a-Lago who is accused of joining Trump and aide Walt Nauta to seek the destruction of the security footage.

                              <span>WNU Editor: In the past two days the Western news media narrative is that Ukraine is making significant gains with Russia retreating from three main frontal attacks (see videos above). 
The Russian news media narrative is the opposite .... More Western-made Ukrainian tanks destroyed – Moscow (RT). More here .... Russia’s Battlegroup South repels attacks of Ukrainian assault groups in three directions (TASS). 
So who is right? 
I am not there, but it looks like Ukraine has committed everything in the past few days (including all of its reserves) to break the Russian lines even though there is no air support for their offensive. Ukraine needs a major victory, and they need it in the next few weeks. 
On a side note. It is reported that Putin told African leaders last night during a Russia - Africa summit dinner that the Kremlin believes Ukraine has only enough weaponry, ammo, and men to continue the offensive until the end of August. After that the Ukraine army, without more support from the West, will have a problem holding back any Russian counteroffensive should the Kremlin decide to launch one.</span>

                              <span>Responsible Statecraft: Moscow and Washington shadowboxing in the skies over Syria

 
Tensions related to the war in Ukraine are resulting in actual physical altercations on another battlefront thousands of miles away. 
U.S.-Russian tensions continued to rise this week as two U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones were damaged by flares released from Russian jets over Syria. 
The first incident on Sunday damaged the drone’s propeller but did not cause it to crash, but it echoed a similar episode over the Black Sea in March when the drone crashed after a collision with a Russian jet. Another incident occurred Wednesday over northwest Syria and resulted in damage to one of the drone’s wings. 
That makes for a reported total of six incidents involving Russian and American aircraft in July. The confrontations were a reminder of the potential dangers of U.S. and Russian forces operating in close proximity to each other in Syria, and they raise the question of why U.S. forces are still operating in a country where they have no legal mandate.

Tokyo’s annual defence white paper sets out plans to increase spending  
Japan has warned that deepening military co-operation between China and Russia is of “grave concern” for its security, in the country’s first defence white paper since it set out plans to expand defence spending last year. 
 Beijing and Moscow kicked off their largest joint naval and air exercise in the Sea of Japan earlier this month, underscoring how their collaboration has gained pace following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The white paper, which was approved by prime minister Fumio Kishida’s cabinet on Friday, also noted that the overall military balance between China and Taiwan was “rapidly tilting” in Beijing’s favour.

A US intelligence report has alleged China is likely supplying Russia&#x27;s army in Ukraine. 

It claimed Beijing was an &quot;increasingly important buttress for Russia in its war effort, probably supplying Moscow with key technology and dual-use equipment used in Ukraine.
&quot; 

Navigation equipment, jamming technology and fighter jet parts were some of the items being supplied by China, despite international controls.

                              <span>Reuters: Niger coup leaders dissolve govt, declare Tiani head of state 
NIAMEY (Reuters) -Leaders of the coup in Niger declared General Abdourahamane Tiani as the new head of state on Friday, and said they had suspended the constitution and dissolved all former institutions after overthrowing President Mohamed Bazoum. 
Tiani was the head of the presidential guard, whose soldiers shut Bazoum in his palace on Wednesday and said it had ousted him because of bad governance and worsening security. 
The general appeared on state television on Friday with a banner on the screen that described him as the president of a newly formed military council, the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland (CNSP).
&quot;The President of the CNSP is the head of state. He represents the state of Niger in international relations,&quot; an officer said, reading out a statement.

European Central Bank policymakers delivered another interest rate increase as anticipated, with eurozone consumer prices still rising fast.  But ECB chief Christine Lagarde sent dovish signals, leaving open the possibility of a pause in its streak of rate hikes as the eurozone&#x27;s economic outlook has deteriorated.

The accident happened in the early afternoon at Laguna lake, near Manila, hours after Typhoon Doksuri had swept out of the northern Philippines.
&quot;Some survivors begged us to rescue those trapped beneath the boat,&quot; resident Monica de la Cruz, who watched the rescue effort off the municipality of Binangonan, told AFP.
&quot;They were crying and some of them were injured.&quot;
Cruz said the accident took place following a &quot;sudden gust of wind, big waves and rain&quot;, with locals initially too afraid to assist, fearing they would be &quot;dragged down as well&quot;.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
