                              <span>Australia’s trade relations with China have undergone a major $160 million development.

The sanction on the export of Australian hay has been lifted after three years of being implemented. 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed in September that exports of Australian hay to Chinese ports will resume in the coming weeks.

The announcement follows the lifting of sanctions on products like coal, cotton and timber but they remain in place on some other items, like Australian wine.

Before the pandemic, the hay trade with China was worth around $160 million a year.</span>

                              <span>A 32-year-old student was arrested after a shooting rampage in Rotterdam, Netherlands, that left three people dead. The shooting began in a private home, where a woman was killed and her daughter was seriously injured, later succumbing to her injuries. The suspect then went to a classroom at a nearby university hospital, where he shot and killed a doctor. The suspect, who studied at the university, was apprehended under the hospital&#x27;s helipad. The authorities believe the suspect acted alone and are investigating the motive. The Dutch Prime Minister expressed his condolences and gratitude to the emergency services.</span>

                              <span>CNN: A NATO country could soon have a pro-Russian leader 
Slovakia is getting ready to elect its fifth prime minister in just four years, and with Kremlin sympathizer Robert Fico’s opposition party leading the polls, it is one being watched with alarm in the West. 
 Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Slovakia has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies. The two countries share a border, Slovakia was the first country to send air defenses to Ukraine and it welcomed tens of thousands of refugees. 
But all that could change if Fico comes to power. The former prime minister makes no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and has blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Russia’s President Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Putin has used to justify his invasion.

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year 
Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year, funneling massive resources into its Ukraine offensive to fight what it calls a &quot;hybrid war&quot; unleashed by the West. 
With Moscow&#x27;s &quot;special military operation&quot; now dragging through its 20th month, both sides have been digging deep and procuring weapons from allies in preparation for a protracted conflict. 
The announcement came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the defense ministers of Britain and France visited Kyiv, where President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied for more air defense systems.

                              <span>President Joe Biden delivered a speech in Arizona, warning that Donald Trump and his allies pose a threat to America&#x27;s democratic institutions. Biden referred to the MAGA movement as an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of democracy. Despite facing low approval ratings and concerns about his age, Biden is focused on protecting democratic institutions. He chose Arizona, near the McCain Institute, to honor the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican who prioritized country over party. Biden aims to avoid alienating moderate Republicans while addressing the spread of anti-democratic rhetoric.</span>

                              <span>The US Senate is pushing for a bipartisan stopgap funding bill to prevent a government shutdown, while the House prepares to vote on partisan Republican spending bills.

The funding fight revolves around a small portion of the overall budget and does not involve cuts to popular benefit programs. The risk of a shutdown remains high as the two chambers take different approaches to funding.</span>

                              <span>Ten Niger soldiers were killed in a militant attack in the country&#x27;s southwest near the tri-border zone of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. The attackers responsible for the attack remain unidentified. Al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates are active in the region and frequently target soldiers and civilians. The army responded to the attack with ground troops and helicopters. Niger has experienced a decline in attacks under former President Mohamed Bazoum, who engaged with Islamists and rural communities. Protests have also been held demanding the withdrawal of French troops.</span>

He and his co-conspirators billed and received payment from Medicare for services that were never provided.

Pancholi faces significant prison time for his crimes.</span>

                              <span>Russian nuclear saber-rattling and coercion have loomed large throughout the Russo-Ukrainian War. This dangerous rhetoric has been amplified and radicalized by AI-powered technology — “false-flag” cyber operations, fake news, and deepfakes. Throughout the war, both sides have invoked the specter of nuclear catastrophe, including false Russian claims that Ukraine was building a “dirty bomb” and President Volodymyr Zelensky’s allegation that Russia had planted explosives to cause a nuclear disaster at a Ukrainian power plant. The world is once again forced to grapple with the psychological effects of the most destructive weapons the world has ever known in a new era

                              <span>North Korea has expelled a US soldier who crossed into the country through the demilitarised zone in July.

Private Travis King has been in custody for the past two months and is now on his way back to America.

The Pentagon confirmed the return of Army Private Travis King from North Korea where he’s been held since July.

Early Wednesday Pyongyang said it had expelled King after officials finished questioning him but the Biden Administration told a different story saying it secured his return through diplomatic channels.

It’s still unclear what prompted Private King to run across the Korean Demilitarised Zone however his family suggests he might be suffering from a mental health crisis.</span>

The Union Pacific rail yard, located near historically Black neighborhoods, has been blamed for an increase in cancer cases. The wood preservative creosote, used at the site until the 1980s, has contaminated the groundwater. The relocation program could cost up to $35 million, with the city seeking additional funding sources.</span>

Although the quake startled residents, it caused no injuries or damage. The Campi Flegrei is a flat volcano that has recently shown increased activity. Experts believe that there may be more intense tremors in the future. The area is home to half a million people, and the last eruption occurred in 1538. The recent spike in activity is likely caused by gas bubbling up, making an eruption less likely.</span>

                              <span>DW: Nagorno-Karabakh: Nearly half of ethnic Armenians flee 
Yerevan said more than 50,000 ethnic Armenians have fled in fear of reprisal from Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, Germany and the US are pushing to get independent observers into the breakaway region. 
The Armenian government said at least 53,000 ethnic Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh since Azerbaijan&#x27;s operation last week to take control of the breakaway region. 
Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday called on Azerbaijan to allow international observers into Nagorno-Karabakh, to show Baku&#x27;s commitment to protecting the people living there. 
US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has also underlined the need for international observers and humanitarian aid in the region in a talk with Azerbaijan&#x27;s President Aliyev, Washington says.

                              <span>WNU Editor: The big news that I have been hearing for the past two days from Russia is that the Russian Ministry of Defense believes if current trends continue, Russia will be well positioned to end the SMO (Special military Operation) by 2025. 
I am not that optimistic. 
In the past few days I have been reflecting on the war, and I do not see this ending in the next year or two. I see the opposite. This Ukraine counteroffensive has burned its best troops and thousands of pieces of Western equipment, and in any other situation a government would sue for peace. But the West, specifically the U.S. government and some of its allies, are hell-bent on continuing this war. They are going to continue the flow of monies and war equipment to Kyiv, even if it will mean the death of hundreds of thousands of more Ukrainians. And if President Biden is re-elected in 2024, God only knows where this conflict is going to end.</span>

                              <span>Ryan was happy to welcome back Lt. Gen. Brian Robinson and Lt. Gen. Andrea Tullos back onto the show. These Air Force leaders lead Air Education and Training Command and Air University, respectively, the latter of which is a major component of the former. As such, they work together all the time (and aren’t dueling, but fun title right?). In this episode, they speak to Ryan about what they and their teams are doing to ensure the U.S. Air Force is trained at the highest level possible in order to ensure readiness. Robinson was on the show last year about related topics.

Now, an estimated 13,000 ethnic Armenians have fled from the enclave and the Armenian government has said that an

                              <span>US soldier Travis King is in American custody after leaving North Korea, where he had been held since running across the border from the South in July, a US official said on Wednesday.
Washington&#x27;s announcement came hours after North Korea&#x27;s state news agency said Pyongyang had decided to expel King, in a surprise move amid deepening tensions on the Korean peninsula.
King was detained by North Korea after crossing the frontier on July 18 after he joined a sightseeing tour of the Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas.
&quot;I have good news for you, I can immediately confirm that Private Travis King is in US custody,&quot; a senior US administration official said on condition of anonymity.

Nygard, the 82-year-old founder of one of Canada&#x27;s largest clothing brands, Nygard International, has pleaded not guilty to five charges of sexual assault and one of forcible confinement in the trial -- the first of several he faces in Canada and the United States.
The claims have seen the Finnish-Canadian likened to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the US financier who killed himself in 2019 as he awaited trial for sex crimes.

Rota lost support of key Liberal ministers on Tuesday 
Liberal MP Anthony Rota is stepping down as House of Commons Speaker after inviting a Ukrainian veteran who fought in a Nazi division to Parliament — a dramatic turn of events that will be welcomed by MPs on all sides who said the embarrassing incident was unforgivable. 
Rota&#x27;s resignation will take effect at the end of the sitting day on Wednesday. 
&quot;This House is above any of us, Therefore, I must step down as your Speaker,&quot; Rota said at 2 p.m. ahead of Tuesday&#x27;s question period. &quot;I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognizing an individual in the House.

DW: South Korea, China and Japan make plans for rare summit 
Diplomats from Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo have met to explore restarting regular three-way summits to foster regional cooperation. 
The initiative has been on hold for the past few years.

South Korean, Chinese and Japanese senior diplomats agreed on Tuesday that their national leaders should meet at the &quot;earliest convenient time,&quot; Seoul&#x27;s Foreign Ministry said after a rare meeting. 
The sides are seeking to reboot trilateral exchanges after regular annual meetings were put on hold because of strained relations and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emmanuel Macron says he will consult coup leaders on withdrawal after two months of defying their expulsion order 
France will withdraw its ambassador from Niger followed by the French military contingent in the next months, Emmanuel Macron has said in the aftermath of the coup in the west African country that ousted the pro-Paris president. 
The French president’s announcement appeared to end two months of defiance in which Paris’s ambassador had been kept in place in Niamey despite coup leaders ordering him to leave.

The Philippine coast guard also released a video showing a diver using a knife to cut a rope attached to buoys.

                              <span>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held talks Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron in Rome, against a backdrop of tensions between the two countries over migration.
The French leader was in the Italian capital to attend the state funeral of former president Giorgio Napolitano, who died on Friday aged 98.
A sharp rise in migrant landings to the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month reignited a bitter debate across the EU over who takes responsibility for asylum seekers.
There has been particularly heated rhetoric in France, where political parties in the country’s hung parliament are wrangling over a draft law governing new arrivals.
“We cannot leave the Italians alone,” Macron said in a television interview on Sunday—an offer of help that Meloni immediately said she “w…</span>

                              <span>Royalty graced the Asian Games on Tuesday with Thai Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana saddling up in the equestrian after being encouraged by the king to &quot;go for it&quot;.
The 36-year-old, who competed at the 2006 Games in badminton, is part of Thailand&#x27;s dressage contingent, riding in the team and individual competitions in Hangzhou.
&quot;I will do my best for (the people of Thailand),&quot; she said at the Tonglu Equestrian Centre.
&quot;They&#x27;re my cheerleaders, my power, my fuel. I play for the Thai people.&quot;
The princess, the only daughter of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his former wife Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, is at her third Asian Games.
As well as badminton in 2006, she also rode in the 2014 Games in South Korea.
&quot;Luckily our father is supporting us. He has always said, &#x27;Go for it! You want to do it? Do it,&#x27;&quot; said the princess, who learned to ride aged nine and trained in France.
&quot;He knows that what drives my heart is horses and badminton. Since my grandfather&#x27;s time, the royal family has always competed in sports.&quot;
She is the latest in a line of royals to compete in top-level equestrianism -- Britain&#x27;s Zara Phillips was a 2012 Olympics silver medallist.
Away from the sporting domain, Sirivannavari is a keen fashion designer and has had shows at Paris Fashion Week.
She cited her sister as inspiration for being in China.
&quot;I do it for my sister. My sister is a horse-lover and a show-jumper and she wants to be on the national team, but she cannot make it,&quot; she said.
&quot;So she gave everything to me: all the information, all of her strategy, all of the equipment.&quot;
Her elder sister, Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol, was hospitalised late last year for heart, lung and kidney issues.</span>

                              <span>South Korea staged its first military parade in a decade on Tuesday, showcasing its advanced arsenal in the face of plummeting ties with nuclear-armed North Korea.
Pyongyang regularly puts on huge military parades but such events in Seoul are traditionally arranged every five years to mark South Korea&#x27;s Armed Forces Day.
The last parade was in 2013. Five years later, then-president Moon Jae-in chose to hold a celebratory ceremony instead of a military event, in line with his conciliatory approach to North Korea.
Around 4,000 troops marched through central Seoul on a rain-soaked afternoon, cheered by umbrella-bearing crowds who waved South Korean flags.
They were accompanied by 170 pieces of military equipment, including air and sea drones, tanks and missiles.

                              <span>The United States said Monday it refused a request by Iran&#x27;s foreign minister to visit Washington last week, pointing to concerns about Tehran&#x27;s record including past detentions of US citizens.
Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian reportedly sought to travel to visit Iran&#x27;s consular interest section following the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
&quot;They did make that request and it was denied by the State Department,&quot; spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
&quot;We do have an obligation to allow Iranian officials and other officials of foreign governments to travel to New York for UN business. But we do not have an obligation to allow them to travel to Washington, DC,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Cuba&#x27;s embassy in Washington was attacked by a man using two Molotov cocktails on Sunday night, the country&#x27;s foreign minister said, describing the incident as a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;.
&quot;The Cuban embassy in the US was the target of a terrorist attack by an individual who launched 2 Molotov cocktails. The staff suffered no harm,&quot; said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.
This was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. 
The Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.
In New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel&#x27;s presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.
&quot;The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about,&quot; said Rodriguez after Sunday&#x27;s attack.
In April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d&#x27;affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his &quot;energetic protest&quot; over what he called a &quot;terrorist aggression&quot; against his embassy.
That shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. 
US authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.
Alazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including &quot;violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon&quot;, according to the US Justice Department.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
