* Moscow to base nuclear arms outside of the country for first time since 1990s 
* Iskander missile systems have already been transferred to Belarus, Putin claims  Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring 
Belarus in response to Britain&#x27;s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds, President Vladimir Putin announced today. 
The rounds which are set to be provided to Kyiv&#x27;s forces contain depleted uranium, and Moscow has falsely claimed that they have nuclear components as it escalates its confrontation with Ukraine and its allies. 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch supporter of the invasion, has long asked for the weapons on the territory, Putin said during an interview on Russian state television.

WNU editor: The Kremlin is saying that this nuclear weapons deployment is a response to the UK&#x27;s announcement that they are going to send depleted uranium shells to Ukraine.

President Biden&#x27;s comments come after Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week 
President Biden had a tense exchange with a reporter when asked about Russia and China&#x27;s economic relationship, arguing that their partnership is &quot;vastly exaggerate[d].&quot; 
Biden held a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa on Friday. A reporter asked Biden what he thought the significance of the Russia-China alliance was. 
&quot;In ten years, Russia and China have had 40 meetings, 40 meetings,&quot; Biden began. &quot;And I disagree with the basic premise of your question.&quot;

USNI News: NORTHCOM: Russia Close to Persistent Nuclear Cruise Missile Attack Sub Presence off U.S. Coasts 
Russia could have its most powerful and quiet nuclear attack submarines on persistent patrols off either U.S. Coast in the next two years, the head of U.S. Northern Command told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
In response to questions from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) on the threat of Chinese and Russian cruise missile submarines operating close to the U.S., NORTHCOM commander Gen. Glen VanHerck said that the deployments of the Russian Yasen-class nuclear cruise missile attack boats have been deploying more frequently. 
“[The risk is] absolutely increasing. Within the last year, Russia has also placed their [Yasens] in the Pacific,” he said.  “Now not only the Atlantic, but we also have them in the Pacific and it’s just a matter of time – probably a year or two – before that’s a persistent threat, 24 hours a day. … That impact has reduced decision space for a national senior leader in a time of crisis.”

WASHINGTON — The conflict in northeast Syria escalated on Friday as Iran-backed militias launched a volley of rocket and drone attacks against coalition bases after American reprisals for a drone attack that killed a U.S. contractor and injured six other Americans. 
President Biden, speaking at a news conference in Canada, sought to tamp down fears that tit-for-tat strikes between the United States and militant groups could spiral out of control, while at the same time warning Tehran to rein in its proxies. 
“Make no mistake, the United States does not, does not, I emphasize, seek conflict with Iran,” Mr. Biden said in Ottawa, where he was making a state visit. “But be prepared for us to act forcefully to protect our people. That’s exactly what happened last night.”

Business Insider: Top US general predicts that much of the world&#x27;s armies, navies, and air forces &#x27;will be robotic&#x27; in 15 years, if not sooner 
* The top US general says technology is changing the ways that wars are being fought. 
* He said that robots will play a huge role in the world&#x27;s armies, navies, and air forces within the next decade or so. 
* Gen. Mark Milley also highlighted the role of artificial intelligence as a military application. 
Technology is changing the ways that war is being fought, and the top US general predicts this will lead to an increasing use of robots in armies, navies, and air forces. 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told the Eurasia Group Foundation on a podcast that the world is undergoing a &quot;fundamental change&quot; in the &quot;character of war.&quot; 
Unlike the &quot;nature of war,&quot; which Milley described to mean human dynamics and intra-country relationships, he clarified that the character of the war incorporates items like tactics, weapons, technologies, organizations, and management.

* The German lender’s shares retreated for a third consecutive day and have now lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month. 
* The emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS, in the wake of the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, triggered contagion concern among investors, which was deepened by further monetary policy tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. 
Deutsche Bank shares fell on Friday following a spike in credit default swaps Thursday night, as concerns about the stability of European banks persisted. 
The Frankfurt-listed stock was down 14% at one point during the session but trimmed losses to close 8.6% lower on Friday afternoon. 
The German lender’s Frankfurt-listed shares retreated for a third consecutive day and have now lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month. Credit default swaps — a form of insurance for a company’s bondholders against its default — leapt to 173 basis points Thursday night from 142 basis points the previous day.

                              <span>EurAsian Times: Russian Pilots ‘Spill The Beans’ On How They Intercepted US MQ-9 Reaper Drone Over The Black Sea 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu awarded the Order of Courage to the pilots that ‘downed’ the US MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea.
Last week, the Russian Defense Ministry said a US MQ-9 drone plunged into the Black Sea after engaging in sharp maneuvering, noting that Russian fighter jets sent to intercept it did not come into contact with it nor used weapons against it. 
The ministry said the air control of the Russian Aerospace Forces recorded the drone’s flight in the Crimean peninsula’s region in the direction of the Russian border.

Meeting is part of high-profile tour as Brazil’s president attempts to repair country’s reputation after the Bolsonaro era 
One of them wants the world to know his country is battling its way back to its former glory after three years of zero-Covid lockdowns and a long and humiliating history of foreign exploitation. 
The other wants to signal his country is bouncing back from four chaotic years under a far-right populist who took a sledgehammer to its place in the world. 
The two revival-seeking politicians – China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – will meet in Beijing next week during a high-profile tour that is part of the latter’s efforts to repair his country’s overseas reputation after Jair Bolsonaro’s era of antagonism and isolation.

                              <span>The Hill: Pentagon chief: Putin-Xi meeting sends ‘very troubling message’ 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday said Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia sends a “troubling message.” 
Xi earlier this week concluded his three-day visit to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a visit seen by the West as Beijing doubling down on its support for the Kremlin in its war in Ukraine. 
“Xi’s visit to Putin and remaining there for a couple of days I think sends a very troubling message, a message of support,” Austin told lawmakers on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee. 
While the U.S. military has not assessed Beijing as yet providing any military weapons or equipment to Moscow, “certainly just showing support by his presence there, I think, is very troubling,” Austin said.

France 24: China says again drove away US warship in South China Sea; US says asserting navigational rights 
China’s defence ministry said on Friday that it yet again had to monitor and drive away the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Milius that entered its territorial waters in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands. 
“We sternly demand the U.S. to immediately stop such provocative acts, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen incidents,” a spokesperson said in a statement from the Ministry of National Defence. 
The U.S. Navy said the guided-missile destroyer was asserting its navigational rights and freedoms.  “Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations,” the U.S. Navy 7th fleet said in an emailed statement.

Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich told NBC News that Russian jets have violated the airspace of At Tanf Garrison roughly 25 times this month, including Wednesday. 
Armed Russian jets have flown over a U.S. military garrison in Syria nearly every day in March, violating a 4-year-old agreement between the U.S. and Russia and risking escalation, according to the U.S. general in charge of air operations in the region. 
 Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, combined forces air component commander for U.S. Central Command, told NBC News on Wednesday that the most recent Russian overflight of At Tanf Garrison (ATG) happened just a few hours earlier, and that Russian jets have violated the airspace roughly 25 times so far this month, compared to zero times in February and 14 in January.
“It is a substantial increase,” he said, explaining that at this rate they are “on track to be double what it has been in the past.”

* Iran-backed fighters fired three missiles at US military base at Al-Omar oil field 
* US killed 11 militants in strikes after Iranian drone strike killed American 
The White House today insisted America is not seeking a conflict with Iran after President Biden launched a series of retaliatory air strikes against Tehran-backed fighters who had killed an American contractor in an Iranian suicide drone attack. 
Biden ordered the U.S. Central Command forces to launch &#x27;precision airstrikes&#x27; against facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard Corps in northeast Syria on Thursday, killing at least 14 pro-Iran fighters. 
White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said today that the retaliatory airstrikes against the IRGC, a wing of the Iranian military which is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Washington, were aimed at protecting American personnel in Syria.

A top Pentagon official has said that a diversity officer who tweeted disparaging remarks about white people will not face workplace discipline following a lengthy internal investigation. 
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros faced tough grilling on the controversy from Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing on Thursday. 
Cisneros confirmed that DoDo employee Kelisa Wing will not be fired or otherwise sanctioned for tweets she wrote prior to taking a job as the chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer in the Department of Defense&#x27;s Education Activity office (DoDEA), which oversees schooling for children of military families.

USNI News: Ford Aircraft Carrier John F. Kennedy to Deliver a Year Later 
The next Ford-class aircraft carrier will now deliver to the Navy in 2025, one year later than the service’s most recent projection, according to Fiscal Year 2024 budget documents released this week. 
The Navy delayed future carrier John F. Kennedy’s (CVN-79) delivery date from June 2024 so the service could alter the ship’s Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) and perform more work during construction, according to the service’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget documents. 
“The Navy is implementing a strategy to pull baseline work from the Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) into the construction period in order to provide more capability at ship delivery,” the Navy’s shipbuilding budget books read.

North Korea claimed Friday to have tested an underwater attack drone capable of unleashing a &quot;super-scale radioactive tsunami&quot; if armed with a nuclear warhead. 
The brazen claim — which many experts doubt  — was part of the Kim Jong Un regime&#x27;s angry response to the latest joint war games by the U.S. and South Korean militaries. 
The North released pictures of Kim admiring what the country&#x27;s official news service said was the new underwater drone, and others purportedly showing it at sea, along with an underwater explosion. 
The regime claimed the weapon cruised underwater for almost 60 hours before blowing up.

Speaking to the CNews channel on Friday morning, Darmanin also said that there had been 903 fires lit in the streets of Paris during by far the most violent day of protests since they began in January. 
“There were a lot of demonstrations and some of them turned violent, notably in Paris,” Darmanin added, saying the toll was “difficult” while praising the police for protecting the more than million people who marched around France.

* In Paris, tear gas and water cannons have been fired at protesters and police have been injured. 
* The French government last week announced it would use special constitutional powers to force its unpopular pension bill through the lower house of parliament without a vote. 
King Charles III’s visit to France has been postponed, as protests continue over the Paris government’s pension system reforms. 
This trip was due to be the new British monarch’s first state visit and was scheduled to run from March 26 to March 29. 
Unions on Thursday called for a national day of action involving strikes and protests on March 28.  The decision to cancel the visit was taken by the French and British governments after a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and King Charles, according to a statement.

Saudi state television reports that the two countries are in talks to resume consular services. 
Saudi Arabia and Syria are in talks over a resumption of consular services between the two countries, according to Saudi state television, an indication of a possible restoration of ties between the two countries. 
Saudi Arabia, which backed the Syrian opposition in the country’s war, closed its embassy in Damascus and expelled the Syrian ambassador in 2012.

WNU Editor: Quite a contrast in the reporting. On the one hand the Western media is saying that Saudi Arabia and Syria are in talks to restore ties. Arab news agencies are saying that the talks have been concluded, and that ties will be restored with the reopening of their embassies. I am trusting the Arab sources on this one.

* An American contractor was killed by a suspected Iranian suicide drone 
* Five US  service members and another contractor were injured 
* The Defense Department said intelligence ops determined the drone was Iranian 
An American contractor has been killed and five service members were wounded when an Iranian suicide drone struck a facility on a coalition base in northeast Syria on Thursday, the Pentagon said. 
In retaliation, President Biden ordered the U.S. Central Command forces to launch &#x27;precision airstrikes&#x27; against facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard Corps, killing 11 pro-Iran fighters. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the airstrikes against the IRGC, a wing of the Iranian military which is blacklisted as a terrorist group by the US, were carried out by F-15 fighter jets.

WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. Expect more strikes between US and pro-Syrian/Iranian forces in this part of the Middle East. This is not an end, but a beginning to a new phase in this long-running conflict.

They endorsed a plan to send Kyiv a million rounds of artillery shells over the next 12 months.  EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday endorsed a deal to ramp up the supply of artillery shells to Ukraine as the country defends itself against Russia&#x27;s unprovoked invasion. 
&quot;Taking into account the security and defense interests of all member states, the European Council welcomes the agreement ... to deliver ground-to-ground and artillery ammunition to Ukraine and, if requested, missiles,&quot; the meeting&#x27;s conclusions on Ukraine read.  Read more ....

Reuters: Zelenskiy tells Europe: Be quicker with military aid or face a long war 
KYIV (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday urged Europe to increase and speed up supplies of modern weaponry and impose tougher sanctions on Russia, saying otherwise the war could drag on for years. 
In a long and sharply worded video address to EU leaders, delivered from a train, Zelenskiy said it was up to the 27-nation bloc to take action to contain Russia more than a year into its invasion of Ukraine. 
Although Ukrainian officials have repeatedly urged partners to step up supplies of weapons, Zelenskiy&#x27;s comments represented an unusually open display of frustration. 
&quot;If Europe waits, the evil may have time to regroup and prepare for years of war. It is in your power to prevent this,&quot; he said in an address to EU leaders, who held talks with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

                              <span>Reuters: Ukraine Prepares Counteroffensive as Russia&#x27;s Assault on Bakhmut Flags 
WEST OF SOLEDAR, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops, on the defensive for four months, will soon launch a counterassault as Russia&#x27;s huge winter offensive weakens without capturing the eastern city of Bakhmut, Ukraine&#x27;s top ground forces commander said. 
The remarks on Thursday were the strongest indication yet from Kyiv that it is close to shifting tactics, having absorbed Russia&#x27;s onslaught through a brutal winter. 
Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenaries &quot;are losing considerable strength and are running out of steam&quot;, Kyiv&#x27;s ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a social media post.

Republic World: &#x27;Decisive&#x27; year for war: Czech Republic President Admits That His Country Exhausted All Means Of Arming Ukraine 
On Wednesday, the President of the Czech Republic Petr Pavel asserted that the year 2023 would be a “decisive” year for the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The President of the Czech Republic Petr Pavel asserted that the year 2023 would be a “decisive” year for the Russia-Ukraine war. According to the Russian news outlet, Russia Today, the president’s remarks came after he predicted that Ukraine&#x27;s western allies have exhausted all means of arming the war-stricken country. In the midst of the raging Russia-Ukraine war, Kyiv’s western allies like the US, UK and NATO have showcased their support to the war-stricken country to combat the wrath of the Russian forces. From military tanks to fighter jets, the western allies have equipped Ukraine with ammunition as the war continues to escalate.

   RT: Ukrainian special forces getting military targets from CIA satellite – Times  
The data is used to launch drone attacks against Russian servicemen, a unit commander told the outlet 
Soldiers of Ukraine’s ‘Thor’ special operations group are using satellite data provided by the CIA to choose targets when conducting drone strikes against Russian forces, the unit’s commander told The Times.
The 27-man group, which is formally a police special operations unit, functions independently from the Ukrainian army and works in close collaboration with the country&#x27;s military intelligence, the GUR, which provides them with ammunition and intel. 
According to The Times, the unit has complete license to select its missions, where it barracks and when it fights.

It was about regime change,&quot; he said. ElBaradei added: &quot;They (the US) thought the best pretext was to say that Saddam Hussein was linked to al Qaeda and had WMDs (...) They didn&#x27;t really have any evidence. It was all about belief. And they started a slew of deception and misinformation.&quot;</span>

Middle East Monitor: US will send old tank-busting planes to Middle East, advanced jets to Asia and Europe: Report 
Deployment of A-10 attack planes to the Middle East comes as Washington looks to focus on great power rivalries with China and Russia 
The US plans to deploy ageing A-10 attack planes to the Middle East in order to send more advanced combat aircraft to Asia, as part of a pivot away from the region to focus on the great power rivalries with China and Russia. 
The move, reported by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, comes as the Pentagon looks to scale back its Middle East footprint. 
Earlier this month, US Air Force officials proposed a 2024 budget of $7bn for operations in the Middle East and  Southwest Asia, about $1.6bn less than last year.

   FOX News: Mexican president backs Trump, says potential indictment is &#x27;fabrication&#x27; to keep him off 2024 ballot  
&#x27;Why not allow the people to decide,&#x27; López Obrador asked when discussing the Trump legal battle 
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador appeared to side with for former President Donald Trump amid his ongoing legal battle with the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office, slamming the potential indictment as a way to prevent Trump from seeking the White House in 2024. 
&quot;Right now, former President Trump is declaring that they are going to arrest him,&quot; López Obrador said Tuesday during a press conference, according to transcribed remarks from Newsweek. &quot;If that were the case… it would be so that his name doesn&#x27;t appear on the ballot.&quot;

China&#x27;s show of solidarity with Russia displeased officials in Brussels, where concerns are growing that Beijing is considering supplying arms to Moscow. 
But for now there is no real desire to decouple from China.  If Xi Jinping chooses to &quot;befriend a war criminal, it is our duty to get very serious about China,&quot; Lithuania&#x27;s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told DW when asked what he thought about the Chinese president&#x27;s three-day visit to Moscow and his meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. 
The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin late last week, accusing him of war crimes.  The only way forward for the European Union now, Landsbergis said, is to take &quot;first steps on de-risking and eventual decoupling from China. The sooner we start, the better for the union.&quot;

 Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday on &quot;America&#x27;s Newsroom&quot; that the Biden administration is making an &quot;enormous strategic mistake&quot; by seeking to downplay the meeting between China and Russia&#x27;s presidents. Pompeo said the Biden foreign policy has failed, as Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin strengthen ties against the West. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement to expand their economic ties during a bilateral meeting in Moscow on Tuesday. 
Xi arrived in Moscow for a multiday series of meetings with his Russian counterpart, aimed at demonstrating the two countries&#x27; new &quot;friendship without limits.&quot; Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of jointly safeguarding their countries&#x27; energy security.  Read more ....

WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. The Russia - China alliance is going to be a strategic political/economic/and military adversary that Washington is going to have a lot of problems countering in the years to come. And the sad part of this story is that this could have all been prevented if Washington took Moscow&#x27;s national security concerns and proposals seriously in the fall of 2021.</span>

Hamburg lawmakers are asking whether a deadly attack on Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses could have been prevented, pointing to material in the public domain that hinted at religious extremism, plus an anonymous tip-off when he applied for a gun licence.
The Left Party called on the Hamburg Senate to clarify unanswered questions about the rampage, said Deniz Celik, interior policy spokesman for the Left Party in Hamburg&#x27;s State Parliament, in a statement on Sunday.

                              <span>DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Sunday, adding that he hoped the exchange would take place soon.
&quot;Regarding the issue of prisoner swaps between Iran and the U.S. we have reached an agreement in the recent days and if everything goes well on the U.S. side, I think we will witness a prisoner exchange in a short period,&quot; Amirabdollahian said.
&quot;On our part everything is ready, while the U.S. is currently working on the final technical coordination.&quot;
One of several Americans held in Iran is Siamak Namazi, a businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, who was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government.
Emad Sharghi, an Iranian-American businessman was first arrested in 2018 when he was working for a tech investment company, is also jailed in Iran, as is Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship.
Iranian sources told Reuters that two regional countries were involved in the series of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington for the release of prisoners.
For years, Tehran has sought the release of more than a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the glitz of Sunday&#x27;s Oscars, the first Irish language film to earn a nomination is sparking renewed interest in a native tongue spoken by so few it is considered endangered by the United Nations cultural agency.
Competing for best international feature, &quot;An Cailín Ciúin&quot; (The Quiet Girl) last year became the first Irish language film to gross more than 1 million euros ($1.06 million) at the UK and Irish box office. It has remained a fixture in cinemas across English-speaking Ireland.
Director Colm Bairéad says the success feels like it is boosting a language he grew up feeling self-conscious about because of its rarity. Raised in a bilingual household, the Dubliner&#x27;s father would make a point of shouting across the street in Iri…</span>

                              <span>TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court&#x27;s powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.
As the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.
&quot;It&#x27;s not a judicial reform. It&#x27;s a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids,&quot; said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.
The protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.
National police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv&#x27;s police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.
The now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and &quot;will not yield to any political pressure on the matter&quot;.
Netanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.
&quot;I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call &#x27;Crime Minister&#x27;,&quot; said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.

Greece has asked for others to imitate the Vatican Museums after they agreed this month to return three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon. London and Athens are in talks over the Parthenon Sculptures held by the British Museum.
The Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis in Athens, was completed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the goddess Athena, and its decorative friezes contain some of the greatest examples of ancient Greek sculpture.

The 20-year-old man suspected of keeping 11 people hostage in a pharmacy for five hours on Friday in Germany&#x27;s south-western city of Karlsruhe has been taken into custody, authorities said on Saturday
According to the public prosecutor&#x27;s office and the police, a judge issued an arrest warrant on charges of hostage-taking.
The 20-year-old suspect, who is known to the police, held the 11 hostages for almost five hours until special forces stormed the pharmacy and overpowered him.
The perpetrator was armed but he acted alone, police said earlier.

                              <span>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has deplored new &quot;brutal terrorist attacks&quot; by Russia on cities and towns across his country.

Day and night there are these attacks, Zelensky said in his nightly video message broadcast in Kiev on Saturday. &quot;Rockets and artillery, drones and mortars: The vicious state uses a variety of weapons with the one goal of destroying life and leaving nothing human behind,&quot; Zelensky said.
&quot;Ruins, rubble, craters where missiles hit are the self-portrait of Russia that it paints where life exists without Russia,&quot; the Ukrainian head of state said. The country stands for evil, he said. &quot;It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment.&quot;
Zelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.</span>

                              <span>Another five people have been arrested in Mexico for the kidnapping of four Americans, two of whom were killed amid the violent abduction. 
The group of suspects were taken into custody Friday on charges including aggravated kidnapping and simple intention homicide, Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica wrote on Twitter shortly before 11:30 a.m. local time. 
A sixth person arrested earlier this week was also being held in connection with the daytime abduction of Latavia “Tay” McGee, Shaeed Woodard, Zindell Brown, and Eric James Williams.</span>

Rosalia Messina Denaro was arrested earlier this month not far from Palermo, where her godfather brother was caught on January 16 after 30 years on the run.
She is accused of issuing orders, keeping the books and transmitting secret messages for her sibling while he was in hiding.
For many years, women linked to the Cosa Nostra Mafia seemed born to become widows, portrayed in films as black-veiled Madonnas, leading funeral processions in sorrowful dignity.
The reality is far more complex, with many wives, daughters and sisters playing active roles while their men are on the run, in prison…</span>

BEIJING (Reuters) -Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China&#x27;s premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity&#x27;s sclerotic stock market.
Li&#x27;s back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.
In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai&#x27;s new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China&#x27;s hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.

                              <span>Mexican authorities have arrested five people over the deadly kidnapping of a group of Americans, after the suspects were left in the street with their hands tied by alleged cartel members, officials said Friday.
The four US citizens, two of whom died, were snatched at gunpoint after crossing the border into crime-plagued Tamaulipas state on Friday in a minivan, apparently so that one could have cosmetic surgery.
Tamaulipas prosecutor Irving Barrios said that a warrant had been executed for five people for the crimes of kidnapping and homicide.
They are the same five men who were found Thursday with their hands bound on a street in the city of Matamoros, apparently dumped by fellow members of the Gulf Cartel, a source in the prosecutor&#x27;s office told AFP.

&quot;The world has gone mad,&quot; says one mourner holding a bouquet of white roses and approaching the entrance of the brick building, cordoned off by police.
The body bags are carefully placed in hearses before being driven away and the man with the bouquet leaves with his flowers still in hand.
&quot;It really upsets me,&quot; says Tatjana Popczy, who lives just 200 metres (yards) from the centre where a former member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses burst into a service at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) on Thursday, killing six people.

                              <span>Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won&#x27;t be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia&#x27;s year-long military invasion.
As reported by CBS News&#x27; Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a &quot;bigger war&quot; in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was &quot;done&quot; with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while &quot;America First&quot; Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.</span>

                              <span>Moscow on Friday accused foreign countries of fomenting days of mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia&#x27;s borders.
Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial &quot;foreign agent&quot; legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
