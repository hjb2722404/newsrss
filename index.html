What really hit me last year was the dearth of correct analyses in main stream media and in politics with regards to the war in Ukraine. 
Little if anything is based on facts. More than 90% of the published output is propaganda. 
The &#x27;western&#x27; plan was to draw Russia into Ukraine to then &#x27;kill&#x27; it by economic sanctions. As Biden said when he announced those:       
We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.

The Hill: Officials say US forces killed almost 700 suspected ISIS members in 2022 
U.S. forces killed almost 700 suspected Islamic State operatives in 2022, including the leader of the group, dozens of regional leaders and hundreds of fighters.  
U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a release on Thursday that it conducted 313 operations against ISIS over the past year, killing 466 operatives in Syria and at least 220 operatives in Iraq. Officials also detained 215 operatives in Syria and 159 operatives in Iraq.  
The release states that no U.S. forces were injured or killed in the operations, a majority of which were conducted with the United States’s allies in the two countries.

Russia’s president has broken years-long tradition, addressing the nation from a military HQ 
Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his traditional New Year&#x27;s Eve address on Saturday, speaking to the nation about the challenges the country has faced over the past year and the achievements it has made. 
The address venue differed drastically from the traditional Kremlin courtyard stand-up shots of the president, with Putin this year recording the annual message at the Southern Military District HQ. During his visit, he also met with top military brass and gave state awards to distinguished soldiers.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Russia that “no one will ever forgive you” for spreading terror following a series of missile attacks on the day of New Year’s Eve.  
Zelensky said in an address on Saturday that the missile attacks will not mark the end of the year but the outcome of Russia’s fate in that it will not be forgiven. 
He mentioned that Russia launched missile attacks during the war at other holidays like Easter and Christmas.  
“They call themselves Christians, they are very proud of their Orthodoxy. But they are following the devil. They support him and are together with him,” he said.

SANTA CRUZ/LA PAZ (Reuters) - Protesters in Bolivia&#x27;s Santa Cruz, a relatively wealthy farming region, attacked buildings, burned cars and blocked highways as part of a 24-hour strike on Friday following the arrest of the regional governor, a right-wing opposition leader. 
As night fell, protesters in parts of the provincial capital torched cars and tires and hurled fireworks toward police, who used tear gas to try to disperse the crowds. 
Pedro Vaca, Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), said in a post on Twitter he was receiving reports of &quot;severe attacks&quot; on the media, attributed to police deployments.

                              <span>VOA/Reuters: Brazil&#x27;s Bolsonaro Lands in Florida, Avoiding Lula Handover 
BRASiLIA, BRAZIL — Outgoing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro landed in Florida on Friday after delivering a teary message to his supporters less than two days before his fierce leftist rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is set to take office. 
An official Brazilian plane landed in Orlando, Florida, late Friday, flight-tracking website FlightAware showed. Although Bolsonaro&#x27;s destination has not been officially confirmed, his security staff were already in place in Florida. 
Bolsonaro&#x27;s exit from Brazil came after he repeatedly said he would not hand over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday&#x27;s inauguration, breaking with Brazil&#x27;s democratic tradition. He may also face legal risks from remaining in Brazil as his presidential immunity expires when Lula takes office.

North Korea has fired three ballistic missiles toward the sea east of the Korean Peninsula, the South Korean military says. 
The launches are the latest in an unprecedented number of missile tests conducted by North Korea this year, as Pyongyang presses on with weapons development amid speculation it could test a nuclear weapon for a seventh time. 
The three short-range ballistic missiles were fired from about 8am local time from North Hwanghae Province, South Korea&#x27;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said.

The Catholic Church has strict protocols in place following the death of its leader, but with the death of former Pope Benedict, it is unclear whether those same protocols will apply to a retired pope. 
When Benedict XVI resigned in 2013 citing old age, he became the first Pope in 600 years to step down from the role. 
Born Joseph Ratzinger, the German cardinal was elected in April 2005 and chose to go by the name of Benedict.

PARIS, December 30. /TASS/.

                              <span>Bloomberg: After $18 Trillion Rout, Global Stocks Face More Hurdles in 2023 
(Bloomberg) -- More tech tantrums. China’s Covid surge. And above all, no central banks riding to the rescue if things go wrong. Reeling from a record $18 trillion wipeout, global stocks must surmount all these hurdles and more if they are to escape a second straight year in the red. 
With a drop of more than 20% in 2022, the MSCI All-Country World Index is on track for its worst performance since the 2008 crisis, as jumbo interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve more than doubled 10-year Treasury yields — the rate underpinning global capital costs. 
Bulls looking ahead at 2023 might take solace in the fact that two consecutive down years are rare for major equity markets — the S&amp;P 500 index has fallen for two straight years on just four occasions since 1928. The scary thing though, is that when they do occur, drops in the second year tend to be deeper than in the first.

EurAsian Times: World’s 1st Space Drone? Russian Historian Says S-70 ‘Hunter’ Can Reach Outer Space; US Experts Skeptical 
Russia’s S-70 Okhotnik Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV), which can also operate as a ‘wingman’ to the Su-57 fighter, is Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled and can reach outer space when fitted with suitable engines. 
The United States tried to develop UCAV with similar performance characteristics but gave up the project after its engineers could not overcome the technical obstacles. 
This was according to military historian and director of the Museum of Air Defense Forces Yuri Knutov, Izvestia reported.  The S-70 Okhotnik is powered by an AL-31 turbojet engine and is expected to fly at 1,000 kilometers an hour and a range of 6,000 kilometers.

Politico:  Turkey renews threat of war over Greek territorial sea dispute  
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu warned Greece not to proceed with any expansion of its territorial waters in the Aegean. 
ATHENS — Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Thursday threatened Greece with retaliation if Athens proceeded with any expansion of its territorial waters in the Aegean, saying that it would still be seen as a casus belli justifying military action.
“Our position is clear, no 12 miles, we will not allow for territorial waters to be expanded by even a mile in the Aegean,” Çavuşoğlu said during an end-of-year press briefing in Ankara, commenting on reports that Athens plans to extend territorial waters around the island of Crete.

                              <span>CNBC: Highly immune evasive omicron XBB.1.5 variant is quickly becoming dominant in U.S. as it doubles weekly 
* The Covid omicron XBB.1.5 variant has nearly doubled in prevalence over the past week and now represents about 41% of new cases in the U.S., according to CDC data. 
* XBB.1.5 is highly immune evasive and appears to bind better to cells than other members of the XBB omicron subvariant family. 
* Scientists at Columbia University have warned that the rise of subvariants such as the XBB family could “result in a surge of breakthrough infections as well as re-infections.” 
The Covid omicron XBB.1.5 variant is rapidly becoming dominant in the U.S. because it is highly immune evasive and appears more effective at binding to cells than related subvariants, scientists say. 
XBB.1.5 now represents about 41% of new cases nationwide in the U.S., nearly doubling in prevalence over the past week, according to the data published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The subvariant more than doubled as a share of cases every week through Dec. 24. In the past week, it nearly doubled from 21.7% prevalence.

Voters are not in a very Christmas-y mood when it comes to Washington’s punishment politics.  In fact, they’d like to see some payback. 
While a majority of voters are OK with House Ways and Means Committee Democrats releasing former President Donald Trump’s federal income taxes, they also feel that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.

As for my friends and relatives in Russia. Life still goes on, and sometimes I get the impression that they are not impacted. There are of course daily reminders on mass media, and hundreds of thousands of reservists have been called up.   But the economy is still functioning. Everyone is working, and even inflation has come down. 
BBC&#x27;s Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg is correct in the above video that Russia is on a war footing, and society has become militarized. Uncertainty is in the back of everyone&#x27;s minds, but for the old timers like myself we have seen this before. 
All wars do come to an end. And the Ukraine war will eventually end. 
And as for Russia. It will survive. It always has.</span>

Space.com: SpaceX launches Israeli reconnaissance satellite, lands rocket in final flight of 2022  
The launch and landing marked SpaceX&#x27;s 61st flight in 2022. 
SpaceX rang out 2022 a few days early with a brilliant nighttime launch from California to haul an Israeli reconnaissance satellite into orbit.  
A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched the Israeli Earth-imaging satellite EROS C-3 into orbit from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California late Thursday night (Dec. 29), releasing the payload into orbit about 15 minutes after leaving Earth. 
Liftoff occurred at 11:38 p.m. PST at the launch site (2:38 a.m. EST/0738 GMT), with the Falcon 9&#x27;s first stage returning to land at a nearby SpaceX pad about 8 minutes into the flight.

The Hill: Esper: Taiwan ‘not prepared enough’ for conflict with China  
Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper says Taiwan is “not prepared enough” for a potential Chinese invasion, though he is optimistic the island will get to that point. 
Esper, who traveled to Taiwan in July, said this week he met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and “outlined a number of things that I thought they needed to do,” including dramatically increasing the island’s defense budget, increasing the length of conscription for at least a year and stockpiling food and weapons.

Global Times: China appoints Qin Gang as new foreign minister 
Qin Gang, incumbent Chinese Ambassador to the US, was appointed as the new Chinese foreign minister, according to a decision made by the 13th National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee on Friday. 
Wang Yi, who is a Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor, no longer serves as the Chinese foreign minister, China&#x27;s Central Television reported on Friday.

WNU Editor: Qin Gang is viewed as one of China&#x27;s &quot;wolf-warrior&#x27; diplomats. His appointment tells me that China is expecting a number of international confrontations in the future, and they have appointed a hardcore and blunt diplomat to present their case to an international audience.

Lavrov claimed that US soldiers, military advisers, and intelligence officers have long been direct participants in the conflict. 
Sitting down with Russia’s Channel One for an interview on Wednesday, Lavrov spoke at length about Washington’s deep involvement in the hostilities in Ukraine, which has steadily grown despite repeated assurances from American leaders that US personnel would have no role in the fighting.

Zero Hedge: This Week Reveals Little Hope For Serious Ukraine-Russia Negotiations 
The Kremlin has clarified its position on being &#x27;open&#x27; to peace negotiations with Ukraine, after over the weekend Ukraine&#x27;s leadership floated a proposal to enter into UN-brokered ceasefire negotiations in February.  
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said any future &quot;peace plan&quot; must involve formal recognition that the annexed eastern territories have joined the Russian Federation.

                              <span>New York Times: In Nord Stream Mystery, Baltic Seabed Provides a Nearly Ideal Crime Scene 
More than 15 years ago, when the Nord Stream gas pipeline between Russia and Germany was little more than an idea, a Swedish government study warned of the risks inherent in running a critical piece of energy infrastructure along the Baltic Sea floor. 
The pipeline would be vulnerable to even the most rudimentary form of sabotage, analysts wrote, and underwater surveillance would be nearly impossible. The 2007 study, written by the Swedish Defense Research Agency, even posited a scenario: 
“One diver would be enough to set an explosive device.” 
Today, European investigators face almost exactly that scenario. The Swedish authorities leading a criminal investigation have concluded that a state actor was most likely responsible for a September blast that ripped through the gas pipes. Officials and experts say that explosives were probably dropped from ships or — just as the Swedish report warned — planted on the seafloor using submarines or divers.

 WNU Editor: I love the mental gymnastics that the New York Times goes through to try and blame Russia for destroying a pipeline that it spent 10 years to plan and $23 billion to build with the expectation of receiving almost a trillion in revenues over the course of its lifetime. 
But we all know who was to gain (and is gaining) from this attack. 

At least the Washington Post coverage of this story is more balanced and straight to the point .... Washington Post: No Conclusive Evidence Russia Is Behind Nord Stream Attack (December 16, 2022).</span>

Moscow Times: Putin Oversees Launch of New Russian Submarine and Warships 
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday oversaw the commissioning of several new warships and a nuclear-powered submarine as he vowed to further strengthen Russia&#x27;s navy. 
Putin, who has largely avoided public engagements since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, gave the green light for Russian flags to be hoisted on the new vessels via video link. 
Among the newly commissioned vessels were a corvette, a minesweeper, and the Generalissimus Suvorov nuclear-powered submarine that is capable of launching ballistic missiles.

The Russian Defense Ministry has received a new batch of Su-57 ‘Felon’ fighter jets from the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aviation Plant (owned by the United Aircraft Corporation).   The press service of UAC announced on December 28. 
In addition to the fifth-generation fighter aircraft, the company also delivered a batch of the Su-35S for the Russian Aerospace Forces.  “KnAAZ manufactured and transferred to the Russian Defense Ministry another batch of serial fifth-generation Su-57 aircraft as part of the supply program of this year,” UAC said.  
Yuri Slyusar, the corporation’s general director, stated that the aircraft plant had fulfilled the current year’s production schedule for the Su-57 and multipurpose Su-35S fighters for the Russian Aerospace Forces.

US News and World Report: China Sails Warships Near Guam in Warning to U.S. Over Taiwan  
The Chinese deployment of its aircraft carrier Liaoning, which Japanese officials confirmed, capped a year of tensions with the U.S., particularly over Taiwan. 
China has sailed one of its three aircraft carriers near the U.S. territory of Guam, Japanese officials confirmed, ending an already combative year with a rare move that Beijing signaled as a clear warning to the Biden administration over Taiwan. 
The Chinese fleet, led by the aircraft carrier Liaoning, had already spurred several clashes with U.S. allies in the region with its tour of the western Pacific, most recently by conducting roughly 260 takeoff and landing drills near the Japanese island of Okinawa, home to a major U.S. military presence. The operations prompted the Japanese air force to scramble fighter jets and helicopters, as well as a destroyer and other elements of its self-defense forces.

The Guardian: No 10 ‘concerned’ MPs engaged in ‘sex and heavy drinking’ on trips abroad  
Downing Street says reports of raucous behaviour of all-party trips are a matter for parliament 
No 10 has said it is “very concerning” that MPs were reportedly met by sex workers in their hotel rooms and engaged in raucous drinking while on parliamentary trips abroad. 
The prime minister’s deputy official spokesperson said the oversight of trips taken by all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) was a matter for parliament but expressed concern about some of the behaviour reported by Politico and the Times. 
“We have seen some of the reports and some of the behaviour reported is clearly very concerning,” he said.

GAO has up to 100 days to rule in a bid protest, but the congressional watchdog agency strives to resolve cases as quickly as possible. 
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky and teammate Boeing today formally protested the Army’s choice of Bell Textron’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor in the coveted Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition, asking the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the decision. 
“Based on a thorough review of the information and feedback provided by the Army, Lockheed Martin Sikorsky, on behalf of Team DEFIANT, is challenging the FLRAA decision. The data and discussions lead us to believe the proposals were not consistently evaluated to deliver the best value in the interest of the Army, our Soldiers and American taxpayers,” the two companies declared in a statement.

A video of a ground control station view (or console) of a massive swarm of loitering munitions by a Chinese company has triggered speculation as to whether China has completely mastered autonomous UAV technology.  
In September 2020, the China Academy of Electronics and Information Technology (CAEIT) released a video of the same system. It showed three drones being launched from a box array of 48 tubular launchers from the back of a Dongfeng Mengshi vehicle.

                              <span>William Gallo, VOA: Under New Defense Plan, Japan May Become ‘Normal’ World Power 
Seoul, South Korea — Japan this month took a major step toward loosening its postwar military restraints, unveiling new policies that will allow the Asian giant to play a much bigger role in regional and global security affairs. 
Under a new National Security Strategy (NSS) and two other documents released in mid-December, Japan will roughly double defense spending over the next five years and for the first time deploy missiles that can hit military targets in other countries. 
The policies smash through decades-old taboos in Japan, which has embraced a relatively restrained defense posture under its technically pacifist constitution drafted by the United States following Tokyo’s defeat in World War II.

Reuters: South Korea&#x27;s Yoon orders revamp of response to violations of country&#x27;s air space 
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea&#x27;s President Yoon Suk-yeol ordered a revamp of the military&#x27;s response to objects violating its airspace, his office said on Thursday, after an intrusion by North Korean drones exposed its difficulty in shooting down small aircraft. 
Five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea on Monday, prompting South Korea&#x27;s military to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, though it failed to bring down the drones, which flew over South Korea for hours. 
Amid criticism over South Korea&#x27;s air defences at a time of North Korea&#x27;s growing nuclear and missile threats, Yoon visited the state-run Agency for Defence Development to check the country&#x27;s reconnaissance and interception capabilities and called for an overhaul of the response system against &quot;all flying objects&quot;.

Sydney — Australia has approved a request to extradite former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan to the United States where he faces charges of money laundering and breaking U.S. arms control laws, the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department said on Thursday. 
Duggan, who was arrested in Australia in October and remains in custody, is accused of breaking U.S. arms control laws by training Chinese military pilots to land on aircraft carriers, according to a 2017 indictment unsealed by a U.S. court in December.

   Reuters: Russia Says It Shot Down Drone Near Engels Air Base 
(Reuters) - A Russian regional governor said on Thursday that air defences had shot down a drone near the Engels air force base, home to long-range strategic bombers. 
Russia says Ukraine has already tried to attack the base twice this month, killing at least six Russian servicemen, although it said there was only slight damage to two aircraft. 
The base is located near Saratov, 730 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow and hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines in Ukraine.

                              <span>China&#x27;s hospitals have been struggling to keep up amid soaring coronavirus cases after the Chinese Communist Party abruptly reversed its stringent &quot;zero Covid&quot; policy while the country&#x27;s vaccination rate remains low. FRANCE 24 correspondents Lou Kisiela, Antoine Morel, Yan Chen and Yena Lee report from a hospital in Shanghai.

This hospital is considered one of the best in China, but it is overwhelmed as Covid cases soar. Stretchers and oxygen tanks pile up in the lobby as ambulance after ambulance arrives, day and night. “I am very worried. I feel powerless. It’s very crowded,” said the daughter-in-law of an elderly patient whose condition was alarming. “The hospital is doing its best […] but they are understaffed. The doctors don’t have time to answer our questions.”

Meanwhile, patients with less serious symptoms were waiting for rationed fever medication. Pharmacies have run out of stock, and this hospital can prescribe it at the rate of one dose per person, per day.

“We could’ve stocked up on drugs before lifting all the restrictions. It’s the government’s fault,” said one patient. “Either we are strictly locked down.. or all the measures disappear at once!”</span>

Reuters: Putin and Xi to speak by video link on Friday 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping via video link on Friday to discuss a host of bilateral and regional issues. 
&quot;First of all, they will talk about bilateral Russian-Chinese relations,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. 
&quot;And, of course, it will be very important to exchange views on more acute regional problems - those that are closer to us, Russia, and those that are closer to China,&quot; Peskov added, without providing specific details.

WNU Editor: Aside from wishing each other a Happy New Year, I expect the rest of the discussion will be focused on economic/military/and geopolitical issues. I am also hearing reports that this is going to be a long meeting, and it will be classified. This tells me that a number of discussions that are going to take place will be of a military nature. Another sign on how close Russia - China ties are becoming.</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Chinese jet came within 10 feet of U.S. military aircraft, U.S. says 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 metres) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last week and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace, the U.S. military said on Thursday. 
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft. 
The incident, which involved a Chinese Navy J-11 fighter jet and a U.S. air force RC-135 aircraft, took place on Dec. 21, the U.S. military said in a statement.
&quot;We expect all countries in the Indo-Pacific region to use international airspace safely and in accordance with international law,&quot; it added. 
A U.S. military spokesperson said the Chinese jet came within 10 feet of the plane&#x27;s wing, but 20 feet from its nose, which caused the U.S. aircraft to take evasive maneuvers.

RT:  Lavrov blasts Zelensky’s ‘illusions’ 
Kiev’s plan for settling the conflict with Moscow is a non-starter, the Russian foreign minister has said 
Russia is not about to engage with Ukraine based on the ‘peace formula’ put forward by President Vladimir Zelensky, as it deems the terms unacceptable, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday. 
He reiterated, however, that Moscow has not refused to engage in talks in general.  Speaking to RIA Novosti, the foreign minister stated that “obviously, Kiev is not ready for dialogue.”

BBC: Ukraine fighting is deadlocked, spy chief Kyrylo Budanov tells BBC 
Fighting in Ukraine is currently at a deadlock as neither Ukraine nor Russia can make significant advances, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence agency has said, while Kyiv waits for more advanced weapons from Western allies. 
&quot;The situation is just stuck,&quot; Kyrylo Budanov told the BBC in an interview. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t move.&quot; 
After Ukrainian troops recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, most of the fiercest battles have been around Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region. Elsewhere, Russian forces appear to be on the defensive while winter has slowed down the pace of Ukraine&#x27;s ground operations across the 1,000km (620-mile) front line.

WNU Editor: If you look at the current state of the war where the territory is not being captured/recaptured on a daily basis, one can say that the war is currently stalemated. But if you look at the war from an attrition point of view, this war is anything but deadlocked. 
I have been reading reports that Ukraine is currently losing up to two battalions of soldiers per day (wounded/killed/missing). And on the Russia side I would not be surprised if the casualties are just as high. Bottom line. It is only a matter of time before one side loses the capability to continue to fight.</span>

Footage has emerged of a Russian TOS-1A thermobaric MLRS purportedly being blasted in the Bakhmut area of Ukraine, where there has been intense fighting over the Christmas period. 
The video, posted on Twitter and said to have been filmed a week ago, shows the weapon being raised from the tank before several rounds of rockets are fired. 
They can be seen exploding on the ground through the eyes of the soldiers firing them, in black and white footage with the crosshair visible on the screen.

Minsk claimed that a Soviet-era air defense missile was fired from Ukraine and landed in Belarus after Ukraine was hit by a barrage of Russian missiles. 
Belarusian and Russian media reported on Thursday that a Ukrainian missile had crossed into Belarus&#x27; territory.  
The reports came shortly after Russia launched one of its largest missile attacks against Ukraine since the war started in February, with Kyiv saying more than 60 missiles had been fired on Ukrainian cities. 
Minsk&#x27;s key ally Moscow is reportedly sending officials to investigate the incident. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.

* Ukraine’s military said it had shot down 54 missiles out of 69 launched by Russia in an assault that began at 7am local time. 
* Air raid sirens rang out across Ukraine and in Kyiv sounded for five hours - one of the longest alarms of the war. 
Russia fired scores of missiles into Ukraine early on Thursday, targeting the capital Kyiv and other cities including Lviv and Odesa in the west, in one of its largest aerial bombardments that sent people rushing to shelters and knocked out power. 
“Senseless barbarism. These are the only words that come to mind seeing Russia launch another missile barrage at peaceful Ukrainian cities ahead of New Year,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.

A 97-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has filed an appeal against the guilty verdict she was given for her role in the deaths that took place at her place of work during World War II.
The appeal means that Germany&#x27;s highest criminal court, the Federal Court of Justice, has to examine whether a procedural error was made.
&quot;The verdict is thus not legally binding,&quot; the lower court in Itzehoe in northern Germany said on Wednesday.
Identified only as Irmgard F under German privacy laws, she was found guilty on December 20 of complicity in more than 10,500 cases of murder and given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in northern Germany.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is &quot;very sick&quot;, his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis&#x27; announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden &quot;worsening&quot; of his health.
&quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church,&quot; Francis said in Wednesday&#x27;s surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.

Its promoters reckon it is revolutionizing human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.
Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
The European Union is likely to pass legislation next year -- the AI Act -- aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
Looming large in the debates has been China&#x27;s use of biometric data, facial recognition and other technology to build a powerful system of control.

Uruguay, a country where horses are not considered food but companions, has seen a rise in equine meat exports, prompting efforts to rescue horses destined for slaughter.
In 2020, the small South American nation was the seventh-largest exporter of horse meat, according to the OEC economic data site, with Belgium, Russia, France and Japan among the top importers.
Most of Uruguay&#x27;s tens of thousands of race, sports and work horses end up on someone&#x27;s plate somewhere else in the world after they become injured, old, or their owners simply cannot care for them anymore.

But it was detected for the first time off Thailand&#x27;s eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.

But there were, indeed, some bright spots. FRANCE 24 looks back at 10 good news stories from 2022.
After two years in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, many had hoped 2022 would herald a brighter future. Those hopes were dashed just a few weeks later with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The past 12 months have also been punctuated by record climate disasters, the overturning of federal abortion rights in the United States and the death of Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II.

                              <span>Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#x27;s inauguration will be secured by &quot;100 percent&quot; of the capital district&#x27;s police force, an official said Tuesday amid widespread fears of violence.
Over the weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly placing explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia&#x27;s airport, hoping to sow &quot;chaos&quot; ahead of the inauguration Sunday.
The suspect was a supporter of Brazil&#x27;s outgoing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and told authorities he wanted to &quot;prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil&quot; under leftist Lula.
The device did not explode.
On Sunday &quot;there will be a mobilization of 100 percent of the police forces of the Federal District (of Brasilia) to ensure the safety not only of the president, but also of foreign delegations and the public,&quot; Lula&#x27;s future security minister Flavio Dino told reporters.
Lula backers have expressed fear on social media of riots or attacks on inauguration day, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend events in Brasilia.
But Dino sought to give assurances the event will be &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;peaceful,&quot; encouraging Brazilians to turn out to celebrate.
He added there had been &quot;no change&quot; to plans for the ceremony, in response to speculation that Lula might do his inauguration parade in a closed car instead of the traditional vintage convertible.
After Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9 percent of the vote in a runoff election in October, supporters of the vanquished president blocked roads and demonstrated outside military barracks demanding the armed forces prevent Lula&#x27;s inauguration.
On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators clashed with the police and set fire to buses and cars in Brasilia.
&quot;Small terrorist and extremist groups will not put the institutions of Brazilian democracy up against a wall,&quot; said Dino.
Bolsonaro, who has limited his public appearances after the defeat, has not confirmed that he will follow the tradition of handing over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday&#x27;s ceremony.

Russia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe 
Early in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion. But Russia meets a tougher resistance than expected. And after a failed attempt to take the capital Kyiv, the Russian …</span>

                              <span>Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. 
A friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov&#x27;s death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov&#x27;s friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have &quot;consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.&quot;
Antov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. 
From the BBC: &quot;Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov&#x27;s account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: &#x27;It&#x27;s extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.&#x27; The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a &#x27;patriot of my country&#x27; and backed the war.&quot;

&quot;Every war ends in a diplomatic way,&quot; Kuleba said in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&quot;
Kuleba suggested the summit could be mediated by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, a vocal advocate of diplomatic talks to end an invasion that has killed thousands of civilians, devastated Ukraine&#x27;s infrastructure, and sparked a massive humanitarian crisis.
&quot;The United Nations could be the best venue for holding this summit, because this is not about making a favor to a certain country,&quot; the f…</span>

More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago -- they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 -- before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding program, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as &quot;vulnerable&quot;, with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild -- with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand&#x27;s wild wetlands.
But since 2011, more than 150 captivity-bred birds …</span>

Ron DeSantis
Will Donald Trump&#x27;s former apprentice, popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis, turn on his one-time mentor by challenging him for the Republican nomination for president?
Trump is already gearing up for a potential battle with his MAGA (Make America Great Again) disciple, whose stock has soared among Republicans.
DeSantis won a landslide re-election in November&#x27;s midterms, in which Trump loyalists fared badly. The property mogul has coined a nickname for the self-styled anti-woke warrior: &quot;Ron de Sanctimonious&quot;.

&quot;We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis&quot; in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.

For the last 18 months, researchers from the French firm Urgo have been working towards achieving this Holy Grail of wound treatment, which would save serious burn victims from the painful and repeated skin grafts they currently endure.
The 100-million-euro ($106,000-million) &quot;Genesis&quot; project hopes to have a product ready by 2030.
Guirec Le Lous, the president of Urgo&#x27;s medical arm, told AFP that it is a &quot;crazy&quot; project.
&quot;Are we capable of designing artificial skin in a laboratory? No one in the world has succeeded,&quot; he said.

Writing before the mid-term election, New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg explained that hundreds of documents he&#x27;s sifted through, in addition to former Robert Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann&#x27;s details, revealed enough to show what Putin was after when he worked to swing the 2016 election for Trump.

                              <span>(Reuters) - SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Monday that the company is now close to having 100 active Starlinks, the firm&#x27;s satellite internet service, in Iran, three months after he tweeted he would activate the service there amid protests around the Islamic country.
Musk said, &quot;approaching 100 starlinks active in Iran&quot;, in a tweet on Monday.
The billionaire had said in September that he would activate Starlink in Iran as part of a U.S.-backed effort &quot;to advance internet freedom and the free flow of information&quot; to Iranians.
The satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the government&#x27;s restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms amid protests around the country.
The Islamic Republic has been engulfed in protests that erupted after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for wearing &quot;unsuitable attire&quot;.

                              <span>Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.
Following his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.
&quot;The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset,&quot; parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.
Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel&#x27;s history.
While the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu&#x27;s right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Both live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.
Netanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.
However, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.
His incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) -China will stop requiring inbound travellers to go into quarantine starting from Jan. 8, the National Health Commission said on Monday in a major step towards easing curbs on its borders, which have been largely shut since 2020.
China&#x27;s management of COVID-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.
Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China&#x27;s economy, fuelling last month the mainland&#x27;s biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
But China made an abrupt policy U-turn this month,…</span>
