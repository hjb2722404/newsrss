Tensions are mounting around Taiwan and in the South China Sea, both in the air and on the water, with numerous incidents of late involving Chinese fighter planes, collisions between ships and reefs being turned into military outposts.

                              <span>WASHINGTON DC, Mar 08 (IPS)  - Poverty is multidimensional. If we think of classical thinkers, Adam Smith referred to the basis of self-respect and the importance of being able to “appear in public without shame,” while John Rawls wrote about “primary goods,” which included rights and liberties as well as income and wealth.

At first, around the shores, the continental shelf is little more than an extension of the adjoining landmass.

Remarkably, in view of what is known about the rest of the planet, and even outer space, most of the ocean floor remains largely a mystery. The scientific consensus is that only 5% of the deep sea has been explored in any detail. When a passenger jet was lost somewhere in the Indian Ocean in 2014, rescuers floundered without definitive maps of the maritime space and its currents at different depths that might have helped in their search.

Despite his findings, authorities have shown little interest in finding the jet. Today marks the tenth anniversary of the plane&#x27;s disappearance, with Richard believing that it will only take one more search to locate the aircraft.</span>

The move was overwhelmingly supported by French lawmakers and is seen as a significant step for women&#x27;s rights.</span>

                              <span>Wallace began their interview Tuesday segment by citing lawyer and Howard University Civil Rights chair Sherrilyn Ifill, who argued that autocracy is contagious.


	Hillyard showed viewers footage of some of the more shocking interviews. Several people confessed they didn&#x27;t care if thousands of people in Ukraine were killed by Russia&#x27;s invasion.


	The number of people with whom Hillyard cannot find common ground is rapidly growing, Hillyard said.


	Hillyard urged directing the political conversation not at public figures but at friends, family and neighbors.

	&quot;These are people who go to our churches, our schools and are in our communities,&quot; Hillyard said. &quot;They are our family members they are our loved ones....we&#x27;ve denied the entanglement of conspiracy theories, but it&#x27;s dangerous if we don&#x27;t have a true conversation about the conditioning.&quot;

William had been due to attend the memorial at Windsor Castle, west of London, for the late King Constantine of Greece, who was also one of his godfathers.

The calendar quirk of February 29 keeps us in sync with the seasons but it has also spawned a host of rituals and superstitions, not to mention computer glitches, which AFP unpacks here:
Why one day more?
Leap years have been with us since the 16th century, an invention of the Gregorian calendar, introduced to deal with a troublesome fraction in the solar year.
Bearing in mind it takes around 365.2422 days each year for the Earth to revolve around the sun, the extra snippet (around six hours a year) adds up over time.
Leap days regulate things -- without them we would fall out of sync with the seasons, causing havoc for farmers and their crops as well as school holidays.
Most leap years fall every four years, but as the extra snippet is no…</span>

                              <span>Almost 500 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa last year, up 11 percent on 2022, despite government efforts to tackle the illicit trade in horns, ministers said Tuesday.
The country is home to a large majority of the world&#x27;s rhinos and a hotspot for poaching, which is driven by demand from Asia, where horns are used in traditional medicine for their supposed therapeutic effect.
The environment ministry said 499 of the thick-skinned herbivores were killed in 2023, mostly in state-run parks.
The lion&#x27;s share were poached in eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, with the Hluhluwe–Imfolozi park -- Africa&#x27;s oldest reserve -- alone losing 307 animals.
&quot;This is the highest poaching loss within this province,&quot; said Environment Minister Barbara Creecy.

                              <span>The French government issued a decree Tuesday banning the term &quot;steak&quot; on the label of vegetarian products, saying it was reserved for meat alone.
Other terms that can no longer be used for meat-free products include &quot;escalope&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;filet&quot; and &quot;prime rib&quot;, according to the decree.
The ruling is a response to a long-standing complaint by the meat industry that terms like &quot;vegetarian ham&quot; or &quot;vegan sausage&quot; were confusing for consumers.
It is based on a 2020 law whose application was temporarily suspended by the State Council in June 2022 after a complaint from Proteines France, a consortium of French companies selling plant-based food.
According to the revised decree published Tuesday, some products containing a small amount of plant-based content can continue to use meaty names, such as merguez sausage, bacon or cordon bleu.
Producers elsewhere in the European Union can continue to sell vegetarian food with meat names in France.
Proteines France has been arguing that the French law is at odds with EU food rules.
Individuals breaking the labelling law can be fined up to 1,500 euros ($1,630), rising to 7,500 euros for companies.
But producers have one year to sell their existing stock before any penalties are applied, the decree said.

U.S. President Joe Biden said Israel has agreed to halt military activities in Gaza for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as the Islamist group studied the draft proposal.
Based on a statement provided to Reuters by the source, the draft proposal for the first stage of the deal would last 40 days and the prisoner-hostage exchange would be at an overall ratio of 10 to one.
Also included in the proposal:

Both parties stop their military operations completely.

&quot;Police have been told a 71-year-old man allegedly assaulted a 51-year-old man at Neutral Bay Wharf about 2:30 am, before leaving the location,&quot; police spokeswoman Alicia McCumstie told AFP.
Australian police do not formally identify suspects.
However, the alleged victim -- veteran photographer Ben McDonald -- and a law enforcement source both identified the man accused as Swift&#x27;s father, Scott.
McDonald said he had been taking pictures of the US pop star and her entourage on a luxury superyacht in Sydney Harbour -- an apparent late-night celebration after the last of her four sellout …</span>

                              <span>The video, when it hit X, spurred the obvious response, noting Vladimir Putin, not Trump, is the nation&#x27;s president: &quot;Russia was never under Trump.&quot;
Syntactic errors aside, Ingraham appears to have been asking if Russia is now stronger than when Trump served as U.S. President, judging by the answer she gave to her own question. 

	&quot;Putin&#x27;s popularity seems to be fairly strong,&quot; she said. &quot;Price of oil — decent return for him despite sanctions — so he&#x27;s gotten stronger under Biden, not under Trump!&quot;

Many  of those who saw and heard Ingraham make the statements quickly shared their responses. 
&quot;More Russia propaganda from Fox News,&quot; wrote @nawfmeskin. 
&quot;Any increase in Putin’s strength is **directly** attributable to US House G☭P, who refuse to send aid to Ukraine,&quot; argued @fanofwalt.
However, @CFC_jogues appeared to side with her, suggesting that Biden hasn&#x27;t been as effective in curbing Russian&#x27;s sway.  &quot;Russia is obviously stronger now. They don&#x27;t regard Biden. They regarded and feared Trump.&quot;
An X user called Resistor Sister disagreed. 
&quot;Like the good little Comrade she is,&quot; she wrote. &quot;@IngrahamAngle recites Putin’s talking points.&quot;

At Saturday&#x27;s ceremony, several winners were accused of making anti-Semitic remarks on stage in relation to Israel&#x27;s military assault, which began after an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas.
US filmmaker Ben Russell, wearing a Palestinian scarf, accused Israel of committing &quot;genocide&quot; with its bombardment of the densely populated Gaza Strip.
Palestinian filmmaker Basel Adra said the Palestinian population were being &quot;massacred&quot; by Israel, to applause from the audience.

The vote, which passed with 188 votes for and six against, came as a culmination of months of wrangling by Hungary&#x27;s allies to convince its nationalist government to lift its block on Sweden&#x27;s membership. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán submitted the protocols for approving Sweden&#x27;s entry into NATO in July 2022, but the matter had stalled in parliament over opposition by governing party lawmakers.

                              <span>Associates of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Monday that talks were underway shortly before his death to exchange him for a Russian imprisoned in Germany.
“Alexei Navalny could have been sitting here now, today. It&#x27;s not a figure of speech,” Maria Pevchikh, who lives outside Russia, said in a video statement. She said she received confirmation the talks were in the “final stages” on February 15, the day before Navalny was reported dead. 
According to Pevchikh, Navalny and two US citizens held in Russia were supposed to be swapped for Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 killing in Berlin of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.

                              <span>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is questioning whether Donald Trump is loyal to the nation he seeks to lead.
Zelensky told CNN that Trump would be &quot;against Americans&quot; if he supported Russia over Ukraine, and he said the former president did not understand the conflict or Vladimir Putin&#x27;s intentions.
“I can’t understand how Donald Trump can be on the side of Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It&#x27;s unbelievable.&quot;
Trump, the clear Republican presidential frontrunner, has claimed he would end the conflict in a day if he&#x27;s re-elected and he has refused to say whether he supports Russia or Ukraine in the war.
“I think Donald Trump doesn’t know Putin,” Zelensky said. “I know he met him… but he never fought with Putin. (The) American army never fought with the army of Russia. Never… I have a better understanding.&quot;
“I don’t think he understands that Putin will never stop,” he added.
Last month, President Joe Biden warned Republicans that blocking vital US military aid for Ukraine threatened the &quot;free world&quot; as talks with congressional leaders at the White House failed to produce a breakthrough.
U.S. assistance for Ukraine has dried up with Republicans refusing to approve Biden&#x27;s request for $60 billion for Kyiv until the Democrat bows to their demands for measures to curb migration over the Mexican border.
The bitter partisan battle has been intensified by the looming US presidential election in November, and has raised deep concerns among Western allies who fear it could harm Kyiv&#x27;s fight against Russia&#x27;s invasion.
Biden told the visiting House and Senate leaders that the months-long standoff &quot;endangers the United States&#x27; national security, the NATO alliance, and the rest of the free world,&quot; the White House said.
&quot;The president called on Congress to quickly provide additional funding to support Ukraine and send a strong signal of US resolve. The president also made clear that we must act now to address the challenges at the border.&quot;</span>

Perhaps appropriately, it passes the newly-renovated Paris Sewer Museum and the more minimalist Pont d&#x27;Alma before looping back. The triathlon swims are shorter and will turn back sooner.

And both were keen to repurpose Trump&#x27;s electoral sales pitch -- &quot;Make America great again&quot; -- for the South American country.
&quot;Make Argentina great again,&quot; Trump said as they posed for photos backstage, while Milei rasped his famous Spanish-language slogan: &quot;Long live freedom, damn it!&quot;
Despite myriad legal woes, Trump is gearing up for a probable rematch with President Joe Biden in November&#x27;s elections, having lost to the Democrat in 2020.
And he was very much on home turf at CPAC, where he is wildly popular.
During his speech, Trump said Milei &quot;has achieved a lot, he is a great gentleman, he is MAGA,&quot; noting that the acronym for his famous tagline works with either country&#x27;s name.
Elected last year on a wave of anger over decades of economic crisis, right-winger Milei has embarked on massive economic deregulation by presidential decree.
He also has devalued the peso and cut state subsidies.
Milei too invoked &quot;MAGA&quot; in a speech.
&quot;We are not going to give up on making Argentina great again,&quot; he said, during an address in which he warned that the world &quot;is in danger&quot; due to socialism.
He ended with a plea: &quot;Do not give up your freedom, fight for your freedom because if you do not fight for freedom it will lead you to misery.&quot;

                              <span>More than two million animals have died in Mongolia so far this winter, a government official said Monday, as the country endures extreme cold and snow.
The landlocked country is no stranger to severe weather from December to March, when temperatures plummet as low as minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit) in some areas.
But this winter has been more severe than usual, with lower than normal temperatures and very heavy snowfall, the United Nations said in a recent report.
As of Monday, 2.1 million head of livestock had died from starvation and exhaustion, Gantulga Batsaikhan of the country&#x27;s agriculture ministry said.
Mongolia had 64.7 million such animals, including sheep, goats, horses and cows, at the end of 2023, official statistics show.
The extreme weather is known as &quot;dzud&quot; …</span>

                              <span>Glenn Kirschner appeared on MSNBC&#x27;s Ayman, where he was asked about former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was recently re-arrested after being let out of custody.
Specifically, the host asked Kirschner whether it appeared as the GOP leaders such as Jordan and James Comer ignored valid warnings about the informant&#x27;s information.

&quot;Were the Republicans in league or incompetent?&quot; Kirschner asked. &quot;It&#x27;s one or the other. And here&#x27;s the thing. There&#x27;s a lot to dislike, sort of every link of the chain here. First of all, the FBI writes down lots of things that human informants and confidential informants say. That doesn&#x27;t mean it is necessarily true. Yes, they record it in a form, 1023, but they write it down. It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s verified, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s accurate, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s reliable. Once they receive it, they have to go about the hard work of corroborating it, or debunking it. And it sounds like the FBI never corroborated, and indeed, ultimately debunked this disinformation.&quot;
He continued:
&quot;So why this debunked Russian disinformation would then be handed off to Republican members of Congress to be used as the basis to impeach an American president is mystifying, Ayman. And look, let&#x27;s use Jim Jordan as an example. You played a clip of him appearing to double down, even though he now knows it&#x27;s Russian disinformation, and Smirnov has been indicted for lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Jim Jordan is a serial abuser of his position and his authority. This is the guy who refused to comply with a lawfully issued congressional subpoena because had he complied and testified he might have incriminated Donald Trump.&quot;

A.J. Delgado, a former Trump 2016 campaign aide, made headlines in November of 2023 when she accused longtime Trump aide Jason Miller of engaging in &quot;a cycle of sexual coercion, rape, sexual assault, abuse, battery, sexual harassment, and sex trafficking.&quot;
Now she&#x27;s drawing attention to the situation in which a Venezuelan immigrant has been accused of killing a nursing student, Laken Riley.

Zelensky meanwhile put Russian losses at 180,000 dead and 500,000 wounded.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
