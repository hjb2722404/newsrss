                              <span>Reuters: FBI chief says TikTok &#x27;screams&#x27; of US national security concerns 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China&#x27;s government could use TikTok to control data on millions of American users, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday, saying the Chinese-owned video app &quot;screams&quot; of security concerns. 
Wray told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security that the Chinese government could also use TikTok to control software on millions of devices and drive narratives to divide Americans over Taiwan or other issues. 
&quot;Yes, and I would make the point on that last one, in particular, that we&#x27;re not sure that we would see many of the outward signs of it happening if it was happening,&quot; Wray said of concerns China could feed misinformation to users. 
 &quot;This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government - and it, to me, it screams out with national security concerns,&quot; Wray said.

    EurAsian Times: Iran Unveils World’s First ‘Air Defense Boat’ Capable Of Firing Deadly Missiles From Its Vertical Launch System – Analyst 
Iran’s second navy, under the IRGC, has developed the world’s first very small air-defense boat amid rising concerns about Tehran’s burgeoning military power that is seen as a threat by countries in the Persian Gulf and Israel. 
The development of a small defense boat is unique in its own right. 
This is the first-of-its-kind vessel Iran has likely produced for domestic use by the Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, according to a report by Naval Analyst and OSINT expert HI Sutton. 
Subsequently, a video surfaced on social media in which a Nawab surface-to-air missile is released from the Vertical Launch System of the boat. According to military observers, this air defense boat was modified and converted from the British Bladerunner. This is due to the hull’s shape, which resembles the Bladerunner.

&#x27;The solution&#x27;s got to come from the host nation itself,&#x27; said Gen. Wayne Eyre  
Canada&#x27;s top general said he was concerned that his country&#x27;s armed forces, which are already stretched thin by support for Ukraine and NATO, do not have the capacity to lead a possible security mission to Haiti. 
Haiti&#x27;s government and top United Nations officials have called for an international force to support Haitian police in their struggle against gangs, which have become the de facto authorities in parts of the country.

DW: Most Germans want compulsory military service return — poll 
Compulsory military service was suspended in 2011. A recent survey suggests 61% of Germans want it reintroduced, with over a third saying it should apply to women as well as men. 
The majority of Germans want to restore compulsory military service, which was scrapped in 2011, a survey revealed on Thursday, as war on the European continent between Russia and Ukraine drags on for over a year. 
The survey was conducted by the Paris-based Ipsos MORI group  , a multinational market research and consulting company. It polled 1,000 eligible voters aged between 18 and 75 nationwide. 
The poll revealed that 61% of the respondents were in favor of reintroducing compulsory service. 
Furthermore, 43% believed that compulsory service should apply to all genders, while the remaining 18% said it should apply but only to men, as was the case under the now-defunct law.

Warzone/The Drive: USAF Testing ‘Mutant’ Missiles That Twist In Mid-Air To Hit Their Targets  
The Air Force sees missiles with articulating noses as one way to take on increasingly maneuverable threats.  
The U.S. Air Force is exploring a novel concept for increasing the likelihood of scoring a hit in air-to-air combat. The idea is to use an air-to-air missile with a nose that bends to get at the target before it can get away. The service views this as one path to giving current and future combat aircraft, including a sixth-generation stealth jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance program, a new way to engage increasingly maneuverable threats. 
The Air Force Research Laboratory highlighted what is formally known as the Missile Utility Transformation via Articulated Nose Technology (MUTANT) project at this week&#x27;s 2023 Air and Space Forces Association&#x27;s Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado. AFRL says that MUTANT leverages work that has been done over the past six years on related technologies, but notes the core concept takes advantage of related research and experimentation dating back all the way to the 1950s.

Yonhap News Agency: N. Korea likely to conduct nuclear test amid continued missile testing: U.S. report 
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Yonhap) -- North Korea is expected to conduct a nuclear test as it continues to develop its missile capabilities in an attempt to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, a U.S. intelligence report said Wednesday. 
The 2023 Annual Threat Assessment also noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may have no intention to give up his nuclear weapons. 
&quot;Kim almost certainly views nuclear weapons and ICBMs as the ultimate guarantor of his autocratic rule and has no intention of abandoning those programs, believing that over time he will gain international acceptance as a nuclear power,&quot; said the report, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Con Coughlin, The Telegraph: Iran is gearing up to attack Britain and the West  
With world attention understandably focused on the Ukraine crisis, we should not be surprised that rogue nations should be seeking to exploit the conflict in order to advance their own nefarious agendas. 
For most of the past decade, British security officials, when asked to rank hostile states that threaten our national wellbeing, have put Russia in first place, with China coming a close second. 
Other threats, such as those posed by Iran and North Korea, as well as the continuing challenge presented by militant Islamist groups, have been deemed less immediate while still worthy of close monitoring. 
The suggestion, therefore, that the Islamic Republic of Iran is now regarded as posing the second most potent threat to Britain in security circles shows just how much progress the ayatollahs have made in developing their military strength while the rest of the world has been distracted by the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine.

* &quot;I don&#x27;t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it,&quot; McCarthy said. 
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s invitation for him to visit Kyiv amid growing concerns over GOP pushback to continued aid to Ukraine. McCarthy also reiterated that he does not support providing Ukraine with &quot;blank checks.&quot; 
 &quot;Let&#x27;s be very clear about what I said: no blank checks, OK? So, from that perspective, I don&#x27;t have to go to Ukraine to understand where there&#x27;s a blank check or not,&quot; McCarthy told CNN on Wednesday. 
&quot;I will continue to get my briefings and others, but I don&#x27;t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it. And my point has always been, I won&#x27;t provide a blank check for anything.&quot;

Reuters: Ukraine Seeks US Cluster Bombs to Adapt for Drone Use - Lawmakers 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine has broadened a request for controversial cluster bombs from the United States to include a weapon that it wants to cannibalize to drop the anti-armor bomblets it contains on Russian forces from drones, according to two U.S. lawmakers. 
Kyiv has urged members of Congress to press the White House to approve sending the weapons but it is by no means certain that the Biden administration will sign off on that. Cluster munitions, banned by more than 120 countries, normally release large numbers of smaller bomblets that can kill indiscriminately over a wide area, threatening civilians.

Insider: Putin thinks &#x27;Ukraine matters more to him&#x27; than to the West and that he&#x27;ll eventually win his disastrous war, CIA chief warns 
* Putin is playing the long game in Ukraine, according to CIA chief Bill Burns. 
* &quot;He&#x27;s convinced that he can make time work for him,&quot; Burns told House lawmakers. 
* Putin still thinks he can win, Burns said, even though the war has been disastrous for Russia. 
Between heavy casualties on the battlefield and crippling economic sanctions, the war in Ukraine has been disastrous for Russia. But CIA Director Bill Burns said that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains convinced he can win the fight because he believes that time is on his side. 
&quot;I think he&#x27;s doubling down,&quot; Burns, a former US ambassador to Russia, said during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday. &quot;I believe he&#x27;s convinced that he can make time work for him, that he can grind down the Ukrainians through this war of attrition, that he can wear down Western supporters of Ukraine.&quot;

WNU Editor: The CIA Director is right. I do not see President Biden focused on Ukraine as much as President Putin is focused on the war. And there is a precedent that Putin will play the long game. Putin was Russian President for the second Chechen war, and that war lasted 9 years.</span>

The leader of Moldova&#x27;s breakaway region said on Thursday that his government would appeal to the UN Security Council to probe a &quot;terror&quot; attack and ensure the security of Transnistria. 
Pro-Russian authorities in the region earlier on Thursday accused Kyiv of planning such an attack, fueling fears of a spillover of the Ukraine conflict. 
 &quot;I have already instructed the foreign minister to prepare appeals to all members of the UN Security Council,&quot; Transnistria leader Vadim Krasnoselsky told residents in a live broadcast, adding it was important to &quot;look into this situation and ensure our safety.&quot; 
He claimed that members of Ukraine&#x27;s SBU security service were involved.

The U.S. military would have to focus on sinking Chinese ships if a war broke out over Taiwan, according to the commander of the United States&#x27; Pacific Air Forces. 
That&#x27;s one of the lessons Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach took from the scramble of military activity that accompanied a visit by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to the island in August 2022. 
&quot;You saw when Speaker Pelosi went to Taiwan, what [China] did with their ships,&quot; Wilsbach told reporters at the Air &amp; Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado, on Wednesday. &quot;They put them on the east side of Taiwan&quot; -- the side opposite China -- &quot;as a sort of blockade.&quot;

DNI Avril Haines unpacked the &#x27;complex&#x27; threat posed by China, Russia, North Korea and Iran 
New concerns over U.S. readiness have mounted since the U.S. intelligence community warned of &quot;complex&quot; international relations and growing threats to America&#x27;s national security. 
Fox News contributor and former Special Operations intel analyst Brett Velicovich warned on &quot;Varney &amp; Co,&quot; Thursday, that the country is not prepared to face the threats from global powers including China. 
&quot;I don&#x27;t think we are prepared at this point,&quot; Velicovich said. &quot;I mean, China is already at war with us. We have an archaic military-industrial complex right now in the U.S. that likes to tell itself it&#x27;s built for speed and innovation and this new digital battlefield, but in reality, the layers of bureaucracy and unnecessary oversight is [sic] getting in the way of U.S. innovation. And China&#x27;s government, they seem to get it.&quot;   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The above Fox News contributor and former Special Operations intel analyst Brett Velicovich is spot on when he said this .... &quot;one of the most dangerous things that could be created from especially recent wars in Europe is a formal alliance between China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.&quot; 
Since the time of Nixon going to Beijing, one of the top national security priorities of the US has been to make sure that a Russia - China alliance does not happen. Why this priority has been abandoned by the current White House completely perplexes me. 
If trends continue and this formal alliance between China and Russia does happen, the consequences will be felt globally for decades. And yes, the US is certainly not prepared to face this foreign threat.</span>

&quot;The world has gone mad,&quot; says one mourner holding a bouquet of white roses and approaching the entrance of the brick building, cordoned off by police.
The body bags are carefully placed in hearses before being driven away and the man with the bouquet leaves with his flowers still in hand.
&quot;It really upsets me,&quot; says Tatjana Popczy, who lives just 200 metres (yards) from the centre where a former member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses burst into a service at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) on Thursday, killing six people.

                              <span>Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won&#x27;t be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia&#x27;s year-long military invasion.
As reported by CBS News&#x27; Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a &quot;bigger war&quot; in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was &quot;done&quot; with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while &quot;America First&quot; Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.</span>

Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial &quot;foreign agent&quot; legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s King Charles III on Friday awarded his younger brother Edward the title Duke of Edinburgh, in line with the wishes of the late Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip.
Philip, who was the last holder of the title, had always wanted it to be inherited by Edward.
Charles conferred the title on Edward, currently known as the Earl of Wessex, on his 59th birthday.
&quot;His Majesty The King has been pleased to confer the Dukedom of Edinburgh upon the Prince Edward,&quot; Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
The title will not however be inherited by Edward&#x27;s teenage son James. The 15-year-old will instead become the new Earl of Wessex.
Edward&#x27;s wife Sophie who was particularly close to Elizabeth, who died last September, will now be known as the Duchess of Edinburgh.
The new duke and duchess will be in Edinburgh later on Friday at a reception to mark the first year of the conflict in Ukraine.
The dukedom was created for Prince Philip in 1947 after his marriage to the then Princess Elizabeth.
Philip, who died in April 2021, had favored Edward inheriting his title, but the decision ultimately had to be made by Charles as King.
Earlier this week Buckingham Palace also updated its website&#x27;s list of succession in relation to the two children of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.
The children are now listed as Prince Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Princess Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor.
Although they automatically became a prince and princess when Harry&#x27;s father King Charles acceded to the throne last year, they had remained listed as plain &quot;master&quot; and &quot;miss&quot; on the website.
The titles had emerged as a contentious issue after Harry and Meghan quit royal life and moved to California in 2020.

Freddy developed off the north Australian coast and became a named storm on February 6.

Freddy has been a named tropical cyclone for 33 days.
Once it has dissipated, a WMO climate extremes expert committee will assess all the data to determine whether a new record has been indeed set -- a process which could take months.

He had left the community voluntarily a year and a half ago, according to officials at a press conference on Friday.
Police said those killed by the shooter were four men, two women and an unborn child. The mother was 28 weeks pregnant.
The perpetrator also died during the incident.
Hamburg&#x27;s Senator of the Interior Andy Grote said police had &quot;very likely&quot; saved lives after the shooting rampage with their &quot;fast and decisive&quot; action.

                              <span>Pope Francis, the first Jesuit and Latin American pope, on Monday marks 10 years as the head of the Catholic Church. Below are some key dates in his papacy.
- March 13, 2013: Jorge Mario Bergoglio is elected 266th pope, succeeding Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down. He chooses the name Francis in reference to Francis of Assisi, patron saint of the poor.
- July 8, 2013: Francis chooses the Italian island of Lampedusa, a major gateway to Europe for migrants, for his first voyage as pope where he castigates the &quot;globalisation of indifference.&quot; Three years later in 2016, Francis will bring back 12 families from a migrant camp in Lesbos, Greece.
- July 11, 2013: Launches a reform of the Vatican&#x27;s penal code to fight sexual abuse against minors and corruption within the Church.

Rather than leave the area due to the precarious security situation, the missionaries have strengthened their presence.
&quot;There were three of us. And now there will be five of us,&quot; said Jesus Reyes, a Jesuit priest who witnessed the shooting by an alleged drug trafficker in the village of Cerocahui in Chihuahua state.
&quot;We&#x27;re staying here with our people,&quot; including members of the Raramuri Indigenous community that the Jesuits began to evangelize in the 17th century, he added.
In the village square overlooking the Copper Canyon, security forces watched over the religious mission.

Ocean plastic pollution is a persistent problem around the globe -- animals may become entangled in larger pieces of plastic like fishing nets, or ingest microplastics that eventually enter the food chain to be consumed by humans. 
Research published on Wednesday found that there are an estimated 170 trillion pieces of plastic, mainly microplastics, on the surface of the world&#x27;s oceans today, much of it discarded since 2005. 
&quot;Plastic pollution in the world&#x27;s oceans during the past 15 years has reached unprecedented levels,&quot; said the study, published in open-access journal PLOS One.

Firstly, there are two glowing earrings in the image hanging in the Mauritshuis museum in the Dutch city of The Hague. And aren&#x27;t those freckles on her face actually... a slightly inhuman shade of red?
That&#x27;s because the work -- one of several fan recreations replacing the 1665 original while it&#x27;s on loan for a huge Vermeer show at Amsterdam&#x27;s Rijksmuseum -- was made using artificial intelligence (AI).
Its presence has sparked a fierce debate, with questions over whether it belongs in the hallowed halls of the Mauritshuis -- and whether it should be classed as art at all.

SHINCHIMACHI, Japan (Reuters) - A chilly dawn paints the sky magenta and purple as Japanese fisherman Haruo Ono unloads his catch of flounder, crab and sea bass from his boat at the small port of Shinchimachi.
A third-generation fisherman, Ono, 71, has been putting to sea for half a century from Shinchimachi, 55 km (34 miles) north of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, the scene in 2011 of one of the world&#x27;s worst nuclear disasters.
On March 11 that year, a 9 magnitude earthquake struck offshore sending tsunami waves smashing into Japan&#x27;s east coast. Ono rode out the waves at sea on his boat but on land, the waves devastated Shinchimachi and obliterated Ono&#x27;s home.

Eight people were killed, &quot;apparently&quot; including the suspected perpetrator, in the shooting at a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses event in the northern city of Hamburg, German police confirmed on Friday morning.
Police investigators are still gathering evidence at the crime scene after the rampage on Thursday evening in the northern Groß Borstel district of the city.
The operation was ongoing and &quot;everything is in flux,&quot; said a police spokesperson.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the shooting as a &quot;brutal act of violence.&quot;
&quot;My thoughts are with [the victims] and their families. And with the security forces who have faced a difficult operation,&quot; the German chancellor wrote on Twitter on Friday morning.
A police press conference has been scheduled for Friday at around midday (1100 GMT).

(Reuters) - The Federated States of Micronesia held talks with Taiwan in February about switching diplomatic ties for $50 million in assistance after growing frustrated at China, the outgoing president of the Pacific island nation has said in a letter.
Tensions between the United States and China for security influence in the Pacific islands are rising, and FSM President David Panuelo was a prominent critic of China&#x27;s attempt to strike a 10-nation security and trade pact.
Panuelo lost his seat in Tuesday&#x27;s national poll, election officials confirmed.
In a letter sent to state governors viewed by Reuters, Panuelo said he met with Taiwan&#x27;s foreign minister Joseph Wu in February to discuss switching diplomatic recognition.

KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s first missile blitz on Ukrainian cities in weeks was met with defiance and disgust over the targeting of civilians, while Ukrainian forces defending the eastern town of Bakhmut continued to thwart Russian attempts to break through.
The pre-dawn barrage on Thursday killed at least nine civilians and cut electricity supplies in several cities, but there was relief that the risk of a catastrophic meltdown at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was averted as power was restored after a temporary disconnection from the Ukrainian grid.

The shift from Australia&#x27;s diesel-electric fleet to nuclear-powered subs brings additional range, stealth and strike capability - crucial capabilities given Canberra&#x27;s reliance on sea cargo for trade, and undersea cables for telecommunications, they said. &quot;This is the biggest step forward in our military c...</span>

                              <span>[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Imagine applying to 25 of the world’s top universities and getting accepted into all of them. Jamie Beaton did exactly that and that isn’t even the most impressive thing about him.   Beaton graduated from Harvard University in 2016 with a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree two years ahead of schedule. At just 20 years old, he became one of the youngest admits to Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), arguably the world’s top MBA school. In 2022, he completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford on the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.  But his success story is not just about impressive credentials — he uses his own experience to support other students to reach for the stars as he did. At just 17, Jamie co-founded Crimson Education, now the world&#x27;s largest and most effective college admissions consulting firm which has supported over 20,000 students to gain offers to the most competitive universities.

His journey began in his teenage years, when he fearlessly charged ahead in his interests and academic pursuits.     The Making of a Prodigy: Jamie’s Teenage Years  Beaton was no different from the average New Zealand teenager who loved playing video games and going to amusement parks. He had his secondary education at King&#x27;s College, New Zealand, and planned to study medicine at his home university, the University of Auckland. Everything changed at 15 when he had a chat with a senior, who suggested that Beaton explore options outside Auckland. That’s when he started to shift his focus and set his sights on the Ivy League, Oxbridge, and other top international universities.  Beaton took 10 A-Levels instead of the usual three. With a stellar academic and extracurricular profile, he received offers from all 25 top universities he applied to,…</span>

* Could last longer as China, Iran and North Korea rumoured to supply weapons
Russia has enough weaponry to keep the Ukraine war going for another two years - even without support from another nation, 
Lithuania&#x27;s military intelligence service said today.  &#x27;Russia had been accumulating weapons and equipment over the long years of the Cold War,&#x27; military intelligence chief Elegijus Paulavicius said and added: &#x27;We estimate that (its) resources would last for another two years of a war of the same intensity as today.&#x27;
Russia has a large amount of weaponry stored in its reserves, which would allow them to &#x27;cause enormous damage and increase the costs of restoration,&#x27; he said.

Soldiers and analysts suggest defending city has become more of a political than practical issue, as Russian push continues 
Ukrainian soldiers are being pummelled on three sides by Russian forces who are trying to capture Bakhmut, a city in the eastern Donetsk region that has become the focus of the longest and one of the bloodiest battles since the war began. 
Ukraine’s authorities insist they will continue to try to hold the city despite them suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day – with some saying the reason is more political and symbolic than practical. Retreating from the city now, after so many soldiers died fighting to keep it, would be a hard reality to face.

PARIS (Reuters) -Train and air traffic will again be disrupted in France on Thursday and garbage collection in cities including Paris will be patchy as strikes against a planned pension reform are set to enter a third consecutive day. 
Opinion polls show a majority of voters oppose President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s plan to delay the retirement age by two years to 64, but the government says the policy change is essential to ensure the system does not go bust. 
Workers in several sectors including oil refineries and railways continued to strike on Wednesday and plan to carry on for the rest of the week after record numbers of people took to the streets on Tuesday as part of a nationwide day of industrial action.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgia&#x27;s ruling party said on Thursday it was dropping a bill on &quot;foreign agents&quot; after two nights of violent protests against what opponents said was a Russian-inspired authoritarian shift that imperilled hopes of the country joining the European Union. 
The Georgian Dream ruling party said in a statement it would &quot;unconditionally withdraw the bill we supported, without any reservations&quot;. It cited the need to reduce &quot;confrontation&quot; in society, while also denouncing &quot;lies&quot; told about the bill by the &quot;radical opposition&quot;. 
However, opposition leaders said the protests would resume at 7 p.m. (1500 GMT). Giga Lemonjava, a representative of the Droa party, said they were demanding that the government formally denounce the bill and release all those detained during the protests.

Warzone/The Drive: B-21 Raider Seen From Above In New Image 
As the B-21 creeps towards its first flight, still slated for later this year, we are getting new looks at it and new insights. 
Two new images of the B-21 Raider next-generation stealth bomber have been released by the U.S. Air Force. One is a detailed close-up of the B-21&#x27;s nose and cockpit section, the other provides us with the first look at the planform of the secretive new jet, which aims to replace the B-2 and the B-1. 
The elevated image underscores the B-21&#x27;s overall layout, which harkens back to what the B-2 would have looked like if requirements for low-level penetration were not introduced mid-way through its development. This planform also would have given the B-2 a substantially higher operating ceiling, which the B-21 will likely achieve. While the image overall is compressed due to the wide angle lens, it still highlights the B-21&#x27;s smaller proportions compared to its now well over three decades-old progenitor.

Global freedoms declined for a 17th consecutive year in 2022 as the struggle for democracy approaches a turning point amid a curtailment of freedom of expression in countries such as Russia and Iran. 
Human rights watchdog Freedom House said in its annual report on freedoms around the world, released on March 9, that the number of countries to score zero for freedom of expression rose on the year to 33 from 14, with media freedom coming under pressure in at least 157 countries and territories during 2022.

Stoltenberg says NATO needs to ramp up arms production in order to keep supplies flowing to Ukraine 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said the hard-fought city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s Donetsk region may fall to Russian troops &quot;in the coming days.&quot; 
His comments followed claims by Russia’s mercenary Wagner Group which said it had taken the eastern part of the city after months of a brutal ground and air offensive. 
Fox News Digital could not verify the group&#x27;s claims and Stoltenberg did not confirm whether any part of the city has yet fallen to Moscow.

The European Union is looking at how to boost ammunition supplies in both the short and long term at a meeting in Stockholm. A top EU official has called for &quot;a war economy.&quot; 
Defense ministers from the EU&#x27;s 27 member states are meeting in the Swedish capital on Wednesday to debate plans to refill Ukraine&#x27;s ammunition stockpiles from their own while also ramping up production within the bloc. 
The meeting comes amid concerns that Ukraine will run out of the 155-millimeter howitzer shells that have played a key role in the country&#x27;s defense against the full-scale Russian invasion that began in February 2022. 
The EU ministers will discuss the possibility of sending €1 billion worth ($1.06 billion) of shells from their own stockpiles while at the same time considering how to ramp up the bloc&#x27;s homegrown arms production capacities.

Avril Haines tells of ‘grinding, attritional war’ but sounds cautious note over Ukraine’s prospects in expected counter-offensive 
Washington does not believe the Russian military can recover from its losses in Ukraine to make territorial gains there this year, the top US intelligence official has said, but she warned that Vladimir Putin still believes that time is on his side. 
The assessment, presented by the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, at a Senate hearing on Wednesday morning, was noncommittal on whether Ukraine could take back significant amounts of occupied land in its planned counter-offensive this spring. Haines said that would depend on multiple factors, including the loss of Ukrainian troops and equipment in resisting Russian attacks.

Special forces are involved in the security operation following a deadly shooting in a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses building in the German city of Hamburg, officials say.
Hamburg police are deployed in the area &quot;with a large contingent, including special forces, to ensure security at the scene and to quickly and comprehensively clarify the detailed circumstances of the crime,&quot; the city&#x27;s Senator of the Interior, Andy Grote, wrote on Twitter.
The incident occurred in the northern Groß Borstel area of the city.

                              <span>A federal judge on Thursday ordered investment banking giant JP Morgan to turn over documents related to CEO Jamie Dimon and late child sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.
As reported by Law &amp; Crime&#x27;s Adam Klasfeld, the judge ordered the bank to turn over the documents at the request of the government of the United States Virgin Islands, which is investigating Epstein&#x27;s past as a client with JP Morgan.
Klasfeld notes that the judge did not outline any specifics behind its ruling, and that JP Morgan has insisted that Dimon had nothing to do with managing Epstein&#x27;s account at the firm.
JP Morgan recently sued former senior banker Jes Staley while alleging that he covered up &quot;personal activities&quot; he engaged in with Epstein that the bank says opened them up to potential legal liability.

The Virgin Islands&#x27; lawsuit against JP Morgan unveiled some of Staley&#x27;s significant contacts with Epstein earlier this year.
“Between 2008 and 2012, Staley exchanged approximately 1,200 emails with Epstein from his JP Morgan email account,” the government alleged. “These communications show a close personal relationship and ‘profound’ friendship between the two men and even suggest that Staley may have been involved in Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation.”</span>

The demonstrations were part of nationwide protests underway for more than two months against Netanyahu and his government&#x27;s contentious plan to overhaul the judiciary.
Demonstrators had made blocking Netanyahu&#x27;s route to the airport a centerpiece of their intensifying efforts to oppose the legal changes, and the optics of the Israeli leader having to make alternate travel plans were a win for the protest movement.
The helicopter ride, far from the snarling traffic triggered by the protest, was also sure to deepen Netanyahu&#x27;s reputation as being out of touch with Israelis a…</span>

In downtown Kabul, a patrol of accountants inspects a bazaar, billing shopkeepers for trading honey, hair conditioner and gas hobs under the snapping white flag of the country&#x27;s new rulers.
Afghanistan is frozen deep in a second winter of humanitarian turmoil since the Taliban seized power in 2021, but cash is changing hands at a dizzying pace.
The Taliban administration is proving adept at collecting tax -- and seemingly without the corruption associated with the previous administration.

Police accused the young trio of seeking to obstruct business at major restaurant chain Kura Sushi, which was bombarded with customer complaints after the video went viral.
The clip shows one member of the group grabbing a piece of sushi from a plate as it passes, shoving the whole morsel into their mouth and then drinking soy sauce directly from a communal bottle.
Similar videos filmed at different chains surfaced last month on platforms including Twitter and TikTok, with some apparently weeks or even years old.

                              <span>France&#x27;s Senate voted Thursday to raise the retirement age by two years to 64, as the government moves to overhaul the country&#x27;s pensions system in the face of strong opposition from labour unions.
The conservative-dominated legislative body voted in favor of a decisive article to raise the age of retirement by 201 votes to 115.
Debate will resume later on Thursday over a controversial amendment to the bill.
The Senate majority is rushing to meet a deadline of midnight Sunday to finalize the legislation.
Liberal politicians voiced anger following the vote.
&quot;Your name will forever be attached to a reform that will set the clock back almost 40 years,&quot; Socialist Monique Lubin told Labour Minister Olivier Dussopt.
Labour unions have vowed to pile pressure on the government by staging protests and strikes.
On Wednesday, fuel deliveries, trains and flights were disrupted for a second day following mass rallies.
Key sea ports were also blockaded, as dock workers were among those to join rolling strikes seeking to convince President Emmanuel Macron to reverse course on the bill he has championed.
Macron has put the change at the centre of his political agenda, with his government arguing that raising the retirement age and stiffening the requirements for a full pension are essential to keeping the system from sinking into deficit.
France lags behind most of its European neighbors, which have hiked the retirement age to 65 or above.

                              <span>On a windswept hillside in a remote corner of northern England, a peatland restoration plan pooling public and private money is underway which proponents claim provides a model for climate change mitigation.
Deploying a tank-like vehicle, helicopter, digger and a dozen-strong team building dams and other defences, the &quot;Ridge Graham&quot; project will return the site to its original waterlogged state, locking in carbon dioxide (CO2).
Currently, the 450 hectares (1,112 acres) of peatland by draining -- the size of 840 football fields -- and others like it in Britain and beyond are releasing greenhouse gases (GHGs), hindering efforts to go net-zero within decades.
The venture will use nascent carbon markets but is groundbreaking in England because it is the first time a company, rather than an NGO…</span>

In welcome good news for the climate-change race, researchers said Latin American countries had more than 319 gigawatts of utility-scale solar- and wind-power projects due to be launched by 2030 -- equal to nearly 70 percent of the region&#x27;s total current electrical capacity from all sources combined.
&quot;Rich in wind and solar resources, Latin America has the potential to be a global leader for renewable energy,&quot; said the report by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a US-based non-profit that tracks clean-energy development.

                              <span>Reuters: US spy chiefs see China-Russia &#x27;love affair&#x27; continuing 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China will deepen its cooperation with Russia to try to challenge the United States despite international condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine, the leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies said on Wednesday. 
&quot;Despite global backlash over Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, China will maintain its diplomatic, defense, economic, and technology cooperation with Russia to continue trying to challenge the United States, even as it will limit public support,&quot; they said in a threat assessment released as the Senate Intelligence Committee held its annual hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security.

                              <span>A landlord in Canada changed the locks on a home and took votes from its occupants on whether one of the tenants could return, the Daily Hive reported. 
Man-Ling Weng claimed Daichi Araki owed him $4,500 in damages, which Araki disagreed with. 
Details from a British Columbia small claims case at the Civil Resolution Tribunal say Weng became a tenant at the home in 2019 but took over rent-collecting duties in 2020 as well as other responsibilities. Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. 
On September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive&#x27;s report as &quot;SJC,&quot; to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”

When Weng&#x27;s return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn&#x27;t initially signal any objections to the extended return date. 
Araki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.
&quot;In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170,&quot; the Hive&#x27;s report stated.</span>

                              <span>Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed former President Donald Trump on Monday and, apparently, omitted crucial chunks of their conversation about Ukraine when it was broadcast to Hannity&#x27;s radio audience.
Justin Baragona, the senior media reporter at The Daily Beast, noticed the discrepancy on Tuesday.
&quot;According to Trump, all he needed to do was let Russia &#x27;take over&#x27; parts of Ukraine,&quot; Baragona explained. &quot;Saying that Russia was going for the &#x27;whole enchilada&#x27; with Joe Biden as president, Trump added that Russia &#x27;took over nothing&#x27; while he was in the White House because Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x27;understood&#x27; that &#x27;he would have never done it.&#x27;&quot;
Trump added, &quot;that&#x27;s without even negotiating a deal. I could have negotiated. At worst, I could&#x27;ve made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could&#x27;ve worked a deal.&quot;
But as Baragona pointed out, that is not what Hannity played.
&quot;Instead, shortly after Trump says, &#x27;I could have negotiated,&#x27; the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that &#x27;China no longer respects the United States,&#x27;&quot; Baragona observed.
Baragona also noted that &quot;besides asserting that he would have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine by making a deal to let them &#x27;take over something,&#x27; Trump also said in the portion not aired by Fox that &#x27;so many more people are dying than is being reported&#x27; while reiterating this &#x27;would have never happened&#x27; under his watch.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Luis Moreno Ocampo was just 32 years old and had no trial experience when he was summoned to prosecute Argentina&#x27;s generals in 1985 after a disastrous military dictatorship -- a story retold in an Oscar-nominated film.
Moreno Ocampo, who went on to become the first prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, says &quot;Argentina, 1985&quot; can help teach global audiences about the risks of losing democracy -- and the importance of public opinion.
&quot;You&#x27;ve got to win your case in court. But then it&#x27;s a battle for the memory,&quot; the 70-year-old Ocampo told AFP in an interview in Malibu, California, where he currently lives.
&quot;I won the battle... in 1985. But (with this movie), Santiago Mitre and Ricardo Darin are winning the battle for memory in 2023, and that&#x27;s unique.&quot;

The findings provide evidence that a basic belief about what it means to be a man could have significant consequences around the world. The new study examined precarious manhood beliefs, which refer to the idea that manhood is something that must be earned and maintained through demonstrations of toughness, control, and dominance. According to this belief, manhood is vulnerable to being lost and men ...</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
