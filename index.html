                              <span>News Corp columnist Louise Roberts says Prince William has “unleashed his fury” in an effective and calculated way. 

Ms Roberts’ remarks come after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were evicted from Frogmore Cottage by King Charles following the release of the Duke of Sussex’s bombshell memoir Spare. 

“William and Kate would rather have Prince Andrew and all the chaos that comes with him as their neighbour … rather than his own brother and his own sister-in-law,” she told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo. 

“I find the way that William has played this is absolutely textbook – it&#x27;s really strategic with a really strong hit of … revenge.”</span>

The Intel Drop: 2nd Kinzhal Attack Hits NATO’s Western Command Center 80 meters Underground, 40 Killed 
IN western Ukraine a Russian Forces Kinzhal struck a bunker extending to 80 metres deep. The RF believes this bunker near Lvov was a NATO strategic command point used to control anti-aircraft systems. It’s still early days but the RF assumes there were up to 300 personnel in the bunker, 40 of which were high ranking foreign specialists, hence we can expect 40 body bags heading west in due course. Unconfirmed in the Nikolaevsk region the RF destroyed four senior militants, and a number of officers and planners. 
As NATO fly’s its spy planes along the Moldavian/Transnistrian (Priednestrovie) border collecting data for the Ukrainians, their troops are positioning themselves to invade Transnistria in Moldova’s breakaway region. A significant build-up of Ukrainian personnel and equipment including setting up of artillery positions and an “unprecedented” increase of drone flights over the region indicate the preparation for an invasion of the sovereign territory that was declared independent in the early 1990s. Half of Transnistria’s 500,000 residents have Russian citizenship.

CNN: North Korea fires 2 missiles from submarine, state media reports  
North Korea launched two missiles from a submarine in the waters of the Sea of Japan Sunday morning local time, according to the state-run news agency KCNA. 
The “strategic cruise missiles” were launched from a “8.24 Yongung” submarine, according to KCNA – the same vessel used to test North Korea’s first submarine-launched ballistic missile in 2016, CNN previously reported. 
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said earlier Sunday that North Korea fired at least one unidentified missile from a submarine near the port city of Sinpo in the South Hamgyong province. 
KCNA claimed the missiles flew for over an hour, traveling roughly 1,500 km (932 miles) per hour and performing figure-of-eight shaped patterns before “precisely” hitting a target.

USS Gerald R. Ford — the US Navy&#x27;s newest supercarrier — is operating underway with all of its available airpower for the first time. 
A Navy official confirmed to Insider reporting from Navy Times that this is the first time the entire carrier air wing has been embarked on the Ford for an underway period. The ship is underway for a composite training unit exercise known as COMPTUEX. 
This exercise &quot;assesses a carrier strike group&#x27;s abilities to conduct military operations at sea and project power ashore through joint planning and execution of challenging and realistic training scenarios,&quot; 2nd Fleet spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Kristi Johnson told Insider. &quot;This evaluation is planned and executed by the Carrier Strike Group 4 staff, and it tests the mission-readiness of deployable assets to perform as an integrated unit.&quot;

CNN: When China shot down five U-2 spy planes at the height of the Cold War  
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — When a Chinese high-altitude balloon suspected of spying was spotted over the United States recently, the US Air Force responded by sending up a high-flying espionage asset of its own: the U-2 reconnaissance jet.
It was the Cold-War era spy plane that took the high-resolution photographs – not to mention its pilot’s selfie – that reportedly convinced Washington the Chinese balloon was gathering intelligence and not, as Beijing continues to insist, studying the weather. 
In doing so, the plane played a key role in an event that sent tensions between the world’s two largest economies soaring, and shone an international spotlight on the methods the two governments use to keep tabs on each other.

Reuters: Iran to buy Su-35 fighter jets from Russia - Iranian broadcaster 
DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said on Saturday, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia&#x27;s war on Ukraine. 
&quot;The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase,&quot; the broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran&#x27;s mission to the United Nations in New York as saying. 
IRIB&#x27;s report did not carry any Russian confirmation of the deal, details of which were not disclosed. 
The mission said Iran had also inquired about buying military aircraft from several other unnamed countries, IRIB reported.  Iran&#x27;s purchase of Russian fighter jets was first reported by news website Semafor on Thursday.

Russians were warned today to take anti-radiation pills and rush to their nearest nuclear bomb shelters after hackers compromised state television servers to broadcast chilling messages. 
TV and radio programmes in Moscow and the Sverdlovsk region, including Yekaterinburg city, were interrupted with an alarming message telling citizens a missile strike had been conducted on Russian soil. 
The population was urged to take potassium iodide pills, don gas masks to protect themselves and to seek shelter.

Tehran, Iran – Iran and Saudi Arabia have agreed to re-establish diplomatic relations in a China-brokered deal that could have wide-ranging consequences but building on it, analysts say, will prove the main challenge. 
The agreement signed in Beijing on Friday said the two countries’ foreign ministers will meet to discuss diplomatic missions within two months, marking the end of a seven-year rift.

   WNU editor: I would not compare Ukraine&#x27;s current demogaphic collapse to the Ukraine famine of 1932-33 that is known as Holodomor (link here). 
But I do know that when this war is finally over and new boundaries are drawn, and they will be redrawn, Ukraine&#x27;s population will be around 25 million. 
What will also make the situation worse is that many of those who fled Ukraine are not going to return. I know among all of the Ukrainian refugees that I have helped in the past year, with the exception of a few who are elderly, the rest have made the decision to call Canada home, and they have no intention of returning back.</span>

Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian politician acting as head of the Russian-annexed Crimea since 2014, said that the territory should &quot;prepare for war&quot; against Ukraine. 
According to Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti, Aksyonov&#x27;s statement was more of a warning than a straight-out declaration of intent. 
&quot;God protects the safe. And I always stand in the position: if you want peace, prepare for war,&quot; Aksyonov said during an interview with Ria Novosti.  &quot;Therefore, we&#x27;d better be ready. Both the Crimeans and all of Russia will sleep peacefully in this regard,&quot; he added.

Zero Hedge: China Foresees End Of Ukraine War This Summer: Report 
A fascinating new report in Nikkei Asia has unearthed and detailed the findings of an elite Chinese state-linked think tank which reports directly to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Nikkei in the context of examining the timing and motives behind China&#x27;s 12-point peace plan said that Chinese military experts are predicting the Russia-Ukraine war will end this summer. 
To review, the 12-point plan urged implementation of a ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations toward a permanent peaceful settlement, and was unveiled on the one-year Feb.24 anniversary of the war. But the Nikkei report asserts there&#x27;s specific rationale driving Beijing: &quot;The reason for China&#x27;s sudden change can be traced back to a report issued two months earlier by a top think tank in Beijing.&quot;

Chinese President Xi Jinping cements his grip on power as parliament wraps up its legislative meetings. But Xi faces immense challenges in his third term. 
Chinese President Xi Jingping is cementing his power. After unanimously getting himself elected for an unprecedented third term on Friday, he has now installed another close confident in a key post; Li Qiang was elected by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) this Saturday as China&#x27;s new premier. 
Li, best known as the enforcer of last year&#x27;s coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai, is believed to have earned Xi&#x27;s trust by sticking to the strict zero-COVID strategy despite months-long protests in China&#x27;s biggest city.

                              <span>Washington Post: Mexico’s president rebukes GOP push to use U.S. military against cartels 
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pushed back Thursday against Republican lawmakers who have urged the Biden administration to take military action against the country’s drug cartels across the border after the abduction of four Americans in the border city of Matamoros. He said such demands threatened Mexican sovereignty. 
“We are not going to allow any foreign government to intervene and much less foreign armed forces to intervene in our territory,” López Obrador said at a news conference, adding that he would ask Americans of Mexican and Hispanic origin not to vote for Republicans if their “aggression” continued. 
López Obrador also sought to deflect attention from Mexico’s role in the fentanyl epidemic. He claimed his country does not produce the substance, which is responsible for the majority of U.S. drug overdose deaths, and cast its abuse as an American problem. U.S. law enforcement officials have said fentanyl is mass-produced by Mexican drug cartels and then distributed by American criminal networks.

Hamburg lawmakers are asking whether a deadly attack on Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses could have been prevented, pointing to material in the public domain that hinted at religious extremism, plus an anonymous tip-off when he applied for a gun licence.
The Left Party called on the Hamburg Senate to clarify unanswered questions about the rampage, said Deniz Celik, interior policy spokesman for the Left Party in Hamburg&#x27;s State Parliament, in a statement on Sunday.

                              <span>DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Sunday, adding that he hoped the exchange would take place soon.
&quot;Regarding the issue of prisoner swaps between Iran and the U.S. we have reached an agreement in the recent days and if everything goes well on the U.S. side, I think we will witness a prisoner exchange in a short period,&quot; Amirabdollahian said.
&quot;On our part everything is ready, while the U.S. is currently working on the final technical coordination.&quot;
One of several Americans held in Iran is Siamak Namazi, a businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, who was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government.
Emad Sharghi, an Iranian-American businessman was first arrested in 2018 when he was working for a tech investment company, is also jailed in Iran, as is Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship.
Iranian sources told Reuters that two regional countries were involved in the series of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington for the release of prisoners.
For years, Tehran has sought the release of more than a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the glitz of Sunday&#x27;s Oscars, the first Irish language film to earn a nomination is sparking renewed interest in a native tongue spoken by so few it is considered endangered by the United Nations cultural agency.
Competing for best international feature, &quot;An Cailín Ciúin&quot; (The Quiet Girl) last year became the first Irish language film to gross more than 1 million euros ($1.06 million) at the UK and Irish box office. It has remained a fixture in cinemas across English-speaking Ireland.
Director Colm Bairéad says the success feels like it is boosting a language he grew up feeling self-conscious about because of its rarity. Raised in a bilingual household, the Dubliner&#x27;s father would make a point of shouting across the street in Iri…</span>

                              <span>TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court&#x27;s powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.
As the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.
&quot;It&#x27;s not a judicial reform. It&#x27;s a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids,&quot; said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.
The protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.
National police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv&#x27;s police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.
The now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and &quot;will not yield to any political pressure on the matter&quot;.
Netanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.
&quot;I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call &#x27;Crime Minister&#x27;,&quot; said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.

                              <span>LONDON (Reuters) - The return of the British Museum&#x27;s Parthenon Marbles to Greece is possible even if the two sides cannot come to an agreement over who owns the sculptures, a campaign group working to resolve the long-standing dispute said on Sunday.
Greece has asked for others to imitate the Vatican Museums after they agreed this month to return three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon. London and Athens are in talks over the Parthenon Sculptures held by the British Museum.
The Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis in Athens, was completed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the goddess Athena, and its decorative friezes contain some of the greatest examples of ancient Greek sculpture.
Greece has repeatedly called for the permanent return of the sculptures, which British diplomat L…</span>

Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to restore diplomatic relations and reopen embassies.

“You can have all the equipment you want, you can have all the ammunition you want, you can have all the tanks you want, but if you don’t have the fighting spirit to use them and go above and beyond, even at times when you know there is a very good chance you will die, then you are not going to do as well as the side who has that,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“On the one hand, we got Ukraine that does have that spirit, they are fighting for their lives, they are fighting for their men and women to their left and right.

“The Russians on the other hand, they don’t really know what they are fighting for in many cases, they are just sent there.”</span>

                              <span>Former British commander Richard Kemp claims peace between Russia and Ukraine will only come from a decision on the battlefield, with one side winning the war. 

Mr Kemp said he doesn’t see any chance of a negotiated peace because both sides are “so far apart”. 

“Putin can’t possibly, let’s say, return to the pre-February 2022 lines in which he started the invasion,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“He can’t do that - he has lost so much of Russia, so many people killed, so much economic damage, so much isolation in the world; he has hugely damaged Russia, he has got to have something to show for it. 

“And on the other hand, Ukraine, President Zelensky has made it very clear he is not going to submit to Russia and is not going to assign to them any land they have taken in this war.”</span>

                              <span>The United States has been “quite cautious” in the support they have given Ukraine, according to former British commander Richard Kemp.

He said the US has waited until almost the “last possible moment” to provide the key equipment Ukraine needs. 

“Obviously, President Biden is mindful of those people who don’t want to support Ukraine, or don’t feel it is the US’ job to be doing so,” Mr Kemp told Sky News Australia. 

“I think while the current administration continues in Washington, we will see a continued level of support.”</span>

                              <span>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has deplored new &quot;brutal terrorist attacks&quot; by Russia on cities and towns across his country.

Day and night there are these attacks, Zelensky said in his nightly video message broadcast in Kiev on Saturday. &quot;Rockets and artillery, drones and mortars: The vicious state uses a variety of weapons with the one goal of destroying life and leaving nothing human behind,&quot; Zelensky said.
&quot;Ruins, rubble, craters where missiles hit are the self-portrait of Russia that it paints where life exists without Russia,&quot; the Ukrainian head of state said. The country stands for evil, he said. &quot;It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment.&quot;
Zelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.</span>

                              <span>Another five people have been arrested in Mexico for the kidnapping of four Americans, two of whom were killed amid the violent abduction. 
The group of suspects were taken into custody Friday on charges including aggravated kidnapping and simple intention homicide, Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica wrote on Twitter shortly before 11:30 a.m. local time. 
A sixth person arrested earlier this week was also being held in connection with the daytime abduction of Latavia “Tay” McGee, Shaeed Woodard, Zindell Brown, and Eric James Williams.</span>

                              <span>Long considered side players, the key role of women in the Sicilian Mafia was highlighted by the arrest of Matteo Messina Denaro&#x27;s sister, accused of managing his affairs while the mobster was a fugitive.
Rosalia Messina Denaro was arrested earlier this month not far from Palermo, where her godfather brother was caught on January 16 after 30 years on the run.
She is accused of issuing orders, keeping the books and transmitting secret messages for her sibling while he was in hiding.
For many years, women linked to the Cosa Nostra Mafia seemed born to become widows, portrayed in films as black-veiled Madonnas, leading funeral processions in sorrowful dignity.
The reality is far more complex, with many wives, daughters and sisters playing active roles while their men are on the run, in prison…</span>

BEIJING (Reuters) -Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China&#x27;s premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity&#x27;s sclerotic stock market.
Li&#x27;s back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.
In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai&#x27;s new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China&#x27;s hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.

The eruption throughout the day blocked out the sun and blanketed several villages with falling ash. No casualties have been reported.</span>

Irregular Warfare Initiative Launches New Website
new website which will serve as the rally point for professional discourse between scholars, policymakers, and practitioners on contemporary irregular warfare challenges. The website offers you access to original articles, fascinating podcasts with insightful guests, virtual and in-person events, and other resources to help illuminate this complex form of conflict. All IWI content is generated by members from the IW community — like you. 

									Demand for IWI content has only increased over the past three years since our first podcast released. The new website is one part of a plan to grow IWI as a platform to meet this increased demand and to continue providing valuable resources to the IW professional community. We hope you enjoy the new website, and encourage you to continue helping us build this community. There are many ways to support: submitting an article, joining the team as a volunteer, planning an event in partnership with IWI, donating (even small contributions help!) or making a purchase from the IWI store, or simply continuing to follow IWI content and sharing it with other irregular warfare professionals in your network. 

									On behalf of the more than 50 volunteers who have worked incredibly hard to make this new website and the content it supports possible, we thank you for your continued support and engagement.

									- Doug Livermore &amp; Charles Faint

                              <span>The Intercept: U.S. Special Forces Want to Use Deepfakes for Psy-Ops  
The U.S. government spent years warning deepfakes could destabilize democratic societies. 
 U.S. Special Operations Command, responsible for some of the country’s most secretive military endeavors, is gearing up to conduct internet propaganda and deception campaigns online using deepfake videos, according to federal contracting documents reviewed by The Intercept. 
The plans, which also describe hacking internet-connected devices to eavesdrop in order to assess foreign populations’ susceptibility to propaganda, come at a time of intense global debate over technologically sophisticated “disinformation” campaigns, their effectiveness, and the ethics of their use.

                              <span>Reuters: FBI chief says TikTok &#x27;screams&#x27; of US national security concerns 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China&#x27;s government could use TikTok to control data on millions of American users, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday, saying the Chinese-owned video app &quot;screams&quot; of security concerns. 
Wray told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security that the Chinese government could also use TikTok to control software on millions of devices and drive narratives to divide Americans over Taiwan or other issues. 
&quot;Yes, and I would make the point on that last one, in particular, that we&#x27;re not sure that we would see many of the outward signs of it happening if it was happening,&quot; Wray said of concerns China could feed misinformation to users. 
 &quot;This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government - and it, to me, it screams out with national security concerns,&quot; Wray said.

Reuters: Saudis kept U.S. informed on talks with Iran - White House 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia kept Washington informed of its talks with Iran to restore diplomatic relations but the United States was not directly involved, White House spokesman John Kirby said on Friday. 
The road map announced on Friday appeared to be the result of several rounds of talks, including some held in Baghdad and Oman, Kirby said, adding that the United States has supported that process as promoting an end to the war in Yemen and to what he termed Iranian aggression: 
&quot;The Saudis did keep us informed about these talks that they were having, just as we keep them informed on our engagements, but we weren&#x27;t directly involved.&quot;

    EurAsian Times: Iran Unveils World’s First ‘Air Defense Boat’ Capable Of Firing Deadly Missiles From Its Vertical Launch System – Analyst 
Iran’s second navy, under the IRGC, has developed the world’s first very small air-defense boat amid rising concerns about Tehran’s burgeoning military power that is seen as a threat by countries in the Persian Gulf and Israel. 
The development of a small defense boat is unique in its own right. 
This is the first-of-its-kind vessel Iran has likely produced for domestic use by the Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, according to a report by Naval Analyst and OSINT expert HI Sutton. 
Subsequently, a video surfaced on social media in which a Nawab surface-to-air missile is released from the Vertical Launch System of the boat. According to military observers, this air defense boat was modified and converted from the British Bladerunner. This is due to the hull’s shape, which resembles the Bladerunner.

&#x27;The solution&#x27;s got to come from the host nation itself,&#x27; said Gen. Wayne Eyre  
Canada&#x27;s top general said he was concerned that his country&#x27;s armed forces, which are already stretched thin by support for Ukraine and NATO, do not have the capacity to lead a possible security mission to Haiti. 
Haiti&#x27;s government and top United Nations officials have called for an international force to support Haitian police in their struggle against gangs, which have become the de facto authorities in parts of the country.

DW: Most Germans want compulsory military service return — poll 
Compulsory military service was suspended in 2011. A recent survey suggests 61% of Germans want it reintroduced, with over a third saying it should apply to women as well as men. 
The majority of Germans want to restore compulsory military service, which was scrapped in 2011, a survey revealed on Thursday, as war on the European continent between Russia and Ukraine drags on for over a year. 
The survey was conducted by the Paris-based Ipsos MORI group  , a multinational market research and consulting company. It polled 1,000 eligible voters aged between 18 and 75 nationwide. 
The poll revealed that 61% of the respondents were in favor of reintroducing compulsory service. 
Furthermore, 43% believed that compulsory service should apply to all genders, while the remaining 18% said it should apply but only to men, as was the case under the now-defunct law.

Warzone/The Drive: USAF Testing ‘Mutant’ Missiles That Twist In Mid-Air To Hit Their Targets  
The Air Force sees missiles with articulating noses as one way to take on increasingly maneuverable threats.  
The U.S. Air Force is exploring a novel concept for increasing the likelihood of scoring a hit in air-to-air combat. The idea is to use an air-to-air missile with a nose that bends to get at the target before it can get away. The service views this as one path to giving current and future combat aircraft, including a sixth-generation stealth jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance program, a new way to engage increasingly maneuverable threats. 
The Air Force Research Laboratory highlighted what is formally known as the Missile Utility Transformation via Articulated Nose Technology (MUTANT) project at this week&#x27;s 2023 Air and Space Forces Association&#x27;s Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado. AFRL says that MUTANT leverages work that has been done over the past six years on related technologies, but notes the core concept takes advantage of related research and experimentation dating back all the way to the 1950s.

Reuters: U.S. sanctions China-based network accused of supplying Iran drone maker 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on a China-based network over accusations it has shipped aerospace parts to an Iranian company involved in the production of drones that Tehran has used to attack oil tankers and exported to Russia. 
The U.S. Treasury Department targeted five companies and one person in the network for selling and shipping thousands of aerospace components, including those that can be used for drones, to the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing In…</span>

                              <span>Mexican authorities have arrested five people over the deadly kidnapping of a group of Americans, after the suspects were left in the street with their hands tied by alleged cartel members, officials said Friday.
The four US citizens, two of whom died, were snatched at gunpoint after crossing the border into crime-plagued Tamaulipas state on Friday in a minivan, apparently so that one could have cosmetic surgery.
Tamaulipas prosecutor Irving Barrios said that a warrant had been executed for five people for the crimes of kidnapping and homicide.
They are the same five men who were found Thursday with their hands bound on a street in the city of Matamoros, apparently dumped by fellow members of the Gulf Cartel, a source in the prosecutor&#x27;s office told AFP.

&quot;The world has gone mad,&quot; says one mourner holding a bouquet of white roses and approaching the entrance of the brick building, cordoned off by police.
The body bags are carefully placed in hearses before being driven away and the man with the bouquet leaves with his flowers still in hand.
&quot;It really upsets me,&quot; says Tatjana Popczy, who lives just 200 metres (yards) from the centre where a former member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses burst into a service at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) on Thursday, killing six people.

                              <span>Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won&#x27;t be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia&#x27;s year-long military invasion.
As reported by CBS News&#x27; Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a &quot;bigger war&quot; in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was &quot;done&quot; with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while &quot;America First&quot; Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.</span>

                              <span>Moscow on Friday accused foreign countries of fomenting days of mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia&#x27;s borders.
Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial &quot;foreign agent&quot; legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
