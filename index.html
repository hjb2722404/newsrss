                              <span>Republican Senator Tim Scott has stated United States President Joe Biden has “blood on his hands” after Hamas’ attack on Israel, says Curtin University Dean of Global Future Joe Siracusa. 

Mr Siracusa says the conflict between Palestine and Israel began “in earnest” after Biden’s administration “turned over $6 billion for the hostages to Iran”.

“Of course, Iran is behind this,” Mr Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

“When the history books are written, those will be the opening.”

Officials say 4,741 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the conflict as Israel’s military claims the number of people held hostage has risen to 212.</span>

The Agriculture Minister says since the beginning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Labor government have “condemned Hamas’ attack on innocent Israeli lives”.

“We’ve said consistently that Israel has a right to defend itself,” Mr Watt told Sky News Australia. 

“But that doesn’t get away from the fact that every life in this conflict is worth something.

                              <span>Nine Republican candidates have officially entered the race to become the next House speaker after the withdrawal of Jim Jordan. 

Several have signed a loyalty pledge to support the winner of the first vote, aiming to avoid the vote-counting confusion that followed Mr Jordan’s candidacy. 

This comes after earlier this month, former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted. 

“If we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern, and every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” Republican Representative Michael McCaul said. 

A secret vote with the GOP conference is scheduled for Tuesday as Republicans are encouraged to sign a unity pledge, promising to support whoever wins the vote.</span>

                              <span>Tyrrell&#x27;s Wines Managing Director Bruce Tyrrell says the industry is going through a “pretty tough time at the moment” as Chinese sanctions on Australian wine are set to be removed.

The decision to remove the sanctions clears the way for the Prime Minister to visit Beijing next month.

Mr Tyrrell said Chinese wine consumption has dropped by about 60 per cent because “they can’t get the wine that they really like to drink”.

“As more and more Chinese people have travelled over the last 10 years, they’ve got to know Australia, they like Australia, they like Australians and got a great taste for Australian wine, so we really need to be back in that market,” he told Sky News Australia.

Mr Tyrrell hopes China’s economy will grow and Australian wine sales will grow with it.</span>

                              <span>Two journalists in Iran have been sentenced to up to seven years in prison for collaborating with the US government and other charges. Niloufar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi were imprisoned for over a year following their coverage of Mahsa Amini&#x27;s death in police custody. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has condemned the decision and called for their release. The journalists were charged with collaborating with the US government, colluding against national security, and propaganda against the system. Their detentions have sparked international criticism over the security force crackdown after Amini&#x27;s death.</span>

                              <span>A second aid convoy entered the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing on Sunday, heading towards Gaza. Shortly after the convoy entered, a blast was heard and seven people were wounded. The Israeli military said one of its tanks accidentally fired and hit an Egyptian position near the border. The Egyptian military said the blast caused minor injuries and that an investigation is underway. The convoy carried medical and food supplies, and distribution of the supplies began on Sunday. However, aid officials are warning of a humanitarian disaster as supplies run low.</span>

                              <span>Advocacy groups have reported a significant increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents in the US and Europe since the recent Hamas attacks in Israel. The Anti-Defamation League recorded a 55% rise in antisemitic incidents in the US compared to the same period last year. There have also been spikes in anti-Israel rallies and antisemitic harassment on messaging apps. Similarly, the Council on American-Islamic Relations reported an increase in anti-Muslim incidents in the past week. In the UK, anti-Muslim attacks have increased sixfold, while France and Germany have also seen a rise in antisemitic incidents.</span>

Qatar played a significant role in delicate talks involving multiple countries to secure the release of the captives. When Hamas released two captives, the Raanan family, US officials thanked Qatar for their involvement. Families of the remaining hostages hope this is just the beginning. The hostages have likely been split into small groups, and it is unclear why the Raanans were released first, although their American nationality may have played a role.</span>

                              <span>Scientists at the University of Bristol have used supercomputer climate models to predict the formation of a future supercontinent called Pangea Ultima, which is expected to occur 250 million years from now. This continent will bring extreme temperatures, rendering it uninhabitable for mammals. The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth&#x27;s climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.</span>

These rare diamonds, formed within the supercontinent Gondwana, provide information about the formation and movement of supercontinents. The research reveals that supercontinents played a role in concentrating deep oceanic plate subduction. The diamonds formed deep beneath Gondwana and were carried to the surface during volcanic eruptions.</span>

                              <span>Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has returned to Pakistan after a four-year self-imposed exile in London. He arrived in Lahore to a huge rally of supporters and vowed to work for the well-being of the public. Sharif&#x27;s return is seen as part of a deal with the military establishment, despite being disqualified from electoral politics. His biggest challenge will be to win back support from his arch-rival, Imran Khan, who remains popular despite being in jail.</span>

The country&#x27;s close ties with Hamas, including financial backing, and its respected status with the US contribute to its effectiveness in hostage negotiations.</span>

Argentines flocked to the polls on Sunday to vote in a tense national election where wild-haired outsider Milei has hogged the limelight amid the country&#x27;s worst economic crisis in two decades and rising anger with the traditional elite.</span>

                              <span>A secret recording revealed by &quot;60 Minutes Australia&quot; exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. 
Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a &quot;favor&quot; for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do,&quot; admitting not only to the bribery but also that it&#x27;s frequent behavior for him. 

&quot;It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings,&quot; The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

                              <span>New court documents reviewed by the New York Times reveal Donald Trump&#x27;s Australian pal, Anthony Pratt, told a lot of people about life at Mar-a-Lago post-presidency. Among the things he said, involved trashing Trump behind his back. 
Pratt, the Australian billionaire that Trump revealed classified information to, told around 45 people about the classified info as well as a number of things about his presidential pal.  
Not only did Trump tell his wife, Melania, to strut around the property in a bikini, but Pratt paid Trump tens of thousands of overages for ticket prices for events at the country club.

                              <span>While appearing on ABC&#x27;s This Week, host Jonathan Karl pressed Scott on his claim that U.S. &quot;weakness&quot; led to the terrorist attacks.

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?be allowed to run for office?


	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	&quot;And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that&#x27;s beyond the pale, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; the ABC host asked.


	&quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost,&quot; Scott opined.

                              <span>Gallup: Media Confidence in U.S. Matches 2016 Record Low 

* 32% have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in media’s news reporting 


* New high of 39% have no confidence at all, compared with 27% in 2016 


* Democrats’ trust is down 12 points since last year; lowest since 2016 


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The 32% of Americans who say they trust the mass media “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to report the news in a full, fair and accurate way ties Gallup’s lowest historical reading, previously recorded in 2016. Although trust in media currently matches the historical low, it was statistically similar in 2021 (36%) and 2022 (34%). 


Another 29% of U.S. adults have “not very much” trust, while a record-high 39% register “none at all.” This nearly four in 10 Americans who completely lack confidence in the media is the highest on record by one percentage point. It is 12 points higher than the 2016 reading, which came amid sharp criticism of the media from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump -- making the current assessment of the media the grimmest in Gallup’s history. In 2016, U.S. adults were most likely to say they had “not very much” trust (41%).

                              <span>VOA: Cairo Summit Fails to Find Consensus on Israeli-Palestinian Conflict  
* No consensus at the Cairo Summit on the Israel-Palestinian violence. 
* The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened Saturday, allowing the transportation of humanitarian aid. 
* Clashes between Israel and Hamas continue, with Israeli airstrikes killing 19 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian media. 
* Israel issued a warning advising its citizens against traveling to Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, and if they are in those countries to leave as soon as possible. 
A Cairo summit hosted by Egypt Saturday failed to reach an agreement on how to contain the violence between Israel and Hamas. 
Arab leaders condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza while mostly Western countries said civilians should be shielded, but with Israel and senior U.S. officials absent there was no consensus on how to resolve the conflict.

The IDF again instructed the roughly 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza to evacuate, threatening that “no matter where you are,” there will be “significant combat.” 
The Israeli military on Saturday stepped up warnings to Gazan residents and continued preparations for an offensive in the war-torn territory, including for ground operations, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. 
The IDF again instructed the roughly 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza to evacuate, threatening that “no matter where you are,” there will be “significant combat.” 
Residents in Gaza reported that Israeli planes rained red leaflets on neighborhoods Saturday, urging residents to evacuate. Those with cell phones also received the message digitally, according to social media reports.

The Guardian: Chinese ship is focus of investigation into damaged pipeline, Finland says

 
Police focusing on Newnew Polar Bear cargo ship that was in the area when gas pipeline was damaged 
Finnish police have said a Chinese ship whose movement coincided with the time and place of the suspected sabotage of a pipeline between Finland and Estonia that was damaged this month is now the focus of their investigation. 
After a leak led to the shutdown of the Balticconnector pipeline on 8 October, Finnish authorities have been investigating the damage they say was caused by “external” activity. 
On Friday, they said their focus was on the Newnew Polar Bear, a cargo ship that reportedly came under Chinese ownership this year. Between 2017 and 2022 it was known as the Baltic Fulmar, the Finnish broadcaster YLE reported.

The president’s second ever Oval Office address was sober and occasionally dark.It challenged America to stick with some major fights. 
President Joe Biden used a rare Oval Office address Thursday night to forcefully advocate for aiding both Israel and Ukraine. 
And he laid out a dark vision of what would happen should that aid, along with America’s larger commitment to defending democracy, not be delivered.

                              <span>BBC: Argentina election: Javier Milei, TikTok economist, leads polls 
Argentina votes on Sunday in one of the most open presidential elections for decades. 
The effects of a deep economic crisis have proved fertile ground for an unorthodox far-right front-runner, with wild hair, big sideburns and a totally radical approach to ruling the country. 
Javier Milei was, until recently, a relative unknown. An economist, pundit and rock fan, he came top in recent primaries and polls now put him ahead in Sunday&#x27;s first round.
He is very clear about wanting to shake things up. At one campaign event, he wielded a chainsaw to send a message that he intends to slash spending to improve Argentina&#x27;s economy.

China has developed an arsenal of more than 500 operational nuclear warheads and is set to double that number by the end of the decade, exceeding previous Pentagon estimates, according to a Defense Department report. 
The figures, released in an unclassified public report to Congress on Thursday, are part of a broad assessment of China’s military goals and developments in the past year, and highlight the rapid advances in Beijing’s multi-decade plan to build a nuclear weapons arsenal that rivals that of the United States.

Mr Husic’s comments come after the Prime Minister announced a trip to Washington.

The Industry Minister said there is a commitment by the United Kingdom, United States and Australian governments to proceed.

“Clearly, there will be discussion on how to progress that along with other matters that are relevant to the relations,” Mr Husic told Sky News Australia.

“Not the least of which being the energy transition and how we can work together on that.”</span>

China can still be a relatively socially conservative country, and under President Xi Jinping the space for the expression of feminism has shrunk even further over the last decade.
But in science fiction, the number of women authors has rocketed in recent years, said Regina Kanyu Wang, a writer and editor nominated for two prestigious Hugo Awards at Worldcon this year.

Founded by four friends in a pub in 2018, the collective&#x27;s campaigns and stunts skewering politicians and spotlighting issues get millions of views online -- and often generate mainstream media coverage.
They remain best known for their light-hearted early efforts, like plastering ex-prime minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s optimistic tweets about the joys of life after Brexit to contrast them with the reality.
More recent ploys, involving stings by fake companies and covert filming, have had a more serious undertone.

                              <span>One of China&#x27;s biggest beer makers said it had opened an investigation after a video appearing to show a factory employee urinating on raw ingredients went viral this week.
The clip, published online on Thursday, purportedly shows a male worker at a Tsingtao Brewery Co. warehouse clambering into a high-walled container and relieving himself onto its contents.
The footage circulated widely on Chinese social media, racking up tens of millions of views on the popular platform Weibo.
Tsingtao said on Friday that it had contacted the police over the incident and an investigation was ongoing.
&quot;Our company attaches high importance to the relevant video that emerged from Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 on October 19,&quot; the beermaker said in a statement.
&quot;We reported the incident to the police at the earliest opportunity, and public security organs are involved in the investigation,&quot; it added.
&quot;At present, the batch of malt in question has been completely sealed. The company continues to strengthen its management procedures and ensure product quality.&quot;
Many social media users reacted to the video with anger and voiced support for one of China&#x27;s best-known beverage brands.
&quot;I suggest the company takes this man to court and gets him to pay compensation for the damages,&quot; read one popular Weibo response to the company&#x27;s statement.
&quot;Investigate this thoroughly! Always stand up for our national champion brands!&quot; wrote another user.

                              <span>Deadly Storm Babet unleashed extensive flooding and damaged towns in Denmark and Norway late Friday and early Saturday, while continuing to sweep across the UK.  Three people died in Scotland and England and families were trapped in flooded homes on Friday as the storm battered Britain and Ireland.  After it made landfall in Scandinavia, the storm triggered a sharp rise in water levels in towns in southern Denmark, flooding the first floor of homes which were left without power for several hours.</span>

Saudi Arabia, which has not followed its Gulf neighbors in establishing relations with Israel, has stated that Palestinian statehood goals should be addressed first. Biden had plans to sit down with the Saudis, making the potential normalization of relations a top priority for Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his trip to Riyadh.</span>

Hamas had previously stated that they took around 200 hostages during their rampage on Israeli towns, and they have released some of them.

The double defeat showed a big slump in support for the governing Conservatives, who have won the last four national votes, and suggests Labour is on course to win power for the first time since 2010 at an election expected next year. While so-called by-elections are often lost by the governing party, the scale of the defeat in two parliamentary seats the Conservatives have held for years piles pressure on Sunak.</span>

The violence poses a challenge to both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with growing support for armed resistance.

                              <span>Israel launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, targeting areas where Palestinians had sought safety, and started evacuating an Israeli town near Lebanon&#x27;s border, indicating a possible ground invasion. Israel&#x27;s defense minister stated that they do not plan to control civilians in Gaza after their war with Hamas and expect a three-phase war. The Israeli military struck more than 100 targets tied to Hamas. Palestinian militants have launched over 6,900 rockets into Israel, causing tensions in the West Bank. Over one million people have been displaced in Gaza, with overwhelmed hospitals rationing medical supplies and fuel. Aid delivery from Egypt remains uncertain.</span>

                              <span>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced her separation from her partner, TV journalist Andrea Giambruno, who has faced backlash for making sexist comments. Meloni stated that she should not be judged for his remarks and will no longer address questions about his behavior. The split comes as Meloni marks her first year in office, leading a right-wing coalition government that prioritizes traditional family values. The couple, who have a 7-year-old daughter, had been together for nearly 10 years. Giambruno&#x27;s controversial comments and actions have been a subject of public scrutiny.</span>

Jordan&#x27;s loss reveals that he had actually lost ground, with 25 Republicans opposing him compared to 22 in his previous attempt.

                              <span>Egypt is hosting a summit on the Gaza crisis, but the absence of key leaders, including the US, has lowered expectations for its outcome. The summit aims to bring together Arab and European heads of state to discuss the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the future of the Palestinian issue. However, there is uncertainty about who will attend, with no confirmation from the US, China, or Russia. Arab countries have expressed anger at Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza.</span>

                              <span>Over 4,200 people have been displaced from villages in south Lebanon due to clashes on the border with Israel. Local officials are concerned about the lack of resources and preparation for a larger exodus if the conflict escalates. Many of the displaced individuals are staying in schools in the city of Tyre, but resources are limited. The Lebanese government has appealed to international organizations for assistance. The ongoing clashes have killed at least 22 people in Lebanon.</span>

                              <span>On Friday, former Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) posted to social media that members of his family had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.
&quot;I was really worried about this,&quot; wrote Amash, the first Palestinian-American to represent Michigan in Congress. &quot;With great sadness, I have now confirmed that several of my relatives (including Viola and Yara pictured here) were killed at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church in Gaza, where they had been sheltering, when part of the complex was destroyed as the result of an Israeli airstrike.&quot;
&quot;Give rest, O Lord, to their souls, and may their memories be eternal,&quot; Amash wrote in mourning.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
&quot;The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much,&quot; Amash continued. &quot;Our family is hurting badly. May God watch over all Christians in Gaza — and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed.&quot;
Tensions have flared in the region after a devastating terrorist attack by Hamas that left hundreds dead and hundreds more as hostages in Gaza.
Israel has responded with a series of airstrikes, as well as a blockade on Gaza that has limited humanitarian aid and electricity, although they rolled back an order limiting the provision of water into the territory.</span>

Paramount pulled the plug on the event, — set to take place Nov. 5 at Paris Nord Villepinte — citing “the volatility of world events” on Thursday. France has been on high alert following the fatal stabbing of a high school teacher by a suspected extremist, and several bomb threats across the country’s airports.

The announcement came after Andrea Giambruno, a television presenter, was caught making overtly sexual and sexist comments to female colleagues off-air.
&quot;My relationship with Andrea Giambruno, which lasted almost 10 years, ends here,&quot; Meloni wrote on social media, saying their paths had &quot;diverged for some time&quot;.
&quot;How do you do, darling?&quot; Giambruno is heard telling a female colleague on the sidelines of his talk show on the Rete 4 channel, owned by Mediaset.

                              <span>NAIROBI, Oct 20 (IPS)  - The tips of our fingers have densely packed nerve endings. That is why a miniscule paper cut activates our pain receptors and causes stubborn pain for a day or two. Now consider that a clitoris has over 10,000 nerve endings. It is the human female’s most sensitive erogenous zone, explaining the sexual pleasure it elicits at the slightest touch. A paper cut on your clitoris would be agonizing yet does not compare to the pain of female genital mutilation – or FGM.

Astronomers Spot Most Distant Fast Radio Burst Ever Detected
Astronomers have observed an extraordinarily distant and powerful fast radio burst (FRB) that released a massive burst of energy in a fraction of a second. FRBs are intense, millisecond-long radio wave flashes with unknown cosmic origins. Since the first detection in 2007, hundreds have been spotted flickering from distant points in space.

Geneva – Israel is conducting the largest campaign of destruction of buildings and residential houses in the Gaza Strip in modern history, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor stated, as part of a wide-scale military attack ongoing since the seventh of this month. 
Euro-Med Monitor emphasised that Israel is focusing its attacks on the Gaza and North Gaza governorates through a systematic destruction campaign, aiming to force displacement and population transfer against the residents of these governorates. 
The Israeli army has warned the residents of both governorates, which are home to nearly a million people, to evacuate the areas and move to the central and southern sections of the Strip, a measure that raises serious legal and humanitarian concerns as it endangers the safety of civilians.

Update #2: UN says 4,200 people killed in Israel, Gaza conflict in 10 days (Anadolu Agency)

 
WNU Editor: The numbers are horrifying. As of yesterday (link here), just in Gaza alone 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since Oct.7. Of this 3,785 total, 1,524 were children and 1,000 were women. 

 
Update #3: These shortages have the potential to be just as destructive as bombs if not alleviated soon .... Gaza conditions worsen amid warnings that shortages could ‘kill many, many people’ (CNN).</span>

Daily Mail: Ready for war: Satellite images show hundreds of Israeli tanks gathered in fields four miles north of Gaza as IDF prepares to send tens of thousands of soldiers in to war-torn strip to destroy Hamas 
* Satellite images have shown how Israeli forces are gearing up on the northern border of Gaza, as they prepare for ground invasion 
* Pictures have shown hundreds of armored vehicles including tanks, personnel carriers and bulldozers 
* The Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has told soldiers at the border to &#x27;get organized, be ready&#x27; for their move into Palestinian territory 
Satellite imagery has revealed where Israel has deployed hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles, as it prepares to invade Gaza. 
The military buildup seen in satellite images is some four miles north of the Erez Crossing, a primary entry point on Gaza&#x27;s northern border. 
Tanks and other armored vehicles are seen in the pictures, which were taken at the end of last week by Planet Labs.

                              <span>The Hill: Americans urged to leave Lebanon ‘as soon as possible’ 
The State Department on Thursday urged Americans to make plans to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible,” elevating an earlier security warning that advised Americans not to travel to the country. 
“The U.S. Embassy is closely monitoring the security situation in Lebanon,” the Thursday advisory read. 
“The Department of State urges U.S. citizens in Lebanon to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available.”

Update #2: US embassy urges its citizens in Lebanon to leave &#x27;ASAP&#x27; (Jerusalem Post)

 
WNU Editor: The US is not the only one telling its citizens to leave .... US, UK, Germany tell citizens to leave Lebanon as regional tensions rise (Al Jazeera). More here .... Canada now advising against all travel to Lebanon amid Israel-Hamas conflict (Global Times), here .... Oman urges its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately (Al Arabiya), and here .... Saudi Urges Citizens To Depart Lebanon &#x27;Immediately&#x27; (AFP).
This push to get foreigners out of Lebanon tells me the following. Israel is going to launch an offensive on northern Gaza in the coming days/weeks. This offensive will probably result in a reaction from Hezbollah, and the real possibility of a second front in this war along the Lebanese border.</span>

The test came hours after Russian lawmakers said they plan to revoke the ratification of a global nuclear test ban treaty 
The U.S. conducted a high-explosive experiment at a nuclear test site in Nevada hours after Russia revoked a ban on atomic-weapons testing, which Moscow said would put it on par with the United States. 
Wednesday&#x27;s test used chemicals and radioisotopes to &quot;validate new predictive explosion models&quot; that can help detect atomic blasts in other countries, Bloomberg reported, citing the Department of Energy.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
