While the protests have waned in recent weeks, Iranians – especially women – have told the FRANCE 24 Observers team that the movement has caused irreversible changes in Iranian society. Our Observers say these changes are not due to any reduced pressure from the regime, but rather a newfound courage in Iranian women and support from society.</span>

France 24: Taiwan vows to deepen ties with US amid tensions with China 
Taiwan will boost military exchanges with the United States to curb &quot;authoritarian expansionism&quot;, President Tsai Ing-wen said Tuesday after meeting with visiting US lawmakers. 
The five-day US Congressional visit comes after a top US defense official reportedly made a rare and highly secretive stopover to the self-ruled island as Washington-Beijing tensions flared over alleged Chinese spy balloons. 
&quot;Taiwan and the United States continue to bolster military exchanges,&quot; Tsai said after convening with the US delegation at her office in Taipei.  &quot;Going forward, Taiwan will cooperate even more actively with the United States and other democratic partners to confront such global challenges as authoritarian expansionism and climate change.&quot; 
Tsai did not provide further details on what the future exchanges might entail.

* The U.S. administration on Saturday formally concluded that Moscow had committed “crimes against humanity” during its year-long invasion of its neighbor.

Russia is attempting to use its nuclear threat to weaken international support for Ukraine, according to Kyiv intelligence. 
The official Ukrainian Ministry of Defence reported via Telegram that Russia has started large-scale exercises involving its strategic nuclear forces, stationed for launch by air, land and sea, and put its units on the highest alert. 
The post, shared on Sunday, warned that Russia was planning to use &#x27;blunt nuclear blackmail&#x27; to weaken foreign support and to stop Joe Biden&#x27;s visit to Europe this week.

                              <span>Joshua Keating, Grid: The unexpected ‘winners’ of the war in Ukraine: The people, companies and countries that have benefited from the turmoil 
The chaos of war has created political and economic windfalls for some. 
The losses from a year of war in Ukraine have been almost incalculable. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers have been killed, millions have been displaced, large portions of the country are under a brutal Russian occupation and the country’s infrastructure has been shattered. The war has contributed to a global food and energy crisis that has plunged many of the world’s most vulnerable people into a state of desperation. Hundreds of thousands of young Russian men have been sent off to fight in what some feel is a pointless and self-defeating war — and whatever they may feel, it’s a war from which many won’t return. The Kremlin’s rule has become far more brutal and autocratic, and hopes of peaceful coexistence between Russia and the West have been dashed for the foreseeable future.

As the war in Ukraine nears the one-year mark, the mayor of Kyiv is highlighting what’s at stake, hoping to remind people the threat of nuclear war looms, and his country is fighting to defend not just itself, but every country that shares its democratic values. 
Vitali Klitschko — in an exclusive Canadian interview airing Sunday with CTV’s Question Period host Vassy Kapelos — stressed that it is important for people to remember the war in Ukraine impacts everyone, not just Ukrainians, adding that it would be a “huge mistake” for people outside of Ukraine to think the war doesn’t affect them. 
“Please don&#x27;t forget, we&#x27;re talking about nuclear weapons,” he said. “An explosion could touch everyone on our planet, and that is why we have to do everything we can to stop this war.”

A CNN insider made the comments to Radar Online after the anchor was lambasted over his “sexist” remarks about the Republican presidential candidate.

&quot;He has a colossal ego and he&#x27;s the kind of person who goes around saying he&#x27;s not going to take the fall for his show flopping, it&#x27;s not his fault and the network&#x27;s tanking, and they shouldn&#x27;t have pushed him out of his primetime slot,” the source said.

Moon of Alabama: Recognizing The War Is Lost The &#x27;West&#x27; Seeks An Exit 
U.S. President Joe Biden is in Kiev today to rescue his lunatic project of destroying Russia by proxy war. But there is no good way to do that. 
A review of &#x27;western&#x27; media shows that the inevitable outcome of the war is now recognized. The only still open alternatives are to risk a large nuclear war or to retreat from &#x27;western&#x27; dreams of its permanent hegemony. 
Few &#x27;western&#x27; officials will admit that the war is lost, that  Russia has won in Ukraine. But it has. It had won the war when it successfully trapped the Ukrainian army into a war of attrition.

 WNU Editor: There has been nothing but praise in the Western media on President Biden&#x27;s trip to Kyiv, and deservedly so .... Joe Biden Made a Surprise Visit to Ukraine as Air Raid Sirens Blared (DNYUZ/Vice). More here .... Zelensky on Biden visit to Ukraine: ‘Historic. Timely. Brave.’ (The Hill), and here .... Biden on surprise visit to Ukraine: &quot;One year later, Kyiv stands&quot; (Axios). 
But what is not mentioned in the press is that every Western leader has had to contact the Kremlin that their leader was going to Ukraine at a certain date to make sure that no Russian missiles or air attacks would happen when they are there. President Biden included (link here).
So the big question is .... why is the Kremlin permitting Biden, Macron, Scholz, Johnson, Sunak, Trudeau, and other Western leaders to go to Kyiv. If you watch/listen/read Russian news, you would notice immediately that these visits are always being used to reinforce the Kremlin&#x27;s narrative that this is a war between NATO and Russia. These visits are also being used by the Kremlin to send a message to the non-Western world that the West is a bloc that may threaten you in the future. 
So why did President Biden go?


Some are saying it would have been an embarrassment if he did not go, especially since he is next door in Poland.  But I think the big reason is that many in the Pentagon and in the West are worried on the state of the war, and Biden had to not only go to Ukraine to reinforce US support of the war, but to tell Zelensky personally that the situation must change on the ground or he will lose this conflict.</span>

 France 24: French army officially ends operations in Burkina Faso 
Burkina Faso announced on Sunday that operations by the French army in the jihadist-hit West African state were officially over, after bilateral relations soured in recent months. 
Senior officers from Burkinabe and French forces in the country held a flag-lowering ceremony to mark the occasion at a camp on the outskirts of the capital Ouagadougou on Saturday, Burkina’s army said in a statement. 
Last month France confirmed it would withdraw its contingent of hundreds of troops stationed in Burkina Faso, after the junta ruling the Sahel country demanded the force pull out within four weeks.

Reuters: Blinken, in Turkey, urges speedy Nordics accession to NATO 
ANKARA (Reuters) -Washington strongly supports Sweden and Finland&#x27;s quick NATO accession given steps they have already taken, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, even as his Turkish counterpart stressed the need for more concrete action. 
Sweden and Finland applied last year to join the trans-Atlantic defence pact after Russia invaded Ukraine, but faced unexpected objections from Turkey. 
Ankara says Stockholm has harboured what Ankara calls members of terrorist groups. Turkey recently indicated it would approve only Finland for NATO membership.

Kyiv&#x27;s security chief vowed that Ukraine&#x27;s &#x27;tanks will be parked on Moscow&#x27;s Red Square and that will be justice&#x27; ahead of the first anniversary of Putin&#x27;s invasion. 
Oleksiy Danilov, Kyiv&#x27;s National Security and Defence Council boss, called Vladimir Putin &#x27;Hitler&#x27;s twin&#x27; as he reiterated Ukraine&#x27;s ambition to expel all Russian troops from its soil, including from Crimea which was annexed by Moscow in 2014. 
The security boss previously warned the bloodiest battles are &#x27;yet to come&#x27; within the next few months, in what will be a &#x27;defining&#x27; moment of the war, amid warnings that the Russian president will soon launch a new offensive in the east of Ukraine to take control of - at the very least - Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

IDEX 2023 — As the war in Ukraine nears its first anniversary, Russian defense firms plan to showcase their wares at the IDEX 2023 expo in the United Arab Emirates, hoping to lure Gulf nations as customers, or establish joint production of high-tech platforms, including fighter jets. 
“Today we are actively working on proposals for the most relevant forms of partnership with the Middle East states, primarily related to technology transfer, joint development and offset programs,” Rosoboronexport CEO Alexander Mikheyev in a press release reported by the Russian TASS news service on Feb. 16. “Rosoboronexport is considering various options for the joint creation of modern high-tech products, including a fifth-generation fighter based on the Checkmate light tactical aircraft, further work on the development and production of air defense systems, equipment for the Navy, and weapons for the ground forces.”

The Hill: White House gave Russia heads-up about Biden’s Ukraine visit for ‘deconfliction purposes’ 
The White House provided Russian officials with advance warning that President Biden would be traveling to Ukraine to mark the approaching anniversary of Russia’s invasion to avoid escalating tensions, administration officials said Monday. 
 “We did notify the Russians that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv. We did so some hours before his departure for deconfliction purposes,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. 
 Sullivan did not detail how Moscow responded to the news, and officials were careful in sharing other details about the planning around Biden’s trip for security reasons.

   Ukrayinska Pravda: Estonian Prime Minister: Putin must answer for crime of aggression, otherwise history will repeat itself 
Kaja Kallas, Estonian Prime Minister, has called for criminal consequences for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. 
&quot;Putin must be held accountable for the crime of aggression, otherwise history will repeat itself,&quot; Kallas said.  Kallas noted that the International Criminal Court in the Hague can judge Putin for war crimes, but not for aggression against Ukraine. 
This requires a separate court.  The actions of the International Criminal Court against Putin are currently impossible, in particular, because neither Russia nor Ukraine are contracting parties to the Rome Statute, which is the legal basis of this court.

Air raid sirens rang out in Kiev during US President Joe Biden’s unannounced visit on Monday, but there were no reports of Russian strikes, Reuters said. 
According to AFP, the alarm was heard when Biden and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, flanked by armed security, were exiting St Michael’s Cathedral where the leaders had a meeting. The siren did not cause any panic, the news agency said.

Reuters: China&#x27;s top diplomat due in Moscow as Beijing scolds United States 
MOSCOW/BEIJING (Reuters) -China told the United States on Monday to keep out of its relationship with Russia, just as Beijing&#x27;s top diplomat prepared for a visit to Moscow, and possibly a meeting with Vladimir Putin, to discuss ideas for peace in Ukraine. 
China is preparing to outline its position on a possible &quot;political settlement&quot; to the Ukraine war just as Washington and Beijing spar over the shooting down of balloons over the United States and U.S. claims China could supply weapons to Moscow. 
Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the deadliest European conflicts since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the planned visit by China&#x27;s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to Moscow but gave no date for the trip.

North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, officials said – the latest missile launch in recent days by the country. 
Japan’s Defense Ministry said officials were still analyzing the data but estimated both missiles were fired at around 7:00 a.m. local time on Monday and fell into the Sea of Japan “to the east of the Korean Peninsula, outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone,” its statement said. 
North Korea acknowledged the incident, calling it a “super-large multiple rocket launcher exercise, which is a means of tactical nuclear attack.” The country said the exercise was a response to the combined air force forces of the United States and South Korea.

Foreign affairs chief tells Munich security conference provision of ammunition has to be solved quickly 
The war with Ukraine will be over unless the EU finds a way in weeks to speed up the provision of ammunition to Ukraine, Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, warned on the final day of the Munich security conference. 
He said a special meeting of EU defence ministers slated for 8-9 March will provide a chance for countries to offer ammunition from their existing stocks, adding it is taking up to 10 months for European armies to order and receive a single bullet. 
“We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly; it is a matter of weeks.” He said if it was not the war would be over.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Iran Nuclear Inspectors Find Uranium Enriched to 84% Purity 
(Bloomberg) -- International atomic monitors in Iran last week detected uranium enriched to levels just below that needed for a nuclear weapon, according to two senior diplomats, underscoring the risk that the country’s unrestrained atomic activities could prompt a new crisis. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to clarify how Iran accumulated uranium enriched to 84% purity — the highest level found by inspectors in the country to date, and a concentration just 6% below what’s needed for a weapon. Iran had previously told the IAEA that its centrifuges were configured to enrich uranium to a 60% level of purity. 
Inspectors need to determine whether Iran intentionally produced the material, or whether the concentration was an unintended accumulation within the network of pipes connecting the hundreds of fast-spinning centrifuges used to separate the isotopes. It’s the second time this month that monitors have detected suspicious enrichment-related activities.

The move paves the way for the German government to complete its first national security strategy as early as next week. 
MUNICH — Germany has decided to drop plans to create a U.S.-style National Security Council after the idea ran into a buzzsaw of partisan squabbling within the country’s three-party coalition government. 
The move has cleared the way for the government to finally complete its first official national security strategy as early as next week, two officials told POLITICO. 
The spat is part of a long-running fight within Germany’s government over who sets the tone on foreign policy — the Social Democrats running German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s office, or the Greens running the foreign ministry.

“I think there is a portion of that rationale that’s about distracting the United States from honing its focus even more on the Asia-Pacific,” Mr Corben told Sky News Australia.

“Which is something Biden administration officials have stressed throughout this war – that the Asia-Pacific remains a high priority.

                              <span>Reuters: U.S. stages joint air exercises with Asian allies after North Korea&#x27;s ICBM launch 
SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States held joint air exercises bilaterally with South Korea and Japan involving strategic bombers on Sunday, a day after North Korea fired a Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in a &quot;sudden launching drill&quot;.
South Korea&#x27;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the exercise, in which South Korea&#x27;s F-35A, F-15K and U.S. F-16 fighters escorted American B-1B bombers, demonstrated the allies&#x27; &quot;overwhelming&quot; defence capabilities and readiness posture. 
&quot;(The exercise) strengthened the combined operation capability and affirmed the United States&#x27; ironclad commitment to the defence of the Korean Peninsula and the implementation of extended deterrence,&quot; the South&#x27;s military said in a statement.

Face The Nation: China considering providing &quot;lethal support&quot; to aid Russian invasion of Ukraine, Blinken says 
Washington — As the attempted Russian takeover of Ukraine nears its one-year mark, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS News on Saturday that China is actively considering providing lethal support, including weapons and ammunition to aid Moscow in its war against Ukraine. 
&quot;We&#x27;ve been concerned from day one about that possibility,&quot; Blinken said in an interview with &quot;Face the Nation&quot; moderator Margaret Brennan on Saturday. 
Pressed on the type of lethal aid China is considering, Blinken spoke in general terms.  &quot;There&#x27;s a whole gamut of things that — that fit in that category, everything from ammunition to the weapons themselves.&quot;

                              <span>BBC: Ukraine war: Russia must be defeated but not crushed, Macron says 
French President Emmanuel Macron has said he does not want to see Russia crushed by a defeat in Ukraine. 
Speaking to French media, Mr Macron urged Western nations to increase military support for Kyiv and said he was prepared for a protracted war. 
&quot;I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,&quot; he said. 
But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to &quot;crush&quot; the nation. 
The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow. 
&quot;I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,&quot; Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche. 
&quot;Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.&quot;

(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said China has been attempting to interfere in Canada’s democracy for years, but Canadians can have “total confidence” in the integrity of its election results. 
Trudeau was responding to a Globe and Mail report that said Canada’s intelligence agency has evidence China employed “a sophisticated strategy” to try to disrupt the country’s federal election in 2021. 
The newspaper reported that Chinese diplomats worked through proxies to persuade Chinese-Canadians to vote against certain Conservative Party candidates. Chinese officials expressed a preference to see Trudeau’s Liberal Party win a minority government, according to the intelligence reports.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic&#x27;s presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society&#x27;s political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

                              <span>Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men&#x27;s World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
&quot;Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,&quot; Murangira said.
&quot;They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.&quot;
&quot;Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.&quot;
Rwanda&#x27;s soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda&#x27;s Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men&#x27;s event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in France.

                              <span>Peru&#x27;s Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children&#x27;s hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.
The vast majority of children are suffering from &quot;moderate to severe malnutrition,&quot; complicated by other ailments including pneumonia, malaria and the stomach flu…</span>

                              <span>Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

                              <span>Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the &quot;toxicity&quot; of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, &quot;and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes&quot;, Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was &quot;now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire&quot;, Cumming said.
&quot;So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I&#x27;m now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!&quot;
The queen&#x27;s death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London&#x27;s West End, the city&#x27;s theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a &quot;telescopic urinal&quot; when he became trapped, police said.
&quot;We&#x27;re sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene,&quot; Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.

Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.</span>

                              <span>Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
&quot;We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,&quot; said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
&quot;Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,&quot; added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a &quot;quagmire.&quot;
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte&#x27;s removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo&#x27;s arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country&#x27;s south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru&#x27;s vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

                              <span>NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran&#x27;s government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
&quot;The victim publicized (the) Iranian government&#x27;s human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution,&quot; Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran&#x27;s head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

                              <span>A British teenager was on Friday sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for videos promoting racist violence that have been linked to two mass killings in the United States.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and a &quot;propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology&quot;.
&quot;You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you,&quot; Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

A paved road of more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) begun in 312 B.C. by Roman statesman Appius Claudius Caecus, the &quot;Via Appia&quot; is an archaeological treasure trove, where an ongoing excavation hopes to uncover the actual starting point of the road in Rome.

Sharma is the custodian of a temple dedicated to Nathuram Godse, who on January 30, 1948, gunned down a figure celebrated the world over as an apostle of non-violent struggle.
For generations, the young religious zealot -- hanged the following year -- was roundly despised as the archvillain of India&#x27;s long struggle to free itself from British colonial rule.
But since the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi nearly a decade ago, an alternate history forged in Hindu nationalist ideology has left Sharma no longer a &quot;lone warrior&quot; in worshipping the assassin.

                              <span>Bruce Willis: you can stand down.
A truck-sized asteroid that suddenly loomed out of the darkness a few days ago -- with the Earth in its sights -- sailed harmlessly past us on Thursday, space scientists said.
Despite what we&#x27;ve seen in movies like &quot;Armageddon,&quot; no global mission to blow it up or knock it off course with nuclear weapons was required.
Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.
Phew.
The rock, which was spotted for the first time on Saturday by an amateur stargazer in Crimea, came closest to the southern tip of South America at around 0029 GMT Friday, according to scientists who were tracking it.
At its nearest point, the asteroid was just 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) from Earth&#x27;s surface -- just a quarter of the heigh…</span>

                              <span>Mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting fresh revelations from the US trial of former security chief Genaro Garcia Luna, accused of receiving vast sums of money to allow the notorious Sinaloa cartel to smuggle cocaine.
The trial of Garcia Luna, who was Mexico&#x27;s public security minister from 2006 to 2012, began on Monday at the same New York court that handed convicted drug lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman a life sentence in 2019.
The prosecution&#x27;s first witness, an ex-police officer who later worked for Guzman&#x27;s Sinaloa cartel, said he had witnessed former gang boss Arturo Beltran Leyva, who was killed in 2009, give bribes to Garcia Luna.
&quot;He was paid until Beltran&#x27;s last day,&quot; Sergio Villarreal Barragan said in Spanish.
In exchange for money, Garcia Luna provided information about police operatio…</span>

                              <span>Former President Donald Trump on Thursday evening claimed he could end the war between Russian and Ukraine in a single day were he still president.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
&quot;IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS,&quot; he wrote. &quot;SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!&quot;
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

&quot;FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!&quot;
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a &quot;genius&quot; at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.</span>

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved its Doomsday Clock forward to 90 seconds before midnight.
The clock has been maintained since 1947 and is used as a metaphor for the likelihood that we&#x27;ll blow ourselves up. Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, &quot;It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.&quot;
In 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. Today it&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
&quot;Before encountering Earth, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth&#x27;s orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun,&quot; NASA said in a statement. &quot;After its encounter, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth&#x27;s and Mars&#x27; orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.&quot;
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world&#x27;s telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.</span>

The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt&#x27;s former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, &quot;decorated with scenes of daily life,&quot; belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.

                              <span>“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages.

                              <span>The Danish government&#x27;s plan to abolish a public holiday to help fund the defense budget amid the war in Ukraine is putting Denmark&#x27;s cherished welfare model at risk, the country&#x27;s biggest trade union warned.
&quot;It&#x27;s a big threat to the Danish model&quot;, said Lizette Risgaard, the head of the FH union which has 1.3 million members in a country of 5.9 million inhabitants.
&quot;Politicians should stay out of labour market issues. If they go through with this they&#x27;ll be imposing their will and violate our agreements&quot;, she thundered in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.
The left-right government coalition in power since December, headed by Social Democratic Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, plans to scrap the religious holiday known as &quot;Great Prayer Day&quot;, observed since the 17th century.
