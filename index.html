* Sales creating huge threat to privacy new report commissioned by Director of National Intelligence  Avril Haines found 
* There is little regulation of what is being sold and who buying 
* &#x27;This review shows the government&#x27;s existing policies have failed to provide essential safeguards for Americans&#x27; privacy,&#x27; said Sen. Ron Wyden 
US spy agencies are buying and selling Americans&#x27; personal data, creating a huge threat to privacy, a stunning new report revealed on Monday. 
The offerings on have grown from basic address history and demographic information to piles of data generated smartphone devices and apps, social-media platforms, automobiles and location trackers such as fitness watches, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
That detailed information can now &#x27;cause harm to an individual&#x27;s reputation, emotional well-being, or physical safety,&#x27; said a report commissioned by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.

19Fortyfive: Is Joe Biden Hiding Intelligence on China’s Assistance to Russia?

 
Any transfer of weaponry from China to Ukraine would be significant, and it would likely mean the war is nowhere near concluding. 
Give credit where credit is due: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan masterfully declassified intelligence ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in order to take the wind out of the sails of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s propaganda. Thanks to the exposure of Putin’s intentions, not only the American audience but also much of the wider world recognized Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim. This held true even in countries like Iran where, despite their government’s support for Putin, ordinary people overwhelmingly see Ukraine as the victim and draw parallels between their own experience during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and what Ukrainians experience today.

SKY News: Iran: The West cannot stop us from building nuclear weapons but a deal is possible

 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#x27;s words come at a time of high tension between Iran and Israel, with Israel&#x27;s leader already having said his country will do &quot;whatever we need to do to defend ourselves&quot;. 
The West cannot stop Iran from building nuclear weapons, the country&#x27;s supreme leader has said.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking on Sunday as tensions continue to mount over the country&#x27;s nuclear work.

In words reported by state media, he said: &quot;Talks about Tehran&#x27;s nuclear weapons is a lie and [the West] know it.
&quot;We do not want nuclear arms based on our beliefs, otherwise they would not have been able to stop it.&quot;

A deal with the West over the nuclear programme is possible, the supreme leader said, but only if Tehran can keep its nuclear infrastructure intact.

RT:  Defense Ministry reveals number of Russians volunteering for army

 
Over 13,500 servicemen have signed up for contract service in just 10 days
Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry has praised the growing “consolidation” among the population, reporting a significant increase in the number of people willing to join the army and volunteer units amid the conflict with Ukraine.
“In just ten days of the current month, 13,644 people have signed up for contract service,” Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Pankov said during a special briefing on Saturday. “This is 2.1 times more than in the same period of May this year, and 3.1 times higher than in April.” 
Last month, ex-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s National Security Council, claimed that some 117,400 people had volunteered to join the army since January.

                              <span>SCMP: Coincidence or deliberate interception? PLA cuts into Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s radio call with air force officer 
* A PLA warning was played as the island&#x27;s leader was making a radio call to a captain stationed in the southern city of Kaohsiung 
* Taiwan says the mainland military had not hacked into her radio channel, but security specialists call for an investigation in case plans are being leaked to the PLA

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army disrupted a radio call between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the island&#x27;s air force, sparking a discussion about secure communications. 
Tsai was visiting southern Taiwan on Friday to boost morale among service personnel ahead of next week&#x27;s Dragon Boat Festival and spoke to two female officers stationed at an air defence and missile command centre in Kaohsiung.
In a video clip broadcast by local media, Tsai was seen radioing an air force captain, saying &quot;Hotel Delta, this is the president&quot;, before a PLA warning was heard in the background.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: NATO Nations Begin Giant Air Force Drills in Germany 
WUNSTORF, Germany — More than 250 aircraft and 10,000 personnel began a two-week military exercise on Monday involving NATO nations and Japan, in what host nation Germany bills as the largest deployment of aircraft in the alliance’s history. 
Planning for the training began in 2018. But it comes as fighting escalates on NATO’s doorstep in Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces, backed by arms from Western allies, are mounting an offensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia since the invasion ordered last year by President Vladimir V. Putin.

Officials involved in the 25-nation NATO exercise said it sends a message about the alliance’s solidarity.

Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian former PM who overcame various scandals to hold office four times, has died at 86. He died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan. 
In April, he was treated for a lung infection linked to leukaemia.

Berlusconi&#x27;s death leaves a &quot;huge void&quot;, Italy&#x27;s defence minister said, with a national day of mourning due to take place on Wednesday. 
The longest-serving prime minister in post-war Italy, he had bounced back from sex scandals and corruption cases. 
After taking political office in 1994, the billionaire media tycoon led four governments until 2011 - though not consecutively.

Issue &amp; Insights: Can Anyone Beat Biden And Trump For Nominations? I&amp;I/TIPP Poll 
Yes, it’s still very early in the nominating process, and both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump face daunting legal questions. Even so, both front-runners for the two major parties maintain comfortable, double-digit leads over their potential challengers. But what happens when the number of possible choices inevitably narrows? Then, the race for each party’s nomination changes considerably, the latest I&amp;I/TIPP Poll shows. 
As in past months, we asked Democratic voters who among a list of 18 (which includes a choice of “someone else”) they would support for the nomination of their party. The online nationwide poll of 1,230 voters was conducted from May 31-June 2, with the Democratic primary question having a +/-4 percentage point margin of error, vs. +/-4.6 percentage points for the Republican primary question.

                              <span>Ukrayinska Pravda: Ukraine asks Germany for more Leopard 2 tanks 
Considering the first losses during the counteroffensive, Andrii Melnyk, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, is asking for more German-made tanks.

 
Details: Against the background of the loss of the first tanks delivered by the Western allies to participate in the hostilities in Ukraine, Kyiv is once again calling for increased support, in particular from Germany. 
&quot;The Ukrainian army desperately needs many more Western battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and other armoured vehicles,&quot; Melnyk said. 
&quot;Each Leopard 2 is literally worth its weight in gold for a decisive offensive,&quot; added the former ambassador of Ukraine in Berlin.

In his opinion, the Bundeswehr is capable of providing more than the 18 already delivered pieces from its stockpile of more than 300. The current number could be &quot;tripled without jeopardising Germany&#x27;s ability to defend itself&quot;. 
Melnyk also asked to hand over &quot;another 60 Marder infantry fighting vehicles&quot; to the Ukrainian army.

                              <span>WNU Editor: Rainy weather continues to impede Ukraine&#x27;s offensive operations. 
My favorite source on the war from the Ukrainian side is repeating what others are saying .... the Ukrainian goal is to launch small scale attacks along the front until they reach the first Russian fortifications. It is then when the bulk of the military will then be thrown in. 
On the Russian side, this commentator is probably right ....  
.... It seems pretty clear that the Russians have  a flexible defense strategy in front of the first fortified line. They hold the outposts when the Ukrainian attack is not so strong, they retreat to the next village when the attack is stronger and counterattack whenever there is a good chance. Most importantly the Russian artillery gives the Ukrainians a hard time when they move into this forward area.</span>

                              <span>In an all-caps rant on his Truth Social platform Monday, former President Donald Trump vowed to appoint another special counsel to prosecute President Joe Biden. It was a single word that raised the alarm for an expert in religious extremism.
&quot;NOW THAT THE &#x27;SEAL&#x27; IS BROKEN, IN ADDITION TO CLOSING THE BORDER &amp; REMOVING ALL OF THE &#x27;CRIMINAL&#x27; ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ILLEGALLY INVADED OUR COUNTRY, MAKING AMERICA ENERGY INDEPENDENT, &amp; EVEN DOMINANT AGAIN, &amp; IMMEDIATELY ENDING THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA &amp; UKRAINE, I WILL APPOINT A REAL SPECIAL &#x27;PROSECUTOR&#x27; TO GO AFTER THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA, JOE BIDEN, THE ENTIRE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY, &amp; ALL OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS, BORDERS, &amp; COUNTRY ITSELF!&quot; wrote Trump.
The use of &quot;seal&quot; may not be an accident, wrote religion reporter and extremism expert Jeff Sharlet. It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.
&quot;QAnon &amp; many fundamentalists will read this — &amp; I don’t think it’s a stretch to imagine Trump’s people are aware of that — as both the indictment &amp; 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ,&quot; wrote Sharlet.
The Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. 
This could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist — as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.
All of this comes as Trump prepares to face arraignment in Miami on Tuesday, and as authorities brace for the possibility of violence from Trump supporters in the vicinity, supported by escalating violent rhetoric on pro-Trump corners of the internet.</span>

UN Secretary General António Guterres has issued a warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence and called for the creation of a regulatory body.
&quot;Alarm bells over the latest form of artificial intelligence – generative AI – are deafening,&quot; Guterres said at a press conference in New York on Monday.
&quot;Scientists and experts have called on the world to act, declaring AI an existential threat to humanity on a par with the risk of nuclear war. We must take those warnings seriously,&quot; he said.
Guterres presented a position paper in which the United Nations makes proposals on how to deal with AI worldwide and announced plans to create a high-level advisory body on the issue.
He also said that he supported the establishment of a regulatory authority, but that it could not be set up by him alone, only in partnership with the UN member states.
He suggested that such an authority could be inspired by what the International Atomic Energy Agency is today.</span>

                              <span>-Lawyers for Ukraine at the top U.N. court on Monday rejected Russia&#x27;s account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a &quot;rambling conspiracy theory&quot;, in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
Kyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.
Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had &quot;overall control&quot; over the separatist forces.
Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine&#x27;s MH17 case was based on &quot;nonsense&quot; and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.
On Monday, Ukraine&#x27;s lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been &quot;subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory&quot; about the shooting down of MH17 which would be &quot;better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet&quot;.
Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.
Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine&#x27;s allegations on Thursday.
The World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.

Just two countries—the United States and Russia—control 90% of the world&#x27;s nuclear arsenal, respectively possessing 3,708 and 4,489 working nukes, SIPRI found. Both nations have thousands of warheads deployed on military bases with operational …</span>

                              <span>BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in Colombia&#x27;s southern jungle will tell their own story about the ordeal, the father of the two youngest siblings said on Sunday.
The children, aged 1 through 13, survived a May 1 plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults and were found on Friday in Caqueta province after weeks of searching by the military and Indigenous communities.
Their ordeal began in the early hours, when the Cessna 206 aircraft carrying seven people and traveling between Araracuara airport in Caqueta and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure.
&quot;They will tell their stories and you will hear them,&quot; said Manuel Ranoque, the father of the 1-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, after visiting them at Bogota&#x27;s military hospital.
&quot;It&#x27;s not easy to ask them because the children went 40 days without eating well, so I have not been able to get information from the oldest child,&quot; Ranoque told reporters.
Ranoque also told reporters the children&#x27;s mother had survived for four days after the crash, an account disputed by another family member who also spoke to journalists. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -At least 10 people died and 25 were injured after a chartered bus carrying wedding guests rolled off a ramp at a roundabout in the Hunter region in Australia&#x27;s New South Wales (NSW) state, police said on Monday.
The accident occurred around 11:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Sunday near the town of Greta, about 180 km (112 miles) northwest of Sydney, in an area famous for its vineyards and wedding spots.
&quot;I understand they had been at a wedding together, it&#x27;s my understanding they were travelling together ... presumably for their accommodation,&quot; NSW Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Tracy Chapman said during a televised media briefing.
At this stage, it appeared to be a single-vehicle accident, Chapman said. Police were still trying to identify all the passengers, …</span>

                              <span>The dramatic reenactment of Prince Harry’s court trial was “fairly accurate” in portraying how the Duke of Sussex tried to “pull at the heartstrings” of the judge, says writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue.

&quot;People online have been saying it’s not Prince Harry but Prince Barry because of the nature of the re-enactment,&quot; Ms Krakue told Sky News host Danica De Giorgio. 

“I think ‘theatre’ is the right way to describe it and I mean, it’s  … fairly accurate in the way that Prince Harry was trying to pull at the heartstrings, or tug at the heartstrings of the judge in this particular case but unfortunately that’s not how a courtroom works.

“A courtroom works based on facts and not your feelings.”</span>

The Russian ship carried out security tasks along the routes of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of Black Sea. All of them were destroyed, there were no casualties, the ship was not damaged.

WNU Editor: This is not the first time a US intelligence plane or drone was in the area at the same time Ukraine was attacking a Russian target. 
Not surprising. This has caught the attention of the Russian media. From TASS .... 
.... A US RQ-4B Global Hawk strategic remotely-piloted surveillance aircraft conducted reconnaissance in the airspace over the central part of the Black sea during Ukraine’s attempted attack, as in other previous cases, the ministry said (link here).</span>

It appears that after a few days of fighting Ukrainian forces have been able to advance along some parts of the front-lines, but the casualty numbers and equipment losses are staggering. Thousands killed and wounded, and hundreds of armored and other military vehicles destroyed. 
But what is shocking is that even with these heavy losses, they still have not reached any of the Russian fortified lines. 
An army that is advancing against fortified and prepared positions will always suffer heavy losses. But unless there is a change in strategy and/or a breakthrough, this counteroffensive will be seen by future historians as a disaster.</span>

Almost half of Americans in a new poll said that they believe the federal indictment of former President Trump is politically motivated after he was charged with 37 counts in relation to the alleged mishandling of records at his Mar-a-Lago estate. 
Forty-seven percent of respondents in the ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday say the charges against Trump are politically motivated, while 37 percent say they are not. Sixteen percent say they are not sure. 
Most Republicans — 80 percent — say the charges announced last week are politically motivated, with only 16 percent of Democrats aligning with that view. 
By comparison, 71 percent of Democrats say the charges are not rooted in politics. Only nine percent of Republicans say the same.

WNU Editor: Only half?!?!?!? 
The details of the ABC/IPSOS poll are here .... Most Americans view latest Trump charges as serious (IPSOS). 
Update: Lawyer Robert Barnes is right (see tweet below). But that is not the media or political narrative right now.

Any executive branch document created before or during a Presidency is the President&#x27;s to do with as he pleases. That&#x27;s the point of The Presidential Records Act. It has to be that way to keep Constitutional power in the hands of the only elected official of the executive branch.…

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia on Sunday said it had destroyed at least seven German-made Leopard tanks and five U.S.-made Bradley vehicles over 48 hours while repelling Ukrainian attacks, though Russian bloggers reported Ukraine had briefly pierced part of the Russian line.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged on Saturday that his military was engaged in &quot;counter-offensive and defensive operations&quot;, a day after President Vladimir Putin said Russia had repelled the first attacks of the offensive. 
Russia&#x27;s defence ministry said it had repelled more than a dozen Ukrainian attacks over the past day in three major directions and had destroyed a column of armoured vehicles of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in the Zaporizhzhia region.

Reuters: Russia says Ukraine tried to attack Russian ship near major gas pipelines in Black Sea 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine had made unsuccessful attempt to attack a Russian naval ship with six high-speed drone boats as the Russian vessel patrolled major natural gas pipelines in the Black Sea. 
The &#x27;Priazovye&#x27; ship was carrying out what Russia&#x27;s defence ministry said was &quot;monitoring of the situation and ensuring security along the routes of the TurkStream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of the Black Sea.&quot; 
Ukraine attacked in the early hours of Sunday about 300 km south-east of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia&#x27;s Black Sea fleet on the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, the defence ministry said.

                              <span>France 24: Fighting resumes in Sudan after 24-hour ceasefire ends

 
Shelling and gunfire resumed Sunday in the Sudanese capital, witnesses said, at the end of a 24-hour ceasefire that had given civilians rare respite from nearly two months of war.  
Deadly fighting has raged in the northeast African country since mid-April, when army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), turned on each other. 
The latest in a series of ceasefire agreements enabled civilians trapped in the capital Khartoum to venture outside and stock up on food and other essential supplies. 
But only 10 minutes after it ended at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday the capital was rocked again by the sound of shelling and clashes, witnesses told AFP.

* Lawyer Daniel Sheehan tells DailyMail.com that a whistleblower told him of a crashed UFO recovered by the US military that &#x27;distorted space-time&#x27; 
* &#x27;They had a guy go into it and it was the size of a football stadium, while the outside was only about 30 feet in diameter.&#x27; Sheehan said

A crashed UFO recovered by the US military &#x27;distorted space-time&#x27; and was &#x27;bigger on the inside&#x27;, claims a top attorney involved in bringing UFO whistleblowers to Congress. 
Daniel Sheehan says he was told the mind-boggling tale by a whistleblower who allegedly took part in an illegally-undisclosed program retrieving crashed non-human spacecraft – and who has now briefed Senate Intelligence Committee staff. 
The lawyer&#x27;s story is the latest in a series of stunning claims this week of UFOs in the government&#x27;s hands, which began on Monday with an on-camera interview of former senior Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch alleging that the US government possesses multiple crashed &#x27;non-human&#x27; craft.

Pledge Times: American General Milli announced the formation of the three superpowers of the world 
The US, Russia and China are the superpowers in the emerging multipolar world. This was announced on Thursday, June 8, by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, at the graduation ceremony for graduates of the National Defense University. 
“During the Cold War, there were two great powers. After the destruction of the Berlin Wall, there was a period when the United States remained the only superpower. Today it is becoming clear that we are in a multipolar environment with at least three great powers: the US, Russia and China,” he said. 
Milley believes that other states are beginning to take leading positions in their region, openly mentioning ambitions for leadership in the world.

                              <span>The Blaze:  Nearly a third of Gen Z Americans say government should put cameras in every home to prevent crime and abuse 
A new poll found a surprising percentage of Gen Z Americans supporting the idea of the government placing cameras in every home in order to prevent crime and abuse. 
The finding was a part of a poll of 2,000 Americans by the Cato Institute. 

The poll asked whether Americans supported &quot;the government installing surveillance cameras in every household to reduce domestic violence, abuse, and other illegal activity.” 
Overall, very few Americans supported the idea, about 14 percent, or one out of every seven respondents. A large majority, 75%, opposed the idea, and only 10% said they weren&#x27;t sure.

But among those aged below 30 years, 29% said they supported the idea, almost a third of respondents in that age group. 
The poll asked whether Americans supported &quot;the government installing surveillance cameras in every household to reduce domestic violence, abuse, and other illegal activity.”

The Guardian: China has used Cuba as spy base for years, US official says 
Chinese intelligence collection from Cuba predates the Biden era, with facilities upgraded in 2019, White House official says 
China has been spying from Cuba for some time and upgraded its intelligence collection facilities there in 2019, a Biden administration official said on Saturday, following a report about a new spying effort underway on the island. 
China had reached a secret deal with Cuba to establish an electronic eavesdropping facility on the island roughly 100 miles (160km) from Florida, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday but the US and Cuban governments cast strong doubt on the report.

BBC: Ukraine counter-offensive actions have begun, Zelensky says 
Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have confirmed that his country&#x27;s long-awaited counter-offensive against Russia has started. 
&quot;Counter-offensive and defensive actions are taking place,&quot; he said.

But he added that he would not talk in detail about which stage or state the counter-offensive was in. 
The comments come after an escalation of fighting in the south and east of Ukraine and speculation about progress of the widely anticipated push. 
Ukrainian troops are reported to have advanced in the east near Bakhmut and in the south near Zaporizhzhia, and have carried out long-range strikes on Russian targets. 
But assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with the two warring sides presenting contrasting narratives: Ukraine claiming progress and Russia that it is fighting off attacks.

                              <span>Simplicius The Thinker: Anatomy of a NATO-Planned, Trained, and Armed Disaster 
As the smoke cleared the battlefield, we were left witness to a disaster of unprecedented proportions. NATO’s most advanced tanks and armor were left as smoking ruins: 
The most shocking development was the closeups revealed that these weren’t just any NATO tanks and IFVs, but were in fact some of the most advanced upgraded variants. Many of the Leopards destroyed were not the older 2A4s but in fact the much newer 2A6s, which are some of the most advanced tanks in the world. 
The losses by some counts are staggering for a single assault:

    
The Ukrainian Telegram channel &quot;Rezident&quot; reports that, according to its sources, in the previous three days the AFU has lost over 150 units of heavy equipment, including 12 German Leopard MBTs and 15 American M2 Bradley IFVs.

Red State: &#x27;Embarrassing&#x27;: Air Force Twitter Account Sparks Outrage After Going Way Too Far in Honor of ‘Pride Month&#x27; 
The recruiting crisis within the U.S. military is a very real thing, and while senior military leaders and “military experts” have been putting the blame squarely on young people, all signs point to the bigger issue boiling down primarily to one thing: the federal government’s dangerous obsession with all things woke. 
And when I say “dangerous,” I’m not engaging in hyperbole. My RedState colleague streiff explained it well in a recent post:

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran&#x27;s supreme leader on Sunday said a deal with the West over Tehran&#x27;s nuclear work was possible if the country&#x27;s nuclear infrastructure remained intact, amid a stalemate between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.
Months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since September, with both sides accusing each other of making unreasonable demands.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#x27;s guarded approval comes days after both Tehran and Washington denied a report that they were nearing an interim deal under which Tehran would curb its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

COLONELGUNJ, India (Reuters) - The chief of the Wrestling Federation of India, under police investigation for suspected sexual misconduct after accusations by female athletes, held a political rally on Sunday in his first public appearance since the probe was launched in April.
Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, also a federal lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s ruling party, is the subject of a criminal case filed by seven female wrestlers who accused him of groping young athletes at training camps and tournaments.
Singh has denied all the allegations. Delhi police are investigating and will submit their findings before a trial court on Thursday.

KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - For Kherson resident Iryna Radetska, the catastrophic flooding of her city after the giant Kakhovka dam was destroyed is the latest chapter in more than a year of wartime suffering.
&quot;They say a new love kills the old one. Maybe it&#x27;s the same with tragedy,&quot; said 52-year-old Radetska, who is deputy head of a school in the southern Ukrainian city.
Few places have felt the extent of suffering that Kherson has since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Few people bore the brunt of it harder than Radetska, who said she has survived imprisonment, beatings and rockets.
The city, which had a peacetime population of 280,000, was occupied by Russian forces on March 2, 2022. It was liberated by Ukrainian troops in early November, but since then has b…</span>

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) - Honduras opened an embassy in China on Sunday, Chinese state media reported, after the Central American nation cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan earlier this year.
The embassy in Beijing was opened by foreign ministers from the two countries, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro is in China for a state visit, during which she is to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, state media have reported.
Tegucigalpa in March ended its decades-long relationship with Taipei and established diplomatic ties with Beijing.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

                              <span>Politico.eu: Watch out Ukraine, here comes the Hungaro-Austrian Empire 
Pro-Russian politicians in the vein of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán are on the rise in Austria and Slovakia.

VIENNA — Austrian politician Herbert Kickl is a pro-Russian, anti-American conspiracy theorist who champions horse dewormer as a remedy for COVID-19 and wants to turn the Alpine country into a “fortress” against migration. 
He’s also the odds-on favorite to become his country’s next leader and Europe’s next big headache. 
Kickl’s far-right Freedom Party has been leading the country’s national polls by several points since November as soaring inflation and a sharp increase in asylum applications fuel discontent with the current government, a coalition between the center-right Austrian People’s Party and the Greens. With the other main opposition party, the Social Democrats, plagued by infighting, Kickl’s party has the best chance in years to seize power.

The commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral John Aquilino, highlighted the military’s threatening posture towards China, speaking at the annual meeting of the National Committee on US-China Relations last month. The group is known for encouraging engagement between the world’s two largest economies. 
In yet another confirmation that the White House has overturned the long-standing “strategic ambiguity” policy regarding Taiwan, Aquilino went so far as to say President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin have tasked him to win a war against China if Beijing attacks the island.

                              <span>Politico: The Pentagon Is Freaking Out About a Potential War With China  
The war began in the early morning hours with a massive bombardment — China’s version of “shock and awe.” Chinese planes and rockets swiftly destroyed most of Taiwan’s navy and air force as the People’s Liberation army and navy mounted a massive amphibious assault across the 100-mile Taiwan Strait. Having taken seriously President Joe Biden’s pledge to defend the island, Beijing also struck pre-emptively at U.S. and allied air bases and ships in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. managed to even the odds for a time by deploying more sophisticated submarines as well as B-21 and B-2 stealth bombers to get inside China’s air defense zones, but Washington ran out of key munitions in a matter of days and saw its network access severed. The United States and its main ally, Japan, lost thousands of servicemembers, dozens of ships, and hundreds of aircraft. Taiwan’s economy was devastated. And as a protracted siege ensued, the U.S. was much slower to rebuild, taking years to replace ships as it reckoned with how shriveled its industrial base had become compared to China’s.

CNN: China and Russia plan joint military drills as top generals meet virtually 
China and Russia will again hold joint military drills this year, top generals from each side confirmed in a virtual meet Friday, according to China’s defense ministry. 
The chief of the Joint Staff Department of China’s Central Military Commission held a video meeting with Valery Gerasimov, chief of General Staff of the Russian armed forces. 
The meeting was held to “exchange views on implementing the consensus of the two heads of state and deepening cooperation between the two armies,” China’s defense ministry stated. 
On June 6, China and Russia held joint air force drills over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

                              <span>OilPrice.com: Oil Prices Rise As China’s Crude Imports Jump 
Oil prices rose early on Wednesday as Chinese data showed crude imports into the world’s top oil importer jumped in May, recovering from a weak April. 
As of 8:13 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, ahead of the EIA weekly inventory report, WTI Crude prices were up by 0.99% at $72.45. The international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded at $76.98, up by 0.94% on the day.

Following a slump on Tuesday, oil prices recovered some of the losses early on Wednesday, as China’s data showed crude oil imports jumped in May by 12.2% year-on-year and by 17.4% compared to April. 
China imported a total of 12.11 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in May, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, as refiners returned from maintenance and moved to stockpile crude.

The Diplomat: India Not Planning to Invite Ukraine to G20 Summit in September

 
Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited to participate in last year’s G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. 
India is not planning to invite Ukraine to the summit of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in September, its external affairs minister said Thursday.
“In our view, G-20 participation is for members and organizations we have invited. That list we declared as soon as we assumed the G-20 presidency” in December, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told reporters. 
Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but Russia is part of the grouping. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the two remain at war. India has avoided condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine and has sought to end it through diplomacy and dialogue.

Reuters: Iceland to suspend embassy operations in Moscow from Aug 1 
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Iceland&#x27;s foreign ministry will suspend its embassy operations in Moscow from Aug. 1 and has asked Russia to scale back its diplomatic activities in Reykjavik, the ministry said in a statement on Friday.
Iceland&#x27;s embassy operations are being suspended due to an &#x27;all-time low&#x27; level of commercial, cultural and political relations between the two countries, the ministry said.

Politico:  Pressure builds on Biden to send long-range weapons to Ukraine

 
The House members want the administration to greenlight the Army Tactical Missile System for Kyiv. 
U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are making a renewed push for the Biden administration to send Ukraine controversial long-range munitions, as Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive appears to get underway. 
With a range of 190 miles, nearly four times that of Ukraine’s existing rockets, the Army Tactical Missile System has been the subject of intense debate for months. 
Nearly a year ago, national security adviser Jake Sullivan feared that sending ATACMS could make the conflict eventually spiral into World War III, because Ukraine could use the weapon to attack deep inside Russian territory. 
More recently, there are growing concerns inside the Pentagon that the U.S. doesn’t have many to spare anyway.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
