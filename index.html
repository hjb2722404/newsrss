Reuters: China Says It Resolutely Opposes US Military Sales to Taiwan 
BEIJING (Reuters) - China resolutely opposes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and has lodged stern representations to Washington, China&#x27;s defence ministry said on Wednesday. 
 &quot;The United States has ignored China&#x27;s core concerns, violently interfered in China&#x27;s internal affairs and deliberately pushed up tensions in the Taiwan Strait,&quot; spokesperson Tan Kefei said in a statement. 
The U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of ammunition and logistics support to Taiwan in two separate deals valued at up to $440 million, the Pentagon said last week.

AFP: France set to allow police to spy on suspects through phones  
PARIS - French police should be able to spy on suspects by remotely activating the camera, microphone and GPS of their phones and other devices, lawmakers agreed late Wednesday. 
Part of a wider justice reform bill, the spying provision has been attacked by the left and rights defenders as an authoritarian snoopers’ charter, though Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti insists it would affect only “dozens of cases a year”. 
Covering laptops, cars and other connected objects as well as phones, the measure would allow geolocation of suspects in crimes punishable by at least five years’ jail.

                              <span>Newsweek: Exclusive: The CIA&#x27;s Blind Spot about the Ukraine War 
One of the biggest secrets of the Ukraine war is how much the CIA doesn&#x27;t know. The Agency is as uncertain about Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s thinking and intentions as it is about Vladimir Putin&#x27;s. And as the Russian leader faces his biggest challenge in the aftermath of a failed mutiny, the Agency is straining to understand what the two sides will do—because President Joe Biden has determined that the United States (and Kyiv) will not undertake any actions that might threaten Russia itself or the survival of the Russian state, lest Putin escalate the conflict and engulf all of Europe in a new World War. In exchange, it expects that the Kremlin won&#x27;t escalate the war beyond Ukraine or resort to the use of nuclear weapons. 
America&#x27;s stance is under threat because the near-mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group, raises the question as to whether Moscow has run out of options.

The Libertarian Institute: Germany Concerned About Western Escalations in Ukraine 
Top German officials have voiced anxiety regarding Western escalations in Ukraine, signaling that Berlin will push back against the most provocative proposals. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany was reluctant to send longer-range weapons to Ukraine over concerns the arms will be used to attack Russian territory. London has provided Kiev with Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles which have a range of more than 155 miles. According to recent reporting, the White House is also closing in on a decision to provide Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), munitions capable of striking targets roughly 200 miles away.

LONDON —  A group of former senior U.S. national security officials have held secret talks with prominent Russians believed to be close to the Kremlin — and, in at least one case, with the country’s top diplomat — with the aim of laying the groundwork for potential negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, half a dozen people briefed on the discussions told NBC News. 
In a high-level example of the back-channel diplomacy taking place behind the scenes, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with members of the group for several hours in April in New York, four former…</span>

                              <span>BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania is considering opening a regional training hub for F-16 fighter jet pilots which would ultimately be available to its NATO allies and partners, including Ukraine, the country&#x27;s supreme defence council (CSAT) said on Thursday. Romania, both a European Union and NATO member, has raised defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product this year from 2%, in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. The country, which shares a 650-km (400 mile) border with Ukraine, is host to a U.S. ballistic missile defence system and, as of last year, has a permanent alliance battl...</span>

                              <span>When US superstar Taylor Swift announced yet more dates for her much-hyped world tour -- but once again skipped Canada -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could not shake it off.
In a tweet referencing the lyrics of Swift&#x27;s songs, Trudeau urged her to fill the blank space and perform in America&#x27;s neighbor to the north.
&quot;It&#x27;s me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you,&quot; Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. &quot;So, don&#x27;t make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.&quot;
The artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.
She plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.
The bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer&#x27;s lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.
Swift last came to Canada in 2018.</span>

According to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index, the world&#x27;s richest people added an average of $14 million per day to their wealth over the past six months, &quot;the best half-year for billionaires since the back half of 2020, when the economy rebounded from a Covid-induced slump.&quot;
Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk saw the largest net worth boost of any global billionaire, adding nearly $97 billion in the first half of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, saw his wealth grow by close to $59 billion, the second-largest gain of any billionaire.

Fifteen women died, two of them while receiving hospital care, as well as 13 men and a child, the prosecutor said.
The first official report set the number of fatalities at 27 and the number of wounded at 17.

The announcement from the EU monitor Copernicus marked the latest in a series of records for a year that has already seen a drought in Spain and fierce heat waves in China and the United States.
&quot;The month was the warmest June globally at just over 0.5 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, exceeding June 2019 -– the previous record -– by a substantial margin,&quot; the EU monitor said in a statement from its C3S climate unit.

Speaking to a committee in March, the rightwinger also criticized Davis&#x27;s belief in the idea of systemic racism, which she denied existed in France, and said &quot;a certain number of recent declarations about France pose a problem.&quot;
She pointed in particular to a joint letter signed by Davis and other academics in 2021 which accused the French state of having a &quot;colonial mentality&quot; which was &quot;manifest in France&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>A man claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey said the Hollywood actor grabbed him &quot;like a cobra&quot;, a London court heard on Wednesday.
The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is the third of four men accusing Spacey of a string of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
The accuser said he met the US actor, who won Oscars for &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, at an event in a West End theatre in 2005.
In a recording of a police interview played at Southwark Crown Court in south London, the man said Spacey &quot;smelled of booze&quot; and &quot;looked disheveled&quot; when he arrived.
&quot;My first impression is that he seemed very arrogant,&quot; he added.
&quot;I remember he looked me up and down and looked at my crotch region,&quot; the accuser said, adding that the actor made crude remarks towards him.
&quot;It was very aggressive. I have never had anyone talk to me in that way. It was all getting hardcore,&quot; he said about the alleged comments.
The complainant said Spacey allegedly grabbed him &quot;with such force it was really painful&quot;, describing it as &quot;like a cobra coming out and getting hold&quot;.
&quot;I remember freezing and pushing his arm away and feeling shellshocked and frustrated that anybody would be that sleazy,&quot; he added.
The accuser said he had initially put the incident &quot;in a box&quot; but it had &quot;a detrimental effect&quot; on his life.
The alleged victim criticized Spacey for coming out as gay several years ago when other allegations against him became public.
&quot;He took no responsibility for it, he just said &#x27;I&#x27;m gay&#x27;.
&quot;He&#x27;s still not hearing what he did was wrong –- that&#x27;s sort of spurred me on a bit,&quot; the witness said.
The court has heard from two other complainants, one of whom said Spacey was an aggressive &quot;predator&quot; uncomfortable with his sexuality.
Another accuser alleged Spacey kissed his neck and grabbed his crotch.
The prosecution has described Spacey as a &quot;sexual bully&quot;, whose preferred method of assault was grabbing other men in the crotch.
Spacey denies all the charges.</span>

A study conducted as part of the Clem Burke Drumming Project found children with the condition who learned to play the drums showed better control of their emotions and fewer signs of hyperactivity, inattention and repetitive behavior.
&quot;This landmark study is the first of its kind to show how the brain responds positively to drumming and how it can help children with autism and other social and emotional difficulties,&quot; said Burke.

At 90, Nokkho Konyak can barely see beyond a few feet, his facial tattoos marking him as a warrior are fading and his frail body needs support.
But his eyes light up and his hands become animated when he talks about &quot;those simpler times&quot;.
&quot;We witnessed our brave elders cutting off enemies&#x27; heads and participated in many battles,&quot; he told AFP.
Nokkho is a Konyak, a small but fierce and respected warrior community in northeastern India&#x27;s Nagaland state.

The village of Gramatneusiedl near Vienna now has a zero jobless rate after guaranteeing work to all its 129 long-term unemployed.
The project shows it is possible to eradicate this stubbornly difficult problem at a community level, said economist Oliver Picek of Vienna&#x27;s Momentum Institute.

The planned, decades-long discharge of accumulated water from the devastated nuclear facility has been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as meeting global standards.
Its chief Rafael Grossi acknowledged at a meeting in Iwaki, Fukushima prefecture, that concerns remain.
&quot;All these complex graphs and statistics are one thing but the reality, the reality of people, the reality of the economy, the reality of the social mood and perceptions may be different,&quot; he told a meeting of residents and officials.

                              <span>Politico: Jens Stoltenberg to continue as NATO chief 
Current leadership will continue for another year. 
NATO allies have agreed to extend Jens Stoltenberg’s term as secretary-general by a year. 
“Honoured by NATO Allies’ decision to extend my term as Secretary General until 1 October 2024,” Stoltenberg tweeted. “The transatlantic bond between Europe &amp; North America has ensured our freedom &amp; security for nearly 75 years, and in a more dangerous world, our Alliance is more important than ever,” he added. 
The decision, ahead of a summit of NATO leaders in Vilnius next week, is seen as a reflection of how politically sensitive the current moment is for the alliance, as well as how difficult it is for allies to find a high-profile candidate who is both available and acceptable to all alliance members.

President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s government faced a backlash Wednesday after the centrist leader called for powers to &quot;cut off&quot; social media in case of widespread violence like riots over the past week. 
&quot;We have to think about the social networks, about the bans we&#x27;ll have to put in place. When things get out of control, we might need to be able to regulate or cut them off,&quot; Macron told a meeting of mayors on Tuesday according to media reports.
Macron and his ministers have singled out platforms like Snapchat, TikTok and encrypted messenger Telegram for their role in spreading images of the nights of violence following the June 27 police shooting of a 17-year-old teenager, Nahel M. 
&quot;When (social media) becomes a tool for organising or for attempting to kill, it&#x27;s a real problem,&quot; Macron said.

                              <span>CNN: Riots in France have already cost businesses more than $1 billion 
 Just weeks after hugely disruptive protests and strikes over pension reforms in France finally died down, businesses in the country are grappling with the fallout from a week of rioting. 
The riots, which were sparked by the fatal shooting of a teenager by a police officer last Tuesday, have already caused more than €1 billion ($1.1 billion) worth of damage, according to a French business association, MEDEF. 
Protesters have attacked nearly 400 bank branches and 500 corner shops, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told CNN affiliate BFMTV Wednesday. Speaking to CNN’s Isa Soares Tuesday, Le Maire put the total number of looted stores at 1,000, adding that the businesses were being supported by the government.

                              <span>CNN: US Navy intervened to stop Iran seizing two tankers in Gulf of Oman, US defense official says  
The US Navy intervened to stop Iranian Navy ships attempting to seize two oil tankers in separate incidents in the Gulf of Oman early on Wednesday morning, according to a US defense official. 
An Iranian ship opened fire at the tanker in the second seizure attempt, according to the official. 
In the first incident, an Iranian Navy vessel approached the TRF Moss, a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker, in international waters in the Gulf of Oman at approximately 1 am local time, the official said. The tanker was through the Strait of Hormuz and heading toward the Arabian Sea when the Iranian vessel approached.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
