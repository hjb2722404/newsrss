The Russian president stressed that at the moment no direct talks with any of the leaders of the other states participating in the G20 summit were on the agenda 
ASTANA, October 14. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that he sees no need at the moment for talks with US President Joe Biden.
&quot;He should be asked whether he is ready to hold such negotiations with me or not. To be honest, I don’t see any need by and large. There is no platform for any negotiations for the time being,&quot; Putin told the media on Friday, when asked about the possibility of a meeting with Biden at the G20 summit in Indonesia.

‘Nothing further is being planned’ after draft of 300,000 is complete, Russian president claims. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed his country’s so-called partial mobilization of reservists to fight in the Ukraine war, announced last month, will end in around two weeks. 
“This work is already coming to an end,” Putin said at a press conference in Astana, where he traveled to participate in a conference. 
“There are now 222,000 people mobilized in the troop formations, out of 300,000. I think that within about two weeks all mobilization activities will be completed.”  Putin also said that “nothing further is being planned … within the foreseeable future,” as his defense ministry had not requested further troops.

Business Insider: After years of headaches, the US Navy&#x27;s first stealth destroyer is operating farther from home than it&#x27;s ever been 
* US Navy destroyer USS Zumwalt is on a tour of the Pacific, making visits to Guam and Japan. 
* The trip is the farthest the futuristic stealth warship has been from home since it entered service. 
* It comes after years of mechanical problems and debates about the ship&#x27;s role in the fleet. 
The US Navy&#x27;s most advanced destroyer may finally be turning over a new operational leaf after years of maintenance delays, budget headaches, and debates about its role in the fleet. 
USS Zumwalt, the lead ship of the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers, made a port call in Guam on September 19 and arrived in Japan on September 26. It departed Japan on October 8. 
The trip is the farthest the warship has been from its home port in San Diego since it was commissioned in 2016. It&#x27;s also a chance to figure out what the Zumwalt class will actually do for the Navy.

Business Insider: The US Navy&#x27;s new high-tech aircraft launcher is being prepped for deployment on France&#x27;s new nuclear-powered carrier 
* France is making plans to build a next-generation aircraft carrier to replace Charles de Gaulle. 
* The new carrier will have the same aircraft launch and recovery systems as the US&#x27;s newest carriers. 
* The new French carrier is expected to enter service in 2038 and remain there until at least 2080. 
In September, US defense firm General Atomics announced that it had received a contract from the US Navy to continue its development and evaluation of its Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and Advanced Arresting Gear in preparation for their potential sale to France. 
It is the latest development in France&#x27;s ambition to build a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, a project known as the Porte-Avions de Nouvelle Génération, sometimes called PANG, which translates to &quot;New Generation Aircraft Carrier.&quot;

At a moment when the global COVID-19 pandemic is finally loosening its grip on the public consciousness as an object of existential dread, a new fear has swept in to supplant it: nuclear annihilation. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February has stoked U.S. nuclear fears like no other event since the close of the Cold War, according to foreign policy scholars and public opinion curators. 
In poll after poll this year, a majority of Americans have said they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin may unleash nuclear weapons on Ukraine, as Putin himself has threatened.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Best Places To Survive A Nuclear Apocalypse In The US 
After President Biden&#x27;s nuclear &quot;Armageddon&quot; statements and reports, the federal government is purchasing $290 million in anti-radiation drugs for use in &quot;nuclear emergencies,&quot; the first question that comes to mind is where to shelter in the event of nuclear war. 
To answer that question, the survivalist website Survivalfreedom.com outlines that some of the safest regions in a nuclear war &quot;include the upper Midwest, Maine, West Texas, and multiple small pockets, usually in areas that don&#x27;t have large populations.&quot; The most dangerous region is the East Coast because of the significant presence of military installations, defense companies, critical infrastructure, and major cities.

Politico:  Senators seek billions more in military aid for Taiwan 
New provisions have been added to the chamber&#x27;s must-pass defense policy bill. 
Senators are looking to shore up Taiwan’s defenses amid heightened tensions with China, and are poised to green-light billions more in military aid to the island to make it happen. 
Defense policy legislation teed up by the Senate this week now includes numerous provisions aimed at boosting cooperation with the self-governing island and would authorize upwards of $10 billion in military assistance over five years to arm it.

Daily Mail: Russia&#x27;s army will be &#x27;annihilated&#x27; by the West&#x27;s non-nuclear military response if Putin uses nukes against Ukraine, warns EU&#x27;s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell

* Alliance has stopped short of threatening to use its nuclear arsenal to respond 
* This is because Ukraine is not covered by NATO&#x27;s mutual self-defence clause 
Russian forces would be &#x27;annihilated&#x27; by the West&#x27;s military response if Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine, the EU&#x27;s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow on Thursday. 
At the opening of a Diplomatic Academy in Belgium, Borrell said: &#x27;Putin is saying he is not bluffing. 
Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the Member States, and the United States and NATO are not bluffing neither. 
&#x27;Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated.&#x27;

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said there was a real threat of hunger and widespread social upheavals amid the increased volatility of world energy and prices.
“Our summit and other regional cooperation needs to resolve various problems. In particular, I’m talking about the increased volatility of world energy, food, fertilizer prices, prices for raw materials and other significant goods,” Putin said during his speech at the CICA summit in Astana.

                              <span>Reuters: Putin courts Erdogan with plan to pump more Russian gas via Turkey 
ASTANA (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday that Moscow could export more gas via Turkey and turn it into a new supply &quot;hub&quot;, bidding to preserve Russia&#x27;s energy leverage over Europe. 
At a meeting in Kazakhstan, Putin said Turkey offered the most reliable route to deliver gas to the European Union, and the proposed platform would allow prices to be set without politics. 
Russia is looking to redirect supplies away from the Nord Stream Baltic gas pipelines, damaged in explosions last month that are still under investigation. Russia blamed the West, without providing evidence, and rejected what it called &quot;stupid&quot; assertions that it had sabotaged the pipelines itself.

Iraq&#x27;s Parliament on Thursday elected Abdelatif Rashid, candidate of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, as the country&#x27;s new president after beating his rival, Barham Sali, in a secret ballot held more than a year after the parliamentary elections that took place in October 2021. 
The victory of Rashid, who has garnered more than 162 votes against 99 for Sali, candidate of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and current president of the country, comes after he beat his opponent in a first ballot but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to secure the post, as reported by the state news agency NINA. 
 Iraq&#x27;s Prime Minister Mostafa al-Kazemi congratulated Rashid, who previously served as Minister of Water Resources between 2003 and 2010, on his official Twitter profile.

                              <span>A day after the House select committee on January 6 unanimously voted to subpoena former President Trump, he responded with an angry letter to committee chairman Bennie Thompson to complain about his work.  The select committee is investigating the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021 and its causes, with the aim of determining who was responsible for the chaos and preventing it from happening again.
Trump did not mention the subpoena and instead criticized the committee;  he said he was writing “to express our anger, disappointment and grievance at all the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on what many consider a hoax and witch hunt”.  He also attacked the committee for failing to investigate voter fraud and appeared to defend the committee’s targets, who he said were merely acting “as con…</span>

The Washington Post reported:
U.S. Chief District Judge Beryl A. Howell has ruled in a sealed decision that could clear the way for other top Trump White House officials to answer questions before a grand jury that Pence’s former chief of staff Mark Short may have had the Information important to criminals The investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol was not available from other sources, one of the people said.
Trump appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined to delay Short’s appearance while the lawsuit continued, a sign that Trump’s attempts to invoke executive privilege to protect the confidentiality of the president’s decisions are not likely to be accounted for, people familiar with the matter said. upper hand.
The ruling has very important implications because it means that senior Trump White House officials and aides, including Trump himself, could be forced to investigate the 1/6 attack and Trump and his administration’s criminal grand jury before a Justice Department criminal grand jury.

On Wednesday, a Connecticut jury did its best to force the Infowars host and owner to face the consequences of the harm his lies caused others, ordering Jones to pay $965 million to relatives of the victims of a mass shooting in 2012 and to an FBI agent whom he accused of being all actors.

Stone said in the clip: “Jared Kushner has an IQ of 70. He’s going to come to Miami. We’re going to kick him out of Miami very quickly. He’s going to leave soon, very soon. He’s got a hundred guards. I’m going to have 5,000 security guards. Do you want to fight? Let’s fight. Fuck you. Fuck you, and your aborted bitch daughter.”
The Jan. 6 attacks, Trump’s coup plot, and narcissism fueled the perpetrators’ decision-making process, and a documentary film crew followed them, giving us an insight into how Trump and those around him operate.
Roger Stone was upset that Donald Trump refused to grant him a second pardon, ostensibly to cover up his activities in the 1/6 attack.
Here’s the Stone video from the documentary filmmaker who posted the above footage, released by the committee on Thursday, Jan. 6:

Recently, the select committee obtained footage of Roger Stone before and after the election. pic.twitter.com/6mRdWwMSmE

Even before yesterday’s hearing, Zachary Petrizzo was the daily beast Stone ‘threatened to file a $25 million lawsuit against Danish filmmakers – Frederick Mabel and Christopher Gould Branson – who took his picture in November, saying’ Fuck the vote and let’s face violence.&#x27;”
Stone may return to the prison where he belongs. Trump’s longtime adviser is a go-between for the Trump campaign and Russia, and has performed the same functions for Trump on 1/6 with the militia.
The failed former president was surrounded by criminal associates like Roger Stone who were only interested in himself.

                              <span>Republicans have ramped up calls to impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after an email circulated indicating he was notified that claims of border patrol agents whipping migrants was false.

Last September images from Del Rio circulated showing border patrol agents on horseback rounding up migrants who had illegally crossed the border.

Those images looked as if agents were whipping migrants, however the photographer later confirmed it was misconstrued.

An email obtained from September last year by Fox News’ Bill Melugin revealed Secretary Mayorkas was told this narrative was fake – two and a half hours before he fronted the media where he condemned his own border patrol agents.
Republicans have now called for him to be impeached for failing to defend agents.

“Alejandro Mayorkas defamed his own employees in order to score political points.  He has violated his oath of office and lied to the American people with a straight face. His career should be over,” Republican Andy Biggs tweeted.</span>

The Saudis rejected the appeal for delay.   The statement upped the ante in an increasingly acrimonious disagreement between the United States and its putative close partner in the Persian Gulf.

* North Korean jets were seen within 12km of the boundary between the nations 
* South Korean fighter jets were scrambled in response to the unusual incident 
* It comes amid raised tensions on the peninsula after missile tests in the North 
South Korea has scrambled fighter jets after Kim Jong Un&#x27;s warplanes flew towards the border and launched a ballistic missile into the ocean. 
Around 10 North Korean military aircraft were seen flying near the de-facto border overnight, in what it says is a response to &#x27;provocative action&#x27; by its southern neighbour. 
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff says planes were seen flying as close as 12km north of the boundary between the two countries late on Thursday and early on Friday.

FM Sergey Lavrov says Joe Biden’s unwillingness to talk with Vladimir Putin won’t complicate an already dire situation  
US President Joe Biden’s latest remark indicating his unwillingness to negotiate with his Russian counterpart is unlikely to further worsen an already dire global security situation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. The diplomat noted that Moscow is, however, still open to dialogue, but that no “sensible” offers have so far been forthcoming from Washington. 
In an interview with Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel aired on Thursday, Lavrov was asked whether he thought Biden’s reluctance to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin would further complicate tensions in the international arena.

Update: Russia not shying away from contacts with US, but no sane proposals so far, Lavrov says (TASS) 
WNU Editor: I disagree with the Russian Foreign Minister. U.S. - Russian relations can get worse, and will get worse. 
My prediction. 
After the US midterm elections are over the Biden administration is going to significantly escalate the deployment of US personal and equipment to eastern Europe, coupled with a massive increase in economic and military support to Ukraine. The next six months we are probably going to witness the most intense moments between the U.S. and Russia since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

BRUSSELS — NATO will closely monitor Russia’s upcoming nuclear exercise but not be cowed into dropping support for Ukraine by Moscow’s veiled nuclear threats, the alliance’s chief said on Thursday. 
“We will not be intimidated,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after a two-day meeting of the alliance’s defense ministers. 
“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous, reckless, and they know that if they use (a) nuclear weapon against Ukraine, it will have severe consequences.” 
The meeting was the first large NATO gathering since Moscow announced it would annex several Ukrainian territories, began a partial mobilization and issued veiled nuclear threats, moves NATO has classified as a clear escalation of the war that started when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Apparently, that&#x27;s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Alexander Venediktov said 
MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. Accession of Ukraine to NATO can lead to World War III and NATO itself understands it, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Alexander Venediktov said in an interview with TASS. 
According to him, Ukraine&#x27;s application for a fast-track NATO membership is &quot;rather a propaganda move.&quot;  &quot;Kiev is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to World War Three,&quot; Venediktov said.

Politico: NATO sets sights on rebuilding Ukraine’s defense industry 
“It&#x27;s about shifting away from Soviet equipment,&quot; one NATO official said. 
BRUSSELS — NATO is developing a 10-year plan to rebuild the Ukrainian defense industry, with the first meeting between the alliance and Kyiv slated for next week. 
The meeting will be the start of a long process hinted at for weeks by U.S. and NATO officials of a long-term commitment to Ukraine to bring it closer to the alliance in both training and equipment. 
“We will be looking at defense planning requirements to get Ukraine fully interoperable with NATO,” said a senior NATO official who asked not to be named due to ground rules for speaking to reporters during alliance meetings in Brussels this week. “It’s about shifting away from Soviet equipment … to NATO-compatible Western equipment.”

Russian missiles targeted more than 40 Ukrainian cities and towns on October 13, officials said, hitting critical infrastructure in Ukraine&#x27;s capital region, a day after the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling Moscow&#x27;s annexation of Ukrainian territory &quot;illegal&quot; and Ukraine&#x27;s allies committed more military aid. 
Three drones operated by Russian forces attacked the small town of Makariv, west of Kyiv, early on October 13, Andriy Nebytov, head of the Kyiv region police, said on the Telegram messaging app. 
 &quot;There was an overnight drones bombardment by invaders on the Makariv community,&quot; Nebytov said. &quot;According to preliminary information, there were no casualties.&quot;

Two Israeli police officers were injured and nine Palestinians were arrested between Wednesday night and Thursday morning as violence broke out across Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank amid rising tensions surrounding IDF operations in Shuafat and Nablus and a visit by Jews to Joseph&#x27;s Tomb. 
Arab rioters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks and fired fireworks toward Israeli forces throughout east Jerusalem starting early in the evening. Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion&#x27;s car was also pelted with rocks on his way to a Sukkot event in east Jerusalem.

Euronews: Fifteen European countries unite to boost air defence capabilities  
Fifteen European countries on Thursday announced that they would jointly procure air defence systems to protect the continent under a newly-created European Sky Shield Initiative. 
Germany, which spearheaded the project, will coordinate the joint procurements to urgently plug existing gaps with regard to possible air attacks at close range -- including drones -- as well as medium and long-range, and especially against ballistic missiles and cruise missiles which Russia owns, its defence ministry said.
&quot;It is about being able to set prices accordingly and, of course, it is also about being able to support each other jointly in terms of maintenance. So it&#x27;s a win-win situation for the countries that are part of it,&quot; Minister Christine Lambrecht told reporters on Thursday morning.

More than 10 percent of those called-up to a recent snap military reservist exercise either did not open the email or did not receive it in the first place, the Estonian Defense Forces said on Monday. 
Estonian Defense Forces (EDF) commander, Lt Gen.

LONDON (Reuters) - A decision by the OPEC+ oil producer group last week to rein in output has driven up prices and could push the global economy into recession, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. 
&quot;The relentless deterioration of the economy and higher prices sparked by an OPEC+ plan to cut supply are slowing world oil demand,&quot; the Paris-based agency, which includes the United States and other top consumer countries, said. 
&quot;With unrelenting inflationary pressures and interest rate hikes taking their toll, higher oil prices may prove the tipping point for a global economy already on the brink of recession,&quot; it added in its monthly oil report.

Martin Chulov, The Guardian: Saudi Arabia is choosing friends on its own terms and Biden is not one of them  
Reactions in Washington to slashing oil supply have not concerned Mohammed bin Salman; nor have the optics of indirectly boosting Putin’s war 
Mohammed bin Salman had seen it coming. The groundswell of anger in Washington was clear and building since he helped lead an Opec+ decision to cut the world’s oil supply last week. 
But for the first time in the modern era of ties between the US and Saudi Arabia, there was no rush to placate hard feelings, or gloss over a rift. This was the birth of a new realpolitik, where nascent Saudi nationalism paid no heed to a historical ally and instead aligned itself to what Riyadh literally sees as a new world order.

WNU Editor: We are no longer in a uni-polar world where the US was the dominant power. There are new blocs forming, and countries like Saudi Arabia are looking for new partnerships. 
My prediction. 
Russia is the world&#x27;s superpower when it comes to resources, so it is natural that Saudi Arabia wants stable relations with Moscow. China is the manufacturing superpower of the world and a major customer for Saudi oil, so it is only natural that Saudi Arabia wants stable relations with Beijing. 
Both China and Russia also have close ties with Iran, a country that Saudi Arabia needs to be contained. What better way to contain Iran by positioning yourself to be able to provide more to China and Russia than what Iran can do.</span>

* President Biden, as well as other White House officials and Senators, have made it clear in recent days that Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the OPEC+ cut. 
* Saudi Arabia says that it totally rejects these statements that suggest the OPEC+ cut was anything but an economic decision. 
* The Kingdom emphasized that the OPEC+ cut was unanimously decided up by members and was based on purely economic considerations. 
A day after President Biden threatened “there will be consequences” for OPEC+’s decision to reduce its production target by 2 million bpd, Saudi Arabia came out with a statement that expressed “its total rejection” of Biden’s and other statements from Washington with regard to the decision. 
“The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would first like to express its total rejection of these statements that are not based on facts, and which are based on portraying the OPEC+ decision out of its purely economic context. 
This decision was taken unanimously by all member states of the OPEC+ group,” the statement, from the Foreign Ministry, said.

   The Guardian: Saudi Arabia claims US requested one-month delay to oil production cut  
Alleged move by Biden administration came before mid-term elections in which petrol prices are key issue 
Saudi Arabia has claimed it was pressured by the Biden administration to delay by a month a decision to cut oil production, a move that would have reduced the likelihood of an unpopular fuel price rise just before the US mid-term elections.
In its first remarks since the US president warned on Tuesday of consequences over the production cut, the Saudi foreign ministry said it rejected the overture and pressed on with the reduction.  Washington has not confirmed it made any such request.

                              <span>Pepe Escobar, The Cradle: Terror on Crimea Bridge forces Russia to unleash Shock’n Awe  
The western narrative of a &#x27;losing Russia&#x27; has just been decimated by Moscow&#x27;s blitzkrieg against Ukraine and its foreign-backed terror operations. 
The terror attack on Krymskiy Most – the Crimea Bridge – was the proverbial straw that broke the Eurasian camel’s back.  Russian President Vladimir Putin neatly summarized it: “This is a terrorist attack aimed at destroying the critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation.” 
The head of the Russian Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, confirmed face-to-face with Putin that Terror on the Bridge was carried out by the SBU – Ukrainian special services.

WNU Editor: I can only hope Pepe Escobar&#x27;s predictions in the above post on what Russia is going to do next do not come to past. But being someone who is from a Soviet/Russian military family, and who has been a student and observer of the Russian military for most of my life, my gut tells me that Pepe Escobar&#x27;s analysis is correct. If I disagree with him, it is on the timing. Putin has not really unleashed the dogs from hell yet, but this weeks attacks are a signal that he is on the verge of doing just that.</span>

Reuters: Ukraine&#x27;s Zelenskiy appeals for $55 billion to cover budget gap and reconstruction 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday appealed to international donors to increase their financial support, saying more money was needed to rebuild schools and homes destroyed by months of Russian bombardment. 
Zelenskiy, speaking by video link to finance ministers at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings in Washington, said Ukraine needed about $55 billion - $38 billion to cover next year&#x27;s estimated budget deficit, and another $17 billion to start to rebuild critical infrastructure, including schools, housing and energy facilities.
&quot;The more assistance Ukraine gets now, the sooner we&#x27;ll come to an end to the Russian war, and the sooner and more reliably we will guarantee that such a cruel war will not spread into other countries,&quot; Zelenskiy said.

Rudd also asserts why the war in Ukraine is the whole world’s business and why he feels that Vladimir Putin’s threats have backfired badly.</span>

                              <span>Power to Europe&#x27;s largest nuclear power plant has been restored for the second time in five days. 

An onsite team from the UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog confirmed external power returned after it was forced to switch to emergency diesel fuel generators.

Ukraine&#x27;s state nuclear energy company earlier accused Russia of shelling a substation, causing the outage - which led to the United Nations calling for a protection zone around the facility.</span>

Officials say the rocket was carrying at least eight satellites intended for orbit.</span>

                              <span>Did the commander-in-chief of Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces publish a photo of himself wearing a bracelet with a swastika on it? That’s what some Russian media outlets and pro-Russian social media accounts have been reporting since October 9, 2022.

                              <span>RT: Gazprom CEO makes grim predictions for EU  
The region will struggle to survive through the winter and may run out of gas by March, Aleksey Miller claims  
Entire cities in Europe could freeze over during the cold peak of winter, CEO of Russian energy major Gazprom, Aleksey Miller warned, speaking at Russian Energy Week on Wednesday. 
According to his estimates, Europe may lack about 800 million cubic meters of gas per day which represents a third of the EU&#x27;s total consumption. In the worst case scenario set out by Miller, gas storage facilities in the region will only be 5% full by March.

Update #3: Gazprom CEO Says Europe Could Freeze Even With Full Gas Storage (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: The Gazprom CEO is saying the same thing that I said last month. Everyone has enough stockpiles to last a normal winter, but it is the spring of 2023 and beyond that we should be more concerned about when it comes to critical energy supplies and shortages.</span>

President Vladimir Putin has said the gas taps can be still turned on for Russian supplies to the EU, despite sharp political disagreements. 
Russia has not delivered gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 line since August, and Nord Stream 2 was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
The February invasion led to gas price hikes, and EU customers face record tariffs this winter.  But Germany quickly rejected Mr Putin&#x27;s offer to send gas via Nord Stream 2.

   PJMedia: Trump, Gabbard Warn of Nuclear Armageddon 
Former President Trump and former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are emerging as voices of reason, as the world watches developments in the Ukraine War with increasing concern. Ukraine is awash in cash and weapons sent by the Biden administration to support its war to repel Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is taking full advantage of the situation, refusing to take a breather until his country is restored to its pre-Russian-aggression borders — including the return of Crimea. Globalist powers are aligning to back nuclear-armed Russian President Vladimir Putin into a corner — an extremely volatile situation.

In 2017, Drug Enforcement Administration agents following the money from cocaine deals in Memphis, Tennessee, identified a mysterious figure in Mexico entrusted by drug lords with their millions: a Chinese American gangster named Xizhi Li.
As the agents tracked Li’s activity across the Americas and Asia, they realized he wasn’t just another money launderer. He was a pioneer. Operating with the acumen of a financier and the tradecraft of a spy, he had helped devise an innovative system that revolutionized the drug underworld and fortified the cartels.
Li hit on a better way to address a problem that has long bedeviled the world’s drug lords: ho…</span>

                              <span>In a move White House officials called a &quot;hostile act,&quot; Saudi Arabia slashed oil production by 2 million barrels a day with around just a month to go before the U.S. midterms. Now, the Biden administration says it will be &quot;re-evaluating&quot; its relationship with the Saudis. 
According to The Intercept&#x27;s Ken Klippenstein, the reaction was a public sign of disappointment from U.S. officials rarely directed towards the Saudi Kingdom. 
Experts speaking to The Intercept say the Saudis&#x27; move wasn&#x27;t just geopolitical -- it was an effort to influence U.S. politics. 
“The Saudis are working to get Trump re-elected and for the MAGA Republicans to win the midterms,” Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, told The Intercept. “Higher oil prices will undermine the Democrats.”

Charles, 73, will be formally crowned at London&#x27;s Westminster Abbey, following a long tradition dating back more than 900 years.
The monarch&#x27;s wife, Queen Consort Camilla, 75, will also be crowned, the palace confirmed.
May 6 is the fourth birthday of Charles&#x27; grandson Archie, the son of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.
&quot;The coronation will reflect the monarch&#x27;s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry,&quot; royal officials said in a short statement.

Vice News reports that newsletter from Ian Bremmer, a foreign policy expert and the founder of the Eurasia Group global risk consultancy firm, is claiming that Musk said that Putin is now &quot;prepared to negotiate&quot; a peace settlement but only if Ukraine accepted Russia&#x27;s annexations of its territories in the eastern part of the country.
Putin emphasized to Musk that Russia&#x27;s annexation of this Ukrainian territory, as well as an agreement in which Ukraine would maintain neutrality and not join NATO, would be accomplished &quot;no matter what,&quot; and he even emphasized that his nation was prepared to launch a nuclear strike should Ukrainian forces attempt to retake Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.
Bremmer also claims that Musk personally told him that &quot;everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome,&quot; and that was why he publicly floated his plan.
IN OTHER NEWS: Now Trump is openly challenging the feds to indict him
But Musk&#x27;s plan has not been well received in Kyiv, with many officials saying it would amount to capitulation to Russia.
&quot;The only outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing tesla crap. So good luck to you,&quot; Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk wrote to Musk on Twitter. &quot;F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you.&quot;
Musk has denied Bremmer&#x27;s claims, however, and he wrote on Twitter that &quot;I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space.&quot;

&quot;I think the president&#x27;s been very clear that this is a relationship that we need to continue to re-evaluate, that we need to be willing to revisit,&quot; National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.
&quot;Certainly in light of the OPEC decision, I think that&#x27;s where he is.&quot;
The 13-nation, Saudi-led OPEC cartel and its 10 allies headed by Russia agreed last week to reduce output by two million barrels a day from November -- raising fears that oil prices could soar.
The decision was widely seen as a diplomatic slap in the face, since Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in July and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salma…</span>

She smiled, and hastily wrapped the bracelet around her wrist. She then rushed into a curtain, the crowd roaring as smoke filled the stage. Some even wiped away their tears as Karol began the show. Karol, a well-known Ukrainian singer, is an artist, actress and show presenter. She’s also a philanthropist and the founder of a nonprofit called The Pole of Attraction.

                              <span>US President Joe Biden warned last week that the risk of nuclear “Armageddon” is now the highest since the Cuban Missile Crisis as Russia and North Korea engage in saber-rattling on the use of “tactical” nuclear weapons. Such weapons are less destructive than “strategic” weapons designed to wipe out entire cities. But analysts worry that this talk of tactical weapons risks normalising weapons of mass destruction.
Nuclear-armed authoritarian states are increasingly invoking the specter of using “tactical” nuclear weapons. North Korea said on Monday that it had simulated a “tactical” nuclear attack on South Korea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted at using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine as Moscow suffers heavy losses on the battlefield.

                              <span>Eight months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, describing it as a &quot;special military operation.&quot; Most military analysts expected an easy victory. The Russians had a significant numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, much greater firepower, air and naval superiority and seemingly bottomless resources with which to impose its will. It was reasonable to believe that Russia would conquer Ukraine rapidly and then replace the existing government before declaring &quot;victory&quot;. 
Of course, that did not happen.
The Ukrainians had been preparing for this eventuality since at least 2014, when the Russian military and its allied forces invaded eastern Ukraine and illegally occupied and annexed Crimea. With the help of the U.S. and other Western allies, the Ukr…</span>

Protests calling for the fall of the clerical establishment have swept Iran since Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, died on Sept. 16 while being detained by the morality police in Tehran for &quot;inappropriate attire&quot;.
While observers do not believe the unrest is close to toppling the government, the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, with reports of strikes spreading to the vital energy sector.

A Supreme Court judge annulled the conviction last year.

                              <span>Rights groups voiced alarm Tuesday over the extent of an Iranian crackdown on a Kurdish-populated city that has become a hub for protests, as oil refinery workers pressed strikes in a new tactic.
Iran&#x27;s clerical authorities have been shaken by over three weeks of protests that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year old Iranian of Kurdish origin, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police.
Despite the use of brutal force by the authorities that activists say has left dozens dead, and led to hundreds of arrests, there is so far no sign of the protest movement coming to an end.
Protests have been especially intense in the city of Sanandaj in the western province of Kurdistan, Amini&#x27;s home region, where rights groups fear heavy casualties and accuse authorities of resort…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskiy on Monday that the United States will provide Ukraine with advanced air systems after a devastating missile barrage from Russia.
Biden spoke by phone with Zelenskiy to give assurances about continued U.S. support and to condemn the &quot;senseless attacks&quot; from Russia that hit civilian targets.
&quot;President Biden pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems,&quot; a White House statement on the phone call said.
Biden also told Zelenskiy the United States and its allies and partners would continue imposing costs on Russia, &quot;holding Russia accountable for its war crimes and atrocities, and providing Ukraine with security, economic, and humanitarian assistance,&quot; the White House said.
The United States has provided more than $16.8 billion worth of U.S. security assistance since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and imposed a wide-ranging array of economic sanctions on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - The United States and other G7 powers will hold crisis talks Tuesday on Russia&#x27;s recent bombing blitz across Ukraine, with Britain&#x27;s Liz Truss expected to insist they &quot;must not waver one iota&quot; in their support for Kyiv.
The meeting comes a day after Russian missiles rocked the Ukrainian capital for the first time in months, with President Volodymyr Zelensky warning Moscow that his country &quot;cannot be intimidated&quot;.
Russian forces rained more than 80 missiles on cities across Ukraine on Monday, according to Kyiv, in apparent retaliation for an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia.

                              <span>The websites for a number of major US airports were briefly taken offline Monday after a cyberattack promoted by a pro-Russian hacking group.
The distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks hit the airport websites of several major US cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and St Louis.
A DDOS attack involves knocking a website offline by flooding it with traffic.
The airport websites were targeted after the pro-Russian hacking group known as &quot;KillNet&quot; published a list of sites and encouraged its followers to attack them.
The DDOS attacks only affected the public-facing websites of the airports, which supply flight and services information and do not have any impact on operations.
Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport said its website is &quot;up and running after an incident early this morning that made it inaccessible to the public.&quot;
&quot;An investigation into the cause of the incident is underway,&quot; it said. &quot;At no time were operations at the airport impacted.&quot;Most of the airport websites targeted appeared to be functioning normally after being temporarily knocked offline.
KillNet claimed responsibility last week for attacks on a number of US state government websites, and it has taken aim at other countries opposing Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
There was no immediate comment from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).</span>

As the war continues to escalate in Ukraine, we feature an interview recorded earlier this month with world-renowned political dissident Noam Chomsky in Brazil and political writer Vijay Prashad. Chomsky discusses why he thinks there is no major U.S. peace movement in response to the Ukraine war, and talks about the dangerous U.S. Senate policy on China and Taiwan, which he says, along with Ukraine, could end in a “terminal war.” Prashad also examines the destruction wrought in the Global South by Western so-called humanitarian invasion in the name of demo…</span>

&quot;Let there be no doubt,&quot; Putin said in televised comments addressed to his security council, &quot;if attempts at terrorist attacks continue, the response from Russia will be severe.&quot;

                              <span>Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently floated a new &quot;compromise&quot; intended to keep peace between Taiwan and China -- and it is being given the same kind of hostile reception that politicians in Ukraine recently gave to his proposed &quot;peace plan&quot; with Russia.
As CNBC reports, Musk told the Financial Times over the weekend that the United States should endorse some kind of plan that gives Beijing some administrative control over Taiwan.
Specifically, Musk said America should &quot;be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy.”
“And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong,&quot; Musk added.
However, Taiwanese diplomat Hsiao Bi-khim immediately shot down Musk&#x27;s proposal, which had received a friendly reception from Qin Gang, China&#x27;s ambassador to the United States.

&quot;Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale,&quot; she said. &quot;Any lasting proposal for our future must be determined peacefully, free from coercion, and respectful of the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan.
Bates Gill of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis similarly told CNBC that there is little desire among people in Taiwan to have any such arrangement, especially after watching how China slowly destroyed freedoms that had existed previously in the city of Hong Kong.
&quot;The world’s wealthiest man obviously feels he has a lot to say on these geopolitical questions,&quot; explained Gill. &quot;I would only suggest that he take a lot harder look at the realities, the historical precedents and geopolitical contestation that surround all of these questions before giving us all a lesson in diplomacy.&quot;</span>

Another 13 people were killed in heavy rains elsewhere in the South American country, while four died in Central America after tropical storm Julia dumped torrential rain on El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Residents of Las Tejerias some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Caracas, used picks, shovels and any tools they could find to dig through a thick bank of mud deposited on the town Saturday.
&quot;It came too fast, we had no time,&quot; resident Carlos Camejo, 60, said of the mudslide.
&quot;The town is lost, Las Tejerias is lost,&quot; added Carmen Melendez, 55, desperately waiting for news on the whereabouts of a missing relative.

But the real culprit behind the subjugation of non-European peoples across the globe wasn&#x27;t an individual, or even a monarch. It was the Roman Catholic Church. It&#x27;s time the church owned that grievous mistake.
 As early as the 15th century, as European nations were making voyages of discovery, Catholic popes gave them permission to subjugate and steal. The most significant of these papal permission slips was the Doctrine of Discovery. A decree Issued in 1493 by Pope Alexander VI, it essentially told Catholic countries that any lands they &quot;discovered&quot; were …</span>

                              <span>Several cities across Ukraine were rocked with explosions in what some are calling the most extensive attack on the country since Russia launched its invasion in February. 
&quot;This morning, a massive high-precision strike was conducted on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, military command, and communications,&quot; said Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;In case Ukrainian terrorist attacks continue on Russian territory, our response will be tough and proportional.&quot;
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the strikes disproportionately targeted civilian infrastructure in 11 of Ukraine&#x27;s 25 regions. 
&quot;It&#x27;s a tough morning when you&#x27;re dealing with terrorists,&quot; said Zelenskyy in the video. &quot;They&#x27;re choosing targets to harm as many people as possible.&quot;

                              <span>Russia on Monday launched a series of missiles into cities across Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson doesn&#x27;t believe that any new initiative will help the country succeed in its goals of taking and holding Ukrainian territory.
While speaking on CNN, Anderson broke down news that Russian General Sergey Surovikin would be taking over as head of the Kremlin&#x27;s &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine, which in recent weeks has been hit with multiple humiliating setbacks.
While Surovikin has a well earned reputation as a hardliner, Anderson was skeptical he could turn things around given the current state of Russia&#x27;s military.
&quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going to be a new approach because he&#x27;s incapable of doing a new approach as long as the Russian army is what it is, which is a terrible army,&quot; he said.

Later in the segment, Anderson elaborated on why new leadership won&#x27;t be nearly enough to fix what&#x27;s broken in the Russian military.
&quot;It&#x27;s not like the soldiers are going to jump into a phone booth and come out as Superman,&quot; he said. &quot;They have a terrible army. They&#x27;re ten years away from having a good army that can take on the Ukrainians and achieve the military objectives they wanted. They have a low morale... They&#x27;re incapable of executing the military operations that Vladimir Putin wants. George Patton couldn&#x27;t make this a success for Putin.&quot;

In Iran no-one who expresses dissent from the ruling theocratic system, including the famous, is safe from being caught in the dragnet of a crackdown that has seen hundreds arrested in more than three weeks of protests.
Activists say that when the unrest erupted last month over the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police, the authorities initially resorted to lethal force, killing dozens in the space of days.
But, as well as keeping up the threat of force, authorities are increasingly resorting to arrests, with a particular focus on those who promote videos of protests or anti-regime messages on social media.

Kim made acquiring tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021, and this year vowed to develop North Korea&#x27;s nuclear forces at the fastest possible speed.
The country revised its nuclear laws last month to allow pre-emptive strikes, with Kim declaring North Korea an &quot;irreversible&quot; nuclear power -- effectively ending the possibility of negotiations over its arsenal.
Since then, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington have ramped up combined military exercises, including deploying a nuclear-powe…</span>

Restoring the practice, which entails self-criticism in front of the general secretary, marked a small but symbolic example of how Xi has departed from China&#x27;s collective leadership of recent decades and accumulated power unseen since Mao&#x27;s time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan throws open its doors to visitors this week after more than two years of pandemic isolation, hopes for a tourism boom face tough headwinds amid shuttered shops and a shortage of hospitality workers.
From Tuesday, Japan will reinstate visa-free travel to dozens of countries, ending some of world&#x27;s strictest border controls to slow the spread of COVID-19. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen&#x27;s slide to a 24-year low.
Arata Sawa is among those eager for the return of foreign tourists, who previously comprised up to 90% of the guests at his traditional inn.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea&#x27;s recent missile tests were &quot;tactical nuclear&quot; drills personally overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, state media said Monday, adding the launches were a response to US-led joint military exercises in the region.
Kim has long wanted to develop tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021.
The country revised its nuclear laws last month, envisaging a wide array of scenarios in which it could use its nukes, with Kim declaring North Korea an &quot;irreversible&quot; nuclear power -- effectively ending the possibility of denuclearisation talks.
Since then, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington have ramped up combined…</span>

Russian President Vladimir Putin has pointed the finger at Ukraine&#x27;s secret service SBU for what he called an &quot;act of terrorism&quot; on a bridge linking Russia to Crimea.
&quot;There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation,&quot; Putin said on Sunday evening in his first public remarks since an explosion tore through the bridge&#x27;s rail and roadway.
Kiev has so far not admitted involvement in the attack on Saturday, which sent massive plumes of smoke and flames into the air when a blast damaged one of the key supply routes for Moscow&#x27;s faltering military campaign in Ukr…</span>

A projection by pollster SORA for national broadcaster ORF based on a partial vote count put Van der Bellen, a 78-year-old former leader of the Greens, on 54.6% with a margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. His nearest rival was far-right Freedom Party candidate Walter Rosenkranz on 18.9%.

                              <span>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Julia slammed into Nicaragua on Sunday carrying top winds of up to 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and a storm surge, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, warning of dangerous weather in the coming days across the region.
The storm made landfall early on Sunday near Laguna de Perlas, the NHC said. By 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) it was around 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of Bluefields.
The hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it crosses Nicaragua, emerging over the eastern Pacific by Sunday night. It was forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night, the NHC said.
&quot;Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides possible from heavy rains over Central America and Southern Mexico through early next week,&quot; the center said.
