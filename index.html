                              <span>Thousands are marching in solidarity with protesters in Iran nearly a month after the death of Mahsa Amini. 

Marches have been held in cities such as Berlin, Washington and London.

Ms Amini was arrested by police for allegedly violating the country&#x27;s dress code for women and her death sparked deadly protests across the country, leading to 12,000 arrests and nearly 250 deaths.</span>

Mr Clennell said the two leaders “upgraded the security relationship” with an agreement that includes that Japanese troops for the first time can train on Australian soil and vice versa. 

“Of course, China looms largest in all of that. Perth was chosen for the bilateral meeting because WA is important to Japan with its supplies of natural resources including gas and iron ore. 

“It is also, of course, after a thumping election result for Labor there, an important political area for the Prime Minister, who over the weekend attended the local telethon. An energy security agreement was also signed between the two leaders.&quot;</span>

Moscow-installed authorities urged residents in the southern Kherson region -- which the Kremlin claims to have annexed -- to leave the main city &quot;immediately&quot; in the face of Kyiv&#x27;s advancing counter-offensive. 
&quot;Due to the tense situation on the front, the increased danger of mass shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks, all civilians must immediately leave the city and cross to the left bank of the Dnipro river,&quot; the region&#x27;s Russian-installed authorities said on social media on Saturday. 
A Moscow-installed official in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, told the Russian news agency Interfax that around 25,000 people had made the crossing.

Mihail Kogălniceanu, Romania — The U.S. Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division has been deployed to Europe for the first time in almost 80 years amid soaring tension between Russia and the American-led NATO military alliance. The light infantry unit, nicknamed the &quot;Screaming Eagles,&quot; is trained to deploy on any battlefield in the world within hours, ready to fight. 
 CBS News joined the division&#x27;s Deputy Commander, Brigadier General John Lubas, and Colonel Edwin Matthaidess, Commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, on a Black Hawk helicopter for the hour-long ride to the very edge of NATO territory — only around three miles from Romania&#x27;s border with Ukraine.

                              <span>DW: Germany: Thousands protest high energy costs in 6 cities 
Protesters gathered in six German cities on Saturday under a motto roughly translating as &quot;together through the crisis — ensure social security and end fossil fuel dependence,&quot; demanding more social justice and sustainability as inflation and rising gas prices start to bite in Germany. 
Organizers like the major trade union ver.di and the German branch of Greenpeace estimated turnout at around 24,000 — including around 6,000 in Berlin, 5,000 in Düsseldorf and Frankfurt, and 4,000 in Stuttgart, with protests also taking place in Hanover and Dresden. 
Police estimates on turnout were often far lower, however, at 1,800 in Berlin, 1,500 in Hanover, 2,300 in Düsseldorf and 2,700 in Frankfurt. 
Police also reported that the demonstrations were calm and peaceful.

Pakistan has been removed from an international terrorism-financing watch list, the head of the international organization that makes the list said. 
The decision was announced on October 21 at the end of a two-day meeting in Paris of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at which the organization removed Pakistan from its so-called &quot;gray list&quot; of countries that do not take full measures to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. 
The FATF welcomed “Pakistan’s significant progress in improving&quot; its anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing policies.

Moscow’s next target may be a massive dam in Kherson.
 Ukrainians in the south of the country are bracing for the likely destruction of a major dam that would have immediate and catastrophic consequences for civilians in the area. Ukraine has pointed to the likely attack on the dam, located in Kherson Oblast, as part of Russia’s increasing use of an illegal but practiced tactic — attacking civilian infrastructure.

The UK has seemed to be in constant crisis for a few years now. There’s one big reason why. 
 Years of political turmoil reached a new low in Great Britain this week with the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss after the shortest tenure in British history. 
Confidence in Truss had collapsed after she presented a budget proposal featuring the UK’s largest tax cuts in 50 years, mainly benefiting the wealthy and corporations. Financial markets reacted with shock to the plan — which commentators dubbed “regressive” and “badly designed” — sending the pound plunging and steeply increasing the costs of government borrowing.

What’s next for the Conservative Party leadership contest, and the country, explained.
 After three prime ministers in as many years, where does the UK Conservative Party go next? 
The immediate question of who will succeed Liz Truss as the party and the UK’s leader, after she announced she would resign just six weeks into her volatile tenure, will be answered in the next week. But while Truss’s downfall was swift, it was the culmination of years of economic and political shortsightedness — and those years weren’t just contained to Brexit.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been filmed with a secret briefcase on Thursday. 
He is being seen firing a sniper rifle at a training camp for conscripts. 
At the camp, one of Putin&#x27;s guards was seen with the nuclear football at a time when the risk of nuclear conflict over the Ukraine invasion is much higher than ever. 
Wearing protective eye goggles, Putin tested the rifle Ryazan region&#x27;s training ground, which is more than 170 km from the Russian capital.

CNN: Multiple foreign nationals charged in alleged schemes to send military technology to Russia 
The Justice Department announced charges on Wednesday against nearly a dozen people and two companies in connection with illegal schemes to send military technology to Russia, some of which has allegedly been recovered from battlefields in Ukraine. 
The department said in a statement that some of the defendants also tried to send “nuclear proliferation technology” to Russia, but that it was intercepted before it arrived.

                              <span>The Guardian: Financial toll on Ukraine of downing drones ‘vastly exceeds Russian costs’  
Analysis reveals cost of shooting down cheap drones, but experts say deployment is sign of Moscow’s weakness 
The cost to Ukraine of downing the “kamikaze” drones being fired at its cities vastly exceeds the sums paid by Russia in sourcing and launching the cheap Iranian-made technology, analysis suggests. 
A total of 161 Shahed-136 drones, one larger Shahed-129 and four even larger unmanned attack vehicles known as Mohajer-6s have been shot down by Ukrainian air defences in the last month. 
With the price of the Iranian-made Shahed-136s standing at €20,000 to €50,000 for each vehicle, the total cost to Russia of the failed drone attacks unleashed on Ukraine in recent weeks is estimated by military analysts at the NGO Molfar to be between $11.66m (£10.36m) and $17.9m (£15.9m).

* Giorgia Meloni and the Brothers of Italy party emerged winners from Italy&#x27;s general election last month 
* She received the most votes but not enough for a majority, today she formed a coalition with her allies 
* The far right-wing party leader is now Italy&#x27;s first female PM, thanks to Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini 
Far-right politician Giorgia Meloni has been elected as Italy&#x27;s leader after officially asking the President for the right to form a government. 
Meloni and her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party emerged the winners of last month&#x27;s election, but short of an overall majority. 
She has now formed Italy&#x27;s most right-wing government since Benito Mussolini after negotiating a coalition with allies including Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia.

THE Royal Navy is tracking a Russian &quot;research&quot; ship that has changed course off the UK coast following raised fears of sabotage on undersea cables. 
The provocative diversion of the Akademik Boris Petrov comes a day after the Shetland Isles suffered a phone and internet blackout caused by severed wires on the sea floor. 
The outage is thought to have been caused accidentally by a fishing trawler rather than by an act of aggression, defence sources said.

                              <span>NBC: With GOP skeptics of Ukraine aid poised to gain seats in Congress, lawmakers look to lock in a huge military assistance package    
One bipartisan idea would use a funding bill during the lame-duck session to secure a much higher level of military and other assistance. 
Amid concerns that a new Congress could take a more skeptical view of aid to Ukraine, lawmakers from both parties are looking to lock in billions of dollars in military assistance to Kyiv before newly elected members are sworn in in January, according to a lawmaker and congressional staffers. 
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who is poised to take over as speaker if the GOP wins a majority in the House in the November midterm elections, warned this week that his fellow party members are “not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.”

                              <span>Euronews: EU to provide Ukraine with €18 billion in financial assistance for 2023, says von der Leyen 
Continued support to Ukraine and the bloc&#x27;s strategic position against China dominated discussions among EU leaders at the second day of a summit on Friday. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is set to provide Ukraine with up to €18 billion in financial assistance throughout 2023 to cover the basic budgetary needs of the war-torn country. 
&quot;It is very important for Ukraine to have a predictable and stable flow of income,&quot; von der Leyen said at the end of two-day meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.

Update #2: EU to give 18B euros to Kyiv next year to help run Ukraine (Reuters)   
WNU Editor: This EU financial assistance does not include military assistance. 
So why is the EU rushing to provide this aid now for 2023 instead of next year? 
My gut tells me that these EU leaders know that this winter is going to be horrendous for many in the EU. 
High energy prices (if you can get a reliable source of energy). Inflation. Shortages. Business closures. High unemployment. High debt loads for governments, businesses, and individuals. 
There will be no appetite among Europeans to provide aid to Ukraine when so many are suffering. Hence the rush to do it now.</span>

Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman held an online meeting with China’s National Energy Administrator Zhang Jianhua, during which they agreed to bolster “the bilateral relationship between the two countries in the field of energy,” according to a joint statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency on Friday. 
They will “strengthen co-operation to address emerging risks and challenges,” the statement read. “The kingdom continues to be China’s most reliable partner and supplier of crude oil.”

The killer ground drone revolution is here. 
The Netherlands has deployed four armed ground robots or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), making it the first NATO country to do so. 
The robots are Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry Systems (THeMIS) UGVs built by the Estonian defense company Milrem Robotics. 
It has treads like a tank and can use a variety of weapons. Photos provided by the Dutch military show their UGVs outfitted with machine guns.

Reports The War Zone obtained reveal new details about swarming incidents off Southern California in 2019 and many more across the Pacific. 
The U.S. Navy has released 35 brief reports regarding various incidents involving its ships and facilities and unidentified small uncrewed aircraft systems, or sUASs, across the entire span of the Pacific between 2016 and 2021. Not all of the reports appear to be notable, and some are clearly innocuous, but others absolutely provide additional evidence of concerning trends that The War Zone has been actively reporting on in recent years. Among the newly released reports, for instance, is one that covers a worrying encounter that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton had with four drones in the Pacific off the coast of southern California in 2019, which you can read more about in our past reporting here.

WNU Editor: There definitely is something out there .... EXCLUSIVE: Dramatic videos of UFOs over the Pacific are revealed, as expert pilots describe seeing bright lights moving in &#x27;race track&#x27; circles over the summer - but say their employers told them to keep quiet (Daily Mail). 
The above Joe Rogan video is a must see. 
Former US F-18 Navy pilot Ryan Graves gives his account on UFO encounters. He gives a few details that are fascinating to listen to. That some of these UFOs are spherical in shape, translucent, and in the sphere is a grayish-black cube?!?!? They can travel at very high altitudes at mach .6 to .7.. They were spotted all the time. Had the capability to move in a &quot;race track&quot; circle (for 13 hours!!!!). But the big revelation (for me) is that they have the capability to stay stationary in one spot even at a high altitude where the winds are intense (130mph to 140mph).</span>

Space News: Space Force briefing on military space race catches Jeff Bezos’ attention 
WASHINGTON — U.S. Space Systems Command officials earlier this month gave an unclassified briefing to Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos on the power competition taking place in the space domain. 
Executives from the space company Blue Origin heard the briefing in September at a Space Systems Command industry meeting in Los Angeles. “The Blue Origin team was so impressed that they requested that SSC brief Jeff Bezos,” Col. Joseph Roth, the command’s director of innovation and prototyping, said Oct. 19 at the Space Industry Days conference hosted by AFCEA Los Angeles. 
The briefing was conducted by SMSgt. Ron Lerch, senior enlisted leader of Space Systems Command’s intelligence directorate.

More than half of all registered voters see the mainstream media as a threat to American democracy, according to a new poll. 
A New York Times-Siena College poll published Tuesday found 59 percent of voters view the media as a “major threat to democracy,” while 25 percent said the press is a “minor threat” and only 15 percent said it poses no threat. 
The divide fell sharply along partisan lines, with 87 percent of voters who supported former President Trump in 2020 indicating they view the media is a major threat, while 33 percent of Biden voters during that election cycle said the same thing.

Exactly two years ago, on October 19, 2020, one of the dirtiest tricks in electoral history was played on the American people by 51 former intelligence officials, who used the false alarm of “Russian interference” to stop Donald Trump winning a second term as president. 
Using the institutional weight of their former esteemed roles, they signed a dishonest letter to mislead voters 15 days before the election, claiming that material from Hunter Biden’s laptop published by the New York Post “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” 
In their expert opinion, “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”

Reuters: U.S. considering joint weapons production with Taiwan 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government is considering a plan to jointly produce weapons with Taiwan, a business lobby said on Wednesday, an initiative intended to speed up arms transfers to bolster Taipei&#x27;s deterrence against China. 
U.S. presidents have approved more than $20 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan since 2017 as China has ramped up military pressure on the democratically-governed island Beijing claims as its own territory. 
But Taiwan and the U.S. Congress have warned of delivery delays because of supply chain difficulties and backlogs caused by increased demand for some systems due to the war in Ukraine. 
&quot;It&#x27;s right at the beginning of the process,&quot; Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which counts numerous U.S. defense contractors as members, said of the plan.

                              <span>The Most Important News: The Food Crisis Of 2023 Is Going To Be Far Worse Than Most People Would Dare To Imagine 
I am trying to sound the alarm about this as loudly as I can.  The global food crisis just continues to intensify, and things are going to get really bad in 2023.  As you will see below, two-thirds of European fertilizer production has already been shut down, currency problems are causing massive headaches for poor nations that need to import food, global weather patterns continue to be completely crazy, and the bird flu is killing millions upon millions of chickens and turkeys all over the planet.  On top of everything else, the war in Ukraine is going to restrict the flow of agricultural and fertilizer exports from that part of the world for a long time to come, because there…</span>

High costs of living are driving people to protest in the streets against crippling prices. 
The BBC has mapped all reported demonstrations over fuel since January 2021, revealing a huge increase in protests this year.
Fuel costs affect many aspects of daily life - personal travel, transportation of goods, energy for electricity and heating.  Around the world demonstrators have called for change. 
They&#x27;ve demanded that petrol be made more affordable or available at all. 
They&#x27;ve sat in peaceful protests and they&#x27;ve attacked governments.  Some have paid an even higher price.

The Intercept: Saudis Sought Oil Production Cut So Deep It Surprised Even Russia  
OPEC+ slashed oil production following a Saudi pressure campaign that experts say aims to hurt Democrats in the midterms. 
The Saudi-led oil cartel OPEC+’s announcement earlier this month that it was cutting 2 million barrels of oil per day — a move that would drive up the price of oil just a month before midterm elections — rankled Democrats in Washington. They accused Riyadh of aligning itself with Russia, another powerful member of OPEC+, which would indeed profit off the move. “What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
But Saudi Arabia actually pushed to cut oil production twice as much as Russian President Vladimir Putin, surprising the Russians, two Saudi sources with knowledge of the negotiations told The Intercept, suggesting that Riyadh’s motives run deeper than what top Democrats want to admit. The sources requested anonymity, fearing reprisal by the Saudi government.

WNU Editor: I agree with the above analysis that the Saudis want to hurt the Democrats in the midterms, and it looks like they will succeed. 
Here is a prediction. If the US Democrats lose control of the Senate and House, they will blame the Saudis.

The commander of the Defense Department&#x27;s Central Command (CENTCOM) visited a nuclear submarine in international waters Wednesday in a possible move designed to send a message to adversaries in the region.

Daily Mail: Mystery of Russia&#x27;s &#x27;missing&#x27; nuclear tests: No sign of long-awaited drills amid claims Putin&#x27;s atomic plans are being &#x27;disrupted&#x27; from within with top brass &#x27;sabotaging plans to use nuclear weapons&#x27; 
* Russia was expected to carry out long-awaited &#x27;Grom&#x27; nuclear drills this week 
* Air alerts were put out over swathes of Arctic suggesting long-range missiles and potentially nuclear bombs were going to be tested 
* But so far there is no sign of drills taking place and alert areas have been silent 
* Russian professor has claimed Putin&#x27;s tests are being &#x27;disrupted&#x27; from within 
Mystery surrounds Russian nuclear tests that were expected to take this week and never materialised, amid claims they are being &#x27;disrupted&#x27; from within. 
Moscow typically carries out large-scale atomic drills dubbed &#x27;Grom&#x27; at this time of year and in recent days had issued a number of airspace alerts over its usual testing grounds - heavily suggesting they would be going ahead. 
But the US says it has received no alert from Moscow about any upcoming tests and there has been no official word from the Kremlin explaining their absence, with the air alerts due to expire Saturday.

Outgoing British prime minister Liz Truss resigned after just 44 days in office.

Speculation has already begun on who could replace her – with former finance minister Rishi Sunak and leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt two of the top contenders.

&quot;It&#x27;s something that he&#x27;ll definitely want to do,&quot; he told Sky News Australia.

&quot;He is the main candidate on the right.&quot;</span>

                              <span>In this November 3, 2017 photo released by China&#x27;s Xinhua news agency, President Xi Jinping (centre) visits the Central Military Commission (joint battle command centre in Beijing as part of an inspection tour.   
Wall Street Journal: China&#x27;s Military Is Catching Up to the U.S. Is It Ready for Battle?  
China’s military is emerging as a true competitor to the U.S. under Xi Jinping. 
The People’s Liberation Army now has hypersonic missiles that evade most defenses, a technology the U.S. is still developing. Its attack drones can swarm to paralyze communications networks. China’s naval ships outnumber America’s, and it launched its third aircraft carrier this summer, the first to be designed and built in the country. Its defense budget is second only to the U.S.’s. China’s military has more serving members, at around 2 million, compared with just under 1.4 million in the U.S. 
The question for Mr. Xi, which he has raised in public, is whether those forces are ready for battle. 
China hasn’t fought a war since a brief border clash with Vietnam in 1979. Unlike American forces, who have fought for most of the past two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan, China’s service members have virtually no combat experience—which some Chinese leaders have referred to as a “peace disease.” Finding a solution short of actual war has been a priority for Mr. Xi, especially as he seeks to prepare the country for a potential showdown with the U.S.

.... Mr. Xi’s ambition, according to China’s most recent defense white paper, is to complete a modernization of the military by 2035 and turn it into a “world-class force” by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party’s founding.</span>

   Antiwar.com: American Advisor to Ukraine Commander Thinks Russia Wants Talks to Return to ‘2014 Lines’  
Dan Rice says Ukraine won&#x27;t have it and wants Crimea and all of the Donbas  
Dan Rice, an American serving as an advisor to the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, told CNN’s Outfront on Tuesday that he believes Russia is looking to negotiate to return to positions it controlled before the February 24 invasion. 
Rice made the comments when discussing Russia’s strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure and outlining what weapons he thinks Ukraine needs. “They are attacking the cities, trying to attack the grid, making it a very difficult winter,” he said. “They are trying to, in my opinion, trying to get to the negotiating table, to try to go back to the 2014 lines.”

WASHINGTON — Iran has sent trainers to occupied Ukraine to help Russians overcome problems with the fleet of drones that they purchased from Tehran, according to current and former U.S. officials briefed on the classified intelligence, a further signal of the growing closeness between Iran and Russia since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The Iranian trainers are operating from a Russian military base in Crimea where many of the drones have been based since being delivered from Iran. The trainers are from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of the Iranian military designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.

Washington Post: U.S. has viewed wreckage of kamikaze drones Russia used in Ukraine 
The U.S. government has examined the wreckage of Iranian-made drones shot down in Ukraine, deepening its insight into the unmanned craft that Russia has launched in a spate of kamikaze attacks on the country’s critical infrastructure, according to two U.S. officials. 
Information about the drones’ structure and technology could prove crucial in helping the United States and its Ukrainian allies better identify and ultimately defeat them before they can reach their targets. Officials said the process has been used in the past to study weaponry deployed by Iran’s proxies in conflicts in the Middle East. People interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence collection.

Deadly clashes between police and demonstrators protesting at the military’s grip on power erupted in Chad on Thursday, claiming at least 50 lives, including members of the security forces. The United Nations condemned the lethal use of force against the protesters and demanded a probe be launched. 
Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in the capital N’Djamena and elsewhere to mark the date when the military had initially promised to hand over power—a period that has been extended for another two years.

Euractiv: Washington rejects Putin’s call to make Turkey Europe’s gas hub 
The US has reacted negatively to a proposal made by Russian President Vladimir Putin to turn Turkey into a gas hub for the EU. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently backed the Kremlin’s idea of creating an international gas hub in Turkey and urged his government on 14 October to quickly present implementation plans. 
“We have continued to urge our allies to take steps to diversify their energy sources, to reduce energy reliance on Russia. And in the case of Turkey, we are working with them closely to assist in their own efforts to enhance energy security in the long term,” US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Wednesday.

                              <span>German fintech N26, valued at $9 billion, has launched crypto trading on its mobile app.  Starting in Austria and rolling out to other countries in the coming months, N26 Crypto will allow its customers to buy and sell 200 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
The Berlin-based fintech announcement the October 20 launch in Austria responds to “strong local demand,” with 40% of N26 users actively trading or having expressed an interest in investing in cryptocurrencies.  N26 plans to roll out its crypto trading service to other key markets over the next 6 months. 
N26 customers with a verified identity can access N26 Crypto from the “Trading” section of the new “Finances” tab of their N26 app.  Thus, they can buy crypto from their fiat bank account.  Transaction fees are set at 1.5% for BTC and 2.5% for other currencies for regular accounts, with some additional discounts for N26 metal card holders.

According to N26 co-founder and co-CEO Valentin Stalf, the company sees its new product as an entry point for a new generation of investors, who are interested in digital assets despite recent market turmoil: 

“While cryptocurrencies have seen a decline in value over the past year, they remain a demanded and attractive asset class for investors and a growing part of the financial system.”

The platform is run in partnership with Vienna-based Bitpanda GmbH, which handles trade execution and coin custody. 
In November 2021, N26 announced its release of the American market and intends to focus exclusively on the European market.  However, the company has also encountered problems in Europe, with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) imposing the new customer cap on the company in May 2021.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Russia announced the evacuation of civilians from a key southern Ukrainian city Tuesday as it acknowledged the situation for its troops on the ground in Ukraine was &quot;tense&quot; in the face of a counter-offensive.
Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, scrambled to rebuild damaged energy facilities across the country following a series of deadly Russian strikes and President Volodymyr Zelensky charged that Moscow&#x27;s purported use of Iranian-made drones in the attacks highlighted its &quot;military and political bankruptcy&quot;.
Russian General Sergey Surovikin, who has been in charge of recent operations in Ukraine, said the army was preparing to evacuate civilians from the city of Kherson…</span>

The warning from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy is the first official signal that Kyiv could be facing a tougher fight for funding as it fends off Russia&#x27;s invasion, with bipartisan support beginning to wane in the United States.
&quot;I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they&#x27;re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won&#x27;t do it,&quot; McCarthy told online politics outlet Punchbowl News.
McCarthy hopes to become House speaker -- the third-most senior position in US politics behind the president and vice president -- if Republicans take over the House next …</span>

Tuesday&#x27;s strikes appeared to be aimed at Ukrainian power stations that Russian-guided suicide drones had failed to reach the previous day.
But the body of Tetyana&#x27;s 44-year-old son Oleksiy had been missing since his capture in Russia&#x27;s aborted assault on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war in March.
Tetyana never saw her son&#x27;s corpse after its discovery in a random field last month.
Her granddaughter decided it would be too much.
&quot;She wouldn&#x27;t let me see his interrogation video either,&quot; the grieving mother said.

                              <span>James Bond actor Daniel Craig on Tuesday received the same honor held by his fictional character, as he is set to retire from the role.
The 54-year-old British actor who played Bond for the fifth and final time in 2021 film &quot;No Time To Die&quot;, was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, a rare honor that author Ian Fleming bestowed on his fictional agent.
Craig bowed his head and smirked as Princess Anne, wearing naval uniform, put the order on its ribbon around his neck during an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The actor received the honor for his outstanding contribution to film and theatre.
Craig was in the British capital for the European premiere of whodunnit drama &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;, which closed the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been expecting you&quot;, the royal family&#x27;s official Twitter account captioned its photograph, quoting a line famously used by a Bond villain.
James Bond was said to have received the honor in his obituary in &quot;You Only Live Twice,&quot; Ian Fleming Publications tweeted.
It was not the first time Craig reprised his Bond role with the royal family in on the joke.
He donned a tuxedo to film a spoof clip with Queen Elizabeth II and her corgis for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Games Olympics hosted by London. .

Netanyahu, also commonly known as Bibi, is Israel&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, with a first term from 1996 to 1999 and an unprecedented 12-year stretch until 2021.
In &quot;Bibi: My Story&quot;, the 72-year-old politician said he will be &quot;forever grateful&quot; for the time in opposition that allowed him to complete his memoir, since a motley coalition of parties ousted him but failed to last its term.
Published just two weeks before Israelis go to the polls, the 650-page autobiography has not generated major headlines in Israel or abroad, lacking bombshell revelations offered in some politicians&#x27; memoirs…</span>

                              <span>President Jair Bolsonaro is prompting fears for Brazil’s democratic system by threatening to appoint new judges to the Supreme Court, the central institution to the country’s young democracy. Between the two presidential rounds, Bolsonaro is blowing hot and cold on the issue – making threats to galvanize his base, then backing down to reassure undecided voters. If re-elected, however, the far-right president could well find the numbers to make changes to the court.
The outcome of the bitter contest between Bolsonaro and social democratic ex-president Lula Inacio de Silva is hard to predict, ahead of the second round of Brazil’s presidential election on October 30.
After getting 48 percent of the vote in the first round on October 2, Lula started trying to reach out to evangelical Christian…</span>

The main suspect, identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders, was questioned earlier Monday alongside an older man suspected of sheltering her.
The 24-year-old has been charged with the rape and murder of a minor aged under 15 along with torture and abuse, the source said.
A judge ordered that she be held in provisional custody.
Prosecutors said in a press release Monday that under questioning, the woman made &quot;varying statements, switching between admitting and denying the facts of the case.&quot;
But she eventually said she had brought the girl -- identified only by her first name, Lola -- …</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from &quot;our enemy&quot;, a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament&#x27;s lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.
&quot;Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy,&quot; Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.
Russia uses the term &quot;special military operation&quot; to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.
The move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday&#x27;s session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.
They were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.
Another deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the &quot;special military operation&quot;. He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.
&quot;Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies,&quot; Svintsov said.

Schönbohm, who leads the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), has been under fire for his links to the Cyber Security Council Germany, which itself has been criticized for being too close to Russian intelligence circles.
Schönbohm helped set up the Cyber Security Council Germany 10 years ago.
The reported accusations against Schönbohm had &quot;permanently damaged the necessary trust of the public in the neutrality and impartiality of the leadership of the president of the most important German cybersecurity authority,&quot; the Interior Ministry said.</span>

PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, asking for higher salaries amid decades-high inflation and posing President Emmanuel Macron one of his stiffest challenges since his reelection in May.
The strike, which will primarily affect public sectors such as schools and transportation, is an extension of the weeks-long industrial action that has disrupted France&#x27;s major refineries and put petrol stations&#x27; supply in disarray.
Trade union leaders are hoping workers will be energized by the government&#x27;s decision to force some of them to go back to work at petrol depots to try and get the fuel flowing again, a move some say put in jeopardy the right to strike.

In the seventh episode, she&#x27;s fighting with her former friend/current stepdaughter Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D&#x27;Arcy), and eventually slices open Rhaenyra&#x27;s arm with a knife. The ostensible source of Alicent&#x27;s outrage is that Rhaenyra&#x27;s son took our her son&#x27;s eye in an otherwise childish brawl. But the rant exposes her deeper motive: plain old envy.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Russian missile struck an apartment building in the Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv early on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said, the latest strike on a city hours after the United States warned that it would hold Russia accountable for war crimes.
The missile, which caused one of three explosions heard in the southern city in the early hours of Tuesday, completely destroyed one wing of the building in the downtown area, leaving a massive crater.
A fire crew pulled the dead body of a man from the rubble, the witness said.
Monday brought Russian strikes on the capital Kyiv and other cities in which at least four people were killed, the second wave of air strikes in a week.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Moscow on Monday stepped up attacks across Ukraine, cutting electricity and killing eight people, including in kamikaze drone strikes on the capital, as a Russian warplane crashed near the border.
The plane struck a residential area of Yeysk, a town in southwestern Russia, according to Russian authorities.
Health minister Mikhail Murashko said three people had died and 19 were injured, Russia&#x27;s state-run TASS news agency reported, revising an earlier toll of six dead given by the ministry of emergency situations.

The candidate running for governor of Sao Paulo, Tarcisio Freitas, said the incident appeared unrelated to his campaign. There were no initial signs of political motives.
Officials said the man was killed near the event in the city&#x27;s Paraisopolis neighborhood, but gave no further details on his identity.

(Reuters) - The United States and Mexico said on Monday they will seek support from the United Nations for a security mission to restore order in Haiti amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, but did not identify who would lead the mission.
Haiti is facing dire shortages of basic goods and a paralysis of economic activity due to the blockade of a fuel terminal by gangs, which has halted transport and left many without food or clean drinking water amid an outbreak of cholera.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month suggested sending in a &quot;rapid-action force,&quot; according to a letter seen by Reuters.

                              <span>During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. 
The Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. 
“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”
The official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”
The FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn&#x27;t visit them personally. 
&quot;The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”
“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.”

                              <span>The United States said Monday that it had confidence in Pakistan&#x27;s ability to control its nuclear arsenal after President Joe Biden expressed alarm, leading Islamabad to summon the US ambassador.
&quot;The United States is confident of Pakistan&#x27;s commitment and its ability to secure its nuclear assets,&quot; State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
&quot;The US has always viewed a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests and, more broadly, the US values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan,&quot; he said.
Biden made the off-the-cuff remarks on Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program Thursday while at a private Democratic Party fundraiser in California where he began to discuss challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China, a close ally of Pakistan.
&quot;And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion,&quot; Biden said, according to a White House transcript.
Pakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a &quot;responsible nuclear state&quot; and that it takes safety measures &quot;with the utmost seriousness.&quot;
US officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden&#x27;s remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.
But Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.
Patel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.
&quot;This is a relationship we view as important and it&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re going to continue to remain deeply engaged in,&quot; he said.</span>

                              <span>Netflix on Monday defended its latest series of &quot;The Crown&quot; after former British prime minister John Major lashed out at a story line showing King Charles plotting to oust the late queen.
Major&#x27;s tenure as prime minister from 1990-1997 covered a turbulent period for the royals that included the divorce of Charles and his wife Princess Diana.
But reported scenes in the fifth series -- defended by streaming giant Netflix as a &quot;fictionalized dramatization&quot; -- have incensed the former premier.
In one scene, heir to the throne Charles attempts to draw Major into a conspiracy to force the abdication of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.
A statement issued by Major&#x27;s office castigated Netflix for the scenes describing them as &quot;damaging and malicious fiction&quot;.

                              <span>Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.
In an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned &quot;peace plan&quot; between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine&#x27;s continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.
&quot;This is a classic Putin play,&quot; she said of Musk&#x27;s recent attempts to interject himself as a &quot;peacemaker&quot; between Russia and Ukraine. &quot;Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.&quot;
Hill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.

&quot;He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process,&quot; she explained. &quot;He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.&quot;

Possible charges include the rape and murder of a minor aged below 15 along with torture, abuse and concealing a body, a source in the French judiciary told AFP, adding that prosecutors had ordered two people held in provisional custody.
The main suspect has been identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders.
She was arrested on Saturday in Bois-Colombes in Paris&#x27; northwestern suburbs, after being spotted on CCTV images from the block of flats home to the young victim, identified only by her first name, Lola.
An eyewitness who also saw her at the scene said that she had offered him money to help her move a …</span>

Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv shortly before the first explosion at around 6:35 am (0335), followed by sirens across most of the country.
&quot;The capital was attacked by kamikaze drones,&quot; the president&#x27;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.
&quot;The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation,&quot; he added.
&quot;We need more air defense systems and as soon as possible. More weapons to defend the sky and destroy the enemy.&quot;

But few were prepared for the scale of the sound and fury – least of all Truss herself.
In just six weeks, the prime minister’s libertarian economic policies have triggered a financial crisis, emergency central bank intervention, multiple U-turns and the firing of her Treasury chief.
Now Truss faces a mutiny inside the governing Conservative Party that leaves her leadership hanging by a thread.
Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon fumed on Sunday that the last few weeks had brought “one horror story after another.”

                              <span>President Joe Biden has &quot;no plans&quot; to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at an upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday. 
Stormy US-Saudi relations have seen new strain over Riyadh&#x27;s recent support for oil production cuts, with Biden warning of unspecified &quot;consequences.&quot;
The move last week by OPEC+ -- composed of the Riyadh-led OPEC cartel and an additional group of 10 exporters headed by Russia -- would reduce global output by up to two million barrels per day from November.

                              <span>Far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva traded jabs and insults as they squared off Sunday in their first-ever head-to-head debate, two weeks from Brazil&#x27;s presidential runoff election.
Lula attacked Bolsonaro as the &quot;king of fake news,&quot; drawing accusations of lying, corruption and a &quot;disgraceful&quot; record in return, as the rivals sparred in the first debate for their polarizing second-round showdown on October 30.
Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-president (2003-2010) who is seeking a comeback at 76, was particularly fiery criticizing Bolsonaro over his handling of Covid-19, which has killed 687,000 people in Brazil, second only to the United States.

Near the southern border with Equatorial Guinea, eight villages have registered complaints with the Campo Ma&#x27;an national park, a vast area of virgin forest from where the animals emerge.
An estimated 500 gorillas and more than 200 elephants -- both endangered species -- roam the reserve&#x27;s 264,000 hectares (652,000 acres).
