                              <span>Reuters: Blinken Warns Against Peace Efforts That Would Reward Russian Aggression 
HELSINKI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday warned against any peace initiatives that could help legitimize Russia&#x27;s seizure of Ukrainian territory, saying a &quot;just and durable&quot; peace effort should address accountability and reconstruction. 
Delivering what U.S. officials described as a highlight speech that lays out Washington&#x27;s view of 16 months of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Blinken said over the coming weeks and months some countries were likely to call for a ceasefire. 
But for any peace effort to be lasting, he laid out, it requires Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;full participation and assent&quot; and should support Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction and recovery, with Moscow paying its share, Blinken said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China&#x27;s military rebuked the United States and Canada for &quot;deliberately provoking risk&quot; after the countries&#x27; navies staged a rare joint sailing through the sensitive Taiwan Strait. 
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s 7th Fleet said the guided-missile destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and Canada&#x27;s HMCS Montreal conducted a &quot;routine&quot; transit of the strait on Saturday &quot;through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law&quot;. 
&quot;Chung-Hoon and Montreal&#x27;s bilateral transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the commitment of the United States and our allies and partners to a free and open Indo-Pacific,&quot; it said in a statement. 
The Eastern Theatre Command of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army said its forces monitored the ships throughout and &quot;handled&quot; the situation in accordance with the law and regulations.

Two members of the security forces were among those killed in some of the deadliest protests in the western African nation in recent decades.

China&#x27;s defence minister said on Sunday that conflict with the United States would be an &quot;unbearable disaster&quot; and his country seeks dialogue over confrontation, despite refusing American demands for military-to-military talks. 
 Speaking at Asia&#x27;s top security summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue, dressed in the uniform of a general in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, General Li Shangfu said the world was big enough for China and the US to grow together. 
&quot;China and the US have different systems and are different in many other ways,&quot; he said in a speech that marked his first significant international address since he was named China&#x27;s Minister of National Defence in March.

CNN: These may be the world’s best warships. And they’re not American 
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — It’s a growing problem that has United States naval commanders scratching their heads: How to keep up with China’s ever-expanding fleet of warships. 
Not only is China’s navy already the world’s largest, its numerical lead over the US is getting wider, with the head of the US Navy warning recently that American shipyards simply can’t keep up. Some experts estimate China can build three warships in the time it takes the US to build one. 
It is just one of the concerns, alongside Beijing’s increasing aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, that’s likely to be weighing on the mind of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as he joins top military figures from across the region at this weekend’s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.

Washington Post: Use of NATO arms for attack in Russia raises doubts about Kyiv’s controls 
The Russian fighters aligned against Moscow who launched a cross-border raid from Ukraine into the Belgorod region of Russia last week used at least four tactical vehicles originally given to Ukraine by the United States and Poland, U.S. officials said, raising questions about the unintended use of NATO-provided equipment and Kyiv’s commitments to secure materiel supplied by its supporters.
Three of the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, also known as MRAPs, taken into Russia by the fighters were provided by the United States and the fourth was from Poland, according to people familiar with the U.S. intelligence finding, which has not previously been reported. Those people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.

WNU Editor: So much for Ukraine President Zelensky&#x27;s public promise to US President Biden that the weapons that have been given to them will not be used to launch attacks Russia itself. No one believed this promise then, and no one should be surprised now. 
The simple fact is that Ukraine is now awash with Western weapons. They have no control on what many of their armed groups and militias are doing right now, and in fact they do not care as long as they are used against Russia. 
The US and other Western governments also do not care. Their focus and priority in this war is to defeat Russia, even if it means their weapons are being used to launch attacks against the territory of Russia.</span>

‘How many lives is one sentence at the Vilnius summit worth?’ Ukraine president asks in Wall Street Journal interview. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doubled down on Kyiv’s push to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ahead of NATO’s next summit in Vilnius this summer. 
“If we are not acknowledged and given a signal in Vilnius, I believe there is no point for Ukraine to be at this summit,” the Ukrainian president told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Saturday. 
“We understand that we will not be in NATO or in any powerful security alliance during this war. But tell me, how many [Ukrainian] lives is one sentence at the Vilnius summit worth?” Zelenskyy said, adding he “honestly [did] not know” if he would receive such a signal.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says his country is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive to liberate territory occupied by Russian forces while warning that it could take some time and be costly. 
 &quot;We strongly believe that we will succeed,” Zelenskiy said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on June 3. 
&quot;I don’t know how long it will take. To be honest, it can go a variety of ways, completely different. But we are going to do it, and we are ready,” he added.

Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian Army had not received &quot;all the weapons it hoped for, but we can&#x27;t wait any longer.&quot;

DW: Germany&#x27;s far-right AfD sees poll numbers surging 
Polls see Germany&#x27;s center-left coalition government in free fall while the far-right populist AfD is reaping the benefits. It currently polls on par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x27;s Social Democrats. 
Never before have voters in Germany been this unhappy with the current coalition government: Only one in five says they are doing a good job. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are plummeting in the polls, after only one and a half years in office. 
This is according to pollster infratest-dimap who surveyed 1300 eligible voters on May 30 and 31, 2023, and published the results in its monthly &quot;Deutschlandtrend.&quot; 
The far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the main beneficiary. Its approval ratings have gone up by another 2% since May and, if elections were held now, would win 18% nationwide putting them on a par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x27;s SPD. In several eastern states, the AfD has long been the strongest party.

Update #2: German far right surges in polls, alarming mainstream parties (Euronews)

 
WNU Editor: In my lifetime I have never seen a German government this incompetent AND dangerous. 
After only one and a half years in office, Germany has lost its source of stable and cheap energy. Its economy, once the envy of the world, is now in a recession. There is no leadership or direction from the Chancellor&#x27;s office. And to top it all off, the country is now involved in a war against Russia.
The AfD may be a far-right populist party. But they, and other opposition parties, in the eys of many Germans are looking very good right now.</span>

Mr Marles said Australia’s communication with China proves it is possible to “walk and chew gum at the same time”. 

“We want to work with China where we can, we will disagree with China where we must – that has really been the mantra of how we have sought to manage the relationship,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

Reuters: Berlin calls on China to stop enlisting former German military pilots 
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius on Saturday called on China to stop enlisting former German military pilots for the training of its own forces. 
&quot;I have made it clear that I expect this policy to be stopped immediately,&quot; German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters after meeting his Chinese counterpart at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Asia&#x27;s most important security conference. 
He added the Chinese defence minister had not denied the practice of hiring former German military pilots, but played down its significance. 
Pistorius did not give any further details in a recording of his comments that was distributed by the defence ministry in Berlin.

                              <span>USNI News: Report: Chinese Warship Harasses U.S. Destroyer in Taiwan Strait Transit 
A People’s Liberation Army Navy warship cut across the bow of a U.S. guided-missile destroyer on Saturday while it was transiting the Taiwan Strait, according to a report from embarked journalists. 
USS Chung-Hoon (DDG-93) and HMCS Montreal (FFH-336) were transiting the strait when a PLAN warship cut across the bow of Chung-Hoon, according to a report from Canadian outlet Global News. 
According to their report, a Chinese warship made a course to cut across the bow of the American destroyer and were advised over radio by the U.S. crew to alter course to avoid a collision. Montreal’s commander, Capt. Paul Mountford, called the move unprofessional. The Chinese warship came within a 150 yards of the U.S. ship. 
Mountford told Global News the incident was ”clearly instigated by the Chinese.”

                              <span>SCMP: CIA Director William Burns made secret visit to China, reports say 
William Burns, the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, reportedly travelled to Beijing last month to meet with Chinese intelligence officials, another in a series of high-level bilateral engagements that resumed following a freeze in communications earlier this year. 
Financial Times and Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar, that Burns had made the trip - his first to Beijing since he became head of the agency in 2021 - as part of efforts to keep open channels between the two countries&#x27; intelligence communities. 
On Friday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby referred questions about Burns&#x27; trip to the CIA, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                              <span>CNN: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as he criticizes China at Shangri-La security summit 
Singapore CNN  — A war over Taiwan would be “devastating” and affect the global economy “in ways we cannot imagine,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has warned, as he underlined US support for the island democracy. 
“Conflict is neither imminent nor inevitable. Deterrence is strong today – and it’s our job to keep it that way,” Austin said in remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit on Saturday, which is being attended by representatives from dozens of countries including China. 
“The whole world has a stake in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The security of commercial shipping lanes and global supply chains depends on it. And so does freedom of navigation worldwide. Make no mistake: conflict in the Taiwan Strait would be devastating.”

The Guardian/AFP: Taiwan hails ‘comprehensive’ trade deal with US as China issues warning

 
Agreement designed to deepen economic ties ‘signals a new beginning’, says Taiwan cabinet spokesperson 
The United States and Taiwan have signed a trade deal aimed at deepening economic relations between both sides – in a move that has sparked a warning from Beijing. 
Taiwan’s government has described the deal as “the most comprehensive” trade agreement signed with Washington since 1979. 
The pact is “intended to strengthen and deepen the economic and trade relationship” between both sides, Sam Michel, a spokesperson at the US Trade Representative press office said in a statement on Thursday.

Germany reacts to Moscow’s decision to limit the number of German officials in Russia to 350. 
BERLIN — Germany is revoking the licenses of four of the five Russian consulates in the country, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday. 
Moscow has been asked to “promptly arrange for the liquidation of the four consulates general in the Federal Republic of Germany and complete it by Dec. 31, 2023, at the latest,” according to the foreign ministry. 
The move is intended to create “structural and personnel parity” between the two countries, the ministry added.

Germany and Russia have repeatedly expelled each other’s diplomats since the start of the Russian war on Ukraine.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would send troops to help expel Russia from the breakaway Moldovan republic of Transnistria – if asked to by the Moldovan government. 
However, he said no such request had been made and emphasised Ukraine has no territorial claims over the pro-Russian territory. 
It comes as US secretary of state Antony Blinken said there could be no ceasefire in the war in Ukraine unless it was part of a “just and lasting” peace deal that includes Russia’s military withdrawal.

Replacing outdated radar technology will enhance the B-52&#x27;s navigation, targeting, and situational awareness capabilities, ensuring its effectiveness in higher-threat environments. 
The US Air Force’s B-52 radar modernisation program takes a step forward as a B-52 from the 307th Bomb Wing arrives at a Boeing facility in San Antonio to receive the Active Electronically Scanned Array system (AESA). 
The US Air Force commenced its program by welcoming a B-52 bomber from the 307th Bomb Wing to a Boeing Co. facility in San Antonio on May 25. This deployment aims to equip the aircraft with the AESA.

(Bloomberg) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban dug in his heels over crucial European Union aid to Ukraine, offering sympathy for his neighbor but nothing more to help it fight off Russia’s invasion. 
Speaking in a Bloomberg interview at the Qatar Economic Forum, Orban argued that Ukraine’s military effort is doomed and sending further aid will only lead to more deaths. 
“Emotionally it’s tragic, all of our hearts are with the Ukrainians,” Orban, 59, told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait on Tuesday. “But I’m talking as a politician who should save lives.” 
“There’s no chance to win this war,” he added.

Reuters: BRICS meet with &#x27;friends&#x27; seeking closer ties amid push to expand bloc 
CAPE TOWN, June 2 (Reuters) - Senior officials from more than a dozen countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, were in talks on forging closer links with the BRICS bloc of major emerging economies on Friday as it met to deepen ties and position itself as a counterweight to the West. 
BRICS, which now consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is considering expanding its membership, and a growing number of countries have expressed interest in joining. 
Once viewed as a loose association of disparate emerging economies, BRICS has in recent years taken more concrete shape, driven initially by China and, since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022, with added impetus from Russia. 
In remarks opening Friday&#x27;s discussions, host South Africa&#x27;s Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor spoke of the bloc as a champion of the developing world, which she said was abandoned by wealthy states and global institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                              <span>Incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has won Turkey&#x27;s run-off presidential vote for another five-year term, Supreme Election Board (YSK) head Ahmet Yener said on Sunday.
Erdoğan received 52.14% of the votes, Yener said.
His rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%, according to the preliminary results, Yener added.
Erdoğan can now remain in his seat for another five years and for a third time. The 69-year-old became prime minister in 2003. The parliament voted him as president in 2014.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turks vote on Sunday in a presidential runoff that could see Tayyip Erdogan extend his rule into a third decade and intensify Turkey&#x27;s increasingly authoritarian path, muscular foreign policy and unorthodox economic governance.
Erdogan, 69, defied opinion polls and came out comfortably ahead with an almost five-point lead over his rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the first round on May 14. But he fell just short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff, in a race with profound consequences for Turkey itself and global geopolitics.
His unexpectedly strong showing amid a deep cost of living crisis, and a win in parliamentary elections for a coalition of his conservative Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), the nationalist MHP and others, buoyed the vetera…</span>

His costume — complete with a long black jacket, gloves, and a red armband adorned with hammers, rather than the Nazi swastika — shocked fans and sparked outrage across the internet. “The elements ...</span>

Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday blamed Kosovo, the United States and European Union for escalating tensions in the Balkans and said it was watching with concern after violent clashes between Kosovan police and protesters opposed to ethnic Albanian mayors.
The United States and allies on Friday rebuked Kosovo, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas undermined efforts to improve troubled relations with neighbouring Serbia. NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.
The clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.
&quot;We decisively condemn Pristina&#x27;s provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,&quot; Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
&quot;The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,&quot; she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by &quot;Western mediators&quot; had come too late.
Serbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, and Moscow has blocked the country&#x27;s bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.

                              <span>As financial belt tightening and layoffs rippled throughout the tech industry in recent months, fact checkers and researchers who were tasked with keeping disinformation and extremism off of social media platforms are becoming scarce, CNBC reported. 
&quot;The cuts come at a time of increased cyberbullying, which has been linked to higher rates of adolescent self-harm, and as the spread of misinformation and violent content collides with the exploding use of artificial intelligence,&quot; the report stated. 
In a mass effort to boost productivity with less overhead, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have all slashed thousands of jobs.
In an example of just how far tech companies are willing to go to cut costs, departments tasked with trust and safety and AI ethics have been slashed as well.

&quot;Twitter effectively disbanded its ethical AI team in November and laid off all but one of its members, along with 15% of its trust and safety department, according to reports. In February, Google cut about one-third of a unit that aims to protect society from misinformation, radicalization, toxicity and censorship,&quot; says CNBC. &quot;Meta reportedly ended the contracts of about 200 content moderators in early January. It also laid off at least 16 members of Instagram’s well-being group and more than 100 positions related to trust, integrity and responsibility, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.&quot;

It was unclear who the pope had been expected to meet with, as his agenda was not made public on Friday, as is customary.
Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin blamed the pontiff&#x27;s busy schedule, saying he was tired.
&quot;The pope was tired, yesterday he had a very busy day, he saw a lot of people .. he wanted to say hello to them all,&quot; said Parolin, according to Italian news agencies.
&quot;And probably at a certain point the resistence breaks down.&quot;
Francis had eight meetings Thursday, according to his published schedule.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
