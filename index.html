                              <span>Tensions between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hezbollah are at their highest level in years.

Both states believe the other is interfering with their territory.

Israel and Lebanon don’t have an agreed border but the United Nations patrols the boundary between the countries, known as the Blue Line.

The Israeli Defence Forces argue Hezbollah placing their yellow flag inside the military buffer zone and building lookout posts around 100 yards away is a violation of the agreement with the UN.

Israel is currently divided by government plans to overhaul its judicial system and one theory is Hezbollah sees this as an opportunity to test Israel.

Lebanon has also accused Israel of regularly flying through its airspace without permission to bomb Iranian targets in neighbouring Syria.</span>

                              <span>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that would have prevented heavy-duty driverless trucks from operating in the state. The bill, which required a human driver to be present in autonomous vehicles weighing over 10,001 pounds, was passed by a majority in both houses of the state legislature. However, Newsom stated that the bill was unnecessary given the existing regulatory framework governing autonomous technology.</span>

                              <span>The Nevada Republican Party has approved rules for their presidential caucus that many believe are designed to benefit former President Donald Trump. The rules would prevent candidates from participating in the caucus if they participate in the state-run primary two days earlier, and would also restrict super PACs from supporting candidates in the caucus. The move reflects Trump&#x27;s influence on state parties and his frontrunner status in Nevada.</span>

The jail had restaurants, bars and even outdoor swimming pools, among other luxuries, and it was the operating center for feared criminal gang Tren de Aragua, according to Venezuela&#x27;s government.</span>

The mission, a collaboration between NASA and the University of Arizona, aims to bring back the largest asteroid sample ever returned to Earth. The sample was collected from the carbon-rich asteroid Bennu, which has a small chance of striking Earth in the late 22nd century. The spacecraft spent nearly two years orbiting the asteroid before successfully collecting the sample in October 2020.</span>

Xi, who has not visited South Korea since 2014, held talks with Han in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou before the opening ceremony of the Asian Games on Saturday.</span>

Indian and Chinese immigrants account for 6% each of total immigration, with the number of Indians increasing by 4.8% and Chinese immigrants increasing by nearly 3%. While Mexicans still have the highest number of immigrants, there was a slight decrease from the previous year. The increase in immigrants from Afghanistan and Venezuela was significant due to asylum seekers and refugees. Experts argue that the increase in immigrant population is relatively low and necessary to address demographic and workforce challenges.</span>

Daily Mail: Is the world running out of patience with Zelensky&#x27;s &#x27;blank cheque&#x27; demands? Poland stops giving arms and US gives a fraction of what Ukraine&#x27;s leader asked for as he visits Canada today to win support 
* Zelensky landed in the capital Ottawa late Thursday and will address parliament 
* It comes after Biden offered more weapons but refused to give ATACMS missiles 
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa today as he scrambles to rally more international support for his troops fighting Russia. 
Mr Zelensky landed in the capital late on Thursday, and will today have talks with Mr Trudeau before addressing the Canadian parliament. 
The Ukrainian leader will hope for a positive outcome after a difficult visit to Washington, where US president Joe Biden offered warm words of support and weapons - but rejected a request for longer range ATACMS missiles.

WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland&#x27;s prime minister told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday not to &quot;insult&quot; Poles, maintaining harsh rhetoric towards Kyiv after the Polish president had sought to defuse a simmering row over grain imports.
Poland decided last week to extend a ban on Ukrainian grain imports, shaking Kyiv&#x27;s relationship with a neighbour that has been seen as one of its staunchest allies since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year.

He addressed a joint meeting of the Canadian Parliament Friday following meetings in the United States, where he appealed for more weapons and rebuked Russia before the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. 
&quot;Life and justice must prevail,&quot; Zelenskyy told the House of Commons in a speech that received at least a dozen standing ovations.

                              <span>NBC News: Biden tells Zelenskyy that U.S. will send Ukraine ATACMS long-range missiles

 
Some in Washington had resisted supplying the weapons system, known as “attack-ems,” out of fear that it would widen the war with Russia. 
President Joe Biden has told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the United States will provide a small number of long-range missiles to aid the war with Russia, three U.S. officials and a congressional official familiar with the discussions told NBC News on Friday. 
The officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, did not say when the missiles would be delivered or when a public announcement would be made. 
For months, Ukraine has asked for the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which would give Kyiv the ability to strike targets from as far away as about 180 miles, hitting supply lines, railways, and command and control locations behind the Russian front lines.

 By all accounts, Zelensky came away from his Washington visit with nothing new. Biden did announce a fresh $325 million aid package for Ukraine from already committed funds, but the hoped-for long range missile approval never came (however, more cluster bombs are being sent). And as we detailed Thursday, House Republican leadership once again failed to move forward on a mere procedural vote for the Pentagon funding bill, due in large part to GOP members rejecting Biden&#x27;s proposed $24 billion more in Ukraine aid.

The crowd gathered in the city&#x27;s Hyde Park railed against the proposal, which if it passes on October 14, would give Indigenous peoples the right to be consulted on policies that affect them, a measure dubbed the Voice.
&quot;I&#x27;m here because I believe that everyone should be voting no. This Voice is causing so much division in the whole of Australia. And we don&#x27;t need it,&quot; Faye Bevan, who attended the rally, told AFP.
Some protesters held signs with slogans such as &quot;Vote no to the Voice of division&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t trust the Voice, I&#x27;m voting no&quot;. Others carried placards referring to a range of conspiracy ideas, such as about human …</span>

                              <span>A fire at a golf ball factory in Taiwan killed at least six people, three of them firefighters who died in an explosion, authorities said Saturday.
The fire, which began Friday evening and raged all night, injured more than 100 people, most of them workers, the Pingtung county government told local media.
One firefighter and three other people are missing.
Taiwan&#x27;s President Tsai Ing-wen visited the scene on Saturday morning and expressed condolences to the victims&#x27; families. She said an investigation into the cause of the tragedy is underway.
&quot;I want to thank everyone for their hard work and please stay safe,&quot; Tsai told emergency response personnel.
She also stopped at the morgue to pay respects to the victims and visited the injured at a hospital.
An official with the Pingtung Fire Department told local media that chemical peroxide stored inside the factory could have been the cause of the one large and several smaller explosions.
Several people were trapped inside due to the blasts, which caused a section of the factory roof to collapse.</span>

                              <span>Pope Francis on Saturday hammered home his message that European governments must do more to care for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, saying &quot;those who risk their lives at sea do not invade, they look for welcome&quot;.
Closing a meeting of bishops and young people from around the Mediterranean in French port city Marseille, he added that migration is &quot;a reality of our times, a process that involves three continents around the Mediterranean and that must be governed with wise foresight, including a European response&quot;.
The pope&#x27;s remarks -- given in front of President Emmanuel Macron, whose government plans tougher measures to control migration -- follow his insistence on arrival in France Friday that &quot;people who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued&quot;.
The way Europe addresses large numbers of arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa has shot up the political agenda since last week, when thousands of people landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa over just a few days.
The pope also appeared to weigh in on French domestic politics, targeting two of Macron&#x27;s projects in assisted dying and inscribing the right to abortion in the constitution.
Old people risk being &quot;pushed aside, under the false pretences of a supposedly dignified and &#x27;sweet&#x27; death that is more &#x27;salty&#x27; than the waters of the sea,&quot; Francis warned.
He also spoke of &quot;unborn children, rejected in the name of a false right to progress, which is instead a retreat into the selfish needs of the individual&quot;.</span>

The hawkish prime minister said that alarm over Tehran&#x27;s clerical leaders was driving Israel closer to the Arab world, with his government on the &quot;cusp&quot; of a historic breakthrough with Saudi Arabia.
Netanyahu, who has repeatedly used the UN stage to issue dark warnings about Tehran, briefly gave pause at the General Assembly when he appeared to threaten nuclear attack if Tehran pursues its own atomic bomb.
&quot;Above all -- above all -- Iran must face a credible nuclear threat. As long as I&#x27;m prime minister of Israel, I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,&quot; Netanyahu said.

                              <span>Donald Trump is taking advantage of the “weakness” in his opposing field, says UC Irvine Professor of Political Science Louis Desipio.

His comments come as the former US president campaigns for the 2024 presidential election.

“He’s not even campaigning very hard at this point which is a pretty dramatic statement,” Professor Desipio told Sky News Australia.

“There will be another Republican presidential debate coming up and that will give an opportunity for somebody to lead the pack.

“I don’t have high hopes that any of them will be able to do that much better than they did in the first presidential debate.”</span>

                              <span>The deadlock between the House Republicans is representative of the “failure” of the US government, says UC Irvine Professor of Political Science Louis Desipio.

His comments come amid fears a government shutdown is looming.

“Usually these shutdown controversies are when one party has one view and another party has another view,” Professor Desipio told Sky News Australia.

He said this time it is because a small far-right group within the Republican party are rejecting anything their leader Kevin McCarthy proposes.

“I think in the short term at least, it bodes pretty ill for the likelihood that the United States government will be open a week from Monday. “</span>

The 58-year-old patient, who was ineligible for a traditional heart transplant, showed positive signs of recovery just two days after the surgery. The transplant was carried out by the same team that performed the world&#x27;s first genetically modified pig heart transplant last year.</span>

                              <span>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly on Friday that Israel is “at the cusp” of a historic breakthrough leading to a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia, without outlining a clear path over the significant obstacles facing such an accord.
He struck an optimistic tone throughout his roughly 25-minute address — and, once again, used a visual aid. He displayed contrasting maps showing Israel&#x27;s isolation at the time of its creation in 1948 and the six countries that have normalized relations with it, including four that did so in 2020 in the so-called Abraham Accords.
“There’s no question the Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are at the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough, an historic peace between Israel and …</span>

On his return to London, he was quizzed about remarks made several days ago, which largely went unnoticed at the time.
At a centre-left forum in Montreal, he declared that he did not want to &quot;diverge&quot; from European Union rules, sparking reaction from heavyweights in the ruling Tory party.

The Ukrainian army claimed responsibility for the strike, saying it took place at around 0900 GMT.
Ukraine has targeted Crimea throughout Russia&#x27;s offensive but attacks on military installations there have recently intensified as Kyiv vows to recapture the peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.
&quot;The headquarters of the fleet have been hit in an enemy missile attack,&quot; Mikhail Razvozhayev, the governor of Crimea&#x27;s largest city Sevastopol, said on social media.
Razvozhayev said that missile fragments had fallen near a theatre and urged residents to stay clear of the site.

Indigenous leaders in bright feather headdresses and body paint exploded in celebration outside the high court building in Brasilia as Justice Luiz Fux became the sixth on the 11-member court to side with the native plaintiffs in the landmark case, giving them victory.
The judges voted one by one and in the end, the tally was a 9-2 win for Indigenous people opposed to the restriction.

Then it went up in flames, allegedly torched by land-grabbers trying to reclaim the territory for cattle pasture.
Launched in 2019 by environmental research group Rioterra, the reforestation project took 270 hectares (665 acres) of forest that had been razed by cattle ranching on a protected nature reserve in the northern state of Rondonia and replanted it with 360,000 trees.
The idea was ambitious, says Rioterra&#x27;s project coordinator, Alexis Bastos: save a corner of the world&#x27;s biggest rainforest, fighting climate change and creating green jobs along the way.

                              <span>Fentanyl addiction is a scourge that&#x27;s sweeping the United States. This dangerous synthetic opioid, 50 times stronger than heroin, is exported from Mexico by drug cartels. With fentanyl, the cartels no longer needed to grow opium or rely on rural communities to produce it. Fentanyl is lightweight, discreet and easy to produce and transport. It can be passed off as a harmless pill, which explains the high number of deaths from overdoses. Just one fentanyl tablet can kill – and it&#x27;s doing so increasingly frequently around the American continent. FRANCE 24&#x27;s Laurence Cuvillier and Matthieu Comin report.</span>

“The Team Room” follows a fictional Special Forces ODA that deploys in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
 Green Beret veteran-turned-writer Bill Raskin has his first play premiering in Washington, DC, October 7-28 at The Keegan Theatre! “The Team Room” follows a fictional Special Forces ODA that deploys in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The production is running on a non-profit basis, and net proceeds will go the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. This non-profit mission has benefitted greatly from other SOF and SOF family leaders, including MG(Ret) Jim Linder and a cohort of retired SF NCOs who have mentored and advised our team of actors. Learn more and purchase tickets at the website below! Bill also welcomes any direct questions or outreach at chair@teamroomfoundation.org https://teamroomfoundation.org

                              <span>Donald Trump&#x27;s purported comments about not wanting &quot;to see&quot; a severely wounded veteran have ignited conservative pundits and experts alike who say the former president crossed a line.
Trump, who is said to have snarled about seeing a severely wounded veteran sing at an event held during his presidency at a military base, is now being called out on his alleged comments by Gen. Mark Milley.
Now, other conservatives are joining Milley in criticizing the former president.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Retired Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe said the incident reminds him &quot;of the time Trump mocked a reporter with a physical disability and a speech impediment.&quot;
&quot;Or when he dissed Senator McCain for having been captured in war and having endured torture,&quot; Tribe added. &quot;Who revels in such cruelty? The Man Who Would Be King, that&#x27;s who. No thank you!&quot;
Conservative attorney and anti-Trump activist George Conway answered Tribe&#x27;s question, saying, &quot;Who is such a person? A malignant narcissist—a soulless, conscienceless, and morally bereft individual relentlessly driven by pathological levels of narcissism, sociopathy, sadism, and Machiavellinism.&quot;
In a separate post, Conway wrote, &quot;There is no nice way to put it. P01135809 is pure scum,&quot; referring to Trump&#x27;s assigned booking number from his recent arrest in Georgia.
Former GOP campaign consultant Rick Wilson also said, &quot;Trump&#x27;s loathing for an injured war hero speaks more volumes about his low, repulsive character than almost any of the other stories of his public or private behavior. I&#x27;ve read damn near every account of his degenerate, foul life, and this one still shocks.&quot;
Former Trump supporter David Weissman on Thursday added, &quot;Trump continues to show his distain of American war heroes. This two time impeach and indicted a--hole is no patriot.&quot;</span>

In his memo, he stated he would officially be stepping down in November – and then used the opportunity to complain about the &quot;elites&quot; he has had to deal with by writing: &quot;Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.”

                              <span>BBC News: How Norway outstrips US on Ukraine spending 
The United States has poured more than a hundred billion dollars into Ukraine&#x27;s effort to repel Russia&#x27;s invasion, spending far more than any other nation. 
But as President Volodymyr Zelensky comes to Washington to ask for more, there is growing Republican scepticism about funding the war effort. 
 In his Tuesday speech to the UN, Joe Biden made a passionate plea for the global community to not turn its back on Ukraine. 
&quot;Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence,&quot; he said.

WNU Editor: The Ukraine sources that I trust are telling me that over half of this aid is now being lost due to corruption. It is almost as if everyone has come to the same realization that aid from the West is not going to be forthcoming as it has been in the past, and now is the best time to grab what you can before the spigot is turned off. 
I can speak personally on how rotten this corruption is. I am part of a group that helps to send needed drugs and medicines to Ukraine. Specifically it goes to my father&#x27;s home town that is south of Kyiv. We always had some losses, but our last three shipments of vital supplies just disappeared.</span>

NYPost: Confused Biden walks into flag, then appears to anger Brazilian prez with handshake snub at UN 
President Biden looked confused again Wednesday as he walked into a giant flag at the United Nations — then appeared to anger Brazil’s president by walking off stage without shaking his hand. 
The gaffe-prone oldest US president in history walked into the 7-foot-tall Brazilian flag as he took the stage, taking a moment to get his bearings as the flag wobbled. 
 He then struggled with the headset of his translation device, soon noted by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was with him for a joint speech agreeing to partner on workers’ rights.

Poland said Wednesday it will stop providing weapons to Ukraine amid a growing dispute between the two countries over a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports.
“We no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on social media. 
Poland has long been one of Ukraine’s staunchest backers since Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor, alongside multiple former Eastern bloc nations who fear they could be next if Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war is successful.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
