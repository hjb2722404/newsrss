                              <span>Helen Zia fought with her father to go to university. She went on to become one of the first American women to graduate from Princeton in 1973. While there, she successfully lobbied to start an Asian American Students Association. A few years later, she demanded that authorities in Detroit handle the slaying of a Chinese-American man, Vincent Chin, as a hate crime. She succeeded. Later, her books and articles would showcase the violence and discrimination faced by Asian-Americans. It seems Zia has always been fighting – and the reasons to fight never cease. “Asian Americans have been slammed as cartoon characters,” she said. “We’ve been called gooks, geeks, geishas. Moving beyond racial slurs to communities of strength and influence is a battle that doesn’t die.” Indeed, even after all the battles she has fought, current conditions present unusually fraught challenges.  “This time feels different,” Zia said at a leadership workshop in Oakland. When people started blaming China for the Covid-19 pandemic, it seemed certain Asian-Americans would feel blowback too. “I see you nodding your heads,” she told the crowd. “You went, ‘Oh, s***.’” No one laughed. “Where we are today is a consequence of so many things that we, some of us, have been predicting for some time,” Zia said. Among those changes is the growing diversity in the US, which some members of society find threatening. Though hardly a household name to the general public, the 70-year-old activist and author is a trailblazer among those who care about Asian-American issues and civil rights. Known for her hard-hitting talk and fierce intelligence as well as her warmth, Zia speaks with such energy and conviction that she leaves her audiences inspired and often in awe. In US, Yelp sees sharp increase in racist anti-Asian business reviews “Most men or women might have given up by now,” said Mary Yu Danico, professor of sociology and director of the Asian American Transnational Research Initiative at Cal Poly Pomona. “Racism – bias against Asian Americans – has…</span>

This instability adds to ongoing economic and political crises in Pakistan where inflation is raging, the country edges closer to default, and a crackdown is administered against former premier Imran Khan&#x27;s political party.</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Ukraine wants &#x27;clear&#x27; decision on NATO future at July summit, Zelenskiy says 
(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday Kyiv wanted to receive a &quot;clear&quot; decision on its future in the NATO military alliance when the bloc&#x27;s leaders meet in Vilnius in July. 
At a summit of over 40 European leaders in Moldova, he also said he wanted progress on Ukraine&#x27;s path to the European Union, which Kyiv applied to join last year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. 
&quot;This year is for decisions. In summer in Vilnius at the NATO summit the clear invitation to the members of Ukraine is needed and the security guarantees on the way to NATO membership are needed,&quot; Zelenskiy said. 
&quot;In (autumn), on our accession to the EU a clear, positive decision is needed. And we are also preparing for a Peace Summit, which will guide the world to jointly implement the peace formula,&quot; he said.

As to what is my take. 
The priority for the Ukraine government right now is to get NATO more actively and directly involved in the war. All of my contacts in Ukraine are telling me the same thing. This Russian war of attrition has revealed one indisputable fact and that is time is not on Kyiv&#x27;s side.</span>

At least eight people were injured in what the governor of a southwestern Russian region on the border with Ukraine described as “endless” shelling early Thursday. 
Belgorod region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukrainian forces of firing Grad missiles at the border town of Shebekino from midnight to sunrise. 
Ukraine adheres to a policy of neither confirming nor denying its role in the cross-border attacks.

Gladkov said eight people sustained various types of injuries, including two women, a police officer and a security guard. One person was in critical condition, he added.

Peskov said as much in a comment on May 24, responding to reports that some in the Polish military expect an uprising in Belarus in foreseeable future. 
General Waldemar Skrzypczak, former commander of the Polish Land Forces, told Polsat News that Belarusian citizens currently serving with Ukraine’s Armed Forces could ultimately use their expertise and weapons to topple the dictatorial regime in their home country. 
“We are preparing for an uprising in Belarus, because it is coming,” said Skrzypczak.

&quot;We need to be ready to support the units that will carry out operations against Lukashenko. Preparing for an uprising in Belarus is crucial. We have reason to help them, just like we help Ukrainians.&quot;

                              <span>Statista: Ukrainians&#x27; Desire to Join NATO and the EU 
NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Oslo today. Ahead of the session, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Sweden and urged Turkey and Hungary to ratify the Nordic country&#x27;s membership in the organization. The bigger elephant in the room during the meeting will be another nation&#x27;s membership prospects: those of Ukraine. While the country is not expected to join immediately, the question of what NATO can offer Ukraine right now will be posed during the meeting. Ukrainians&#x27; desire to join the treaty (and the EU) is higher than ever after some hesitation, a survey from the country&#x27;s Rating Sociological Group shows.

WNU Editor: This is nothing new. Western Ukraine support for joining the EU and NATO has always been strong. It was one of the main reason why the 2014 Maiden Revolution occurred. When then Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych signed an agreement with Russian President Putin for closer ties, those who favored closer ties to the West revolted. 
As for eastern Ukraine, for as long as I can remember the sentiment has always been the opposite. And this war has now only hardened both sides where reconciliation is now impossible.</span>

Insider: A secret Cold War-era deal lets British jets shadow Russian bombers when they fly near a vital Atlantic chokepoint 
* Since the 1950s, Ireland has allowed British jets to intercept Russian aircraft near Irish airspace. 
* Ireland&#x27;s west coast overlooks North Atlantic waters that the Russians and NATO keep a close eye on.
* The deal allowing the intercepts has long been secret, and Irish lawmakers now want more details.
If Russian bombers fly near Ireland, they may be intercepted by fighter jets — but not Irish ones. 
Under a secret agreement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland that dates back more than 70 years, Britain will defend Irish airspace from intrusions by Russian aircraft and other aerial threats. 
The deal has been amended by Irish leaders over the years, but it has also been kept secret due to Irish memories of British rule and tensions over Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the UK after Ireland was partitioned in 1921.

Unidentified metallic orb UFOs have been spotted &#x27;all over the world&#x27;, a Pentagon chief admitted today during NASA&#x27;s first-ever public hearing into the phenomenon. 
Physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon&#x27;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: &#x27;We see these [&#x27;metallic orbs&#x27;] all over the world, and we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers.&#x27; 
Dr Kirkpatrick presented AARO&#x27;s latest findings to NASA&#x27;s independent team of scientists and other experts who have been tasked with studying the UFO phenomenon — which has become increasingly less stigmatized following several high-profile congressional hearings and military sightings.

CNN: Xi Jinping tells China’s national security chiefs to prepare for ‘worst case’ scenarios
Hong Kong CNN  — Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called on his top national security officials to think about “worst case” scenarios and prepare for “stormy seas,” as the ruling Communist Party hardens efforts to counter any perceived internal and external threats. 
“The complexity and difficulty of the national security issues we now face have increased significantly,” Xi said Tuesday at a meeting of the party’s National Security Commission, state news agency Xinhua reported. 
“We must adhere to bottom-line thinking and worst-case-scenario thinking, and get ready to undergo the major tests of high winds and rough waves, and even perilous, stormy seas,” he added.

Pentagon — The United States will provide another $300 million in new military aid for Ukraine in a package that is expected to include munitions for Ukraine’s Patriot missile defense system, defense officials tell VOA.

Defense One:  Misfiring Cannons, Rotted Tires Among US Army Gear Pulled for Ukraine, Watchdog Finds 
It’s not the first time the unit and its contractor have been faulted for poorly maintained equipment by the service&#x27;s inspector general. 

When technicians got a look at one U.S. Army howitzer set to ship to Ukraine, it wasn’t pretty. 
The M777 cannon, which an Army contractor was presenting for inspection, “would have killed somebody” if it were fired, the technicians said, according to a recent report by the Defense Department’s inspector general. 
The investigation details numerous failures by an Army unit and a contractor that could have endangered the lives of Ukrainian or U.S. troops if the faulty equipment had been fielded. The report also exposes problems with a program designed to help soldiers deploy quickly across the world.

Two US Air Force B-1B Lancer bomber aircraft conducted a low flyover of Sarajevo and other cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Tuesday. It had been pre-announced at the start of this week and described as &quot;a sign of the strong partnership between the United States and the Armed Forces of BiH, according to a statement in the English language news portal Sarajevo Times.

Reuters: Qatar prime minister, Taliban chief hold secret Afghan talks -source 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Qatari prime minister held secret talks with the supreme leader of the Taliban this month on resolving tension with the international community, a source briefed on the meeting said, signaling a new willingness by Afghanistan&#x27;s rulers to discuss ways to end their isolation. 
The May 12 meeting in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar between Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani and Haibatullah Akhunzada is the first the reclusive Taliban chief is known to have held with a foreign leader. 
U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration was briefed on the talks and is &quot;coordinating on all issues discussed&quot; by the pair, including furthering dialogue with the Taliban, said the source. 
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said other issues Sheikh Mohammed raised with Haibatullah included the need to end a Taliban bans on girls&#x27; education and women&#x27;s employment.

Politico: Erdoğan pulls out of European summit

 
The Turkish leader, who won reelection Sunday, was expected to attend the meeting, which is meant as a show of solidarity against Russia. 
CHISINAU — A massive gathering of European leaders on Thursday has suffered its first high-profile casualty, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pulling out at the last minute. 
The Turkish leader, who won five more years at the helm of his country in second-round elections on Sunday, will not travel to Moldova for the one-day summit, according to three officials involved in the preparations. 
The so-called European Political Community (EPC) — a new collective launched in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine — is meant to draw together European leaders beyond the EU. More than 40 European leaders will be present Thursday, including those from all 27 EU countries plus non-EU countries like Britain and Turkey, as well as the Western Balkan nations.

EurActiv/Reuters: Borrell: Russia won’t enter negotiations while trying to win war 
The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, on Monday (29 May) said he believed Russia will not be willing to negotiate while it is still trying to win the war in Ukraine, adding that he was “not optimistic” about what could happen in the conflict this summer. 
 “I see a concentration of troops on both sides, the clear will of Russia to try to win the war,” Borrell told an event in Barcelona. “(Russia) will not go to a negotiation until it has tried to win the war.” 
He added that Russia has repeatedly signaled it would not cease the campaign until its military goals have been achieved. 
Borrell’s comments came the same day Russia said its military had hit Ukrainian air bases and Ukrainian forces shelled industrial facilities inside Russia as both sides sought the upper hand ahead of what Kyiv hopes will be a decisive counter-offensive.

* The violence has stirred fear of a renewal of the brutal conflict in the late 1990s 
* More than 10,000 people lost their lives and more than 1 million were displaced

NATO will send 700 more troops to northern Kosovo to help quell violent protests after clashes with ethnic Serbs there left 30 international soldiers wounded, the alliance announced Tuesday. 
The latest violence in the region has stirred fear of a renewal of the 1998-99 conflict in Kosovo that claimed more than 10,000 lives, left more than 1 million people homeless and resulted in a NATO peacekeeping mission that has lasted nearly a quarter of a century. 
The clashes grew out of a confrontation that unfolded last week after ethnic Albanian officials elected in votes overwhelmingly boycotted by Serbs entered municipal buildings to take office. When Serbs tried to block them, Kosovo police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.

ICC warrant for Russian president’s arrest issued in March over alleged war crimes in Ukraine 
South Africa has issued blanket diplomatic immunity to all leaders attending an August summit, meaning Vladimir Putin might be able to travel to Johannesburg and not fear the country acting on an international criminal court warrant for his arrest. 
South African officials insisted the broad offer of immunity, issued in a government gazette, may not trump the ICC arrest warrant. As an ICC member, South Africa would be under pressure, and possibly under a legal requirement, to arrest Putin. The court issued a warrant for his arrest in March over the alleged forcible deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.

Moscow Times: Russia Says Destroyed Ukraine’s ‘Last Warship’ 
Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it had “destroyed” what it claimed was Ukraine’s last warship. 
The landing ship Yuri Olefirenko was struck by “high-precision” Russian Aerospace Forces weaponry in the Black Sea port of Odesa on Monday, the Defense Ministry said in a daily briefing. 
It was not immediately possible to verify Moscow’s assertion and Kyiv has not yet commented on the claim. 
Ukrainian naval forces spokesman Oleh Chalyk declined to comment on the claim specifically, but said he &quot;did not recommend paying attention&quot; to Russian sources. 
The Yuri Olefirenko is a medium-sized landing ship for troops and vehicles.

                              <span>Politico.eu: Top Russian official says British politicians now a legitimate military target

 
Dmitry Medvedev argues U.K. is ‘de facto leading an undeclared war against Russia.’ 
LONDON — British politicians are now a legitimate military target for Moscow, a senior Russian official said, after the U.K.’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly argued Ukraine has the right to use force within Russian borders. 
Speaking in Estonia Tuesday, Cleverly said Ukraine “has a right” to project force “beyond its own borders” as part of its self-defense, following a series of drone strikes that hit Moscow’s wealthiest neighborhoods. 
The U.K. minister argued that Kyiv striking inside Russia would “undermine” the Kremlin’s ability to continue its war in Ukraine, which has officially denied responsibility for the attack.

WNU Editor: Many Western governments, the UK included, are assuming that Russia will not escalate the war beyond the current theater of operations. And they are right. 
But former Russian President Medvedev is saying what many (if not most) Russians now believe, and that is certain Western countries are now in a de facto undeclared war against Russia.

                              <span>Reuters: N Korea’s first spy satellite launch ends in failure 
North Korea’s first spy satellite launch ended in failure on Wednesday, after the space rocket crashed into the sea. 
The newly developed Chollima-1 rocket was supposed to put in orbit the North’s first spy satellite... to keep watch on U.S. military activities.
In an unusually candid admission of a technical failure by the North, state media KCNA on Wednesday reported the rocket plunged into the sea because of instability in the engine and fuel system. 
 Neighboring South Korea said it had recovered what is believed to be parts of the space launch vehicle, including this large cylindrical object attached to a buoy.

Politico: Video: Chinese fighter jet buzzes U.S. Air Force plane in ‘unnecessarily aggressive’ maneuver

 
The incident took place over the South China Sea on Friday. 
A Chinese fighter jet conducted “an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver” by darting in front of an American surveillance plane over the South China Sea on Friday, according to the U.S. military. 
The incident, which was captured on video and released by the U.S on Monday, came as the U.S. Air Force RC-135 surveillance plane was flying in international airspace. 
The maneuver by the Chinese J-16 forced the U.S. plane to fly through the jet’s turbulence.

Reuters: Ukraine aide proposes post-war demilitarised zone in Russia 
KYIV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian presidential aide said on Monday a demilitarised zone of 100-120 km (62-75 miles) should be established inside Russia along the border with Ukraine as part of a post-war settlement. 
The zone would be necessary to protect Ukrainian regions from Russian attacks, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter. 
&quot;The key theme of the post-war settlement should be the establishment of safeguards to avoid the recurrence of aggression in the future,&quot; he wrote. 
He made his remarks after the governor of Russia&#x27;s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, called in televised comments for the annexation of Ukraine&#x27;s Kharkiv region to stop Ukrainian cross-border shelling.

WNU Editor: Mykhailo Podolyak controls the entire information policy of the Office of the President and advises Zelensky directly. I remembered before the war he was pushing for Ukraine to launch an offensive to take back the Donbas, and when the Ukraine offensive started two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine he was assuring everyone that Russia was not going to intervene. He completely misread Russia then and he is completely misreading them now.</span>

Naked Capitalism: Ukraine: Bleeding Out 
Even for well-reported 20th century wars, decades later, historians are still seeking to improve our understanding of them. With the Ukraine conflict, we’re in the midst of the unprecedented experience of being able to discern a remarkably high proportion of what is afoot, albeit with a great deal of noise in the signal between aggressive propagandizing and issues of sourcing with various purported close-to-the-action accounts. 
But the war has gone at a seemingly slow pace, due to Russia shifting strategy to attrition (rather than trying to force negotiations), the time required to break extremely well-fortified lines (without incurring huge and unnecessary human costs), and Russia choosing to grind down other elements of Ukraine’s military, notably its air defenses. That’s lead commentators to focus on battles and even hot spots on the line of contact, in part because that’s where the action has been, in part because close observers hope they’ll be able to find clues of when and where the fighting might shift into bigger, more decisive-looking campaigns.

                              <span>Following Russia’s failed winter offensive, Ukraine appears to be preparing for its planned counter-offensive. Ryan sat down with Mike Kofman to discuss the state of Russia’s armed forces, the current state of the Western-led effort to train and equip Ukrainian forces and the latest from the battle for Bakhmut. The conversation also touched on the role of the British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missile, Ukraine’s ability to absorb the F-16, what exactly happened during the recent cross-border attack on Belgorod and revisited concerns about nuclear escalation.

                              <span>Incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has won Turkey&#x27;s run-off presidential vote for another five-year term, Supreme Election Board (YSK) head Ahmet Yener said on Sunday.
Erdoğan received 52.14% of the votes, Yener said.
His rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%, according to the preliminary results, Yener added.
Erdoğan can now remain in his seat for another five years and for a third time. The 69-year-old became prime minister in 2003. The parliament voted him as president in 2014.

Erdogan, 69, defied opinion polls and came out comfortably ahead with an almost five-point lead over his rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the first round on May 14. But he fell just short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff, in a race with profound consequences for Turkey itself and global geopolitics.
His unexpectedly strong showing amid a deep cost of living crisis, and a win in parliamentary elections for a coalition of his conservative Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), the nationalist MHP and others, buoyed the vetera…</span>

&quot;Don Goyo&#x27;s angry because they didn&#x27;t put out his offering,&quot; said Jose Luis, a 55-year-old charcoal seller in Xalitzintla, the community closest to Popocatepetl.
Some residents even report having seen the mountain incarnate appear before them.
Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco.
&quot;We asked him &#x27;who are you?&#x27; He said: &#x27;Don&#x27;t you know me? I&#x27;m Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl. I&#x27;m the volcano,&#x27;&quot; the 77-year-old farmer said.

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov discussed the Ukraine conflict with China&#x27;s special envoy Li Hui, blaming Ukraine and Western countries for creating &quot;serious obstacles&quot; to resuming peace talks.
In Belgorod in southern Russia, the governor said the Ukrainian military was responsible for dozens of artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region but reported no casualties.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video of smoke billowing from roofless buildings with blown-out windows after the attack that authorities said had left 30 people injured including two boys age…</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday blamed Kosovo, the United States and European Union for escalating tensions in the Balkans and said it was watching with concern after violent clashes between Kosovan police and protesters opposed to ethnic Albanian mayors.
The United States and allies on Friday rebuked Kosovo, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas undermined efforts to improve troubled relations with neighbouring Serbia. NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.
The clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.
&quot;We decisively condemn Pristina&#x27;s provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,&quot; Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
&quot;The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,&quot; she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by &quot;Western mediators&quot; had come too late.
Serbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, and Moscow has blocked the country&#x27;s bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.

                              <span>As financial belt tightening and layoffs rippled throughout the tech industry in recent months, fact checkers and researchers who were tasked with keeping disinformation and extremism off of social media platforms are becoming scarce, CNBC reported. 
&quot;The cuts come at a time of increased cyberbullying, which has been linked to higher rates of adolescent self-harm, and as the spread of misinformation and violent content collides with the exploding use of artificial intelligence,&quot; the report stated. 
In a mass effort to boost productivity with less overhead, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have all slashed thousands of jobs.
In an example of just how far tech companies are willing to go to cut costs, departments tasked with trust and safety and AI ethics have been slashed as well.

&quot;Twitter effectively disbanded its ethical AI team in November and laid off all but one of its members, along with 15% of its trust and safety department, according to reports. In February, Google cut about one-third of a unit that aims to protect society from misinformation, radicalization, toxicity and censorship,&quot; says CNBC. &quot;Meta reportedly ended the contracts of about 200 content moderators in early January. It also laid off at least 16 members of Instagram’s well-being group and more than 100 positions related to trust, integrity and responsibility, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.&quot;

It was unclear who the pope had been expected to meet with, as his agenda was not made public on Friday, as is customary.
Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin blamed the pontiff&#x27;s busy schedule, saying he was tired.
&quot;The pope was tired, yesterday he had a very busy day, he saw a lot of people .. he wanted to say hello to them all,&quot; said Parolin, according to Italian news agencies.
&quot;And probably at a certain point the resistence breaks down.&quot;

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
