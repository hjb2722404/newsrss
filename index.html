                              <span>Reuters: Russia attacks Ukraine&#x27;s vital Danube export route in widening strikes 
KYIV (Reuters) -Russia destroyed Ukrainian grain warehouses on the Danube River and wounded seven people in a drone attack on Monday, expanding the target area of an air campaign it launched last week after pulling out of the Black Sea grain deal, Kyiv said. 
The attacks last week mostly targeted the sea ports of Odesa but Monday&#x27;s pre-dawn strikes hit infrastructure along the Danube, an alternative export route that is vital for Kyiv after the demise of the year-old deal allowing safe exports of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea.

                              <span>Wall Street Journal: Chinese Money Flees the Western World 
Just a few years ago, Chinese money was rippling across the rich world. Chinese investors were making blockbuster deals and snapping up trophy assets, from luxury homes and five-star hotels in New York to a Swiss chemical company and a German robotics giant. 
That era is over. 
Chinese investment is retreating from the West as hostility to Chinese capital has grown. Increasingly, Chinese companies are instead spending money on factories in Southeast Asia and mining and energy projects in Asia, the Middle East and South America, as Beijing seeks to cement alliances in those places and secure access to critical resources. 
The biggest recipient of Chinese investment so far this year is nickel-rich Indonesia, according to a preliminary estimate of Chinese investments compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Nickel is a key component in many of the batteries used to power electric vehicles.

Politico: China secretly sends enough gear to Russia to equip an army

 
Shipments of military-capable hardware expose a China-sized loophole in Western sanctions. 
The pictures posted on the Chinese company’s website show a tall, Caucasian man with a crew cut and flattened nose inspecting body armor at its factory.
“This spring, one of our customers came to our company to confirm the style and quantity of bulletproof vests, and carefully tested the quality of our vests,” Shanghai H Win, a manufacturer of military-grade protective gear, proudly reported on its website in March. The customer “immediately directly confirmed the order quantity of bulletproof vests and subsequent purchase intention.” 
The identity of the smiling customer isn’t clear, but there’s a fair chance he was Russian: According to customs records obtained by POLITICO, Russian buyers have declared orders for hundreds of thousands of bulletproof vests and helmets made by Shanghai H Win — the items listed in the documents match those in the company’s online catalog.

(Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Monday that it had found traces of explosives on a ship travelling from Turkey to the port of Rostov-on-Don in Russia to pick up grain. 
The FSB said the ship had been docked in the Ukrainian port of Kiliia in May, and that it may have been used to deliver explosives to Ukraine.
It said the ship had changed its name while in the Turkish port of Tuzla earlier this month and replaced its crew, which had consisted of 12 Ukrainian nationals.

* Goldman Sachs forecasts “all-time high” demand in oil markets leading to a “sizeable deficit.” 
* The investment bank projects Brent crude to rise from just above $80 per barrel now to $86 per barrel by year end. 
Goldman Sachs expects record demand in oil markets to drive crude prices higher in the near term. 
“We expect pretty sizable deficits in the second half with deficits of almost 2 million barrels per day in the third quarter as demand reaches an all-time high,” Goldman’s head of oil research Daan Struyven told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Monday. 
He added that the bank forecasts Brent crude to rise from just above $80 per barrel now to $86 per barrel by year-end.

A “conversation has commenced” with North Korea over US Army Pvt. Travis King, who crossed the border between North and South Korea last week in the demilitarized zone separating the two nations, the deputy commander of the United Nations Command (UNC) said Monday.
King, believed to be the first US soldier to cross into North Korea since 1982, had a history of assault, was facing disciplinary action over his conduct and was meant to go back to the US the day before the incident.

Soldiers tell Sky News how they have discovered mines and booby traps hidden in doors and in the magazines of automatic weapons - and even attached to dead bodies. 
For the members of the demining unit in Ukraine&#x27;s 35th marine brigade, every step is fraught with peril - every action is beset with risk - during a period that has been particularly dangerous. 
As the Ukrainians press ahead with their summer offensive, the Russians have countered with Soviet-era tactics. 
They have laid millions and millions of landmines.

Territory and communities along the 1,000km (621 mile) frontier have been saturated with anti-personnel mines, anti-vehicle and anti-tank mines, and remotely-detonated mines.

(Reuters) -Clashes flared in parts of Sudan on the 100th day of the war on Sunday as mediation attempts by regional and international powers failed to find a path out of an increasingly intractable conflict. 
The fighting broke out on April 15 as the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) vied for power. 
Since then, more than 3 million people have been uprooted, including more than 700,000 who have fled to neighbouring countries. Some 1,136 people have been killed, according to the health ministry, though officials believe the number is higher. 
Neither the army nor the RSF has been able to claim victory, with the RSF&#x27;s domination on the ground in the capital Khartoum up against the army&#x27;s air and artillery firepower.

No casualties were reported, Russian officials said. 
Several drone attacks struck Crimea and Moscow overnight, causing the evacuation of several villages in the Russian-occupied peninsula and damaging buildings in the vicinity of the defense ministry in the Russian capital, Russian officials said Monday. 
“Drone strikes on two non-residential buildings were recorded at around four o’clock this morning,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in the early hours of Monday, adding there had been “no serious damage or casualties.” 
“Two Ukrainian UAVs were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed” over Moscow, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement, accusing Kyiv of being responsible for the attack.

                              <span>Axios: Israeli Knesset passes judicial overhaul bill despite mass protests, U.S. pressure 
Israel&#x27;s parliament on Monday passed the Netanyahu coalition&#x27;s controversial bill that will significantly limit the Supreme Court&#x27;s ability to review government decisions, despite mass protests and pressure from the Biden administration to not rush the vote.

 
Why it matters: It&#x27;s the first piece of legislation that is part of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s judicial overhaul — a plan that has destabilized Israel&#x27;s economy, military and foreign relations. 
* Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition have for months faced mass anti-government protests over the plan. Thousands of Israeli reservists, including fighter pilots and members of the intelligence, cyber and special operations units in the IDF, warned in recent days they will not report to duty if the bill passed.

Axios: Pentagon watchdog: U.S. struggled to track military aid to Ukraine 
Dozens of rifles, thousands of rounds of ammunition and other military equipment donated to Ukraine in the early months of Russia&#x27;s invasion were stolen last year, according to a Pentagon report.

 
Why it matters: The thefts by crime groups and volunteer fighters were ultimately disrupted by Ukraine&#x27;s security service and the military hardware was recovered, the Defense Department initially struggled to track and monitor all the equipment it donated to Ukraine, as required by law. 
The inspector general&#x27;s report does not specify whether the stolen weapons were donated to Ukraine by the U.S.

                              <span>Newsweek: Wagner Group Wants to March on Poland, Putin Ally Warns 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko warned on Sunday that the Wagner Group wants to march on Poland during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
 Putin exiled the Wagner Group, a paramilitary unit that previously fought alongside his troops in Ukraine, to Belarus following an attempted mutiny by Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin against Moscow&#x27;s military leadership last month. The transfer fueled concerns about stability across Eastern Europe, including Poland, which shares a strategically critical northeastern border with Belarus. The Polish military has transferred troops near its Belarusian border amid threats that the Wagner Group could attempt to seize the Suwalki Gap and cut off the Baltic states from the rest of Europe.

                              <span>Spain appears headed for political gridlock after Sunday&#x27;s inconclusive national elections left parties on both the right and left without a clear path toward forging a new government. The conservative Popular Party won the elections, but it fell short of its hopes of scoring a much bigger victory and forcing the removal of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. Instead, the party led by candidate Alberto Núñez Feijóo performed below expectations of most of the campaign polls.</span>

                              <span>Politico: Spanish elections: Sánchez holds off right surge

 
The center-right Popular Party won the most votes but does not appear to have a path to form a government. 
MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is poised to remain prime minister as a result of Sunday’s inconclusive national elections in which the center-right Popular Party won the most votes but was left with no clear path to form a government. 
As expected, none of Spain’s major parties secured a governing majority. 
With 99 percent of the votes tallied, the Popular Party had 136 seats, the Socialists 122, the far-right Vox 33, and the left-wing Sumar 31. 
Prior to the vote, conservative leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo indicated that he would be willing to form a coalition government with Vox, but both parties fell short of the 176 seats needed to control the Spanish parliament.

                              <span>Antiwar.com: Higher Military Spending Will Save Democracy  
So says the &quot;liberal&quot; New York Times 
Three days ago, I got a story in my New York Times email feed on “A Turning Point in Military Spending.” The article celebrated the greater willingness of NATO members as well as countries like Japan to spend more on military weaponry, which, according to the “liberal” NYT, will help to preserve democracy. Interestingly, even as NATO members have started to spend more, the Pentagon is still demanding yet higher budgets, abetted by Congress. I thought if NATO spent more, the USA could finally spend less? 
No matter. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the hyping of what used to be called the “Yellow Peril,” today read “China,” is ensuring record military spending in the USA as yearly Pentagon budgets approach $900 billion. That figure does not include the roughly $120 billion or more in aid already provided to Ukraine in its war with Russia. And since the Biden administration’s commitment to Ukraine remains open-ended, you can add scores of billion more to that sum if the war persists into the fall and winter.

The NATO Summit in Vilnius (July 11-12) signaled that there is absolutely no possibility of talks to settle the Ukraine war in a foreseeable future. The war will only intensify, as the US and its allies still hope to inflict a military defeat on Russia although that is clearly beyond their capability. 
On July 14, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of US joint chiefs of staff said that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is “far from a failure” but the fight ahead will be “long” and “bloody”. Milley has a reputation for speaking what the White House wants to hear, no matter his professional judgment.

Modern Diplomacy: U.S. report: One third of Ukraine’s Bradley vehicles taken out 
Following the delivery of American M2 Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine in April, multiple Western sources have reported at least one third of the vehicles have been visually confirmed as having been abandoned, damaged or destroyed, ‘Military Watch Magazine’ informs. 
This was supported by prior reports, including one from the New York Times, highlighting that Ukraine’s Western-trained 47th Mechanised Brigade had lost 30 percent of its Bradleys within just two weeks. 
 The first images of the vehicles taking heavy losses in combat, alongside German supplied Leopard 2A6 tanks, emerged in early June. Although Washington has pledged to continue to supply new Bradleys to Ukraine, and to eventually supplement them with M1A2 Abrams tanks, it has also repeatedly been made clear by officials and lawmakers in the United States that the future of arms supplies to the Eastern European country will depend heavily on the success of its new offensives.

Wall Street Journal: Ukraine&#x27;s Lack of Weaponry and Training Risks Stalemate in Fight With Russia 
BRUSSELS—When Ukraine launched its big counteroffensive this spring, Western military officials knew Kyiv didn’t have all the training or weapons—from shells to warplanes—that it needed to dislodge Russian forces. But they hoped Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day. 
They haven’t. Deep and deadly minefields, extensive fortifications and Russian air power have combined to largely block significant advances by Ukrainian troops. Instead, the campaign risks descending into a stalemate with the potential to burn through lives and equipment without a major shift in momentum. 
As the likelihood of any large-scale breakthrough by the Ukrainians this year dims, it raises the unsettling prospect for Washington and its allies of a longer war—one that would require a huge new infusion of sophisticated armaments and more training to give Kyiv a chance at victory.

Sighhh ....
The hope in the West that Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day reminds me of something that Hillary Clinton said a decade ago. Hope is not a strategy. But apparently for the West and Ukraine&#x27;s political leaders hope was the strategy.</span>

President Biden on Friday elevated William J. Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to become a member of his cabinet, citing the agency’s work in providing “good intelligence, delivered with honesty and integrity” on China, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and emerging technologies. 
“Bill has always given me clear, straightforward analysis that prioritizes the safety and security of the American people, reflecting the integral role the C.I.A. plays in our national security decision-making at this critical time,” Mr. Biden said in a statement.

Daily Beast: Taiwan’s ‘Doomsday Drills’: A Chilling Glimpse of War With China

 
The drill simulating a Chinese attack will include shelter orders and traffic stops, bringing cities to a near standstill in hopes of giving civilians the best shot at survival. 
From Monday through Thursday this week, Taiwan will be running a defense exercise simulating a Chinese air attack, preparing civilians for what to do if China invades. And from Monday through Friday, Taiwan will be running a live-fire exercise to test Taiwan’s combat readiness to respond to a Chinese invasion, according to the Ministry of National Defense. 
Civilians will be required to shelter in place when the defense drill is underway, according to CNA. In some locales, drivers out on the streets will be asked to stop their cars and evacuate them, as will passengers on public transportation, bringing cities to a near standstill, according to Taipei’s Department of Transportation. 
The entire drill is aimed at reducing casualties in the case of an attack from China, which has been growing increasingly aggressive towards Taiwan. Over the last few weeks, China has sent a record number of warships to waters surrounding Taiwan. According to American officials, the current U.S. government assessment is that Chinese President Xi Jinping is working to be prepared for conflict in either 2025 or 2027.

Chinese ships have sailed off the coast of Australia before, and the vessel’s movement is not considered concerning, Lt. Gen Greg Bilton, chief of Joint Operations, Australian Defence Force (ADF), said during the opening ceremony of Talisman Sabre.

The comments signal that the Biden administration is feeling a new sense of urgency to deliver the warplanes as quickly as possible.
The Biden administration expects American-made F-16 fighter jets will arrive in Ukraine near the end of this year, a top spokesperson said, signaling that U.S. officials are feeling a new sense of urgency to deliver the warplanes as quickly as possible. 
“Now look, the F-16s will get there probably towards the end of the year,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said on Fox News on Thursday
“But it’s not our assessment that the F-16s alone would be enough to turn the tide here.”

Russian president reacts angrily after Polish defence minister sends troops to guard eastern border 
Vladimir Putin has said Russia will use “all means at its disposal” to defend Belarus after Poland and other EU countries voiced concerns about the deployment of Russian paramilitaries near their borders. 
Putin delivered a series of aggressive remarks during a meeting of his security council, where he claimed without evidence that Poland was seeking to invade Belarus, a Russian ally, and that their elites were “dreaming of Belarusian lands”.

Franchetti, who is currently serving as the vice chief of naval operations, commissioned in 1985 and has served as the commander of US Naval Forces Korea, deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfighting Development, and director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy of the Joint Staff, according to her official biography. She has also commanded two carrier strike groups, and became the Vice CNO in September 2022.

Final opinion polls tip right-wing Popular Party to win most seats, but without securing working parliamentary majority. 
Voters in Spain are headed for the polls on Sunday in an election that could make the country the latest European Union member to swing to the populist right, a shift that would represent a major upheaval after five years under a left-wing government. 
Final opinion polls, that were published on Monday, tipped the right-wing Popular Party (PP) to win the most seats but without securing a working parliamentary majority.

According to the RBC business daily, the detention came after a complaint from a former member of the Wagner mercenary outfit, which Girkin had criticized in the past.

                              <span>Reuters: India imposes major rice export ban, triggering inflation fears 
NEW DELHI: India on Thursday ordered a halt to its largest rice export category in a move that will roughly halve shipments by the world&#x27;s largest exporter of the grain, triggering fears of further inflation on global food markets. 
The government said it was imposing a ban on non-basmati white rice after retail rice prices climbed 3 per cent in a month after late but heavy monsoon rains caused significant damage to crops. 
India accounts for more than 40 per cent of world rice exports, and low inventories with other exporters mean any cut in shipments could inflate food prices already driven up by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine last year and erratic weather.

WNU Editor: India is responsible for approximately 40% of the world&#x27;s rice exports. Some variants will still be exported, but 25% of the world&#x27;s rice production is now off the global markets. This is a nightmare situation for third world countries that will get worse if this ban is permanent. If you think the immigration crisis is bad now, you have seen nothing yet.
Update: India’s rice export ban comes amid ‘perfect storm’ with Black Sea wheat crisis, El Nino (see video below).

During a speech at the Aspen Security Forum, Ukrainian President

stated that the Crimean bridge is a legitimate target for Ukraine and must be &quot;neutralized.&quot;
&quot;The Crimean Bridge is not just a logistical road. This is the road that is used to feed the war with ammunition. And it militarizes the Crimean Peninsula. This is an enemy facility built outside international law, so understandably, it is a [military] objective,&quot; President Zelensky stated. &quot;And any target that is bringing war must be neutralized.&quot; 
The President also emphasized that the counteroffensive is progressing more slowly than expected because the operation started later than originally planned. According to Zelensky, Russia had more time to mine Ukrainian land and build several lines of defense.

                              <span>Cohen, who has previously said that former president Donald Trump&#x27;s disrespect for the security of classified information really amounts to a disrespect for the men and women behind that classified information who put their lives on the line for the country, was asked on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta about the &quot;far-right Republicans&quot; who argue that culture war add-ons recently passed in the House as part of a military budget &quot;will help rid the military to what they describe as wokeness.&quot;
Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
&quot;We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars,&quot; he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a &quot;wokeness problem,&quot; Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
&quot;What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?&quot;

The fire started early in the morning near the village of Puntagorda in the north-west of the Canary Island. A lasting drought and high winds meant the fire spread quickly, according to the mayor of the village, Vicente Rodríguez, who spoke to state television broadcaster RTVE. 
Firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames as the wind kept changing direction. At least 11 houses burned down and an area of about 140 hectares was destroyed.</span>

South Korea is at the peak of its summer monsoon season and there has been heavy rainfall for the last three days, triggering widespread flooding and landslides, and causing a major dam to overflow.
The interior ministry reported that 22 people had been killed and another 14 were missing in the heavy downpours, mostly buried by landslides or after falling into a flooded reservoir.
The majority of the casualties -- including 16 dead and nine missing -- come from North Gyeongsang province, largely due to massive landslides in the mountainous area that engulfed houses with people inside.

                              <span>The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of &quot;permanent, irreversible harm&quot; to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister&#x27;s granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps&#x27; successor Mark Harper said he was &quot;satisfied&quot; that the project&#x27;s &quot;harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits&quot;.
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
&quot;This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it&#x27;s not over yet,&quot; Gooding said.

                              <span>Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey on Friday spent a second day in the witness box at a London court, denying sexual assault charges and claiming the prosecution case against him was weak.
The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a &quot;sexual bully&quot; who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men&#x27;s crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…</span>

The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia&#x27;s military campaign in Ukraine.
&quot;I feel total despair,&quot; said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
&quot;If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned,&quot; he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

The country may be synonymous with the beautiful game, but it banned women from the sport for nearly four decades until 1979.
Ahead of the Women&#x27;s World Cup starting next week in Australia and New Zealand, where Brazil will be in action, Mendes recalled the lengths she went to in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a soccer player.
As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil&#x27;s impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.
She used to dig a hole next to the pitch to hide in until the enforcers left, then crawled out again to continue kicking the ball aroun…</span>

                              <span>The Athens Acropolis, Greece&#x27;s top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening &quot;to protect workers and visitors&quot;, Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
&quot;It&#x27;s highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.</span>

                              <span>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
&quot;Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;He needs to lift the holdings,&quot; said Austin. &quot;This is a national security issue, a readiness issue.&quot;
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin&#x27;s call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
&quot;Is that something you&#x27;re willing to deal with, negotiate?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that&#x27;s an important policy,&quot; said Austin. &quot;I think our troops don&#x27;t get to choose where they&#x27;re assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I&#x27;m proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.&quot;
&quot;So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;That&#x27;s our policy,&quot; said Austin.

President Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s greenlight, which ended more than a year of opposition to Sweden&#x27;s membership bid, came as a surprise even to allies at home who had supported him in demanding Stockholm first take steps against groups deemed terrorists by Ankara.

This comes as President Joe Biden, who has already declared his confidence that Ukraine will be triumphant over the Kremlin invasion, proclaimed that they already have at a summit in Helsinki, during celebrations about Finland&#x27;s admission into NATO.

                              <span>The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been &quot;eaten alive.&quot;
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates &quot;do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.&quot; 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,&quot; she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson&#x27;s death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a &quot;racial justice issue,&quot; citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was &quot;almost completely detached from the base of his neck.&quot; The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use &quot;new plates and fixations in the damaged area.&quot; 
&quot;Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room,&quot; Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
&quot;The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing,&quot; Einav said.</span>

Sources at the BBC claim presenter Victoria Derbyshire was investigating accusations about Edwards’ conduct in the days before The Sun made its claims. Last week Derbyshire’s enquiries sparked concern among BBC staff, but it is not clear if senior editors in the news team were aware of the work, according to Deadline. The revelation has raised concerns about whether allegations regarding Edwards were circulating in the newsroom and if senior managers were inf...</span>

                              <span>Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denied any &quot;aggressive&quot; behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to &quot;come off the road&quot;.
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said &quot;it didn&#x27;t happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way&quot;.
&quot;It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic,&quot; Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a &quot;big flirt&quot;.
But the alleged victim &quot;made it clear that he did not want to go any further,&quot; the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt &quot;crushed&quot; after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a &quot;stab in the back&quot;.
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as &quot;madness&quot;.
&quot;I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn&#x27;t and never have to anyone in my life,&quot; Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn&#x27;t recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, was artistic director of London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
