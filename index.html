                              <span>Defence Minister Richard Marles has held a breakthrough meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore.

Mr Marles met with General Wei Fenghe for more than hour on the sideline of the Shangri-La Defence Dialogue, marking the first time in three years the defence ministers of the two countries have met.

Lowy Institute Senior Fellow Richard McGregor says the meeting was “very interesting” as both Australia and China were willing to have a conversation.

He said before Mr Marles went to Singapore he said there was no meeting arranged so the occurrence of one shows both countries “decided it was about time to end the stand-off”.

“It’s important to remember though there’s no change in all the fundamental problems in the relationship, all that’s happening now is we’re talking about them,” he told Sky News Australia.

“In the case of the military that’s a good thing because it means we might be able to avoid the kind of incidents we had in the South China Sea a few months ago.”</span>

                              <span>China has ended its nearly three-year diplomatic freeze directed at Australia. 

It comes after Defence Minister Richard Marles sat down for a discussion with his Chinese counterpart on the sideline of a security summit in Singapore.

Mr Marles and Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe held a one-hour meeting at the Shangri-La Defence Summit in Singapore on Sunday where each raised concerns about one another&#x27;s nations amid rising tensions over the Indo-Pacific.</span>

                              <span>China says it will &quot;fight to the very end&quot; to stop Taiwanese independence.

The Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe says the nation only seeks peace and stability.

He is accusing the United States of being a bully and interfering in China&#x27;s internal affairs - including on Taiwan.

The US Defence Secretary on Saturday had accused Beijing of &quot;provocative and destabilising&quot; military activity and said it was up to America to improve the bilateral relationship.</span>

“They’re going to put resources into this: mental health resources, resources into the schools and that kind of thing,” he told Sky News Australia.

“But this government, this money, has to be accepted by the governments of the 50 states so they can reject the money and tell the federal government to go in a different direction.”</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden&#x27;s support within the Democratic Party seems to be declining after high-profile progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declined to endorse the president’s 2024 re-election bid.

During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said she would worry about the 2024 election after this November&#x27;s midterm elections.

“First of all, I’m focused on winning this majority right now and preserving a majority this year in 2022,” she said.

“I believe that the president has been doing a very good job so far. And should he run again, I think that we will take a look at it.”​

The comments come as more-and-more Democrats publicly raise their concerns about President Biden’s advanced age and declining popularity as the party faces a tough midterm election.</span>

                              <span>Ukrainian officials claim Russia has targeted numerous cultural and historical sites during its assault on the country. In response, artists and historians have been racing to save key artifacts in an effort to preserve Ukrainian culture. CNN Style Global Editor Fiona Sinclair Scott has the story of one such artist and examines how some Ukrainian residents have returned to the ballet in hopes of a more normal night out.

Warzone/The Drive: Israel Has Extended The Range Of Its F-35s: Report 
Reports in the Israeli media suggest that IAF F-35s have been enhanced to hit Iranian targets unrefueled and carry at least one new weapon. 
Recent reports in the Israeli media claim that the country has developed a means of extending the range of its F-35I Adir stealth jets, allegedly providing them with enough reach to hit targets in Iran without needing aerial refueling. The development has been announced together with the integration of a new, locally developed smart bomb for internal carriage in the F-35. These apparent upgrades to the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities come as the Israeli leadership announces a harder line against Tehran’s nuclear program, while the air force conducts exercises widely thought to be dress rehearsals for potential raids against Iran.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a plan to enhance the country’s military capability and assist Southeast Asian countries with maritime security during his Friday keynote address in Singapore before the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier security summit.

                              <span>Blogging will return later today.
This is going to be my last day volunteering to help Ukrainian refugees. No more being on call 24/7.

A lot of people /NGOs/etc. are now volunteering, freeing people like myself to get back to our normal routine.
It has been a tough but rewarding 100+ days. 

Needless to say blogging will return to normal this week, and I will also be lifting the block on readers posting comments.</span>

Business Standard/ANI:  Russia-US dialogue is at unprecedented low level: Ambassador Antonov 
Russia-US dialogue is at an unprecedented low level. Trust is undermined, cooperation is collapsing even on issues of mutual interest, Russian Ambassador to US Anatoly Antonov said 
&quot;Russian-American political dialogue is at an unprecedented low level. Trust is undermined, cooperation is collapsing even on issues of obvious mutual interest. Communication between the parties is limited today,&quot; Antonov said on the air of the Bolshaya Igra (&quot;Big Game&quot;) show on Channel One, adding that the dialogue is &quot;limited to the discussion of technical issues,&quot; Sputnik reported. 
The diplomat also said that the sides currently do not conduct a dialogue on the strategic stability and called the situation &quot;wrong&quot; as the &quot;world expects concrete actions&quot; from the US and Russia. 
Antonov added that he is &quot;unaware&quot; of any unofficial dialogue between Moscow and Washington.

WNU Editor: I do not know what Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov expects. President Biden and his top officials have made it very clear that they want regime change in Moscow. As far as the US government is concerned. Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov represents an illegitimate government.</span>

                              <span>DNYUZ: Biden Races to Expand Coalition Against Russia but Meets Resistance 
WASHINGTON — Even before the start of the war in Ukraine, an international alliance to rally the world against a Russian invasion came together so quickly that President Biden later marveled at the “purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.” 
Now, with the conflict in its fourth month, U.S. officials are facing the disappointing reality that the powerful coalition of nations — stretching from North America across Europe and into East Asia — may not be enough to break the looming stalemate in Ukraine.

WNU Editor: One thing that I learned in my travels is that in many places around the world many people do not like the U.S. government. The US culture/opportunities/people/etc. .... they love. The US government not so much. These unwilling governments know that, and they are going to bide their time.

And as for the current coalition that formed after the invasion. Lets see how united they are six months from now in the middle of winter.</span>

                              <span>Nearly all 50 Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times said Joe Biden (pictured on Friday) should not run for president   
Daily Mail: &#x27;To say our country was on the right track would flagrantly depart from reality&#x27;: Top Democrats say Biden should NOT run for re-election in 2024 
* Fifty top Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times said Joe Biden  should not run for re-election in 2024 president 
* Many were pessimistic about Biden&#x27;s leaderships, which is marred with failures 
* Biden failed to pass his $1.8 trillion Build Back Better agenda and voting rights expansion bill, and faced backlash over the chaotic exit from Afghanistan 
* The administration continues to face challenges from record high gas prices and soaring inflation, and a possible end to the federal abortion rights 
* Many Democratic leaders also worry about the presidents age, who was the oldest man appointed to office at 78 last January 
* Democrats are also at a loss of who should take control of the party as Republicans are expected to rack up major victories in the coming midterms 
Top Democrats across the country said President Joe Biden should not run for re-election in 2024 as they expressed worries over his current leadership and age. 
Nearly all 50 Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times feared a Biden re-election campaign would not help their party against Republicans, who are expected to make sweeping victories in the coming midterms. 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) member Steve Simeonidis, of Miami, said he was generally pessimistic about his party&#x27;s leadership and called on Biden, 79, to let someone new take over in 2024.

The following year, he joined the New York City Department of Education to start a dance training program for public school students, which eventually grew into a school for students in grades four through the eighth year: Ballet technique.
This oft-told story was told again Thursday at the Joyce Theater, which Feld also helped found, with the return of Kids Dance, Ballet Tech’s performance troupe, in a recital for paying (and even critical) audiences.  He came in Feld’s recorded voice as part of “Eureka!”, a new work …</span>

Her husband, Edward Grinnan, said the cause was suicide.  He said she had battled depression as well as lupus.

England, in the shadow of the First World War.  “Peaky” reminded the rapper of how he got involved in gang culture in Los Angeles, Knight said.
“How the connection occurs between 1920s Birmingham and South Central, I don’t know,” said Knight, 62.  “I think you just get lucky with certain projects and that resonates with people.”

Bethanie Taylor, 27, mother of a five-month-old baby boy who lives in Springhill, Kansas, knows she loves the Little Sleepies.  “But I don’t know if I was brainwashed,” she said.
There’s a lot to like for a discerning parent: the material is hypoallergenic, antifungal, odor resistant and has natural UV protection.  Items come in thousands of patterns and designs, which the company releases weekly.  Instead of offering all of these options on the company’s website like most retailers do, Little Sleepies “drops” these baby pajamas at some point.

Americans are facing more expensive food, fuel and housing, and some are seeking answers on what is causing the price spike, how long it could last and what can be done to fix it.
There are few easy answers or painless fixes when it comes to inflation, which has surged around the world as supply shortages collide with strong consumer demand.  It’s hard to predict how long today’s price spike will last, and the main tool to combat it is rising interest rates, which dampen inflation by slowing the economy – potentially sharply.


Here’s a guide to understanding what’s going on with inflation and how to think about price gains when navigating this complicated t…</span>

                              <span>HOUSTON — Gasoline prices hit an ominous milestone on Saturday, as the national average for regular gasoline hit $5 a gallon.
Summer gasoline is almost always more expensive as fuel demand takes off around Memorial Day weekend.  But this year, oil and refined fuel prices have risen to their highest levels in 14 years, largely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions, and a rebound in energy consumption as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
The national average gasoline price on Saturday was $5.00, up 60 cents from a month ago.  A year ago gasoline was selling for $3.08, according to the AAA automobile club.  The national average is at its highest level since March, when it topped his previous record set in July 2008, when oil was trading at over $133…</span>

                              <span>With 44 million Medicare beneficiaries and an annual test costing around $1,000 a year, plus expensive scans and biopsies for those who test positive, the price could be substantial.
He and other critics warn the risks of triggering the tests are substantial.  As paradoxical as it may seem, finding cancers earlier could mean as many deaths, at the same time, as without early diagnosis.  Indeed, at least with current treatments, cancers meant to kill are not necessarily cured if caught early.
And there are other risks.  For example, some will test positive, but doctors will be unable to locate the cancer.  Others will be aggressively treated with surgery or chemotherapy for cancers that, if left alone, would not have grown and spread and may even be gone.
Dr. Beer acknowledges that a blood test for cancer “is not without risk or cost, and will not detect all cancers”.
But, he said, “I think there’s the promise of real impact.”
Other experts are worried.
Dr. Barnett Kramer, a member of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine and former director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, worries that testing will go mainstream without ever showing it’s beneficial .  Once that happens, he said, “it’s hard to ring the bell.”
“Hopefully we’re not halfway to a nightmare,” Dr. Kramer said.
Damocles syndrome
When Susan Iorio Bell, 73, a nurse who lives in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, saw an ad on Facebook recruiting women her age for a cancer blood test study, she immediately signed up.  This aligned with his advocacy of preventive medicine and his belief in clinical trials.

Then a piece of the ceiling above the leak collapsed.  The super covered the hole with cardboard but never fixed the leak or the ceiling.  I called several times, and he always says “tomorrow” but never solves the problem.  I also called management twice and sent pictures.  The wall seems to be getting moldy.  The cardboard begins to crumble.  What should I do?
A: You can do lots of things.  Start by calling 311 to request an inspection at Department of Housing Preservation and Development.  An inspector would most likely issue a violation, which might not solve your problem immediately, but would create a paper trail of evidence.

The agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said Thursday it was update of its preliminary assessment from autopilot to technical analysis, a deeper level of scrutiny that is required before a recall can be ordered.
The analysis will examine whether the Autopilot fails to prevent drivers from diverting their attention from the road and engaging in other predictable and risky behaviors while using the system.


“We’ve been calling for a closer look at Autopilot for some time,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, which coord…</span>

“We’ve had a ton of sightings,” said Maxine Montello, an official with the New York Maritime Rescue Center.  “It’s a glory to see stronger populations but also a worry because there’s increased overlap with humans and shared resources,” she said, particularly during the summer months when more and more tourists and pleasure craft ply the bustling waters.
The dolphin revival around metropolitan New York – which has the most developed coastline in the country – stands in stark contrast to the grim periods of disease and soaring death rates that have periodically plagued the wate…</span>

The Russian federal space company, Roscosmos, announced his death.  Dmitry Rogozin, the company’s director, called Mr Ryumin’s death an “irreparable loss”, but did not say where he died or name the cause.
Mr Ryumin’s first mission, on Soyuz 25, was supposed to last 90 days, but ended after just two when the vehicle failed to dock with the Salyut 6 orbital space station.


During his next two missions, Mr. Ryumin and his teammates set space endurance records: 175 days with Vladimir Lyakhov on Soyuz 32 in 1979 and 185 days with Leonid Popov on Soyu…</span>

It’s the final leg of a journey of thousands of miles, as the butterflies travel from their North American breeding grounds to their winter colonies, where they cover the fir trees.  Visitors who time their trips correctly may find the air so laden with monarchs that they can hear the flapping wings of butterflies.
“It’s a to-do list,” said Andrew Davis, an ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens.  “Imagine being surrounded by billions of butterflies. It’s a magical experience.

He was 79.
His ex-wife and longtime partner, Susan Thackery, said the death, in a hospital, was due to cancer.
Mr. Thahackrey did not want to go into winemaking.  The son of two Hollywood veterans, he had no background in viticulture – or agriculture, for that matter – when he settled in 1973 in Bolinas, a bohemian town isolated on the Pacific Ocean, in the south -western Marin County.

                              <span>In Game 3, the Celtics reclaimed that advantage.
“We had to do it,” Smart said of the physicality with which Boston outplayed Golden State.  “Match 2, they brought us the heat.  For us, it left a bad taste in our mouths because what we hang our hats on is defensive effort and being a physical team.
Golden State couldn’t match it, not long enough anyway.
Golden State outscored Boston by 43 points in the third quarter of this series and took the lead in Game 3, 83-82, on a 3-pointer from Curry.  This basket had followed a rapid sequence of 7 points without Boston taking possession.  Curry was fouled shooting a 3-pointer, and since the foul was flagrant, Golden State recovered the ball and scored another 3.
But late in the quarter, Golden State’s grip on the game slipped.
“Take the hits, keep fighting,” Williams said was the message in the group after the third quarter.  “Obviously they’re a great team that do runs, lots of runs, but just take the hit.”
Golden State couldn’t get through the defense or stop the Celtics from getting a second chance.  Hustle games usually went to Boston.
At one point in the fourth quarter, several players got tangled up on a loose ball, and Smart found it before Draymond Green pushed it.  It was Green’s sixth foul, and the crowd laughed at him after spending the night shouting curses at him.
Golden State’s Klay Thompson complained about fans swearing at “kids in the crowd.”
“Really classy.  Good job, Boston,” he said.

BEIJING — China’s two largest cities are tightening some Covid measures again, just days after loosening them as the virus appeared under control. 
Shanghai, which emerged from a two-month lockdown early this month, said Thursday that seven of its 16 districts would conduct mass testing this weekend, according to state media. 
Those areas included financial and downtown districts.  During the testing period, residents in affected areas will need to stay home until the testing is over, the city said in the comments section of an official release.

Al-Monitor: Congress wants Pentagon to bolster Arab, Israeli air defenses against Iran 
The Abraham Accords could enable Israel to share missile defense technology with Arab Gulf countries in a joint defensive architecture against Iran. 
 Bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress today would require the Pentagon to present a strategy for integrating the air defense capabilities of Israel and Arab states in order to counter ballistic missile and other projectile threats from Iran and its proxies. 
The bill, led in the Senate by Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), mandates a report on the Pentagon’s plans be presented to lawmakers no later than 180 days after its passage.

CNN: US seeks full reset with Saudi Arabia, effectively moving on from the murder of Jamal Khashoggi 
(CNN)Senior US officials have conveyed to Saudi Arabia that the US is prepared to move forward with a &quot;reset&quot; of the relationship, and effectively move on from the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in order to repair ties with the key Middle East ally, senior US officials tell CNN. 
The planning for a reset is a dramatic about-face for President Joe Biden, who came into office vowing to make Saudi Arabia a &quot;pariah&quot; over Khashoggi&#x27;s murder. 
His administration also released an intelligence report last year that directly accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of orchestrating Khashoggi&#x27;s killing.

                              <span>DW: Algeria suspends friendship treaty with Spain amid Western Sahara tensions 
Algeria said its decision was due to Spain&#x27;s &quot;unjustifiable turnaround&quot; over the Western Sahara region. Earlier this year, Spain recognized Morocco&#x27;s plans for the disputed territory, sparking tensions with Algeria. 
Algeria has suspended its 20-year-old cooperation treaty with Spain, the country&#x27;s presidency announced Wednesday. 
The decision came after Madrid reversed its long-standing policy of neutrality on the Western Sahara conflict in March by backing Morocco&#x27;s position.

Newsweek: Ukraine&#x27;s At Risk of Losing War With Russia: Military Official 
Russia&#x27;s attack on Ukraine has become a war of artillery, and Ukraine is at risk of losing, according to the deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence. 
Vadym Skibitsky told The Guardian in an interview published Friday that Ukraine is now heavily reliant on weapons provided by the West in its counteroffensive against Russia.
Russia, meanwhile, currently outranks Ukraine in terms of artillery supplies, according to the official. 
&quot;Everything now depends on what [the West] gives us,&quot; Skibitsky said. &quot;Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our Western partners have given us about 10 percent of what they have.&quot;

CNN: Two Air Force Ones, one big mess for Boeing 
Did you know there are actually two Air Force Ones? (Should that be Airs Force One?) It&#x27;s true — POTUS gets two planes, and technically Air Force One is designated as whichever jet the president is flying on.
More fun facts: Boeing was due to deliver two new presidential 747s soon, but they are wildly over budget and behind schedule.

Reuters: Sri Lanka Risks Full-Blown Humanitarian Emergency, UN Agency Says 
GENEVA (Reuters) - Sri Lanka is at risk of tipping into a full-blown humanitarian crisis as the country&#x27;s economy suffers its biggest shock in decades, the U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said on Friday. 
Sri Lanka&#x27;s 22 million people are suffering the country&#x27;s most serious financial turmoil in seven decades, with severe shortages of fuel, medicines and other essentials amid record inflation and a devaluation of its currency. 
&quot;Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. We are concerned that this could develop into a full-blown humanitarian emergency,&quot; OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told a regular U.N. news conference in Geneva.

A senior Chinese economist at a U.S.-China forum proposed that Beijing take over Taiwan and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) if Washington sanctions Beijing as it has Moscow.
 “If the United States and the West impose destructive sanctions on China as they treat Russia, we must recover Taiwan,” said China’s economist Chen Wenling on May 30 at a forum hosted by the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, according to state outlets. 
“Especially in the reconstruction of industry and supply chains, we must seize TSMC, a firm that inherently belongs to China.”

                              <span>New data show that inflation in the US rose to 8.6 percent last month
  
Daily Mail: Inflation surges to new 41-year high of 8.6%: Groceries jump 12% and gasoline soars 49% as rising prices cause misery for consumers 
* The consumer price index rose 8.6% on May from a year ago, the fastest increase since December 1981 
* Increase was larger than economists expected and topped the recent peak set in March 
* Soaring food and energy prices drove the increase, with groceries up 11.9% and gasoline rising 48.7% 
* But core inflation, excluding food and energy, was also higher than expected at 6% annual rate 
* It is the strongest signal yet that inflation has not yet peaked, as Biden previously claimed 
* On Friday Biden plans to speak at the Port of Los Angeles to highlight supply chain initiatives 
Annual inflation in the US has jumped to a 41-year high of 8.6 percent, blowing past expectations and dashing any hopes that consumer price increases had peaked. 
The new figures released on Friday suggested that the Federal Reserve could continue with its rapid interest rate hikes to combat inflation, and markets reacted swiftly, with the Dow shedding more than 700 points in early trading. 
The Labor Department&#x27;s report showed that the consumer price index jumped 1 percent in May from the prior month, for a 12-month increase of 8.6 percent.

The Guardian: We’re almost out of ammunition and relying on western arms, says Ukraine 
Exclusive: Deputy head of military intelligence says it’s an artillery war now and ‘everything depends on what the west gives us’  Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has said Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay. 
“This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”. 
“Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” said Skibitsky. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.”
