Reuters: Putin Says Russia&#x27;s New Sarmat Nuclear Missiles Soon Ready for Deployment 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia&#x27;s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, would soon be deployed for combat duty.

In a speech to new graduates of military academies, Putin stressed the importance of Russia&#x27;s &quot;triad&quot; of nuclear forces that can be launched from land, sea or air.

&quot;The most important task here is the development of the nuclear triad, which is a key guarantee of Russia&#x27;s military security and global stability,&quot; he said.

RT:  Russian Army getting enough recruits to form new regiment per day – Shoigu

 
The defense minister’s statement comes as Ukraine ramps up its conscription effort  
The Russian Army is recruiting enough new personnel to complete the formation of its reserve force, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Thursday. Enough applicants are signing formal contracts with the ministry to form a new regiment every day, he added. 
A total of 114,000 people have joined the Russian Armed Forces as contract servicemen to date, Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin at a Russian National Security Council session. An additional 52,000 people have joined the military ranks as volunteers, he said.

WNU Editor: I expected a bigger number. But 114,000 signing formal contracts  plus an additional 52,000 people joining the military ranks as volunteers is a large number. 
This is the opposite on what is happening in Ukraine. In 2022 tens of thousands volunteered. No more now. Conscription is the rule now, and draft dodgers are being hunted down .... Ukrainian youth speak on war, social catastrophe: “The military is grabbing draft evaders everywhere” (WSWS).</span>

RT:  Macron is ‘inappropriate’ for BRICS – Moscow

 
There should be no place for the French president at the bloc’s upcoming summit, a senior diplomat has argued  
French President Emmanuel Macron’s attendance at a meeting of BRICS leaders would be “inappropriate,” considering his government’s stance against Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said. 
Paris confirmed this week that Macron is seeking an invitation to the bloc’s summit in South Africa in August. 
Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Ryabkov explained that Russia’s opposition to Macron’s potential appearance was based on France’s efforts to isolate Moscow and its support for NATO’s goal of inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia in the Ukraine conflict. 
“We are not hiding this position and have informed our South African colleagues about it,” Ryabkov said, as cited by Interfax. “We expect our point of view to be fully taken into account.”

Zero Hedge: Biden Dispatches Sullivan, Nuland To Convince War Skeptics From BRICS To Turn Against Russia 
At a moment President Zelensky has confessed that Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive which was launched this month has been &quot;slower than desired&quot;, President Biden&#x27;s national security advisor Jake Sullivan is mounting a big push to convince &quot;skeptics&quot; from developing nations to become more firmly supportive of Kiev&#x27;s war effort. 
&quot;Joe Biden’s top national security aide will fly to Denmark this weekend at the behest of Kyiv’s government for an unannounced meeting with representatives of several developing countries that have not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,&quot; Financial Times has reported. 
A planned Copenhagen meeting is expected to include large but &#x27;neutral&#x27; countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa - the latter which has of late been accused of actively supporting Moscow.

Defense Post: US B-1B Bombers Land in Sweden for Exercises for First Time 
US bomber jets have landed in Sweden for the first time in modern history for training exercises with the NATO invitee, the military said Wednesday. 
Sweden, which abandoned two centuries of military non-alignment to seek NATO membership last year, announced earlier this month that it was ready to host NATO troops and materiel on its soil even before it becomes a member of the alliance. 
Two American B-1B Lancers landed at Lulea-Kallax airport in northern Sweden on Monday June 19, the military said.

Chonhar Bridge is one of a handful of infrastructures linking Crimea with the mainland

Russian-backed officials in southern Ukraine have accused Kyiv of using British-supplied long-range missiles to strike a bridge connecting Kherson province with the Crimean peninsula. 
The strike on the Chonhar Bridge, one of the few links between mainland Ukraine and Crimea, came two days after Moscow threatened to attack Kyiv’s “decision-making centres” if western-supplied missiles were used against Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
A series of photos and videos circulating on Telegram on Thursday showed a large crater on the bridge, with debris littering the roads. There were no casualties reported.

Ukrainian troops—if sufficiently supported with expanded Western military aid—can break through Russian lines and reach the occupied Crimean Peninsula by the end of the summer, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe Ben Hodges has told Newsweek. 
Amid concerns about the slow pace and mounting losses of Ukraine&#x27;s nascent counteroffensive in the south and east of the country launched early in June, Hodges called on President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration to underscore its commitment to Ukrainian victory by providing advanced weapons like the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System—colloquially known as the ATACMS—so far denied Kyiv for fear of provoking Russian retaliation.

Update: A retired US general says Ukraine could recapture Crimea before the summer&#x27;s out, but only if the US gives it the ammunition it needs (Insider)

 
WNU Editor: The Russians in Crimea, who make up 80% of the population (if not more), will see the Ukrainian army not as liberators, but as invaders. It will be a carnage for both sides. 
There is history that can be looked at to predict what will happen. It took the German 11th Army 8 months of heavy fighting to finally capture Crimea in 1942 (link here). The casualty numbers and destruction of that campaign was astronomical. and I predict the same will happen if Ukraine&#x27;s military forces enter Crimea in the coming months.</span>

Reuters: New Zealand PM disagrees with Biden, says Xi Jinping not a &#x27;dictator&#x27; 
SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, ahead of his official trip to China at end of this month, said on Thursday he did not agree with U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s remark that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was a dictator. 
&quot;No, and the form of government that China has is a matter for the Chinese people,&quot; Hipkins told reporters. 
Asked by a reporter whether the Chinese people had a say in the form of government, Hipkins said: &quot;if they wanted to change their system of government, then that would be a matter for them.&quot; 
Hipkins is scheduled to visit China from June 25 to 30, leading a trade delegation that includes some of New Zealand&#x27;s biggest companies. He will meet Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, and the chairman of the standing committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, Zhao Leji.

Responsible Statecraft:  Will upcoming NATO summit launch forever war in Europe?

 
Pressure is mounting to make some sort of formal declaration over Ukraine’s membership at meetings in Vilnius next month. 
An article in the New York Times on Wednesday claimed that pressure is building on Biden to announce a timetable for Ukrainian membership in NATO at its Vilnius Summit next month. 
Supposedly Biden is “isolated” among NATO allies in his reluctance to do so, even though that claim is contradicted by the story’s own last paragrap…</span>

Zero Hedge: The Failing Ukraine Counteroffensive &amp; The Peace That Could Have Been 
It&#x27;s safe to say that if the Ukrainian counteroffensive was currently making significant gains, everyone would know about it. Not only would mainstream media headlines feature celebratory daily news of any big gains on the ground, but it would not be the case that the question of how Ukraine is fairing would actually be slipping from the headlines (as it is now), no longer a prime focus in public discourse. 
David Sachs has observed of the current state of the counteroffensive that, &quot;With each passing day, it’s becoming clear that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is failing to achieve any of its originally stated objectives.&quot; At the same time escalation between Russia and NATO grows by the day, seemingly with no off-ramp, now also with tactical nukes stationed in Belarus.

CNN: Pentagon says Ukraine accounting error revealed last month is much bigger than previously stated 
The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the accounting error revealed last month was significantly more than previously stated and aid provided to Ukraine was overvalued by $6.2 billion rather than $3 billion. 
The accounting error includes fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and occurred because “in a significant number of cases,” when the US transferred weaponry, military officials counted the value of replacing the weapon instead of the value of the actual weapon, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh explained at a news briefing. 
That process drove up the cost of each new aid package – because new weaponry costs more than old weaponry – and resulted in the false assumption that more of the funding had been used.

As the United States considers how to grapple with the challenges stemming from illegal and unreported fishing, our research has shown that progress made in tamping down illegal fishing may lead to an increase in piracy.  As the United States focuses more on illegal fishing — particularly given China’s use of maritime militias for this act — it is important to understand how support for policing may inadvertently spawn other illegal acts that impinge on U.S. global interests.  Just days before leaving office, the Trump administration declassified its “Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific” region.

                              <span>Former Navy commander Frank Owen says the banging noises heard near the search area of a missing submersible could be the result of the advice from the former French Navy commander on board.

Mr Owen said the advice given to submariners inside a disabled submarine is to bang on the hull for three minutes at a time on the hour and half hour. 

“The fact that it is happening at 30-minute intervals, says to me that he is sending a message,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That suggests very much that there is life on board.”</span>

                              <span>[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Advances in technology are having a major impact in the workplace, creating new roles, changing job content, and obliging everyone to acquire the skills needed to keep pace with developments in a fast-moving environment.    Those circumstances no doubt explain the demand for places on the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) programme offered by City University of Hong Kong (CityU).  Available in both one-year full-time and two-year part-time modes, the course is a favourite with forward-looking data analytic professionals keen to build a highly rewarding career with tech and e-commerce firms or in big data, AI and machine learning across a broad spectrum of industries.  But it is also attracting applicants from fields like banking, accounting, logistics, real estate and marketing, who see that relevant expertise will enhance their standing as problem solvers, strategists and managers and open the door to all kinds of new opportunities.    “As data collection technology continues to develop and becomes cheaper, companies in different sectors want to take advantage of it,” says Dr Matthias Tan, Associate Professor at CityU’s School of Data Science and Programme Leader for MSDS programme. “By analysing the data they have, they can improve decision making and overall business performance. Right now, the field is expanding very quickly in terms of methodology and data collection techniques, so I am confident that demand for data scientists will continue to grow.”  As a result, each September intake for the MSDS admits around 100 students. They are expected to take five core courses and five electives to achieve a total of 30 credits. The foundational modules cover areas such as exploratory data analysis and visualisation, statistical machine learning, and storing and retrieving data. This provides strong training in key aspects of both theory and practice.  The list of electives gives students scope to pick courses…</span>

BBC: Ukraine war: Zelensky admits slow progress but says offensive is not a movie 
President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged battlefield progress has been &quot;slower than desired&quot;, weeks into Ukraine&#x27;s military offensive to recapture areas occupied by Russia. 
&quot;Some people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It&#x27;s not,&quot; he told the BBC. What&#x27;s at stake is people&#x27;s lives.&quot; 
Ukraine says its counter-offensive has reclaimed eight villages so far in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk to the east. 
Mr Zelensky said the military push was not going easily because 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces. 
&quot;Whatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best,&quot; Mr Zelensky added.

                              <span>France 24: EU proposes 50 bn-euro package to support Ukraine 
Brussels (AFP) – Brussels on Tuesday asked EU member states to back a 50-billion-euro ($55 billion) package to support Ukraine over the next four years, as part of a boost to the bloc&#x27;s budget. 
&quot;This financial reserve will allow us really to calibrate our financial support according to the evolution of the situation on the ground,&quot; European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. 
The proposal from the European Commission, the EU&#x27;s executive arm, is aimed at helping prop up Kyiv&#x27;s finances and covering immediate reconstruction costs caused by Russia&#x27;s war. 
The money, 33 billion euros in loans and 17 billion in grants, is part of the review to plug gaps in the EU&#x27;s budget for the period 2024-2027 left by the fallout of the Covid pandemic and the conflict. 
Ukraine&#x27;s Prime Minister Denys Shmygal thanked von der Leyen &quot;for such steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine&quot;.

The German chancellor met the Chinese premier in Berlin and the latter preferred to focus on trade. 
BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday reiterated his appeal to China to use its influence on Russia to help end the war in Ukraine. But his guest from Beijing wanted to talk about deepening trade ties instead. 
In a statement to journalists following a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Scholz said that he had &quot;again appealed to the Chinese government to exert even more influence on the Russian government in this war.&quot; 
 He added: &quot;As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China carries a very special duty here ... Russia must — as we see it — withdraw its troops; otherwise it will not be possible to achieve a good peace.&quot;

WNU Editor: The operator of the sub was the founder, an 61-year old ex-navy white guy (link here). But I think the issue has to do less with the pilot and more to do with the construction and engineering.
On a personal note. Last year the GF put visiting the Titanic on our bucket list on things to do when we retire. I told her that if we had the money to afford it my answer is a yes, but it will be the last thing to do on our bucket list.</span>

                              <span>Federalist: Joe Biden Is Not OK

 
There is nothing unique about being a scatterbrained 80-year-old. But a scatterbrained 80-year-old should not be president. 
The other day, Joe Biden ended a big gun-control speech in Connecticut with the words, “God save the queen, man.” Why did the president express adoration for the departed Brit monarch? Was he confused about royal succession? Is he a Sex Pistols fan? Who knows. 
When asked about the incident, White House aides offered nonsensical and conflicting answers — because they have absolutely no idea, and neither does the president. It’s likely that the octogenarian spontaneously used a cool-sounding phrase, much like when your elderly neighbor tells you to “keep on truckin,&#x27;” for no apparent reason. It happens.

A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday found that 29 percent of respondents believe the government is “not at all sound,” with Republicans more likely to think so than independents and Democrats.

The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, just two days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded a fence-mending visit to China. 
While both sides described his talks with senior officials - including President Xi Jinping - as constructive, Blinken failed to persuade his Chinese hosts to agree to resume high-level military dialogue between the two countries. 
The US has been pushing for a channel of communication between senior commanders to help reduce the risk of miscalculations and misunderstandings amid rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

* British Challenger 2 tanks were sent to Ukraine to help with counter attack 
British Challenger 2 tanks have been spotted on the Ukrainian front line for the first time - as Russian helicopter attacks reportedly force Kyiv to pause their counter-offensive after at least 20 Western tanks and IFVs were destroyed. 
A squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which have a 120mm rifled gun and a 7.62mm machine gun, were gifted by Britain earlier this year as the West continue to show their unwavering support to Ukraine in their fight against Vladimir Putin&#x27;s invasion. 
The £5m Challenger 2 is designed to attack other tanks and have far greater ranges and accuracy than the Kremlin&#x27;s equivalent.

* Ukraine&#x27;s military shared a video this week of Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi engaged in war efforts. 
* A mysterious Baby Yoda patch could be spotted on his uniform, and its not exactly clear why. 
* The little patch immediately stoked intrigue and admiration on social media. 
Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;Iron General,&quot; was spotted this week wearing an unusual new patch. Military uniform patches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and can carry a wide range of meaning, but his is something of a mystery at the moment. 
Ukraine&#x27;s General Staff of the Armed Forces published a video on Monday showing Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces, sporting a Baby Yoda patch in the center of his uniform as he discusses details on the war with other top officials. 
The new video includes scenes of Zaluzhnyi hovering over blurred-out information and walking alongside individuals whose faces have been censored. A clock on the wall at one point in the video indicates that the footage is from Saturday.

WNU Editor: This video was quickly released after Russian President Putin was trolling the General on where he may be .... Who Is Commanding Ukraine&#x27;s Military Forces? (June 19, 2023). 
Everything about this video is staged, including always showing a calendar in the background on what day this video was taking place. But a Baby Yoda patch?!?!? I guess they want to send out the message that the &quot;Force&quot; is with them.</span>

The Guardian/Reuters: Biden calls Chinese president Xi a ‘dictator’ a day after Blinken visit aimed at easing tensions

 
US president’s comments come just as two countries seek to dial down intense rivalry 
US president Joe Biden has called Chinese president Xi Jinping a dictator and said Xi was very embarrassed when a Chinese balloon was blown off course over the US earlier this year. 
Biden made the remarks one day after secretary of state Antony Blinken met Xi on a trip to China that was aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. 
“The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two box cars full of spy equipment in it was he didn’t know it was there,” Biden said at a fundraiser in California on Tuesday.

Newsweek: U.S. Volunteers Clash With Russian Forces in Intense Urban Warfare Video

 
New footage circulating online appears to show U.S. volunteers fighting Russian troops in Ukraine under near-constant mortar fire. 
The footage shows soldiers advancing through a smoke-filled urban area with visibly damaged buildings. Faces captured in the footage have been blurred, but dialogue and what appear to be American accents can be heard over the sound of firing in the clips. 
At several points in the footage, the group takes shelter in what looks to be the basement of an abandoned building. 
Newsweek could not independently verify this footage, which was shared on social media by Eastern European outlet Visegrad 24. The outlet did not specify details about the fighters in the video, nor when or where the footage was filmed.

Daily Mail: Putin&#x27;s suicide tank attack: Russia packs remote-control tank with six tons of explosives and drives it up to Ukrainian soldiers before detonating it in massive fireball - as counter-offensive is &#x27;paused&#x27; 
* Ukraine&#x27;s much-anticipated counter-offensive has yielded a mixed response 
* Russia&#x27;s dominance in the air is having a major impact on Ukraine&#x27;s push 
* Putin also resorting to suicide tanks in a bid to restrict Ukrainian advances 
Russian soldiers are packing tanks with explosives and remotely driving them at Ukrainian trenches and detonating them in a terrifying new tactic. 
It comes as Kyiv is forced to pause its counter-offensive in the south amid heavy losses of Western armoured vehicles, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
New video footage from Donetsk shows a remote-controlled T-54 laden with explosives lumbering towards a Ukrainian trench this week.

                              <span>Five Michigan Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday voted against a child marriage ban. 
Michigan in among 42 states in which child marriage is currently legal, of which 20 states don’t have a minimum age for marriage, The Detroit Free Press reports, citing data from the human rights group Equality Now.
Children who are 16 or 17 years of age can enter marriages with the written consent of a parent or guardian under current Michigan law. House Bill 4293 would ban such marriages. 
The Michigan state House passed the measure resoundingly, but GOP Reps. Steve Carra, Neil Friske, Matt Maddock, Angela Rigas and Josh Schriver all voted against the measure, Heartland Signal reports on its Twitter feed.
So far this century, 5,400 children (under the age of 18) were married in Michigan, but the numbers have declined steadily in recent years, the report said, noting 468 girls married in Michigan in 2000 compared to just 32 in 2021.
Democratic Rep. Kara Hope, one of the bill’s sponsors, said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that this practice is still legal in Michigan in the year 2023,&quot; according to the report. 
&quot;Victims of child marriage have less stability in their financial situations, more unwanted pregnancies and worse health outcomes,&quot; it says.
A United Nations initiative aims to end child marriage by 2030.</span>

“Donald Trump’s no fan of mine, he primaried me last year,” Mace earlier told Fox News. “So, I’m not a shill, but I see this, and I see how unfair it’s been.”
Speaking to Politico, Mace said that she has &quot;no ill will&quot; towards Trump, adding that the country &quot;can’t afford four more years of Joe Biden.&quot;
“I’m willing to bury the hatchet to save the country, and I know President Trump is too,&quot; Mace said. 
According to a source speaking to Politico, Trump, who formerly called Mace a &quot;grandstanding loser,&quot; sent her a text the day after his indictment thanking her for defending him.

The blast was followed by a major fire which caused one building, housing a fashion school, to collapse, as well as an adjacent building, emergency services said.
Some 70 fire trucks and 230 firefighters were battling the blaze which was contained by the early evening. Nine doctors were also at the scene.
The fire service said there had been &quot;an explosion&quot; which had &quot;caused the collapse of two buildings&quot;.
Several witnesses told AFP at the scene they had heard &quot;a giant explosion&quot;.

Zhu hired McMahon to track down the former official, who was living in New Jersey with his wife, according to the Department of Justice.

                              <span>The black fedora worn by pop superstar Michael Jackson just before he dazzled the world with his moonwalk dance for the first time will be up for grabs in September during a Paris auction of music memorabilia.
The King of Pop whipped off the hat while breaking into his hit &quot;Billie Jean&quot; during a televised Motown concert in 1983.
A few minutes later Jackson, at the height of his fame, showed off what would become his trademark move -- a seemingly effortless glide backwards while appearing to move forward.
The hat, with an estimated value of 60,000 to 100,000 euros ($65,000-$110,000), will be the star attraction at an auction of rock-and-roll items by Drouot on September 26.
Other items include a guitar owned by the legendary bluesman T-Bone Walker that could fetch up to 150,000 euros; a suit worn by Depeche Mode&#x27;s Martin Gore; and one of Madonna&#x27;s gold records.
The sale is being organised by Artpeges and Lemon Auction, which last year made a splash with the 385,500-euros sale of the infamous guitar that broke up Oasis, the British band formed by the brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher.
A full list of the roughly 200 items will be published online by Hotel Drouot on July 4.</span>

                              <span>Former OceanGate passenger and Journalist David Pogue says he doesn’t see how there is “any hope” for the missing submersible if it continues to remain underwater.

“There are no other crafts that can go to Titanic depths that can be mobilised in a day and a half, and even if there were, there isn’t one that can tow it back to the surface,” he told Sky News Australia.

“So I think the underwater search is an exercise in futility.”</span>

                              <span>An extensive search and rescue operation is underway to locate a commercial submersible that went missing during a dive to the Titanic shipwreck.
According to the US Coast Guard, contact with the submersible was lost about one hour and 45 minutes into the dive, with five people onboard. The vessel was reported overdue at 9.13pm local time on Sunday (12.13pm AEST, Monday).
The expedition was being run by US company OceanGate as part of an eight-day trip with guests paying US$250,000 per head to visit the wreck site. As of Monday afternoon (Tuesday morning in Australia), US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger said the watercraft likely had somewhere between 70 and the full 96 hours of oxygen available to the passengers.

Launched by Pope Francis, who has sought to make the Church more welcoming towards marginalised people, the gathering is part of a wide-ranging consultation of 1.3 billion Catholics on every continent, who have for the past two years been invited to express their views on the Church and social issues.

                              <span>Government ethics experts are already raising alarms about former President Donald Trump&#x27;s business dealings with Oman, and New York Times reporter Eric Lipton said on Tuesday that the arrangement Trump has forged is truly without precedent.
Writing on Twitter, Lipton broke down what makes this particular Trump deal particularly troublesome.
&quot;As a NYT reporter, I&#x27;ve been investigating Trump family international deals since 2016. India, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Panama,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I have never seen anything like the Oman deal, [regarding] the potential for a conflict of interest.&quot;
What makes the deal such a giant red flag, argues Lipton, is that the land being used to build the Trump real estate project in the country is actually owned by the government of Oman.

Added to this, notes Lipton, &quot;the developer, Dar al Arkan, is a Saudi real-estate company with close ties to the Saudi royal family,&quot; which has also put large investments into Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner&#x27;s private equity firm.
&quot;Oman is enormously important player in the Middle East,&quot; Lipton adds. &quot;Close ties with Saudi Arabia and Iran. US has sold F-16s/other military equipment.

&quot;Mr. Trump’s name is plastered on signs at the entrance of the project and in the lobby of the InterContinental Hotel in Muscat, the nearby capital of Oman, where a team of sales agents is invoking Mr. Trump’s name to help sell luxury villas at prices of up to $13 million, mostly targeting superrich buyers from around the world, including from Russia, Iran and India,&quot; reported Eric Lipton. &quot;Mr. Trump has been selling his name to global real estate developers for more than a decade.

Police arrested Tate, 36, and his brother Tristan, 34, and the two Romanian women late last year. Under preventive detention at first, they were placed under house arrest at the end of March.
The anti-organized crime prosecution&#x27;s unit (DIICOT) &quot;ordered the indictment&quot; of the four defendants for offenses including &quot;setting up an organised criminal group... trafficking in persons... rape&quot;, they said.
The brothers deny all the accusations. If found guilty, they would face years in prison.

Raids were carried out at the headquarters of the committee, which is known as Cojo, and at the offices of Solideo, the body in charge of the Olympic construction sites, a source close to the investigation told AFP.
The reason for the raid was not immediately clear but Cojo said they were &quot;cooperating fully with the investigators in order to facilitate their investigation.&quot;

                              <span>Search and rescue teams are racing to find a deep-sea vessel that went missing with five people on board during a dive to explore the wreck of the Titanic ocean liner. 
The US Coast Guard is leading the search for the small craft, named Titan, in the North Atlantic Ocean. The remote area is where the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew.
The Titan&#x27;s dive on Sunday is one of many that have been made to the wreck by OceanGate Expeditions since 2021. The sunken ship is about 2.4 miles (3.8 kilometers) below the surface.
The undersea exploration company has been chronicling the ship&#x27;s decay as well as the underwater ecosystem that has sprung up around it over the last century.

                              <span>NAIROBI, Jun 20 (IPS)  - Oil palm has brought significant benefits and prosperity to Liberia.

Kyiv’s forces may be temporarily halting their counteroffensive operations to re-evaluate their tactics for future operations, according to military experts. 
Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center Colonel Margo Grosberg said on 16 June that in his assessment “we won’t see an offensive over the next seven days”. 
The Wall Street Journal similarly reported on 17 June that Ukrainian forces “have mostly paused their advances in recent days” as the command in Kyiv re-examines tactics.

WNU Editor: After two weeks of fighting and losing thousands of soldiers and hundreds of pieces of equipment, the only thing that Ukraine has to show for it are about a dozen small villages and 45 square miles. A re-evaluation is necessary. 
There are also reports now coming in that Russia has launched a major offense in the northeastern part of the country. If true, Ukraine will need to draw on their reserves to counter it, thereby depriving men and equipment for their southern counteroffensive.</span>

The Kremlin has warned the US and Britain they will be seen as &#x27;full-fledged&#x27; participants in the war in Ukraine if Storm Shadow and HIMARS missiles are used to hit targets in Russia or Russian-occupied Crimea. 
Vladimir Putin&#x27;s defence minister Sergei Shoigu warned he will target &#x27;decision-making centres&#x27; in Ukraine - implying he plans to order his military to target Volodymyr Zelensky and his government leaders in Kyiv. 
Shoigu said: &#x27;According to our information, the leadership of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is planning to launch strikes on the territory of the Russian Federation, including Crimea, with HIMARS and Storm Shadow missiles.

Reuters: Ukraine targets initial $40 billion for &#x27;Green Marshall Plan&#x27; 
LONDON (Reuters) -Ukraine is seeking up to $40 billion to fund the first part of a &quot;Green Marshall Plan&quot; to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry, a senior Ukrainian official said ahead of an international summit. 
Politicians and financiers will discuss short-term funding issues as well as look at long-term reconstruction efforts at the two-day meeting, starting in London on Wednesday and co-hosted by Ukraine and Britain. 
It is expected to launch a &quot;war risk&quot; insurance scheme to cover companies that begin investing in Ukraine again and see government officials discuss behind the scenes if and how to use frozen Russian assets to fund some of the rebuild effort. 
The World Bank estimates Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction will cost more than $400 billion, three times the country&#x27;s gross domestic product. Since Russia&#x27;s invasion in February 2022, external backers have poured $59 billion into Ukraine to support it during the war.

WNU Editor: I just finished talking to a friend who lives in Odessa. And all that he talked about (besides the war) was how bad the corruption has become in the country. Basically if you want something, be ready to pay a bribe. 
I have zero confidence that the monies for this &#x27;Green Marshall Plan&#x27;, plus an EU financial package of $50 billion that is now being arranged, will go to the people who will rebuild the country. It is going to go somewhere else.</span>

Daily Mail: Biden warns Putin&#x27;s threat to use tactical nuclear weapons is &#x27;real&#x27; after Russian despot moved them close to the Polish border in Belarus 
* President Biden denounced Russia&#x27;s deployment of such weapons in Belarus 
* Belarus said they have started taking delivery of the tactical nuclear weapons 
Joe Biden has warned the threat of Russian President Vladimir Putin using tactical nuclear weapons is &#x27;real&#x27;, days after denouncing Russia&#x27;s deployment of such weapons in Belarus. 
It comes after Biden on Saturday called Putin&#x27;s announcement that Russia had deployed its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus &#x27;absolutely irresponsible&#x27;. 
&#x27;When I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,&#x27; Biden told a group of donors in California on Monday.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
