                              <span>Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell reveals there has been an untimely naval incident between Australian and Chinese ships.

The incident came just as relations were beginning to strengthen between the two nations.

Reportedly, Australian Naval divers received minor injuries after contact with sonar from a Chinese Naval ship, despite Australian communication to China’s vessel that the divers were nearby.

Defence Minister Richard Marles confirmed the incident and says the Australian government has “expressed its serious concerns” over the “unsafe and unprofessional interaction”.

“Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner.”</span>

The demonstration, the latest in a series of protests in cities across the country against the amnesty, took place two days after Spain&#x27;s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez won a four-year term with the backing of Catalan and Basque nationalist parties in return for agreeing to the law.</span>

                              <span>Argentine presidential candidate Javier Milei caused a commotion when he attended a production of Madame Butterfly at Buenos Aires&#x27; Teatro Colon. Milei, known for his radical libertarian views and promises to cut government spending, faced heckling from opponents and applause from supporters. The incident highlights the polarizing nature of the upcoming election, with Milei running against center-left Economy Minister Sergio Massa. The incident has gained widespread attention on social media.</span>

                              <span>The construction of a new freight train line in northern Mexico is threatening the biodiversity and habitats of various animal species. The project, which has been shrouded in secrecy, has raised concerns among local residents and conservationists who claim it ignores environmental considerations. The new rail line will fragment habitats. The lack of official information and communication from authorities has made it difficult for locals to understand the purpose and impact of the project.</span>

                              <span>Javier Milei, a right-wing Argentine presidential candidate, is following Donald Trump&#x27;s playbook by claiming that election results are dubious and that he may be deprived of the nation&#x27;s top job. Analysts believe this tactic is meant to energize Milei&#x27;s base and promote vigilance at polling stations, or to set the stage for refusing to concede a loss. While Argentina&#x27;s voting system has some irregularities, it is unlikely that fraud on a scale to sway an election could occur.</span>

                              <span>Sydney Morning Herald: Australian navy divers injured after sonar pulses detected from Chinese warship 
A Chinese warship’s “unsafe and unprofessional” use of sonar is suspected of injuring Australian navy divers during an operation in international waters.
Divers from HMAS Toowoomba suffered minor ear damage in Tuesday’s incident involving a People’s Liberation Army-Navy destroyer, which used its powerful sonar despite being warned Australian personnel were underwater nearby. 
The incident occurred before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit, sparking questions from the federal opposition about why the details were withheld until Saturday.

The Ukrainian military says it has established &quot;several bridgeheads&quot; on the eastern banks of the Dnieper River in Russian-occupied territory of the southern Kherson region following a &quot;series of successful operations.&quot; 
The Ukrainian Marine Corps said in a statement published on Facebook on November 17 that operations were continuing on the eastern banks of the Dnieper and that Russian forces had suffered heavy losses &quot;in manpower and equipment.&quot; 
Ukrainian forces are trying to push Russian forces away from the Dnieper to stop the shelling of civilian areas on the Ukrainian-held west bank, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said on November 17.

                              <span>Russian officials said Friday they are seeking a ban on the &quot;international LGBT public movement,&quot; building on a crackdown against liberal-leaning groups that has intensified since Moscow deployed troops to Ukraine.
Russia&#x27;s justice ministry said it had &quot;lodged an administrative legal claim with the Supreme Court to recognise the International LGBT public movement as extremist and ban its activity in Russia.&quot;
The ministry did not specify whether it was seeking the closure of any specific groups or organisations, or if the designation would apply more broadly to the LGBTQ community, causes and individuals.
The proposed ban is the latest in a long-standing crackdown against LGBTQ people in Russia, which has escalated since Russia launched its offensive on Ukraine last February.

                              <span>An independent Scotland would move quickly to rejoin the European Union, the Scottish government said on Friday as it laid out its plans for getting back into the bloc.
The administration led by the Scottish National Party (SNP) said that Scotland would &quot;apply to re-join the EU as soon as possible&quot; after independence, although that is not currently on the horizon.
The pro-independence government of the devolved parliament in Edinburgh made the comments in a paper that sought to lay out the benefits of EU membership.
&quot;Given the position of the main parties at Westminster (the UK parliament in London), the only route back to the EU for Scotland is by becoming an independent country,&quot; it said.

                              <span>Public sector employees and transport workers across Italy went on strike Friday in an action pitting trade unions against the hard-right government in Rome over its 2024 budget.
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni&#x27;s government has been accused of using the budget to chase votes ahead of next year&#x27;s European Parliament elections at the expense of workers and pensioners.
&quot;Meloni, the people are hungry&quot;, read one banner held aloft by protesters gathered in Rome&#x27;s historic Piazza del Popolo, while thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets in Genoa and Milan.
The walkout was called by two of the country&#x27;s largest unions, the CGIL and UIL, which say the tax-cutting budget woefully underfunds key sectors such as health, education and industry.
Teachers, healthcare workers, taxi drivers and postal workers were called to strike for eight hours nationwide, while some in the private sector, from steelworkers to shopkeepers, could join in central Italy.
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also transport minister, imposed restrictions on the strike to reduce the disruption, to the outrage of union leaders.
In what he described as a compromise based on &quot;common sense&quot;, he halved the duration of the transport workers and firefighters strike to four hours during the morning, while air travel is not included at all.
CGIL general secretary Maurizio Landini accused him of an &quot;attack on the right to strike&quot;.
The unions had sought to have their walkout defined as a general strike, which would have been allowed to last 24 hours.
But the watchdog that arbitrates strikes in Italy said it did not meet the criteria, as several sectors were excluded from the action, which is also being spread out over five days.</span>

                              <span>A French senator was in custody Friday on suspicion of drugging an MP with a view to assaulting her, prosecutors and sources familiar with the case told AFP.
Joel Guerriau, a centrist senator from western France, was being held for &quot;administering to a person without their knowledge a substance likely to diminish their judgement or self-control to commit a rape or sexual assault,&quot; prosecutors said on Thursday.
While the prosecutors named the victim only as &quot;a woman, who filed a complaint&quot;, several sources familiar with the case told AFP she was an MP.
She allegedly felt strange after accepting a drink on Tuesday night at the 66-year-old senator&#x27;s Paris home.
Prosecutors said the two were not in an intimate relationship.
Tests revealed that she had ecstasy in her system, investigators added, prompting her to file a criminal complaint.
Guerriau was arrested and held in custody under caught-in-the-act rules allowing police to override his parliamentary immunity, prosecutors said.
Broadcaster RMC, which first reported the story, said that police had searched his office and home, where prosecutors confirmed they found ecstasy.
Originally a banker, Guerriau has been a member of the senate since 2011 and is deputy head of the foreign and military affairs committee.
His lawyer, Remi-Pierre Drai, said he was &quot;outraged to see information from the investigation in the press&quot;.
&quot;I&#x27;m amazed that the victim&#x27;s name has not been leaked, unlike my client&#x27;s,&quot; he added.

                              <span>Indian rescuers said Friday they had drilled less than halfway through the debris to reach 40 men trapped in a collapsed tunnel for nearly a week.
A second heavy drill is to be airlifted into the northern state of Uttarakhand after the existing giant machine -- itself flown in as a replacement by the air force on Wednesday -- hit a boulder, officials said.
Excavators have been removing debris since Sunday morning to create an escape route for the workers after a portion of the tunnel they were building collapsed in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
Rescue efforts have been slowed by debris that has continued to fall.
Engineers are trying to drive a steel pipe about 90 centimetres (nearly three feet) wide through the debris -- wide enough for the trapped men to squeeze through.

                              <span>A Russian court on Thursday sentenced artist Alexandra Skochilenko to seven years in prison for spreading &quot;false information&quot; about the army after she swapped supermarket price tags with slogans criticizing Russia&#x27;s offensive in Ukraine.
The 33-year-old, known as Sasha, is the latest among thousands of Russians to be detained, jailed or fined for speaking out against Moscow&#x27;s military intervention.
Supporters shouted &quot;shame&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;re with you Sasha&quot; after the judge, Oksana Demiasheva, read out the verdict, an AFP journalist in court reported.
Some, mainly young people, pulled out banners saying &quot;she should not go to prison&quot;, while her lawyers left without giving any comment.
Skochilenko wore a colorful T-shirt with a large red heart printed on it. She made a heart shape with her hands and smiled to supporters during the hearing.
&quot;Every person in this room wants only one thing: Peace. Why fight?&quot; she said in a closing statement.
Skochilenko had said in an earlier hearing that she &quot;just wanted to stop the war. That was my motivation&quot;.
&#x27;They give less for murder&#x27;
&quot;It&#x27;s not Sasha who should go to prison, but the people who convicted her,&quot; 20-year-old Anton, who declined to give his full name, citing security concerns, told AFP after the verdict was announced.
One of the messages included claims about a Russian strike on a theatre in Mariupol that was reported to have left hundreds dead.
&quot;The cost of this war is the life of our children&quot; and &quot;Putin has been lying to us from television screens for 20 years&quot; were written on other tags.
An elderly shopper reported the swapped tags to police.

Execution-style shootings carried out by &quot;child soldiers&quot;, apartment buildings rocked by bombings, innocent relatives targeted in vendettas, and the morning news summarising the night&#x27;s death toll -- all have become disturbingly routine in the normally quiet country.
&quot;No other country in Europe is seeing anything like this,&quot; said Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson as he vowed to defeat the gangs.
&quot;Swedish legislation was not designed for gang wars and child soldiers. But we&#x27;re changing that now,&quot; he said.

The United Nations said it would not be able to deliver basic necessities to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Friday due to communication collapsing in the Palestinian enclave and a lack of fuel. The World Health Organization warned that the paralyzed aid would mean the &quot;immediate possibility of starvation&quot; for the roughly 2.3 million people living in the embattled region. 
&quot;The communications network in #Gaza is down because there is NO fuel,&quot; the U.N. agency that operates in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a statement on social media. &quot;This makes it impossible to manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys.&quot;

RT: Palestinians believe they can’t coexist with Israel – poll 
Many Palestinians say they will “never forgive” Israel for its military action in Gaza, according to a survey 
A significant majority of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza say that they don’t envision a future where they can coexist peacefully alongside Israel, according to the findings of a poll. 
The densely-populated Gaza enclave has been subjected to an unprecedented bombardment for more than five weeks as part of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s vow to “eliminate Hamas” in response to the militant group’s cross-border attack on October 7.

Eugene Rumer and Andrew S. Weiss, Wall Street Journal: It’s Time to End Magical Thinking About Russia’s Defeat 
Putin has withstood the West’s best efforts to reverse his invasion of Ukraine, and his hold on power is firm. The U.S. and its allies need a new strategy: containment. 
As Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress, not to mention the pro-Putin leanings of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.
 Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.

National Interest: The Joe Biden-Xi Jinping Summit: Nothing Accomplished? 
Despite Washington and Beijing’s apparent satisfaction with the meeting, the tensions at the heart of the relationship show no signs of abating. 
 After meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in San Franciso on November 15, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping (separately) announced several agreements that reflect their shared interest in reducing U.S.-China tensions. They agreed to resume military-to-military exchanges at both senior and operational levels. They also agreed to improve cooperation on counternarcotics, primarily aimed at ending the flow of Chinese-origin fentanyl into the United States. In addition, Washington and Beijing will expand dialogue on addressing the potential risks of artificial intelligence, continue to hold working-level consultations on a wider range of bilateral issues, and seek to increase educational and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Biden and Xi also hailed the agreements announced earlier in the week on enhanced bilateral cooperation on climate issues.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Ukraine Aid From US Won’t Be Approved for a Month, Maybe Longer 
New US aid for Ukraine risks slipping to mid-December and maybe longer, casting doubt on Washington’s ability to keep up the flow of weapons that both the Biden administration and the Ukrainian government say is vital. 
Ukraine’s congressional backers are engaged in a tough battle over an expansive aid package whose fate is now enmeshed in a partisan fight over border policies and torn from must-pass bills that would prompt swift action. 
The soonest Congress could complete negotiations and pass new Ukraine assistance is mid-December, nearly two months after President Joe Biden first requested $61 billion for the country in its war against Russia. 

The US has begun restricting the flow of military assistance because of the wait, according to a Defense Department spokeswoman.

Kyiv Independent: Zelensky: Artillery munition deliveries to Ukraine have decreased since Israel-Hamas War 
The delivery of artillery shells to Ukraine from Western allies has decreased since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 16. 
In particular, supplies of the much-needed 155mm artillery shells have &quot;really slowed down,&quot; he said. 
Zelensky added that the U.S. did not formally say that they would stop or decrease the flow of artillery shells to Ukraine, but rather that &quot;everyone is fighting for (stockpiles) themselves.&quot; 
&quot;This is life. I&#x27;m not saying that this is positive, but this is life, and we have to defend what&#x27;s ours.&quot;

 WNU Editor: During the Second World War 70% of the military casualties on the front-lines came from artillery duels and strikes. The same can be said about this war, maybe even higher if one includes drone strikes. 
Bottom line. If supplies of artillery shells to Ukraine are being cut and/or stopped, this war will end in 2024 with a Russian victory.

                              <span>Paul Poast, The Atlantic: Not a World War But a World at War 
Just in the past 24 months, an astonishing number of armed conflicts have started, renewed, or escalated. Some had been fully frozen, meaning that the sides had not sustained direct combat in years; others were long simmering, meaning that low-level fighting would intermittently erupt. All have now become active. 
The list encompasses not just the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, but hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, Serbian military measures against Kosovo, fighting in Eastern Congo, complete turmoil in Sudan since April, and a fragile cease-fire in Tigray that Ethiopia seems poised to break at any time. Syria and Yemen have not exactly been quiet during this period, and gangs and cartels continuously menace governments, including those in Haiti and Mexico. All of this comes on top of the prospect of a major war breaking out in East Asia, such as by China invading the island of Taiwan.

WNU Editor: The last paragraph of the above post sums it perfectly .... 
.... Wars were already a persistent feature of the international system. But they were not widespread. War was always happening somewhere, in other words, but war was not happening everywhere. The above dynamics could change that tendency. The prevalence of war, not just its persistence, could now be our future.</span>

                              <span>SFGate: Joe Biden floats Gavin Newsom presidency at APEC welcome reception in San Francisco 
President Joe Biden led off his remarks at an APEC welcome reception in San Francisco on Wednesday evening by semi-jokingly floating a future Gavin Newsom presidency. 
“I want to talk about Gov. Newsom. Want to thank him,” Biden said at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, according to a transcript released by the White House. 
“He’s been one hell of a governor, man. Matter of fact, he could be anything he wants. He could have the job I’m looking for.” 
Newsom, the governor of California, has for years been a rumored presidential candidate. Those rumors have subsided slightly in recent months, as Newsom has taken on more of a surrogate role for Biden’s 2024 re-election campaign. But even a full-throated endorsement of Biden hasn’t fully killed off the presumption that Newsom is waiting in the wings, either as a 2024 last-minute replacement, or for a full-fledged 2028 run.

                              <span>Pepe Escobar, Strategic Culture: Evidence keeps piling up, via leaked reports, of an across-the-board breakdown in the Ukrainian frontlines.

 
Previously, we focused on the southern Zaporozhye front.  Now let’s focus on Kharkov, in the northeast. 
The attached document, fully verified for authenticity, is a July report to the Chief of Staff of the operational-tactical group “Sumy”. 
The report essentially says that it’s impossible to withdraw two thirds of the A7383 unit from the battlefield to recover combat readiness because the remaining one third is incapable of holding the fort – which happens to extend along 55.5 km.

WNU Editor: Conflicts like the Russia - Ukraine war where both sides are not willing to compromise to end the war do take a long time to resolve itself. This war will not be an exception. But all wars do come to an end, and the above analysis by Pepe Escobar is repeating what all of my contacts/friends/and family members in Ukraine have been telling me for the past few months. 
Bottom line. Time is not on Ukraine&#x27;s side.

 
Update: I concur with the analysis below on Russia&#x27;s current war strategy.

I think it&#x27;s pretty clear what the Russians are doing with their ongoing &quot;mud season offensive&quot; in Ukraine, really a collection of local attacks across the length of the front line (with the exception of Kherson, but the Ukrainians are playing themselves there). These attacks… pic.twitter.com/7uWTPqFcoM

Pandemic restrictions. The Russia - Ukraine war that has engulfed my family and friends on both sides. Taking care and providing guidance to hundreds of Ukrainian families who have fled Ukraine to start a new home in Canada. Providing home care to my 97 year old mother who is now near the end of her life. And doing all of this while still working 60+ hours per week. Correction .... always working 24/7.

Sighhh ....

It has been a challenge. 
And I am getting too old for this shit. :) 
But tonight my young, beautiful, super intelligent and always entertaining step-daughter surprised me by taking me to my favourite restaurant in Montreal (Joe Beef). Regarded as one of the best restaurants in North America, and the favourite restaurant for people like the late Anthony Bourdain, Joe Rogan, Prime Minister Trudeau, and others .... sighhh ....  they certainly did not disappoint tonight. 
Best table in the house. Best food. Best wine. Fantastic service.  A personal visit from the chef and some extras from him. And most important of all .... being with great company in a place where the energy and atmosphere was fantastic.

Yup. I needed this break tonight.</span>

                              <span>In this special edition, Annette Young heads to South Korea, which, despite its impressive economic record, consistently scores poorly for gender equality among advanced nations. It has the worst gender pay gap among OECD nations, while its traditional workplace culture results in many women giving up their careers after childbirth. Now the country has recorded the lowest fertility rate in the world, with women of reproductive age having fewer than one child on average. Sex crimes against women are frequent in a criminal justice system that often issues light sentences to perpetrators. We meet feminists who face online and physical threats including those who vow publicly not to marry or have children in protest of conservative societal attitudes. Meanwhile the country’s ultra-conservative government said it plans to abolish South Korea’s Gender Equality Ministry. We also talk to an advisor to the ruling political party who claims radical feminism has more in common with fascist parties in Europe and says anger over the issue has reached boiling point.</span>

According to reports, a flyer claiming the Jews were responsible for 9/11 was placed on an outside window along with a swastika. Also found was an image of a Star of David with a knife through it. 
&quot;Hate crimes and civil rights violations have no place in New Hampshire,&quot; said a spokesperson for Attorney General John Formella. &quot;The attorney general’s office is committed to working with our local, state, and federal partners to identify these acts and their perpetrators and to pursuing action to the fullest extent possible.&quot;

In a post to X, Rep. Chris Pappas, D-(NH) wrote, &quot;I’m thinking of all my friends in Laconia tonight. This antisemitic vandalism is part of a surge in hateful attacks on the Jewish community across the country. There is simply no place for bigotry and hate in our society, and we must speak with one voice to condemn it.&quot;
As NBC News points out, the incident comes as law enforcement agencies report a significant spike in antisemitic hate crimes around the country.</span>

Bin Laden&#x27;s &quot;Letter to America&quot; began being shared on TikTok on Tuesday, sparking a fierce debate about US backing for Israel in its current war against Hamas.
The transcript includes bin Laden&#x27;s assertion that the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001 due to its support of Israel.
Links to the original were replaced on the Guardian website with a statement saying it had been shared &quot;without the full context&quot;.

                              <span>Chinese President Xi Jinping appears ready to deploy his country&#x27;s soft power after his summit with U.S .President Joe Biden -- in the form of cuddly pandas.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing mean that only a handful of the black and white bears remain in the United States, with three having left the national zoo in Washington earlier this month.
But Xi told a dinner after meeting Biden in California on Wednesday that China could send new pandas as &quot;envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people.&quot;
The White House said it would be happy to have more bamboo-chewing bears.
&quot;Should the decision be made by the PRC (People&#x27;s Republic of China) to restore some of the pandas to the United States, we would absolutely welcome them back,&quot; National Security Council spokesman John K…</span>

                              <span>More than 100 people, including 16 children, have died and over 700,000 been forced out of their homes in the Horn of Africa due to flash flooding, the British charity Save the Children said Thursday.
The region, particularly Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, has been lashed by unrelenting downpours since the beginning of the month due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, inundating homes and farmland.
About 46 people had died in Kenya, 32 in Somalia and another 33 in Ethiopia, Save the Children said, warning the rains were &quot;showing no signs of slowing down&quot;.
The Horn of Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events are occurring with increased frequency and intensity.
The region is emerging from the worst drought in four decades after multiple failed rainy seasons that left millions of people in need and devastated crops and livestock.
&quot;Heavy flooding and displacement have cut off families and children from basic services including access to food, healthcare, water and hygiene services,&quot; said Xavier Joubert, Ethiopia director for Save the Children.
&quot;With that comes the real risk of waterborne diseases including cholera and measles.&quot;
Humanitarian groups have warned that the situation is only likely to worsen and called for urgent global intervention as El Nino is expected to last until at least April 2024.
El Nino is typically associated with increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere.
Between October 1997 and January 1998, devastating floods caused by El Nino led to more than 6,000 deaths in five Horn of Africa countries.
At least 1,800 people died in Somalia where the Juba River burst its banks.
At the end of 2019, 265 people died and tens of thousands were displaced during two months of relentless rainfall in several countries in East Africa.

                              <span>A grandson of French war hero and former president Charles de Gaulle said Thursday he wanted Russian citizenship, saying Russia offered “great possibilities”.
Pierre de Gaulle is little known in France, but Russian state media have heralded his pro-Kremlin statements as proof that leading Western voices support Moscow’s assault in Ukraine.
“It would be an honour for me to acquire Russian citizenship,” he told a journalist at the Saint Petersburg Cultural Forum, Russian agencies said.
He also said that Russia was “fighting for traditional values, the family and spirituality” in Ukraine and that “NATO had lost”.
This is not the first time the previously obscure scion of France’s most famous political family has made waves.
Yves de Gaulle, his eldest brother, told Le Parisien daily in January that his sibling’s views “concern no one else other than himself – not me, not our family and even less the general.”
Charles de Gaulle headed the French resistance movement from London during World War II, before returning triumphantly to France.

As president, he positioned France as a hinge between the US-dominated Western bloc and the Soviet Union during the Cold War – a position that his grandson claims to represent. 
But historians agree de Gaulle also kept France firmly anchored in the Western alliance. His views are a source of debate in France, particularly when applied to contemporary events.

                              <span>Asia Times: CIA boss heads for Z-Day in Kiev as Ukraine falters 
William Burns, boss of the CIA, is flying to the Ukrainian capital for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky.  

Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?

The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.

FOX News: US forces in Syria and Iraq attacked 57 times since mid-October: Defense official 
The official told Fox News that three of those attacks have taken place on Wednesday, when rockets were fired toward Mission Support Site Green Village in eastern Syria. According to the official, the rockets didn&#x27;t land on base and didn&#x27;t cause any injuries. 
Wednesday&#x27;s attacks mark the 57th attack on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq since Oct. 17, and there have been six since Sunday.

U.S. forces on Sunday conducted precision air strikes in eastern Syria against two facilities used by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other related groups.

                              <span>Research conducted by Yale University has revealed that over 2,400 children from Ukraine, aged between six and 17 years old, have been taken to 13 facilities across Belarus since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The report suggests that the children were transported from various cities in Ukraine to Belarus in an ongoing practice facilitated by Russia and coordinated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko. Once in Belarus, the children have allegedly been subjected to military training and re-education.</span>

                              <span>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez won the backing of parliament for another term, with the country divided over his amnesty for Catalan separatists. Sanchez agreed to grant amnesty to those facing legal action for their involvement in Catalonia&#x27;s separatist movement, in exchange for the support of Catalan separatist parties. Critics argue that the amnesty undermines the rule of law and hurts Spain&#x27;s international reputation. Protests against the amnesty have taken place nationwide, with some turning violent.</span>

The aim is to minimize the risk to soldiers by blocking and damaging the tunnels, rather than sending troops in. However, experts warn that without ground forces, it is difficult to assess the extent of the damage. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the US and European Union.</span>

However, economists believe that the increase in the jobless rate is not necessarily a bad sign as it is due to an expansion in the labor force rather than a decline in employment.</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
