Lithuania is to close two of its six border crossings with Belarus. 
The two rural crossing points, which are not used by commercial vehicles, will be closed from Friday. 
The government said the decision was in response to changes in the geopolitical situation and threats to national security, as well as smuggling. 
Belarus&#x27;s western neighbours have increased security since Minsk granted shelter to fighters from Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary group. 
This came as part of a deal to end a brief mutiny in Russia by Wagner in June.

Tucker Carlson posted his latest episode on Monday, a roughly hour and a half sit-down with Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in which the two discussed a wide range of topics including Ukraine, bio-labs, and who is responsible for his uncle’s assassination. 
On the subject of bio-labs, the former Fox News host brought up how Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland acknowledged that Ukraine “has biological research facilities.” 
Carlson asked Kennedy why the U.S. would provide funds for such labs, prompting a lengthy explanation from the Democrat. 
“Because we’re developing bioweapons,” RFK Jr. claimed, before getting into the history of the move.

As Ecowas chiefs prepare to meet to discuss possible action against junta, civic group says ‘we need to be ready’

Supporters of the Nigerien junta are calling for the mass mobilisation of citizens against the threat of military action by a west African regional bloc that is calling for the restoration of the country’s deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum. 
With a delayed meeting of military chiefs of staff of the Ecowas bloc scheduled to take place later this week, regional tensions over the July coup against Bazoum appeared to be deepening, despite the junta’s efforts to suggest they were open to talks.

Moscow has claimed that two F-35 jets from the pro-American coalition came dangerously close to two Su-35 belonging to Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria on August 14, marking the latest episode in a series of confrontations between the US and Russian military aircraft. 
Deputy head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of the Warring Parties (CPVS) in Syria, Rear Admiral Vadim Kulit, alleged on August 15 that the incident occurred in the Al-Tanf area. 

Kulit highlighted that the Russian Su-35 fighter jets were conducting a prearranged flight along the southern border of Syria. 
“On August 14, from 12:35 to 12:50, in the Al-Tanf area at an altitude of about 9,100 meters, there was a dangerous rapprochement between two coalition F-35 fighters and two Su-35 aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces, which were making a planned flight along the southern border of Syria. Russian pilots, demonstrating high professionalism, took the necessary measures promptly to prevent a collision with coalition fighters,” he said.

Poland is holding its largest military parade in decades on Tuesday, in a flex of defensive muscle that comes as tensions rise on the border between the NATO nation and key Russian ally Belarus. 
Poland’s Defense Ministry said the celebration of Polish Army Day on Tuesday would be marked by a showcase that includes 200 units of Polish and foreign military equipment, 92 aircraft and 2,000 service members. 
The parade includes some of the latest technology Poland has in its arsenal, including US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, South Korean K2 tanks and K9 self-propelled howitzers, HIMARS rocket launchers, Krab self-propelled howitzers, as well as US-made Patriot missile batteries systems, which are part of the Polish “WISŁA” air defense system.

Ukrainian security services have released to CNN exclusive footage showing the moment in July when they used an experimental sea drone to attack Russia’s bridge to annexed Crimea, providing new details on the attack and warning more such assaults will follow. 
It’s the first time the SBU have openly claimed responsibility for the operation. 
The attack on July 17 caused damage to the road lanes of the bridge, and, according to Russian officials, killed two civilians. It was the second attack on the vital crossing, and showed how hard it is to defend the only independent Russian link to the peninsula.

The official blamed Washington’s desire for regime change in Pyongyang for ratcheting up tensions. He also accused the US of increasing its military presence in the region by deploying nuclear-capable aircraft and a submarine to the area.

The tragic disaster that we just witnessed in Hawaii should break all of our hearts. 

The death count just keeps going up, and it is being reported that these were the deadliest fires in the United States in more than 100 years. 
 In addition, Hawaii Governor Josh Green is telling us that this was actually “the largest natural disaster” that his state has ever experienced. 
More than 2,700 structures have been burned down in Lahaina alone, and it is being estimated that the value of the property that has been destroyed is over 5 billion dollars.

The blast on Monday shook the commercial area of San Cristobal, less than 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the capital Santo Domingo, sparking a fire that burned for hours, and a huge column of smoke.</span>

The event was also live-streamed to over 40,000 online viewers around the world.  Inaugural Dean of SFT, Professor Erin Cho, believes that the School is at the forefront of the newest developments in all fashion-related sectors, not just locally and regionally, but also globally. “We contribute to Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area (GBA) through our strong research capabilities.”   “SFT is unique in the sense that we’re the leading and most specialised [fashion-related technology] research centre in the whole of China,” she added, citing that the School’s research capabilities range from sustainability, biodegradable and smart materials, to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the metaverse, and all the other technological components.

                              <span>Business Insider: Russia is quickly depleting its fleet of warplanes through overuse, and Ukraine deploying F-16s could worsen the situation: expert 
* An engineering expert says the Russian air force is being depleted through overuse in Ukraine. 
* The arrival of Ukraine&#x27;s F-16s could worsen the problem, wrote Rand&#x27;s Michael Bohnert. 
* Ukraine says it urgently needs F-16s to reduce Russia&#x27;s air dominance. 
Russia&#x27;s fighter planes are malfunctioning because of overuse, handing Ukraine a potential advantage in its air battles against the Russian air force, an engineering expert said. 
In an article for Defense News, Michael Bohnert, an engineer at the Rand Corporation think tank, said that Russia&#x27;s warplanes were running out of &quot;aircraft life&quot;. 
&quot;Overuse of these aircraft is also costing Russia as the war drags on,&quot; he wrote, adding that by his calculations as many as 57 Russian planes, many repurposed Soviet-era machines, might have been lost because they broke down since the start of the war.

Washington has chosen its own interests over its allies, a French diplomat has told the newspaper, following Victoria Nuland’s visit to Niger. 
The presence of the ‘Maidan midwife,’ US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, in post-coup Niger has enraged Washington’s NATO ally, France, Le Figaro reported over the weekend, citing a source within the French Foreign Ministry. 
The US “did the exact opposite of what we thought they would do,” a French diplomatic source told the paper, adding that “with allies like these, we do not need enemies.” 
Paris has been insisting on the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Bazoum ever since a new military government came to power in Niger in a coup in late July.

Niger’s junta claimed Sunday it had gathered evidence to prosecute the country’s ousted President Mohamed Bazoum for “high treason,” upping the stakes in their brinkmanship against key neighbors in West Africa who have vowed to restore constitutional order in the coup-hit country. 
“The Nigerien government has to date, gathered the necessary evidence to prosecute the deposed president and his local and foreign accomplices before the competent national and international authorities for high treason and undermining internal and external security of Niger,” said a statement by the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) of Niger, the military council that toppled the government in July.

According to the defense minister, Ukraine&#x27;s defeat will become &quot;a factor in combating modern neocolonialism&quot; 
PATRIOT PARK /Moscow Region/, August 15. /TASS/. Ukraine’s military resources are &quot;almost exhausted,&quot; while Moscow’s special military operation has made it clear that there is nothing on the battlefield that is invulnerable to Russian weapons, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said in an address to the 11th Moscow Conference on International Security. 
According to him, history has once again chosen Russia to be &quot;a driving force promoting the interests of the majority of independent states,&quot; while Kiev’s defeat will become &quot;a factor in combating modern neocolonialism.&quot;

* Fitch Ratings cut its assessment of the banking industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
* But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score from AA- to A+ would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC. 
* “If we were to move it to A+, then that would recalibrate all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions,” Wolfe said.
A Fitch Ratings analyst warned that the U.S. banking industry has inched closer to another source of turbulence — the risk of sweeping rating downgrades on dozens of U.S. banks that could even include the likes of JPMorgan Chase. 
The ratings agency cut its assessment of the industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score, to A+ from AA-, would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in an exclusive interview at the firm’s New York headquarters.

Reuters: US, South Korea, Japan to launch new defence steps at Camp David: Officials 
WASHINGTON – The United States, Japan and South Korea will launch a series of joint initiatives on technology, education and defence when the countries’ leaders gather at Camp David on Friday, according to senior US administration officials, amid mounting shared concerns about China. 
While the summit is unlikely to produce a formal security arrangement that commits the nations to each others’ defence, they will agree to mutual understanding about regional responsibilities and set up a three-way hotline to communicate in times of crisis, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
US President Joe Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol to the storied presidential retreat in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains as the Asian nations work to mend their tattered diplomatic relations in the face of greater regional threats posed both by China’s rise and North Korea.

August 15 has been declared a national holiday to celebrate the Taliban government, which is still not recognised by any country. 
The Afghan Taliban is marking the second anniversary of its return to power with a public holiday, celebrating the takeover of Kabul and the establishment of what it described as security across the country under an “Islamic system”. 
“On the second anniversary of the conquest of Kabul, we would like to congratulate the mujahid [holy warrior] nation of Afghanistan and ask them to thank Almighty Allah for this great victory,” the spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said in a statement on Tuesday.

* Argentinian stocks and its sovereign dollar bonds were also lower Monday. 
Argentina’s central bank devalued its currency, the peso, by close to 18% and hiked its benchmark interest rate by a whopping 21 percentage points to 118% on Monday following a shock primary election win by far-right libertarian Javier Milei. 
The moves were a bid by the government to calm markets in the wake of the Argentinian congressman’s surprise victory, which gave him the largest share of votes in the country’s presidential primary election at roughly 30%, far exceeding forecasts. 
Markets had been betting on favorable results for moderate candidates. Argentina’s presidential election will be held in October.

                              <span>RT: Zelensky tells Ukrainians to avoid bars and clubs 
The Ukrainian president claimed “everyone is at war” and must be “working for victory” 
President Vladimir Zelensky has criticized Ukrainian civilians for not showing enough solidarity with the soldiers risking their lives on the frontlines in the conflict with Russia.
“Ukraine is at war. And those who are not fighting on the frontline must help fight. Not in bars, not in clubs, not by street racing or some kind of ostentatious consumption, but by helping the warriors in a very specific way. To say the least of it,” Zelensky said on Monday in his nightly video address.

Reuters: US to send Ukraine new security aid worth $200 million, State Dept says 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States said on Monday it will send Ukraine new security assistance valued at $200 million, including air defense munitions, artillery rounds, and additional mine-clearing equipment. 
The assistance will also include anti-armor capabilities, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. 
Two U.S. officials told Reuters last Monday that Washington would begin to dole out $6.2 billion of funds discovered after a Pentagon accounting error that overvalued billions of dollars of Ukraine aid.

The Telegraph: Germany considers ban on far-Right AfD 
 Germany is debating whether to ban the far-Right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as the party surges to 21 per cent in the polls, amid warnings from intelligence officials that its members are becoming increasingly extreme. 
 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, warned in a speech to the country’s domestic intelligence agency that “we all have it in our hands to put those who despise our democracy in their place”. 
His speech at the castle where the German post-war constitution was created has widely been seen as support for a ban after Thomas Haldenwang, the domestic spy chief, warned about growing Right-wing extremist influence in the party.

WNU Editor: In order to save democracy you must ban your opponent from running in the next election. 
I am seeing a trend. 
US Democrat prosecutors are doing all that they can to make sure former President Trump cannot run in 2024. Ukraine President Zelensky has banned and/or imprisoned his major political opponents. And now we have Germany moving to ban the country&#x27;s second most popular (and growing) political party. 
There is some stuff that you just cannot make up.</span>

At least 96 people reported dead after wildfires tore through Maui

President Biden was sharply criticized on Sunday after telling reporters during a Delaware beach getaway that he had &quot;no comment&quot; on the rising death toll in Hawaii from severe wildfires. 
&quot;After a couple hours on the Rehoboth beach, @potus was asked about the rising death toll in Hawaii,&quot; Bloomberg&#x27;s Justin Sink posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. He said that the president responded with &quot;no comment&quot; before he went home. 
Video later confirmed his account, showing as Biden paused briefly before responding and getting into his transportation.

                              <span>Far-right populist candidate Javier Milei emerged as the biggest vote-getter in Argentina&#x27;s primary elections for presidential candidates. With around 92% votes counted, Milei had around 30% of the total vote, making him an unexpected but real contender for the presidency. Milei, an admirer of Trump, wants to abolish the central bank, legalise the sale of human organs, and make it easier to own handguns.</span>

&quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters,&quot; Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage&#x27;s exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage&#x27;s complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…</span>

Nuland&#x27;s trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.

Naeem Panjutha said the petition challenging the weekend conviction had been filed in Islamabad High Court which will hear the case on Wednesday. Ex-cricketer Khan, 70, was jailed on charges of selling state gifts unlawfully during his tenure as premier from 2018 to 2022.</span>

The number is close to the total documented in 2022 and is close to three times more than what was recorded in 2021.

Polls show the former stand-up comedian&#x27;s crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country&#x27;s most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.

At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree &quot;a national disgrace&quot; after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
