“I mean, she is one of the hardest working members of the family, she’s regularly vying with him to take the top spot each year, she’s so hard working,” Ms Nash told Sky News Australia. 

“She kind of issues the media spotlight and the interest, she just gets on with the job.”</span>

                              <span>Former world number one and 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has announced he will retire from tennis after the Laver Cup in London later this month. 

The 41-year-old made the announcement via a social media message posted on Twitter on Thursday. 

The sporting icon cited injuries as the main reason behind his decision to retire. 

“As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries,” Mr Federer said. 

“I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form, but I also know my body’s capacities and limits and its message to me lately has been clear. 

“Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognise when it is time to end my competitive career.”</span>

Footage recorded by Michael Schwab initially shows a trapper sitting atop the alligator while working to bind the reptile, said to be over 10 feet long. The creature is then seen hoisted up by a tow truck, before four people help place it into the back of a pickup truck.

Wranglers from Bayou City Gator Savers posted that the alligator was 10 foot 6 inches long. Local media said the animal weighed 400 pounds.</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg: Bernstein Quants Say $7.6 Trillion US Bear Market Has More to Go 
(Bloomberg) -- US stocks are nursing losses of $7.6 trillion this year, but if history is any guide, they’re likely in for even more declines before the bear market is over, according to Sanford C. Bernstein quantitative strategists. 
An analysis of the 15 major routs since 1937 shows peak-to-trough price drops averaged 28%, deeper than the current drawdown of 20%, the team led by analyst Ann Larson wrote in a note on Sept. 13. 
The average bear market lasted seven-to-eight months and included three rallies with returns of 9% and lasting about 22 days on average -- in line with this year, they said. 
“We believe this bear market has more room to run because most major global synchronized selloffs have ended with a moderate inflation/low growth regime, and we are not there yet,” Larson said.

Daily Mail: White House pledges new military aid package for Ukraine &#x27;very, very soon&#x27; that will put the total over $14B - as John Kirby says China hasn&#x27;t done &#x27;anything overt&#x27; to aid Russia&#x27;s war effort and Putin meets Xi to laud Beijing&#x27;s &#x27;balanced position&#x27; 
* New package expected to include more long-range and artillery weapons 
* It would be the 21st military and economic aid package 
* Ukraine is appealing for more arms after battlefield gains 
* Russian President Putin met China&#x27;s Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan and praised China for its &#x27;balanced&#x27; position on the war 
* Putin and Xi last met before Russia launched its invasion 
The White House is preparing to announce yet another military aid package for Ukraine as its military continues to make territorial gains in its effort to seize back territory from Russia in its northeast and south. 
The package, the 21st tranche of security assistance, will come &#x27;very, very soon,&#x27; White House coordinator for strategic communications for national security John Kirby said Thursday. 
Although the Pentagon has yet to announce details, he indicated the package would include more of the long-range artillery and rocket systems that have allowed Ukraine to strike Russia behind its own lines, to devastating effect.

Reuters: Iran to join Asian security body led by Russia, China 
DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran has moved a step closer towards becoming a permanent member of a central Asian security body dominated by Russia and China, as Tehran seeks to overcome economic isolation imposed by U.S. sanctions. 
Foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian on Thursday said Iran had signed a memorandum of obligations to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is holding a summit this week in Uzbekistan. 
The body, formed in the 2001 as a talking shop for Russia, China and ex-Soviet states in Central Asia, expanded four years ago to include India and Pakistan, with a view to playing a bigger role as counterweight to Western influence in the region.

Facebook has been spying on the private messages and data of American users and reporting them to the FBI if they express anti-government or anti-authority sentiments — or question the 2020 election — according to sources within the Department of Justice. 
Under the FBI collaboration operation, somebody at Facebook red-flagged these supposedly subversive private messages over the past 19 months and transmitted them in redacted form to the domestic terrorism operational unit at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, without a subpoena.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday urged China not to back Moscow in its war against Kyiv, saying the whole would should be aligned against Moscow&#x27;s aggression in Ukraine and not remain on the sidelines. 
&quot;We don&#x27;t think anybody should be on the sidelines,&quot; White House spokesman John Kirby told CNN in an interview on Thursday as Chinese President Xi Jinping met Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Uzbekistan. 
&quot;The whole world should be lined up against what Mr. Putin is doing.&quot;  &quot;This is not the time for any kind of business as usual with Mr. Putin,&quot; Kirby added.

At a time of increasing animosity with the West, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in person for the first time since the start of the Ukraine war to showcase their strong ties. 
The two authoritarian leaders gathered on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Uzbekistan&#x27;s ancient Silk Road city of Samarkand in a show meant to signal deeper coordination and unity between the two countries and reaffirm their relationship amid major battlefield setbacks for Moscow in its nearly seven-month war in Ukraine, which has seen China walk a cautious but supportive line for the Kremlin.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for their first face-to-face talks since the start of the conflict in Ukraine on Thursday, hailing their strategic ties in defiance of the West. 
Sitting across from each other at two long rounded tables and flanked by aides, the two leaders met on the sidelines of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in ex-Soviet Uzbekistan. 
The meeting was part of Xi&#x27;s first trip abroad since the early days of the pandemic and for Putin a chance to show Russia has not been fully isolated despite Western efforts.

   BBC News: Putin-Xi talks: Russian leader reveals China&#x27;s &#x27;concern&#x27; over Ukraine 
Vladimir Putin has acknowledged China&#x27;s &quot;concern&quot; over Ukraine, in his first face-to-face talks with President Xi Jinping since the Russian invasion. 
But speaking in Uzbekistan, Mr Putin also thanked China for its &quot;balanced position&quot; - and said US &quot;attempts to create a unipolar world&quot; would fail. 
Mr Xi said China was willing to work together with Russia as &quot;great powers&quot;. 
China hasn&#x27;t endorsed Russia&#x27;s invasion but has grown trade and other ties with Moscow since it was launched. 
The two leaders&#x27; meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Samarkand comes at a crucial point in the Ukraine war, as Russian troops lose ground in parts of the country.

WNU editor: My Chinese sources tell me that Chinese President Xi&#x27;s concerns stem from what Putin told him during the Winter Olympics in February when it came to Ukraine, and what has happened since. 
Bottom line. 
Russia is China&#x27;s most important strategic ally. The last thing that Beijing wants to see is the war in Ukraine resulting in a very unstable Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has denounced what he calls Western attempts to create a &quot;unipolar world&quot; as he met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Samarkand. 
Putin praised Beijing&#x27;s &quot;balanced position&quot; on the war in Ukraine - China has pointedly refused to criticise Russia’s action in Ukraine and criticised Western sanctions against Moscow. 
Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid tensions with the US that followed a recent visit to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

(see Yevgeny Prigozhin(unofficial head of the Wagner group&#x27;s speech below). 

The speech is quite direct...

    As to what is my take on the head of the Wagner Group looking for recruits at Russian prisons. He is going to be very successful. I have met people who have served time in Russian prisons, and it is not a place you want to be. I would not be surprised if a good chunk of these long term prisoners (100,000 prisoners serving over ten years) will take the offer. 
This is also nothing new. Ukraine did the same thing when the war started .... Ukrainian prisoners will be released from jail to fight in war (Washington Examiner)</span>

* Vice President Kamala Harris insisted on Sunday that the southern border was &#x27;secure&#x27; during an interview on Sunday 
* But migrants arriving in DC, close to her home, have said that they thought it was open despite the comments - with one happily telling reporters &#x27;we came here illegally&#x27; 
* Texas Governor Greg Abbott has sent yet another bus of illegal migrants from his state in what appears to be a direct retaliation for the comments 
* More than 100 people travelled from Eagle Pass to the Naval Observatory on Thursday morning , just yards from Harris&#x27; DC home 
* The home is best known as the &#x27;President&#x27;s Guest House&#x27; - the 14 bedroom home is a fully-staffed compound spread across 60,000 square feet across four townhouses 
* Those who arrived on the bus said that they had travelled from Venezuela, with many women, children and families smiling as they got off the vehicles 
Kamala Harris has been mocked by illegal migrants bussed to her Washington DC residence who said they&#x27;d strolled across the southern border unimpeded - days after she insisted it was secure. 
 One unidentified man filmed outside the Naval Observatory on Friday told Fox News: &#x27;The border is open, not closed. 
Everybody believes that the border is open.   &#x27;It is open because we enter. We come in free, no problem. We came illegally, not legally.&#x27;

The New Voice Of Ukraine: US, EU trying to force Turkish banks to disconnect from Russian payment system  
The United States and EU are increasing pressure on Turkey over concerns that the country&#x27;s banking sector is a potential loophole through which Russia can evade sanctions. 
The United States has focused its attention on Turkish banks that work with the Russian payment system Mir, the newspaper noted. At the same time, Brussels is preparing a delegation to express its concerns directly to Turkish officials. 
“We will send a very clear signal that financial institutions of third countries should not connect to the Mir payment network, because, as you know, this involves some risks of evading sanctions,” said one of the publication’s sources. 
The pressure on Turkey has come as Western countries have shifted from imposing new sanctions to tightening restrictions that are already in place. 
“We need to close the loopholes,” another FT source said.

The Intercept: U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine Grows to Historic Proportions — Along With Risks  
Ukraine is on track to become the largest recipient of U.S military assistance in the last century. But questions surround the policy. 
Since Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February, the U.S. government has pumped more money and weapons into supporting the Ukrainian military than it sent in 2020 to Afghanistan, Israel, and Egypt combined — surpassing in a matter of months three of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid in history. 
Keeping track of the numbers is challenging. Since the war started, U.S. officials have announced a flurry of initiatives aimed at supporting Ukrainian defense efforts while keeping short of a more direct involvement in the conflict. On Thursday, on a surprise visit to Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new $675 million package of U.S. military equipment as well as a $2.2 billion “long-term” investment to bolster the security of Ukraine and 17 of its neighbor countries. Weeks earlier, President Joe Biden unveiled a $3 billion aid package, the largest yet, symbolically choosing Ukraine’s Independence Day for the announcement. The administration noted on that occasion that the total military assistance committed to Ukraine this year had reached $12.9 billion, more than $15.5 billion since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. And this month, Biden also asked Congress to authorize an additional $13.7 billion for Ukraine, including money for equipment and intelligence.

Reuters: Russia says longer-range U.S. missiles for Kyiv would cross red line 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that if the United States decided to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, it would cross a &quot;red line&quot; and become &quot;a party to the conflict&quot;. 
In a briefing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added that Russia &quot;reserves the right to defend its territory&quot;. 
Washington has openly supplied Ukraine with advanced GMLRS rockets, fired from HIMARS launchers, that can hit targets up to 80 km (50 miles) away. 
&quot;If Washington decides to supply longer-range missiles to Kyiv, then it will be crossing a red line, and will become a direct party to the conflict,&quot; Zakharova said.

Kyiv also requested tanks, drones, artillery systems, additional Harpoon antiship missiles and HIMARS missiles 
Kyiv asked Washington for long-range missiles to continue its successful counter offensive against the Russian army, according to a document shared with US lawmakers on Monday. 
The list of requested military aid included 29 types of weapons and ammunition, among which is the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which has a range of nearly 190 miles, 
The Wall Street Journal reported after viewing the document. Kyiv also wants tanks, drones, artillery systems, additional Harpoon antiship missiles and 2,000 missiles for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, which had proven to cause significant damage to the Russian forces in recent months.

Is the U.S. giving Ukraine some weapons secretly? (Politico). That while the US is not officially sending Ukraine long range missiles directly, it is using third parties in Europe to do so.

RT: Russia reacts to US ‘boasting’ about Ukraine involvement 
The Pentagon is openly aiding Kiev and bragging about it, the Russian envoy to Washington said 
It is cause for “deep concern” that the US government is “openly boasting” that Ukraine’s battlefield successes were achieved with the Pentagon’s direct involvement, the Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said in an interview on Wednesday. 
“Against this background, Washington’s statements that the US is not a party to the conflict sound absolutely ridiculous and unfounded,” Antonov told RIA Novosti. “Facts and interviews of former and current politicians and generals say otherwise.”  “Videos currently shown on Western channels clearly demonstrate that soldiers and officers who speak fluent English, many with pronounced British and American accents, are fighting against us,” the ambassador added.

Ukraine’s airspace has been busy this year—that’s the nature of war. But scientists in the country are looking to the skies and seeing something they didn’t expect: An inordinate number of UFOs, according to a new preprint paper published by Kyiv’s Main Astronomical Observatory in coordination with the country’s National Academy of Science.

                              <span>View co-host Sarah Haines absurdly claimed on Wednesday that “there are no such thing as people having late-term abortions.”
During a discussion about Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introducing a bill on Tuesday that would have banned abortion after 15 weeks – with exceptions for the mother’s life in danger, rape or incest – Haines noted that 15 weeks is the first week of the second trimester of pregnancy.
“By the way, 15 weeks for anyone who doesn’t know is a week in your second trimester,” she said.  “And just to clear up a myth that’s often used to get a certain political outcome, there’s no such thing as people having late-term abortions.”
“There’s no such thing as people having late-term abortions,” Haines reiterated, after some encouragement from the co-host Whoopi Goldberg.

In the world in which Russians live today, a tiger may very well have wings, a beak and fins, if the Kremlin wishes.  But in this reality, even darker things are possible.

In Russia, nearly a quarter of the population lacks sanitation facilities, but missiles are considered a priority.

In Russia, its rulers can weaponize nearly a quarter of the world’s natural gas reserves, but nearly a third of households cannot heat their homes.

In Russia, they like “grandeur”.  But this most nebulous concept is never measured by economic development, well-being or quality of life.  The Russians measure it by fear.

Black cab driver Perry Bowen says he has been very busy since the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. 

“Road closures make it a little bit more awkward, but being a black cab driver, we know how to get around the town,” Mr Bowen said.</span>

                              <span>A series of videos posted on Twitter on August 30shocked the Saudi public by showing men dressed in uniforms and plainclothes pushing and beating young women with sticks, belts and taser guns. The images, which were filmed in a home for young orphaned girls, led to an internal police investigation that is still ongoing. But beyond police violence, the case reveals the girls&#x27; ongoing struggle, as they are considered wards of the Saudi state.</span>

                              <span>After news broke of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, social media users in some corners of the internet started sharing a video showing two women, one of them said to be the queen, throwing coins to children. Some people claimed that the video was filmed during the queen’s visit to an “African” colony of the former British Empire. However, it turns out this video doesn’t have any connection to Elizabeth II. It was filmed in Vietnam in 1899— twenty-seven years before she was born.</span>

Despite earlier claims of a ceasefire, fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia continued Wednesday, a day after nearly 100 soldiers died in clashes, according to the Azerbaijani and Armenian ministries of defense. 
Russia suggested it had brokered a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan in a statement Tuesday, but it proved short-lived.
The Russian-mediated ceasefire was “almost immediately broken,” according to US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby.

The end of the Covid-19 pandemic is “in sight”, the World Health Organization has declared, after revealing that weekly deaths from the virus around the world were at the lowest level since March 2020. 
The weekly global deaths figure on 5 September 2022 was 11,118, according to the WHO’s website. 
March 2020 was the month that the UK entered its first national lockdown.  The WHO also estimated that 19.8m deaths were averted in 2021 due to Covid-19 vaccines being administered and that 12bn doses had been given around the world.

Loose coalition of SD and centre-right parties wins majority of three in parliament 
The leader of Sweden’s incumbent Social Democrats conceded defeat in the country’s knife-edge election on Wednesday, handing victory to a loose bloc of rightwing parties that includes the far-right Sweden Democrats (SD). 
The prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, called a press conference at which she accepted defeat, while pointing out that the Social Democrats remained Sweden’s largest party with more than 30% of the vote – and that the majority in parliament for the right bloc was very slim.

RT: Medvedev issues apocalyptic warning to West over Ukraine 
The former Russian president used a Book of Revelation quote to comment on “Kiev Security Treaty” demands   Western “half-wits” from “stupid think tanks” are leading their countries down the road of nuclear armageddon with their hybrid war against Moscow, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. 
Endlessly funneling weapons and support to Ukraine while pretending not to be directly involved in the conflict will not work, added the deputy chair of the Russian Security Council. 
The “security guarantees” proposal unveiled by Kiev on Tuesday was “really a prologue to the Third World War,” said Medvedev, calling it a “hysterical appeal” to Western countries engaged in a proxy war against Russia.

   Warzone/The Drive: Russia Has Begun Using Iranian Kamikaze Drones On Ukraine 
The first evidence has come to light of an Iranian loitering munition, or ‘Kamikaze’ drone, used by Russia in its war in Ukraine.   Ukrainian officials are claiming the destruction of the first example of an Iran-supplied drone used by Russia in the war in Ukraine. 
The assertion is backed up by photos showing the apparent remains of what looks very much like an Iranian Shahed-136 loitering munition, or ‘suicide’ drone, reportedly found in eastern Ukraine. 
This appears to confirm that Iranian-made drones have not only been delivered to Russia but are now being employed in combat, including in strike missions.

The Volokh Conspiracy/Reason: &quot;Americans Own Over 415 Million Firearms,&quot;  
&quot;consisting of approximately 171 million handguns, 146 million rifles, and 98 million shotguns.&quot; There are also estimates of AR-15 ownership and ownership of magazines that hold over 10 rounds (which some state laws classify as &quot;large-capacity&quot;). 
There&#x27;s a new survey aimed at determining patterns of gun ownership and defensive gun use, from Prof. William English at the Georgetown University. It&#x27;s much larger than most other such surveys, with over 54,000 adult American respondents, of whom over 16,700 personally owned guns. 
It measures some things that others have already measured—for instance, its estimate of the adult firearms ownership rate, 32%, is on par with other surveys. (Some other surveys also try to estimate what fraction of households contains at least one gun; this one didn&#x27;t, though in response to my e-mail Prof. English wrote, &quot;the individual gun ownership estimates are very much in line with other recent surveys that asked about ownership at the individual level; and some of these also asked about household ownership (Pew, Gallup), generally finding household rates in the 42-44% range.&quot;) But the survey also gives us some data that has rarely been gathered before, including (items reordered):

Popular Science: How Tiangong station will make China a force in the space race 
China’s Tiangong space station is almost complete. Here’s what it means for the country&#x27;s rise as a space superpower. 
At the height of the Cold War, large-scale investigations beyond our planet served as the dramatic stage for the post-nuclear era power struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. This anxious tension fueled the early days of the space race—catapulting new technologies, forming space agencies, and laying the foundation for future advancements in nearly every mechanical aspect of our society.

Warzone/The Drive: KC-135 Boom-Down Emergency Landing Was Result Of Incident With B-1 
A B-1 bomber and a KC-135 tanker made emergency landings on Guam and in Japan after a refueling incident high over the Pacific. 
The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that an incident on Saturday that left a KC-135 aerial refueling tanker with its boom broken and prompted an emergency landing at Yokota Air Base in Japan, also forced a B-1B bomber to divert to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. Both aircraft were able to get on the ground safely at the respective bases and there were no reported injuries as a result of the incident.

The SUN: Mystery as ‘top secret hypersonic 5,000mph US spy plane’ spotted flanked by two fighter jets flying near Britain 
FLYING high over the North Sea, a mysterious &quot;black triangle&quot; shape flanked by two US fighter jets was spotted by an oil rig worker. 
The sighting came as there was a flurry of reports of unusual aircraft, unexplained sonic booms, ear-splitting high-pitched shrieks and fast-moving radar dots around Britain. 
For years during the late 80s and early 90s the British Isles seems to have been menaced by these shapes and sounds, with the reports often being branded as UFOs.

   VICE: Watch the U.S. Army Prepare for a 40 Drone Swarm Attack  
The U.S. Army is training its troops to fight against a modern threat: swarms of coordinated commercial drones. 
On the morning of September 11, 2022, the U.S. Army launched a swarm of 40 s small quadcopter drones into the California desert as part of a training exercise designed to prepare America’s soldiers for a grim reality of modern war: cheap off the shelf drones capable of carrying munitions have become ubiquitous on the battlefield.

The Ukrainian military has reportedly been making advances over the past week on the Eastern front, gaining back territory in the regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk that were taken by the Russian military after its invasion of the country that started in late February. Around 3,000 square kilometers were retaken, according to accounts that cannot be independently verified, and many towns liberated. The Russian side meanwhile spoke of a &quot;regrouping&quot; of its troops as apparent videos from the front showed abandoned Russian tanks and other vehicles. Russian shelling of infrastructure like power stations intensified with the recent developments, causing blackouts in the affected regions.

Business Insider: The US has given Ukraine nearly a million 155 mm artillery shells. Now it&#x27;s looking for US companies to build more of them. 
* The US Army is looking for companies that can build up to 12,000 155 mm artillery shells a month. 
* The Army&#x27;s survey comes as the US supplies Ukraine with arms, including some 800,000 155 mm rounds. 
* The scale of the effort to supply weapons has raised concerns about the status of US stockpiles. 
With US ammunition stockpiles being depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, the US Army is looking for new manufacturers for 155 mm howitzer shells. 
The Army recently put out a market survey to identify US and Canadian companies that can manufacture up to 12,000 M795 155 mm high-explosive shells a month. 
The M795 is the standard shell for Army and Marine 155 mm howitzers and would be the prime ammunition for any US-designed 155 mm howitzers sent to Ukraine, which is already using M777 towed 155 mm guns sent by the US and Canada.

* The United Nations is warning that the impacts of global climate change are entering “uncharted territories of destruction” as countries fail to set adequate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
* The report, compiled by the World Meteorological Organization, said climate-related disasters have increased fivefold over the past five decades and are costing $200 million a day. 
* U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited this year’s floods in Pakistan, heat waves in Europe and record drought conditions in parts of the U.S. and China as failures to combat climate change and curb fossil fuel production.

Harris made that pledge for the U.S. five months ago, and she announced a coming and concerted international push on Friday (Sept. 9) during a meeting of the National Space Council (NSC) at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston.

Reuters: Exclusive-U.S. considers China sanctions to deter Taiwan action, Taiwan presses EU 
The United States is considering options for a sanctions package against China to deter it from invading Taiwan, with the European Union coming under diplomatic pressure from Taipei to do the same, according to sources familiar with the discussions. 
The sources said the deliberations in Washington and Taipei&#x27;s separate lobbying of EU envoys were both at an early stage -- a response to fears of a Chinese invasion which have grown as military tensions escalate in the Taiwan Strait. 
In both cases, the idea is to take sanctions beyond measures already taken in the West to restrict some trade and investment with China in sensitive technologies like computer chips and telecoms equipment.

Daily Mail: Biden&#x27;s stumbling victory lap! President celebrates &#x27;making progress&#x27; on inflation despite stock market&#x27;s worst day in two years - before treading on his own jacket!

They paid the full asking price for the prewar block, on the 10th and 11th floors of 33 E. 70th St., off Fifth Avenue near Central Park and the Frick Collection.  The seller was Kim Sapersteinthe daughter of a former Bear Stearns financier, and her former boyfriend, Andrew Frankel, who is now married to Tom Brady’s exBrigitte Moynahan. 
The remodeled 6,000 square foot home began with a $5.1 million purchase in 2011 by Saperstein and Frankel.  Then they added a $6.2 million unit above in 2015.

The home also features wide-plank oak floors, recessed lighting, built-in sound, and oversized windows.  The 11-story building, which dates from 1929, includes a gym and bicycle storage.

Charles Kushner went to prison for 14 months in Alabama and was later pardoned by his son’s stepfather, Donald Trump. 
The listing broker was John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens.

                              <span>Queen Elizabeth II is still dead, several American media continued to confirm it on Monday.
The 96-year-old British monarch died on Thursday, ending a 70-year reign.  Her death sparked a relentless barrage of media coverage about her and the royal family – not just in the UK, but in the US, which has said no to the monarchy.
Yet despite this innate aversion to hereditary aristocracy as a guiding principle, the American media covered the death of Elizabeth, the rise of her son King Charles IIIand all the mini-dramas around it, but ultimately stupid.
The most incredible part is that the British throne wields little real political power, thus making it all a largely aesthetic matter.  We’re actually talking about ‘optics’, and in one of the most superficial ways imaginable.

Theodorou died on Sunday surrounded by his family and loved ones “after an arduous struggle with metastatic colon cancer”, according to one posted statement on its website and social media accounts on Monday.

An expert on the British Empire explains “Her Majesty’s government” in the 20th century.
 Queen Elizabeth II’s death last week has prompted both an outpouring of grief and complicated reactions across the globe — in large part because during her 70 years on the throne, she ruled over the twilight of the British Empire.
At the height of that empire after the First World War, the United Kingdom had colonies on every continent save Antarctica, ruling one out of every five people in the world. Over the centuries, Britain extracted wealth from those colonized lands — by one estimate, $45 trillion in today’s dollars from India alone.
“All empires were violent,” said Caroline Elkins, whose second …</span>
