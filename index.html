Ms Joseph said Her Majesty is lying in state with the crown of Scotland and a floral tribute from her family. 

“It’s all very peaceful,” Ms Joseph told Sky News Australia.

“I think the fact that he is very pragmatic, and I think he realised that they needed to set aside their differences for such a momentous occasion,” Ms Joseph told Sky News Australia.

“And in fact, I think he texted Harry sort of, more or less the moment they were due to go out there – he suddenly had this thought.

“And that is why they were three-quarters of an hour late because Harry and Meghan then had to find something to wear.”</span>

                              <span>US President Joe Biden has been mocked online after appearing to become &quot;lost on stage&quot; following a speech he delivered to reignite his Cancer Moonshot initiative.

Mr Biden spoke at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on Monday, local time.

The speech comes on the 60th anniversary of former US president John F. Kennedy&#x27;s famous &#x27;moonshot&#x27; speech – where he outlined the aim to achieve the feat of putting a man on the moon.

President Biden discussed his bold vision for another American moonshot – &quot;ending cancer as we know it&quot;.

The measure aims to cut the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years and provide greater support to caregivers and survivors.</span>

He added that there may be a &quot;snowball effect&quot; if one or more countries decide to remove the British monarch as head of state, but that the Commonwealth itself has a bright future ahead.</span>

Ramzan Kadyrov, Kremlin-appointed Chechnya leader, suggests Putin might not be fully aware of true state of affairs 
Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. 
In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “for ever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs.
 “They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,” Kadyrov said in an audio message posted to his Telegram channel on Sunday.

                              <span>The Guardian: Swedish rightwing on verge of narrow election win but waits on final tally 
Bloc including far-right Sweden Democrats on course for one-seat majority with last votes to be counted  Sweden’s future is balanced on a knife-edge as the country awaits a final tally of the votes in Sunday’s general election, in which a loose bloc of rightwing parties led by the far-right Sweden Democrats – now the second largest party – holds the slimmest of majorities. 
With 95% of the vote counted, the right bloc was on 49.7%, while four parties on the left, including the incumbent Social Democrats, stood at 49%. 
The final picture will come on Wednesday after the votes of Swedish citizens living abroad and those of some who voted early are counted.

Ethiopia&#x27;s Tigray rebels said Sunday they were ready for a ceasefire and would accept a peace process led by the African Union, removing an obstacle to negotiations with the government to end almost two years of brutal warfare. 
The announcement was made amid a flurry of international diplomacy after fighting flared last month for the first time in several months in northern Ethiopia, torpedoing a humanitarian truce. 
&quot;The government of Tigray is prepared to participate in a robust peace process under the auspices of the African Union,&quot; said a statement by the Tigrayan authorities.
&quot;Furthermore, we are ready to abide by an immediate and mutually agreed cessation of hostilities in order to create a conducive atmosphere.&quot; 
The Ethiopian government has previously said it was ready for unconditional talks &quot;anytime, anywhere,&quot; brokered by the Addis Ababa-headquartered AU.

Russian-installed official admits serious lack of battlefield readiness during Kyiv’s surprise offensive in the Kharkiv region. 
Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russian troops by eight times during the rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, a Russian-installed official said. 
Vitaly Ganchev said Ukrainian soldiers captured previously Russian-held settlements in the region’s north, breaking through to the border with Russia, and “about 5,000” civilians had been evacuated to Russia. 
Ganchev told the state-owned Rossiya-24 television channel on Monday “the situation is becoming more difficult by the hour”, adding the border with Russia’s Belgorod region was now closed. 
During the weekend, Ukrainian forces overran the key Russian supply hubs of Izyum and Kupiansk, where the Kharkiv region’s Russian-appointed administration had been based.

WNU Editor: It always comes down to how many boots you have on the ground, and how well equipped they are. 
It is because of reports like the above coupled with this morning&#x27;s attacks on Ukraine&#x27;s power grid that I now believe the Kremlin is going to upgrade its conflict in Ukraine from a &quot;special military operation&quot; to an anti-terrorist operation along the same lines that it operates on in Syria. What this means is that the list of targets will now be expanded that will also include Ukraine&#x27;s leadership. It will (or course) also mean the deployment of more Russian troops and equipment into the conflict.</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Russian state media grapples with Kharkiv defeats 
LONDON (Reuters) - Commentators on Russian state television have been forced to go off script by Ukrainian forces&#x27; swift advance in the country&#x27;s Kharkiv region and Moscow&#x27;s rapid retreat. 
Since the beginning of what Russia calls its “special military operation”, belligerent guests on state television talk shows typically have tried to outdo each other in backing President Vladimir Putin and denouncing Ukraine and its allies. 
But in the wake of Kyiv’s lightning counteroffensive, the mood was more subdued and the narrative turned to how allegedly Ukrainian forces overwhelmingly outnumbered the Russians in the northeast. 
The Rossiya-24 news channel on Monday interviewed Vitaly Ganchev, a Russian-appointed official in the Kharkiv region, who said that Russian troops in the province had been outnumbered “eight times over.” 
He also said, without providing evidence, that Ukrainian forces had been bolstered by “Western mercenaries”.  &quot;A most difficult week on the front,&quot; presenter Dmitry Kiselyov said at the opening of his prime time Sunday night program.

                              <span>BBC: Sweden election: Result could take days as vote too close to call 
Sweden&#x27;s election was too close to call on Sunday night, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said. 
Exit polls at first predicted victory for the incumbent left-wing coalition, but results later suggested the right-wing bloc could narrowly win. 
Immigration and crime were major issues in the campaign, and the far-right Sweden Democrats look set to become the second-largest party. 
It could take until Wednesday for all votes to be counted.  Soon after polls closed, an early exit poll by Sweden&#x27;s public broadcaster suggested Ms Andersson&#x27;s coalition of four left-wing parties would narrowly win, with 49.8% of the vote compared to 49.2%. 
But the left&#x27;s celebrations were perhaps premature, as later partial results put the right-wing group ahead, with a projected 176 of 349 seats in parliament after 94% of electoral districts were counted.

Times of Israel: Israeli official predicts no return to Iran deal before US midterms in November  
Official says Biden administration has pledged not to make more major concessions in talks with Tehran, as Lapid flies to Berlin to discuss nuclear issue 
Israel does not believe that Iran and world powers will return to their nuclear deal before the November midterm elections in the United States, a senior Israeli official said on Sunday morning.
Furthermore, “If the US doesn’t give into Iran’s demands, and Iran doesn’t give into US demands and the IAEA doesn’t close the probes, there will be no return to the agreement,” the official said.

VOA/Reuters: Europeans Doubt Iran&#x27;s Intentions in Nuclear Talks, Sparking Tehran&#x27;s Ire  
PARIS/VIENNA — France, Britain and Germany on Saturday said they had &quot;serious doubts&quot; about Iran&#x27;s intentions to revive a nuclear deal, comments that were rejected by Tehran and called &quot;very untimely&quot; by Moscow. 
Earlier this month, Iran sent its latest response to the European Union&#x27;s proposed text to restore the 2015 agreement under which Tehran had restrained its nuclear program in exchange for relief from U.S., EU and U.N. economic sanctions. 
Diplomats have said Iran&#x27;s response to the EU coordinator was a step backward, with it seeking to link a revival of the deal with the closure of investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) into traces of uranium at three sites.

The Guardian: The super-rich ‘preppers’ planning to save themselves from the apocalypse  
Tech billionaires are buying up luxurious bunkers and hiring military security to survive a societal collapse they helped create, but like everything they do, it has unintended consequences 
As a humanist who writes about the impact of digital technology on our lives, I am often mistaken for a futurist. The people most interested in hiring me for my opinions about technology are usually less concerned with building tools that help people live better lives in the present than they are in identifying the Next Big Thing through which to dominate them in the future. I don’t usually respond to their inquiries. Why help these guys ruin what’s left of the internet, much less civilisation? 
Still, sometimes a combination of morbid curiosity and cold hard cash is enough to get me on a stage in front of the tech elite, where I try to talk some sense into them about how their businesses are affecting our lives out here in the real world. That’s how I found myself accepting an invitation to address a group mysteriously described as “ultra-wealthy stakeholders”, out in the middle of the desert.

A Unique Perspective On Sept. 11: The Last Sunrise Between The Twin Towers -- Spiegel Online
He came to New York for vacation, but became a witness to the most devastating terror attack the world had ever seen. Reinhard Karger documented the disaster from a marina across the water from the World Trade Center and shared his story with SPIEGEL ONLINE.  In the summer of 2001, my brother was living on a sailboat in New York Harbor. For one week, I went to visit him there to relax and sail a bit. I wanted to shop in Manhattan, and enjoy the last warm days of summer. The views were dazzling.

                              <span>Business Insider: &#x27;AMERICA&#x27;S DARKEST DAY&#x27;: See newspaper headlines from around the world 24 hours after 9/11
* Tuesday is the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
* The day after the attacks, newspapers around the world reacted by capturing the sadness, shock, and horror people felt.
* We compiled front pages from American and international newspapers to show what people woke up to on September 12, 2001.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks happened exactly 17 years ago Tuesday.
For many people, the attacks were the biggest news story of their lifetime. Almost all who experienced it can remember where they were when they heard of the attacks.
Many people who remember that day also recall the following morning, when newspapers around the world captured the horror, shock, and sadness people felt.
The Newseum, a museum in Washington, DC, that chronicles the history of media, archived more than 100 newspapers from September 12, 2001, the day after the attacks. The front pages of these newspapers, bearing headlines like &quot;ACT OF WAR&quot; and &quot;AMERICA&#x27;S DARKEST DAY,&quot; underscore the impact the attacks had on the American psyche.
Here is what newspapers looked like the day after September 11, 2001.

Born in Hayle, Cornwall, May 27, 1939, to a working-class family, Rescorla joined the British Army in 1957, serving three years in Cyprus. Still eager for adventure, after army service, Rescorla enlisted in the Northern Rhodesia Police.
Ultimately finding few prospects for advancement in Britain or her few remaining colonies, Rescorla moved to the United States, and joined the US Army in 1963. After graduating from Officers’ Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1964, he was assigned as a platoon leader to Bravo Company of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, Third Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Rescorla’s serious approach to training and his commitment to excellence led to his men to apply to him the nickname “Hard Corps.”

Tom Junod, Esquire: The Falling Man
An unforgettable story.
Do you remember this photograph? In the United States, people have taken pains to banish it from the record of September 11, 2001. The story behind it, though, and the search for the man pictured in it, are our most intimate connection to the horror of that day.
In the picture, he departs from this earth like an arrow. Although he has not chosen his fate, he appears to have, in his last instants of life, embraced it. If he were not falling, he might very well be flying. He appears relaxed, hurtling through the air. He appears comfortable in the grip of unimaginable motion. He does not appear intimidated by gravity&#x27;s divine suction or by what awaits him. His arms are by his side, only slightly outriggered. His left…</span>

Poilievre swept the contest with 68.15 per cent of the vote. Former Quebec premier Jean Charest, who came in second, only got 16.07 per cent 
It was an overwhelming victory for Pierre Poilievre.  Poilievre, 43, became the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada on Saturday night after a lengthy and divisive seven-month leadership campaign that saw him be a clear frontrunner on all accounts – whether it be membership sales or fundraising. 
Poilievre swept the contest with 68.15 per cent of the vote. Former Quebec premier Jean Charest, who came in second, only got 16.07 per cent.

Reuters: Zelenskiy to appeal directly to U.S. defense companies 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to speak to U.S. arms makers and military leaders on Sept. 21, when he is expected to make an appeal for more weapons for his country&#x27;s defense against Russia, according to an advance notice of the speech seen by Reuters. 
Zelenskiy was set to speak by video link before a conference hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association in Austin, Texas, in his first-ever speech to the U.S. defense industry. 
Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine&#x27;s minister of defense, was also slated to appear at the Future Force Capabilities conference and appeal for support for the country&#x27;s fight against Russia&#x27;s invasion, now more than six months on.

CBC News: As Ukraine pleads for more weapons, allies warn the cupboards are almost bare 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to make a direct appeal to weapons makers this month  It may appear at times that the U.S. can call on a bottomless pit of military stores to supply Ukraine. 
Increasingly, however, western allies are balking at taking any more equipment out of their inventories to support the eastern European country&#x27;s war against Russia. 
It&#x27;s an untidy, uncomfortable aspect of alliance politics that was acknowledged publicly on Friday by the secretary general of NATO.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: On September 11, the war between Ukraine and Russia will have been going on for 200 days. 
The latter launched its offensive on February 24 after months of amassing troops at the Ukrainian border, attacking the former on several fronts from the North, East and Southeast. 
While it looked like Russia would emerge as a winner in the conflict initially, Ukraine managed to defend several strategic locations. 
As Statista&#x27;s Florian Zandt shows in the chart below, based on monthly polls by YouGov and The Economist, Americans even thought Ukraine had better chances to win the war than Russia in April and May.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised that the consensus is growing in the U.S. that this is going to be a long war. I know among all of my friends and family members in both Ukraine and Russia there is a resignation that this war is going to go into 2023 and maybe even into 2024. 
As to what is my take. I can now easily see this war going into 2024. 
As to how will it end? 
As I have mentioned before, I believe it will end when European governments, tired of the enormous cost in supporting Kyiv in this conflict, will say &quot;enough is enough&quot; and tell Zelensky to make a deal with Putin or they will cut off aid. We are already seeing EU states slow walking aid to Ukraine, aid that was promised months ago .... EU finance ministers back next $5 billion loan to Ukraine (Reuters). More here ....

The tallest building… or not.
Trump got off to a quick start, bragging on 09/11/2001 that since the twin towers had been destroyed hours earlier, it now had the tallest building in the area.
“Forty Wall Street was actually the second tallest building in midtown Manhattan,” Trump said, adding “and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, it was the tallest, then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second largest, and now it’s the largest.

There is ongoing discussion and analysis of the ex-president’s removal of classified White House documents from the media.  Although the actions of the ex-president are problematic, they are not surprising.  However, shouldn’t the bigger story, and the outrage, be how these documents were able to leave the White House in the first place?
In most workplaces, when a disgruntled employee is fired, they are told to collect their belongings under the supervision of a security guard and then escort them out of the building.  The ex-president was ousted by the American people in November 2020, and he was clearly unhappy, denying the election results and promoting plans to prevent the peaceful transition of power.  So how is it that as a private citizen, the ex-president left the White House with boxes of documents belonging to the American people?  What systems or people did we have in place to prevent this from happening?  How have these systems/people let us down?
Investigations are underway to assess the impact of the actions of the former president on national security.  However, some impacts are already known.  Our allies will think twice about sharing information with us now that they know we cannot keep confidential documents secure.  Significant damage has been done regardless of what the recently recovered boxes contain.
I’m not a fan of the former president and I understand the political motivation of the left wing media to focus on the culpability of the former president, but we can’t ignore the national security failure that has happened. product.  This should be the main story.

Putin had anticipated his February 24th &quot;special military operation&quot; to be a cakewalk through the Russian-controlled East into the Ukrainian capitol of Kyiv. But with the aid of a Western coalition led by the United States, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s unshatterable resistance campaign has decimated Putin&#x27;s combat forces and depleted his military&#x27;s offensive capabilities.

                              <span>JAKARTA (Reuters) -About 200 people evacuated to higher ground after an earthquake of magnitude 6.1 struck islands in western Indonesia on Sunday, causing some property damage, the country&#x27;s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said.
The quake in the Mentawai Islands west of Sumatra struck at a depth of 27 km (17 miles) and was followed by one of magnitude 5.3 in the same area, authorities said. There was no danger of tsunami.
One person was injured in the head by falling wood, and a school and health centre were among properties slightly damaged, the disaster agency said.
Mentawai resident Nurjuli Hasanah told Reuters the quake felt strong and shook her wooden house. &quot;Some of (the residents) are still in an evacuation shelter and some have gone back home,” she said.
Also on Sunday, east of the vast Indonesian archipelago, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the Eastern New Guinea region in Papua New Guinea, reportedly damaging property and spreading panic among residents.
Indonesia straddles the &quot;Pacific Ring of Fire&quot;, where different tectonic plates of the Earth&#x27;s crust meet and create frequent seismic activity.

                              <span>2022 marks the tenth anniversary of the UN-run Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan. It is the largest in the Middle East – and one of the largest in the world – and home to some 80,000 Syrians. UN News spoke to some of the refugees about life at the camp, and their hopes for the future.

                              <span>Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says “millions of Brits” are saying they “cannot believe” the way they reacted to the news of the death of Queen Elizabeth II. 

“Grown men moved to tears … good, decent folk moved emotionally in a way they could never, never, have understood,&quot; Mr Farage told Sky News Australia. 

“The day after the announcement, people said to me, young and old, they just couldn’t get to sleep, they couldn’t believe what had happened  – this rock, this woman who stood for decency, honour, integrity, Christianity, service – had gone.

“It’s been a very emotional, very sad couple of days.”</span>

“Because you can see there were lots of little moments, if you want to read into the body language, between all four of them yesterday,” Mr Murray told Sky News Australia. 

“Pretty obviously ... Meghan and Catherine didn’t seem too interested to play nice, but that was one of many little moments which had been unexpected.”</span>

                              <span>The death of the Queen has “shaken” Australia, Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says. 

“And was obviously the predominant subject discussed during that 20-minute phone call between Anthony Albanese and the new UK PM Liz Truss on Friday night,” Mr Clennell said. 

“Liz Truss spoke of the grief and shock experienced in Britain; the PM felt the same could be said of the reaction in Australia.

“He now prepares to fly out to the Queen&#x27;s funeral later this week, either on Wednesday or Thursday.”</span>

                              <span>Former prime minister John Howard says Queen Elizabeth II had a “great affection” for Australia and “identified with so many of our pursuits”. 

“She was very rounded in her understanding of different countries, and she never lost sight of the fact that she was there by the consent of the people,” Mr Howard told Sky News Australia. 

“She would always be very well-informed about Australian affairs, whenever I saw her, she was across the recent political developments in Australia.

“She would ask about them but not in a way that represented any kind of interference, but she was very familiar with things that we had done and things we’d achieved, and the challenges that the country had.”</span>

Putin joined Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, via video conference, for the ceremony, Russian state media reported.
&quot;It is a unique [construction], 140 meters high. There is nothing like that in Europe,&quot; Putin said. &quot;&quot;It is very important for people to have a chance to chill out with their family and friends.&quot;
Russian state media reported, &quot;At an overall height of 140 meters, the VDNKh’s open revolving observation wheel is the tallest in Europe. Mounted on the wheel are 30 cabins, and one in six has a transparent floor. The air conditioning, lighting and heating systems as well as an emergency button and audio system are installed in the cabins. One complete rotation of the Moscow Sun takes about 18 minutes …</span>

The Ukrainian army has recaptured around 2,000 square kilometres of territory this month in areas previously occupied by Russia as part of Ukraine&#x27;s counter-offensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
In a video speech on Saturday evening, Zelensky thanked all the soldiers who were involved in the recapturing territory in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, Russia&#x27;s military announced a withdrawal from the region.
The Russian army made a good decision by fleeing, Zelensky asserted: &quot;Occupiers have no place in Ukraine and will not have one.&quot;</span>

Relations have been strained between the two sons of Britain&#x27;s new king after Harry and Meghan moved to the United States and the four had not been seen so closely together since.
William&#x27;s spokesman said he had invited Harry and Meghan, officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to join him and Kate as they examined the flowers and spoke to crowds lining the entrance to Windsor Castle.
The sight of the two couples together will raise hopes that there has been a rapprochement following the death of Britain&#x27;s longest-reigning monarch.
William was heard telling one well-wisher that the days following the queen&#x27;s death had been &quot;so surreal&quot;.
&quot;We all thought she was invincible,&quot; he said.

&quot;How about we talk a little bit more about colonialism,&quot; he began. &quot;The first Elizabethan era ended when Queen Elizabeth the First died in 1603. Her 45 year reign was, quote, &#x27;a golden age,&#x27; though I guess that depends on your perspective which marked England&#x27;s emergence as an ambitious and ruthless global power.&quot;

&quot;It was shocking because we had never heard of something like this here,&quot; Villamizar, a government employee in the farming town of 90,000, told AFP on Friday.
More than 160 police officers aided by dogs and drones were deployed to find the group after they went missing on August 22, when they set off for a religious retreat, leaving their cell phones behind to avoid being disturbed.
Local media labeled the group &quot;religious fanatics&quot; and a cult of &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; who were waiting for &quot;the end of the world.&quot;

&quot;It was frightening,&quot; said 61-year-old Anatoli Vasiliev, recalling this week&#x27;s battle when Ukrainian troops recaptured Grakove from the Russians.
&quot;There were bombings and explosions everywhere.&quot;
Vasiliev stood in front of the local church, whose bell had been damaged by a projectile.
Some of the Russian soldiers &quot;took phones, but I managed to keep mine by hiding it so I could communicate with my family,&quot; he said.
Ukrainians have announced significant territorial gains in the eastern Kharkiv region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday 30 towns and cities had been recaptured there.

China&#x27;s rising pressure on Taiwan, North Korea&#x27;s nuclear test threats and Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine are among issues to be discussed, with the summit likely to be held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting, Kyodo said, citing sources in both governments.
Kishida is also likely to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth in Britain together with Japan&#x27;s Emperor Naruhito before visiting the United States, TV Asahi reported earlier on Saturday. Biden has said he will attend the queen&#x27;s funeral.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Saturday visited several areas of Pakistan ravaged by floods, as he rounded off a two-day trip aimed at raising awareness of the disaster.
Record monsoon rains and glacier melt in northern mountains have triggered floods that have killed more than 1,391 people, sweeping away houses, roads, railway tracks, bridges, livestock and crops.
Huge areas of the country are inundated, and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes. The government says the lives of nearly 33 million have been disrupted. Pakistan estimates the damage at $30 billion, and both the government and Guterres have blamed the flooding on climate change.

PRINCE ANDREW
Andrew, second son of the late queen and reputed to have been her favourite child, stepped down from royal duties in 2019 after a disastrous TV interview in which he had hoped to clear his name over his relationship to the late U.S. financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In January 2022, he lost his military links and royal patronages, and gave up his Royal Highness title. A month later he agreed an out of court settlement with Virginia Giuffre, an American woman who had been a victim of Epstein and who had accused Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was a teenag…</span>

The Guardian: Ukraine’s southern offensive ‘was designed to trick Russia’ 
Exclusive: Russian forces wrong-footed by attack in Kharkiv region after preparing for offensive in the south 
The much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces have said. 
Ukrainian forces are continuing to make unexpected, rapid advances in the north-east of the country, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region in three days. Much of Ukraine’s territorial gains were confirmed by Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday. 
“[It] was a big special disinformation operation,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces.

                              <span>WNU Editor: This is what happens when a front line collapses. And while I am sure that Ukraine has lost a lot of soldiers in their Kharkiv counter-attack, they have gained significant territory and they now have the military momentum in this part of the war. 
Reaction to this defeat on Russian social media has been predictable and quite a sight to see today. Criticism of President Putin and the Generals who are responsible for the war have been widespread and brutal. I am sure Putin is now feeling the pressure to change his military strategy from a &quot;special operation&quot; to something that is more significant. 

The next few days are going to be critical. The Russian Ministry of Defense clearly underestimated this Ukraine counter-offensive, and they are now deploying heavy reinforcements to blunt it. But this takes time, and for now Ukraine will take advantage of their momentum. 
The big surprise (for me) in this counter-offensive are the actual low number of soldiers that are involved (for now). At the beginning of the Kharkiv counter-offensive Ukraine deployed anywhere from 9,000 - 15,000 soldiers. And on the Russian side it was mostly Donbas militia numbering only a few thousand mixed with a few thousand regular Russian forces to face the Ukrainians. 
On a thousand mile long front there are always going to be gaps and weaknesses, and in this case the Ukraine military saw an opportunity and they took it.  The big question that needs to be answered is .... can Ukraine keep this territory that they have recaptured? 
I say this because a few months ago Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to the north of Kharkiv and they were very successful. Even reaching the border of Russia, albeit briefly. But within a few weeks they were driven back to their original positions, experiencing heavy casualties. 
Will history repeat itself? We shall see.</span>

                              <span>We host a roundtable on the life and legacy of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, who died Thursday at the age of 96. She was the country’s longest-reigning monarch, serving for 70 years and presiding over the end of the British Empire. Her death set off a period of national mourning in the U.K. and has thrown the future of the monarchy into doubt. “The monarchy really has come to represent deep and profound and grave inequality,” says Cambridge scholar Priya Gopal, author of “Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent.” We also speak with Harvard historian Maya Jasanoff, Novara Media editor Ash Sarkar and Pedro Welch, former chair of the Barbados Reparations Task Force, who says the British monarchy’s brutal record in the Caribbean and other parts of the world must be addres…</span>

(Reuters) -An international standards body has approved the creation of a new merchant code for gun retailers, a representative said on Friday, following pressure from activists who say it will help track suspicious weapons purchases.
At a meeting this week, a subcommittee of the International Organization for Standardization approved what is known as a &quot;merchant category code&quot; for firearms stores, a spokeswoman said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain&#x27;s King Charles paid a heartfelt tribute on Friday to his late &quot;darling mama&quot; Queen Elizabeth, and vowed to serve as monarch with &quot;loyalty, respect and love&quot; as she had done for more than seven decades.
In his first address to the nation, Charles paid tribute to his mother for her devotion to her family and to those she reigned over, saying her loss brought great sadness and a &quot;sense of loss, beyond measure&quot;.
Elizabeth, Britain&#x27;s longest-reigning monarch https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/life-queen-elizabeth-2022-09-08 and a towering presence on the world stage for 70 years, died on Thursday at her home in Scotland aged 96, drawing an outpouring of tributes https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/death-queen-elizabeth-marked-around-world…</span>

ROME (Reuters) - Italy&#x27;s right-wing bloc is on track to win a clear majority in both houses of parliament at this month&#x27;s election, according to studies based on the final opinion polls before a ban on their publication kicks in on Saturday.
The far-right Brothers of Italy which dominates the conservative alliance is set to be the largest single party at the Sept. 25 vote, according to the latest surveys which show it widening its lead over the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).
A study by the Cattaneo Institute think tank, based on polls conducted up to Aug. 31, suggests the conservative bloc could elect at least 258 lawmakers out of 400 in the Chamber of Deputies, and 131 out of 200 in the Senate.
It estimated a 91.5% probability that the alliance, in which Giorgia Meloni&#x27;…</span>
