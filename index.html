The Guardian/AFP: Taiwan hails ‘comprehensive’ trade deal with US as China issues warning

 
Agreement designed to deepen economic ties ‘signals a new beginning’, says Taiwan cabinet spokesperson 
The United States and Taiwan have signed a trade deal aimed at deepening economic relations between both sides – in a move that has sparked a warning from Beijing. 
Taiwan’s government has described the deal as “the most comprehensive” trade agreement signed with Washington since 1979. 
The pact is “intended to strengthen and deepen the economic and trade relationship” between both sides, Sam Michel, a spokesperson at the US Trade Representative press office said in a statement on Thursday.

Germany reacts to Moscow’s decision to limit the number of German officials in Russia to 350. 
BERLIN — Germany is revoking the licenses of four of the five Russian consulates in the country, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday. 
Moscow has been asked to “promptly arrange for the liquidation of the four consulates general in the Federal Republic of Germany and complete it by Dec. 31, 2023, at the latest,” according to the foreign ministry. 
The move is intended to create “structural and personnel parity” between the two countries, the ministry added.

Germany and Russia have repeatedly expelled each other’s diplomats since the start of the Russian war on Ukraine.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would send troops to help expel Russia from the breakaway Moldovan republic of Transnistria – if asked to by the Moldovan government. 
However, he said no such request had been made and emphasised Ukraine has no territorial claims over the pro-Russian territory. 
It comes as US secretary of state Antony Blinken said there could be no ceasefire in the war in Ukraine unless it was part of a “just and lasting” peace deal that includes Russia’s military withdrawal.

Airforce Technology: US Air Force initiates radar modernisation for B-52 fleet 
Replacing outdated radar technology will enhance the B-52&#x27;s navigation, targeting, and situational awareness capabilities, ensuring its effectiveness in higher-threat environments. 
The US Air Force’s B-52 radar modernisation program takes a step forward as a B-52 from the 307th Bomb Wing arrives at a Boeing facility in San Antonio to receive the Active Electronically Scanned Array system (AESA). 
The US Air Force commenced its program by welcoming a B-52 bomber from the 307th Bomb Wing to a Boeing Co. facility in San Antonio on May 25. This deployment aims to equip the aircraft with the AESA.

(Bloomberg) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban dug in his heels over crucial European Union aid to Ukraine, offering sympathy for his neighbor but nothing more to help it fight off Russia’s invasion. 
Speaking in a Bloomberg interview at the Qatar Economic Forum, Orban argued that Ukraine’s military effort is doomed and sending further aid will only lead to more deaths. 
“Emotionally it’s tragic, all of our hearts are with the Ukrainians,” Orban, 59, told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait on Tuesday. “But I’m talking as a politician who should save lives.” 
“There’s no chance to win this war,” he added.

Reuters: BRICS meet with &#x27;friends&#x27; seeking closer ties amid push to expand bloc 
CAPE TOWN, June 2 (Reuters) - Senior officials from more than a dozen countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, were in talks on forging closer links with the BRICS bloc of major emerging economies on Friday as it met to deepen ties and position itself as a counterweight to the West. 
BRICS, which now consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is considering expanding its membership, and a growing number of countries have expressed interest in joining. 
Once viewed as a loose association of disparate emerging economies, BRICS has in recent years taken more concrete shape, driven initially by China and, since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022, with added impetus from Russia. 
In remarks opening Friday&#x27;s discussions, host South Africa&#x27;s Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor spoke of the bloc as a champion of the developing world, which she said was abandoned by wealthy states and global institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

US Air Force official claimed drone killed operator during simulation 
The U.S. Air Force on Friday is pushing back on comments an official made last week in which he claimed that a simulation of an artificial intelligence-enabled drone tasked with destroying surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites turned against and attacked its human user, saying the remarks &quot;were taken out of context and were meant to be anecdotal.&quot;
U.S. Air Force Colonel Tucker &quot;Cinco&quot; Hamilton made the comments during the Future Combat Air &amp; Space Capabilities Summit in London hosted by the Royal Aeronautical Society, which brought together about 70 speakers and more than 200 delegates from around the world representing the media and those who specialize in the armed services industry and academia.

SCMP: China has tamed the world’s most powerful explosive, military scientists say 
* New synthesising method can give five-fold stability boost to CL-20, the deadliest non-nuclear explosive in existence, Chinese research team says 
* According to 2021 US study commissioned by Pentagon, only China has CL-20 mass production capacity and has used it in some of its newest weapons 
A Chinese research team said they have significantly improved the safety of the world&#x27;s most powerful explosive by engineering a five-fold boost to its shock resistance capacity. 
The breakthrough could speed up the large-scale application of the explosive in battle, making Chinese weapons far superior in terms of destructive power, according to the scientists. 
CL-20 is the most deadly non-nuclear explosive in existence. When detonated, it can produce destructive shock waves with blast pressures many times higher than other common explosives like TNT and RDX.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Thursday it has agreed to purchase Starlink satellite internet terminals from Elon Musk’s SpaceX for use in Ukraine as Kyiv continues to defend itself against a full-scale Russian invasion. 
“We continue to work with a range of global partners to ensure Ukraine has the satellite and communication capabilities they need. 
Satellite communications constitute a vital layer in Ukraine’s overall communications network and the department contracts with Starlink for services of this type,” the Pentagon said in a statement to CNBC. 
The Pentagon declined to offer additional contract details, including the price, scope and timeline of the delivery.

                              <span>Politico:  The debt deal limits Pentagon spending. Lawmakers are already figuring out ways around it. 
Both Democrats and Republicans say a supplemental for Ukraine could be a way to pad defense spending. 
The ink is barely dry on a debt limit deal that constrains Pentagon spending for the next two years, but lawmakers in both parties are already looking for ways to boost funding levels in spite of those caps. 
 The pact passed the House late Wednesday with the support of most Republican defense hawks, even though the deal caps national defense spending at the administration’s $886 billion proposal for fiscal 2024. It’s still unclear as of Thursday afternoon how the GOP will break in the Senate. 
That hasn’t stopped Democrats and Republicans from looking for creative ways to increase the Pentagon budget.

Update #2: Senators seek to bypass defense caps in debt ceiling bill (Defense News)

 
WNU Editor: The US Senate has passed the debt ceiling deal .... The Senate just passed the debt ceiling bill. Here’s what happens next (CNN). 
As to what is my take on this &quot;debt deal&quot;. 
1) $4 trillion in more debt. 
2) The debt ceiling no longer has a real ceiling. 
3) The US budget will now be normalized from $4t to $6t, with spending mostly likely to be near the $6t mark (for the next two years). 
4) This new debt will be offering 5.25% interest of which half will be used for paying interest on existing debt.  

5) This is not temporary. This is their plan. 
6) The Pentagon budget will continue to grow.</span>

                              <span>The Hill: Ukraine battles sky-high expectations ahead of counteroffensive 
Ukraine is facing sky-high expectations ahead of its upcoming counteroffensive, raising a litany of dangers if Kyiv fails to make major advances against entrenched Russian forces.
Lackluster results could hurt Ukraine’s international support moving forward, embolden critics of continued military support and ultimately benefit Russia. 
 Ukraine has received nearly all of the promised military aid from Western allies, including infantry fighting vehicles and main battle tanks, all of which are upping the global pressure for Ukrainians to succeed. 
But victory is far from assured.

WNU Editor: Before the invasion Ukraine spent almost 8 years, backed heavily by the West, in waging war against the two rebellious provinces in the Donbas .... and failed to conquer them. And now we are being told that this counter-offensive will be the first step not only in expelling Russian military forces in Ukraine, but also recapturing Crimea?!?!?!? 
Since the start of the war Ukraine has loss almost half of its population. 20% of its territory. An economy and government that is totally dependent on Western aid. And an army that when the war started has been decimated through attrition, and is now made up by survivors, volunteers, and conscripts, that need regular and constant Western supplies to function. 
So yeah. There are sky-high expectations ahead of Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive.</span>

President Joe Biden laughed off his embarrassing fall at the Air Force Academy commencement ceremony as he arrived safely back at the White House on Thursday. 
&#x27;I got sandbagged,&#x27; he joked to reporters following the tumble, after the White House insisted that he was OK. 
But as he got off the plane Thursday evening, the 80-year-old commander-in-chief was again seen bumping his head on the doorframe.

 I have mentioned it before. He is now at the stage of his cognitive decline where he will be needing a cane for support.

Satellite reconnaissance provides high-quality data that can be used for various purposes. Data collected this way can be used to track the movement of troops, ships, and aircraft, and to monitor the activities of other countries. 
A new Russian radar satellite will be able to conduct reconnaissance against Ukrainian military facilities as often as twice a day, a source told Sputnik.

 
&quot;The new Kondor-FKA radar satellite, which was launched into orbit on Saturday, will be used for reconnaissance of Ukrainian military installations. It will pass over Ukraine on average twice a day and is capable of detecting military objects in radar range with a resolution of one meter,&quot; a source said.

                              <span>Helen Zia fought with her father to go to university. She went on to become one of the first American women to graduate from Princeton in 1973. While there, she successfully lobbied to start an Asian American Students Association. A few years later, she demanded that authorities in Detroit handle the slaying of a Chinese-American man, Vincent Chin, as a hate crime. She succeeded.

In US, Yelp sees sharp increase in racist anti-Asian business reviews “Most men or women might have given up by now,” said Mary Yu Danico, professor of sociology and director of the Asian American Transnational Research Initiative at Cal Poly Pomona. “Racism – bias against Asian Americans – has…</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Ukraine wants &#x27;clear&#x27; decision on NATO future at July summit, Zelenskiy says 
(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday Kyiv wanted to receive a &quot;clear&quot; decision on its future in the NATO military alliance when the bloc&#x27;s leaders meet in Vilnius in July. 
At a summit of over 40 European leaders in Moldova, he also said he wanted progress on Ukraine&#x27;s path to the European Union, which Kyiv applied to join last year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. 
&quot;This year is for decisions. In summer in Vilnius at the NATO summit the clear invitation to the members of Ukraine is needed and the security guarantees on the way to NATO membership are needed,&quot; Zelenskiy said. 
&quot;In (autumn), on our accession to the EU a clear, positive decision is needed. And we are also preparing for a Peace Summit, which will guide the world to jointly implement the peace formula,&quot; he said.

The priority for the Ukraine government right now is to get NATO more actively and directly involved in the war. All of my contacts in Ukraine are telling me the same thing. This Russian war of attrition has revealed one indisputable fact and that is time is not on Kyiv&#x27;s side.</span>

At least eight people were injured in what the governor of a southwestern Russian region on the border with Ukraine described as “endless” shelling early Thursday. 
Belgorod region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukrainian forces of firing Grad missiles at the border town of Shebekino from midnight to sunrise. 
Ukraine adheres to a policy of neither confirming nor denying its role in the cross-border attacks.

Gladkov said eight people sustained various types of injuries, including two women, a police officer and a security guard. One person was in critical condition, he added.

Peskov said as much in a comment on May 24, responding to reports that some in the Polish military expect an uprising in Belarus in foreseeable future. 
General Waldemar Skrzypczak, former commander of the Polish Land Forces, told Polsat News that Belarusian citizens currently serving with Ukraine’s Armed Forces could ultimately use their expertise and weapons to topple the dictatorial regime in their home country. 
“We are preparing for an uprising in Belarus, because it is coming,” said Skrzypczak.

&quot;We need to be ready to support the units that will carry out operations against Lukashenko. Preparing for an uprising in Belarus is crucial. We have reason to help them, just like we help Ukrainians.&quot;

                              <span>Statista: Ukrainians&#x27; Desire to Join NATO and the EU 
NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Oslo today. Ahead of the session, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Sweden and urged Turkey and Hungary to ratify the Nordic country&#x27;s membership in the organization. The bigger elephant in the room during the meeting will be another nation&#x27;s membership prospects: those of Ukraine. While the country is not expected to join immediately, the question of what NATO can offer Ukraine right now will be posed during the meeting. Ukrainians&#x27; desire to join the treaty (and the EU) is higher than ever after some hesitation, a survey from the country&#x27;s Rating Sociological Group shows.

WNU Editor: This is nothing new. Western Ukraine support for joining the EU and NATO has always been strong. It was one of the main reason why the 2014 Maiden Revolution occurred. When then Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych signed an agreement with Russian President Putin for closer ties, those who favored closer ties to the West revolted. 
As for eastern Ukraine, for as long as I can remember the sentiment has always been the opposite. And this war has now only hardened both sides where reconciliation is now impossible.</span>

Insider: A secret Cold War-era deal lets British jets shadow Russian bombers when they fly near a vital Atlantic chokepoint 
* Since the 1950s, Ireland has allowed British jets to intercept Russian aircraft near Irish airspace. 
* Ireland&#x27;s west coast overlooks North Atlantic waters that the Russians and NATO keep a close eye on.
* The deal allowing the intercepts has long been secret, and Irish lawmakers now want more details.
If Russian bombers fly near Ireland, they may be intercepted by fighter jets — but not Irish ones. 
Under a secret agreement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland that dates back more than 70 years, Britain will defend Irish airspace from intrusions by Russian aircraft and other aerial threats. 
The deal has been amended by Irish leaders over the years, but it has also been kept secret due to Irish memories of British rule and tensions over Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the UK after Ireland was partitioned in 1921.

Unidentified metallic orb UFOs have been spotted &#x27;all over the world&#x27;, a Pentagon chief admitted today during NASA&#x27;s first-ever public hearing into the phenomenon. 
Physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon&#x27;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: &#x27;We see these [&#x27;metallic orbs&#x27;] all over the world, and we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers.&#x27; 
Dr Kirkpatrick presented AARO&#x27;s latest findings to NASA&#x27;s independent team of scientists and other experts who have been tasked with studying the UFO phenomenon — which has become increasingly less stigmatized following several high-profile congressional hearings and military sightings.

CNN: Xi Jinping tells China’s national security chiefs to prepare for ‘worst case’ scenarios
Hong Kong CNN  — Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called on his top national security officials to think about “worst case” scenarios and prepare for “stormy seas,” as the ruling Communist Party hardens efforts to counter any perceived internal and external threats. 
“The complexity and difficulty of the national security issues we now face have increased significantly,” Xi said Tuesday at a meeting of the party’s National Security Commission, state news agency Xinhua reported. 
“We must adhere to bottom-line thinking and worst-case-scenario thinking, and get ready to undergo the major tests of high winds and rough waves, and even perilous, stormy seas,” he added.

Pentagon — The United States will provide another $300 million in new military aid for Ukraine in a package that is expected to include munitions for Ukraine’s Patriot missile defense system, defense officials tell VOA. 
The officials, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the package’s expected release Wednesday, said the latest aid also includes rockets for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and more tank ammunition and anti-armor capabilities ahead of an expected Ukrainian offensive.

Defense One:  Misfiring Cannons, Rotted Tires Among US Army Gear Pulled for Ukraine, Watchdog Finds 
It’s not the first time the unit and its contractor have been faulted for poorly maintained equipment by the service&#x27;s inspector general. 

When technicians got a look at one U.S. Army howitzer set to ship to Ukraine, it wasn’t pretty. 
The M777 cannon, which an Army contractor was presenting for inspection, “would have killed somebody” if it were fired, the technicians said, according to a recent report by the Defense Department’s inspector general. 
The investigation details numerous failures by an Army unit and a contractor that could have endangered the lives of Ukrainian or U.S. troops if the faulty equipment had been fielded. The report also exposes problems with a program designed to help soldiers deploy quickly across the world.

Zero Hedge: US Flexes With Low B-1 Bomber Flyover As Balkan Tensions Boil 
At a moment tensions are on edge in the Balkans over a fresh crisis between the Serbian minority of northern Kosovo and ethnic Albanians, which over the weekend saw dozens of NATO peacekeeping forces injured while trying to quell fierce protests, the United States decided it was time for some muscle-flexing. 
Two US Air Force B-1B Lancer bomber aircraft conducted a low flyover of Sarajevo and other cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Tuesday. It had been pre-announced at the start of this week and described as &quot;a sign of the strong partnership between the United States and the Armed Forces of BiH, according to a statement in the English language news portal Sarajevo Times.

Reuters: Qatar prime minister, Taliban chief hold secret Afghan talks -source 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Qatari prime minister held secret talks with the supreme leader of the Taliban this month on resolving tension with the international community, a source briefed on the meeting said, signaling a new willingness by Afghanistan&#x27;s rulers to discuss ways to end their isolation. 
The May 12 meeting in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar between Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani and Haibatullah Akhunzada is the first the reclusive Taliban chief is known to have held with a foreign leader. 
U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration was briefed on the talks and is &quot;coordinating on all issues discussed&quot; by the pair, including furthering dialogue with the Taliban, said the source. 
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said other issues Sheikh Mohammed raised with Haibatullah included the need to end a Taliban bans on girls&#x27; education and women&#x27;s employment.

Politico: Erdoğan pulls out of European summit

 
The Turkish leader, who won reelection Sunday, was expected to attend the meeting, which is meant as a show of solidarity against Russia. 
CHISINAU — A massive gathering of European leaders on Thursday has suffered its first high-profile casualty, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pulling out at the last minute. 
The Turkish leader, who won five more years at the helm of his country in second-round elections on Sunday, will not travel to Moldova for the one-day summit, according to three officials involved in the preparations. 
The so-called European Political Community (EPC) — a new collective launched in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine — is meant to draw together European leaders beyond the EU. More than 40 European leaders will be present Thursday, including those from all 27 EU countries plus non-EU countries like Britain and Turkey, as well as the Western Balkan nations.

EurActiv/Reuters: Borrell: Russia won’t enter negotiations while trying to win war 
The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, on Monday (29 May) said he believed Russia will not be willing to negotiate while it is still trying to win the war in Ukraine, adding that he was “not optimistic” about what could happen in the conflict this summer. 
 “I see a concentration of troops on both sides, the clear will of Russia to try to win the war,” Borrell told an event in Barcelona. “(Russia) will not go to a negotiation until it has tried to win the war.” 
He added that Russia has repeatedly signaled it would not cease the campaign until its military goals have been achieved. 
Borrell’s comments came the same day Russia said its military had hit Ukrainian air bases and Ukrainian forces shelled industrial facilities inside Russia as both sides sought the upper hand ahead of what Kyiv hopes will be a decisive counter-offensive.

                              <span>Daily Mail: NATO will send 700 more troops to Kosovo after 30 international soldiers were wounded amid violent protests 
* The violence has stirred fear of a renewal of the brutal conflict in the late 1990s 
* More than 10,000 people lost their lives and more than 1 million were displaced

NATO will send 700 more troops to northern Kosovo to help quell violent protests after clashes with ethnic Serbs there left 30 international soldiers wounded, the alliance announced Tuesday. 
The latest violence in the region has stirred fear of a renewal of the 1998-99 conflict in Kosovo that claimed more than 10,000 lives, left more than 1 million people homeless and resulted in a NATO peacekeeping mission that has lasted nearly a quarter of a century. 
The clashes grew out of a confrontation that unfolded last week after ethnic Albanian officials elected in votes overwhelmingly boycotted by Serbs entered municipal buildings to take office. When Serbs tried to block them, Kosovo police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.

                              <span>Incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has won Turkey&#x27;s run-off presidential vote for another five-year term, Supreme Election Board (YSK) head Ahmet Yener said on Sunday.
Erdoğan received 52.14% of the votes, Yener said.
His rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%, according to the preliminary results, Yener added.
Erdoğan can now remain in his seat for another five years and for a third time. The 69-year-old became prime minister in 2003. The parliament voted him as president in 2014.

And when he gets upset, &quot;El Popo&quot; starts to rumble as it has for more than a week.
&quot;Don Goyo&#x27;s angry because they didn&#x27;t put out his offering,&quot; said Jose Luis, a 55-year-old charcoal seller in Xalitzintla, the community closest to Popocatepetl.
Some residents even report having seen the mountain incarnate appear before them.
Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco.
&quot;We asked him &#x27;who are you?&#x27; He said: &#x27;Don&#x27;t you know me? I&#x27;m Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl. I&#x27;m the volcano,&#x27;&quot; the 77-year-old farmer said.

In Belgorod in southern Russia, the governor said the Ukrainian military was responsible for dozens of artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region but reported no casualties.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday blamed Kosovo, the United States and European Union for escalating tensions in the Balkans and said it was watching with concern after violent clashes between Kosovan police and protesters opposed to ethnic Albanian mayors.
The United States and allies on Friday rebuked Kosovo, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas undermined efforts to improve troubled relations with neighbouring Serbia. NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.
The clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.
&quot;We decisively condemn Pristina&#x27;s provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,&quot; Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
&quot;The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,&quot; she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by &quot;Western mediators&quot; had come too late.
Serbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, and Moscow has blocked the country&#x27;s bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.

&quot;The cuts come at a time of increased cyberbullying, which has been linked to higher rates of adolescent self-harm, and as the spread of misinformation and violent content collides with the exploding use of artificial intelligence,&quot; the report stated. 
In a mass effort to boost productivity with less overhead, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have all slashed thousands of jobs.
In an example of just how far tech companies are willing to go to cut costs, departments tasked with trust and safety and AI ethics have been slashed as well.

&quot;Twitter effectively disbanded its ethical AI team in November and laid off all but one of its members, along with 15% of its trust and safety department, according to reports. In February, Google cut about one-third of a unit that aims to protect society from misinformation, radicalization, toxicity and censorship,&quot; says CNBC. &quot;Meta reportedly ended the contracts of about 200 content moderators in early January. It also laid off at least 16 members of Instagram’s well-being group and more than 100 positions related to trust, integrity and responsibility, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.&quot;

It was unclear who the pope had been expected to meet with, as his agenda was not made public on Friday, as is customary.
Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin blamed the pontiff&#x27;s busy schedule, saying he was tired.
&quot;The pope was tired, yesterday he had a very busy day, he saw a lot of people .. he wanted to say hello to them all,&quot; said Parolin, according to Italian news agencies.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
