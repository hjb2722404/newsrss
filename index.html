                              <span>FEB. 24 - MARCH 2, 2023

The war in Ukraine, a shipwreck off Italy’s southern coast that drove home the desperate and dangerous sea journeys of migrants seeking to reach Europe, and a collision between a freight train and a passenger train in Greece were the top stories in Europe and Africa, along with Nigeria&#x27;s elections. 

This photo gallery highlights some of the most compelling images made or published in the week by The Associated Press from Europe and Africa. 

The selection was curated by Rome-based international photo editor Fabio Polimeni.

Eight people including a nephew of Morrisseau were arrested this week and face a total of 40 charges including forgery of artworks and of paperwork that purported to authenticate them.
&quot;Over 1,000 allegedly fraudulent paintings have been seized. The total number produced and sold is unknown,&quot; Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Kari Dart told a news conference.
Some of the paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars to unsuspecting buyers across Canada and internationally.

                              <span>King Charles III will make his state first state visits as UK monarch when he travels to France and Germany later this month, Buckingham Palace announced Friday.
The choice of the two European nations and close allies is widely seen as an attempt to build post-Brexit bridges and an acknowledgement of the affection the late Queen Elizabeth II had for France.
The visits will take place from March 26 to March 31, ahead of the king&#x27;s coronation on May 6.
The tour &quot;will celebrate Britain&#x27;s relationship with France and Germany, marking our shared histories, culture and values,&quot; the palace said.
Charles and his wife Camilla will be in France from March 26 to March 29, and will join President Emmanuel Macron for a ceremony of remembrance and wreath laying at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

                              <span>Scientists have discovered a hidden passage inside Egypt&#x27;s Great Pyramid, the authorities announced on Thursday, part of a seven-year international research project. 
The passage is nine metres (30 feet) in length and more than two metres in width, the antiquities ministry said in a statement.
Egypt&#x27;s Tourism and Antiquities Minister Ahmed Issa told reporters at the ancient site in Giza also known as the Khufu, or Cheops, pyramid, that the &quot;gabled corridor&quot; with a triangular ceiling &quot;was found on the northern face of the Great Pyramid of King Khufu&quot;.
The discovery was part of the ScanPyramids project, launched in 2015 as a collaboration between major universities in France, Germany, Canada and Japan and a group of Egyptian experts.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt&#x27;s former antiquities minister, heads the committee supervising the project, which uses advanced technology to visualise hidden parts of the pyramid&#x27;s interior without having to excavate it.
The technology is a mix of infrared thermography, muon radiography imaging and 3D reconstruction -- all of which the researchers say are non-invasive and non-destructive techniques.
The Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza, standing 146 meters tall, and the only surviving structure of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
Built some 4,500 years ago, it has three known chambers, and like other pyramids in Egypt was intended as a pharaoh&#x27;s tomb.
Hawass told reporters at the pyramid on Thursday that &quot;there is a great possibility... the tunnel is protecting something. In my opinion, it is protecting the actual burial chamber of King Khufu.&quot;
In 2017, ScanPyramids announced the discovery of a passenger plane-sized cavity, the first major structure found inside the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.

The regal crib, which has its origins in a thousand-year-old tradition observed up to the time of Henry VIII in the 16th century, was lost for decades but is ready for service after a remarkable journey.
On the night before coronation, the sovereign traditionally spent the night at the Palace of Westminster, then the Royal Palace.
After falling out of favour, the tradition was revived two centuries ago for the coronation of George IV in 1821.
But that bed was destroyed in the fire that ravaged Parliament in 1834.

Raza competed in international championships with the Pakistani women&#x27;s team in 2012 and 2013, and was once described as the &quot;linchpin&quot; of the side.

                              <span>MOSCOW (Reuters) -A court in Belarus on Friday sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Ales Bialiatski to 10 years in prison for financing protests and other crimes, in a case that rights groups say was politically motivated.
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Bialiatski and other activists sentenced in the same trial had been unfairly convicted, calling the verdict &quot;appalling&quot;.
&quot;We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice &amp; free them,&quot; she said on Twitter.
Prosecutors had asked the Minsk court to give Bialiatski, who denied the charges, a 12-year sentence.
He and three co-defendants were charged with financing protests and smuggling money.
Belarusian state news agency Belta confirmed the sentences, including a decade in jail for Bialiatski.
Aged 60, Bialiatski is a co-founder of the Viasna human rights group and one of the most prominent of hundreds of Belarusians who were jailed during a crackdown on months of anti-government protests that erupted in the summer of 2020 and continued into 2021.
Viasna took a leading role in providing legal and financial assistance to those jailed. Mass demonstrations took place after long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election.
&quot;The allegations against our colleagues are linked to their human rights activity, the Viasna human rights centre&#x27;s provision of help to the victims of politically motivated persecution,&quot; Viasna has said of the case.
Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last October for his work on human rights and democracy, sharing it with Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine&#x27;s Center for Civil Liberties.
He had been arrested in 2021 along with two co-workers from Viasna.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan&#x27;s government believes China is set to renew a charm offensive targeting &quot;opinion leaders&quot; to win hearts and minds as the island gears up for a presidential election in less than a year, a security agency said in an internal report.
China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, has long taken a carrot and stick approach to the island, threatening it with the prospect of military action while reaching out to those it believes are amenable to Beijing&#x27;s point of view.
As Taipei and Beijing gradually resume travel links halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan security officials expect China to relaunch an influence campaign that in the past included all-expenses-paid trips to China for Taiwan politicians.
From this month, the campaign will …</span>

CHASIV YAR, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian forces clinging to the eastern city of Bakhmut dug new trenches in an attempt to hold back Russian attackers, as the United States said new military aid for Ukraine would be discussed at a meeting with Germany&#x27;s leader on Friday.
Russian forces have been attacking Bakhmut in Donetsk province for months, sometimes in waves and the site has become one of the bloodiest battles of the war.
&quot;Fighting is going on in Bakhmut round the clock...The situation is critical,&quot; Volodymyr Nazarenko, a deputy commander in the National Guard of Ukraine, told Ukrainian NV Radio.

WIESBADEN, Germany (Reuters) - The United States is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through upcoming battlefield decisions, officials said on Thursday, ahead of the next phase of the year-old conflict with Russia.
The multi-day, table top exercises have been carried out at a war-gaming facility at a U.S. Army base in Wiesbaden, Germany, where the top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, visited on Thursday.
U.S. officials declined to talk through the potential battlefield scenarios that Ukrainian military staff were examining during the drills, which involve thought exercises to evaluate potential military courses of action.

                              <span>Daily Mail: A shot over China&#x27;s bows? Incredible moment Air Force breaks ship IN HALF with a single 2,000 pound &#x27;quicksink&#x27; bomb dropped by F-15E Strike Eagle with &#x27;torpedo-like&#x27; accuracy 
* The bomb, a JDAM, tested in the video  is called the Quicksink because of the rate at which it sinks ships 
* The JDAM is a relatively inexpensive way to convert unguided bombs into all-weather precision-guided munitions 
* An F-15E Strike Eagle fighter launched the modified bomb, successfully striking the target by detonating a GPS-navigated bomb underneath the vessel 
Recently released footage shows the decimation of a cargo ship by a 2,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munition dropped by the Air Force from an F-15E Strike Eagle. 
In the roughly one-minute video taken last April, an old, derelict cargo ship - the Courageous - is seen floating in the Gulf of Mexico.
Moments later a JDAM approaches from above and the Courageous is literally lifted out of the water and split in half, as waves begin to crash on the decks.

                              <span>James Rikards, Daily Reckoning: One of the Biggest Propaganda Campaigns Ever  
It’s extremely difficult to find the truth about the war in Ukraine. 
The first reason for this is because… it’s a war. Wars are always difficult to gauge in real-time. The phrase “fog of war” was invented to convey the uncertainty and imprecision about the progress of any particular war. 
Still, there’s another reason the war in Ukraine is confusing for so many. 
It’s because the Ukrainian propaganda effort is one of the most astonishingly effective concoctions of lies ever seen. 
From the “Ghost of Kyiv” fighter ace to the “Heroes of Snake Island” to wildly exaggerated claims of Russian casualties to the suppression of any news that reflects badly on Ukraine, the Ukrainian propaganda machine has been firing on…</span>

Peter Frankopan, Spectator: Is Putin winning? The world order is changing in his favour 
‘This is not about Ukraine at all, but the world order,’ said Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a month after the invasion. ‘The unipolar world is irretrievably receding into the past … A multi-polar world is being born.’ The US is no longer the world’s policeman, in other words – a message that resonates in countries that have long been suspicious of American power. The West’s core coalition may remain solid, but it has failed to win over many of the countries that refused to pick sides. Moscow’s diplomatic mission to build ties and hone a narrative over the past decade has paid dividends.
Look at Africa. In March last year, 25 African states out of 54 abstained or didn’t vote in a UN motion condemning the invasion, despite huge pressure from western powers. Their refusal to side clearly with Ukraine was testament to Russia’s ongoing diplomatic efforts in the developing world.

Reuters: Russia journal: Moscow mulls possible use of nuclear arms to fend off US attack  
A Russian defence ministry journal says Moscow is developing a new type of military strategy using nuclear weapons to protect against possible U.S. aggression, RIA news agency reported on Thursday. 
The article is the latest in a series of combative remarks by Russian politicians and commentators after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, suggesting Moscow would, if necessary, be prepared to deploy its vast nuclear arsenal.
RIA said the article, published in the Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought) magazine, concluded Washington was worried it might be losing dominance over the world and had therefore &quot;apparently&quot; prepared plans to strike Russia to neutralise it.

WNU Editor:  In the past few months I have noticed this change among many of my Russian family members and friends on the possibility that the US may launch a nuclear first strike against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine worsens for Kyiv. This  Russian defence ministry journal is voicing what many fear Washington will do next.

Update: I take Russian nuclear threats seriously. I completely disagree with this point of view .... Russian Nuclear Threats Are Empty, Part of ‘Information Operation:’ ISW (Newsweek).

China has a &quot;stunning lead&quot; ahead of the US in high-impact research across critical and emerging technologies, according to Canberra-based independent think tank Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI. 
The world&#x27;s second-largest economy is leading the US in researching 37 out of 44 critical and emerging technologies across the defense, space, energy, and biotechnology sectors — including research of advanced aircraft engines, drones, and electric batteries — the ASPI said in its Thursday report.

Reuters: US to announce new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will announce a new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday, worth roughly $400 million and comprised mainly of ammunition, two officials and a person familiar with the package said. 
Aid for Ukraine is expected to be a major topic when President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meet at the White House on Friday. 
The package, the sources said on Thursday, is expected to contain more Guided Multiple Launch Rockets (GMLRS) for HIMARS launchers, ammunition for the Bradley Fighting Vehicles, as well as armored vehicle launched bridges.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A court on Friday sentenced Belarus’ top human rights advocate and one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize to 10 years in prison, the latest move in a yearslong crackdown on dissent that has engulfed the ex-Soviet nation since 2020. 
The harsh punishment of Ales Bialiatski and three of his colleagues was delivered in response to massive protests over a 2020 election that gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a new term in office.

Ukraine has ordered some residents to leave Kupiansk, as Russia seeks to re-take the city it left last year. 
Kharkiv&#x27;s regional authorities said families with children and people &quot;with limited mobility&quot; must leave due to &quot;constant&quot; shelling by Russian forces. 
Russia seized the north-eastern city early in the full-scale invasion, with Ukraine recapturing it last September. 
Meanwhile, Russian mercenaries say they have &quot;practically encircled&quot; the key city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.

WNU Editor: Kupiansk is a critical rail hub. Russian forces will need to retake this city to deny the Ukrainian army the logistical support that is necessary for Kyiv to supply their forces in the region and northern Donbas. After the fall of Bakhmut, this may become the new battle line.

Reuters: Russian mercenary chief says Ukraine&#x27;s Bakhmut is practically surrounded 
(Reuters) -Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary force, said in a video published on Friday that the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was &quot;practically surrounded&quot; by his forces and that Kyiv&#x27;s forces had only one road left out. 
Prigozhin&#x27;s men have spearheaded the assault in eastern Ukraine for months. 
Moscow regards Bakhmut, which it calls by its Soviet-era name of Artyomovsk, as a useful stepping stone to seize bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. 
Prigozhin, wearing a military uniform in the video, called on Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to withdraw his forces from the small city.

WNU Editor: The military experts are trust tell me that Russia has now attained fire-control over all roads leading in and out of Bakhmut. I do not know how many Ukrainian soldiers are left in Bakhmut, but it looks like they are going to experience the same fate that Ukrainian soldiers faced in Mariupol. A siege that will go on for the next month or two before there is a mass surrender.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Sixty-five percent of Americans prefer the U.S. to take the leading (20%) or a major role (45%) in world affairs. This is down from 69% in 2019 and 72% as recently as 2017. The current figure is one percentage point below the prior low from 2011. In almost all years since Gallup first asked the question in 2001, more than seven in 10 Americans have favored a leading or major role for the U.S., including a high of 79% in February 2003.

WNU Editor: The world is a different place today, and many are not sympathetic to Washington. As the world breaks up into multi-polar blocs, there is going to be push-back against the U.S. and its economic/political/military/and social policies. 
My hope is that the foreign policy experts in Washington are smart enough to realize that, and be able to maneuver US foreign policy to safeguard US interests, while respecting what other countries want. This could be a new age for the US on the world stage, or a mess of disputes and conflicts that will only drain the US in both blood and treasure.</span>

Tech Monitor: Could undersea cables be the next casualty of hybrid warfare? 
The UK, Italy and France are all investing in new ships and infrastructure to protect the internet from Russian aggression. Critics argue they’re overreacting.
The Akademik Boris Petrov is officially listed as a research vessel. About 75 metres long and moored, at the time of writing, in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, the ship’s official purpose is to survey the ocean depths. Others believe its role is more nefarious. Labelled a ‘spy ship’ by several UK tabloids, the vessel’s brilliant white silhouette has been variously described as skulking away from the Shetland Islands just after its undersea internet cable connection to the rest of the world was severed, and being forced out of the Netherlands’ territorial waters by that country’s coastguard under suspicion of mapping the underwater infrastructure syphoning natural gas and internet traffic in and out of Western Europe. 
To clarify, the Akademik Boris Petrov has not been officially labelled as a Russian spy vessel by any government, and neither has it been conclusively linked to acts of sabotage or espionage as they pertain to undersea internet cables. But Western capitals are worried.

WNU Editor: The deliberate destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines last year has opened the door that undersea infrastructures are now fair game. To me it is a given that it is only a matter of time before the West&#x27;s undersea internet infrastructure is targeted as the war in Ukraine escalates.</span>

Financial Post/Reuters: Russia set to seal up damaged Nord Stream gas pipelines: reports  
Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipes ruptured in unexplained blasts last year  
MOSCOW/FRANKFURT — Russia’s ruptured undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines are set to be sealed up and mothballed as there are no immediate plans to repair or reactivate them, sources familiar with the plans have told Reuters. 
Three of the pipes were ruptured by unexplained blasts in September, and one of the Nord Stream 2 pipes remains intact.  But soaring tensions between Moscow and the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had by then already brought Nord Stream 1 to a standstill and prevented its twin, criticized by Washington and Kyiv for increasing Germany’s dependence on Russia, ever coming online.

Reuters: Iran rial plunges to new lows amid unrest, international isolation 
Iran&#x27;s currency fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Sunday, amid the country&#x27;s increasing isolation over its disputed nuclear programme, human rights violations and the supply of drones to Russia. 
The U.S. dollar was fetching as much as 601,500 rials on Iran&#x27;s unofficial market on Sunday, compared with 575,000 on the previous day and 540,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. 
Iranian authorities have blamed the currency&#x27;s fall on &quot;the enemies&#x27; plot&quot; to destabilise the Islamic Republic after months of unrest sparked by the death in custody of a young woman on Sept. 16. 
The rial has lost nearly half of its value since the start of nationwide protests, the boldest challenge to theocratic rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

WNU Editor: The Iranian government is in a Catch-22 situation. The government provides subsidies and support programs that are not sustainable, but cutting these programs will only fuel more protests. Here is an easy prediction. Currency depreciation and high inflation are not coming down anytime soon.</span>

   RT:  Pro-Kiev stunt in Baltics goes awry (VIDEO)  
The displays of destroyed Russian tanks somewhat backfired on those behind the project  
Actions in support of Kiev in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania went off script over the weekend as locals started bringing flowers to destroyed Russian tanks that had been put on display in the three nations’ capitals to demonstrate solidarity with Ukraine. 
A video released by RT&#x27;s video agency Ruptly shows small bouquets of flowers lying on the ground near a burnt-out Russian tank in the Latvian capital of Riga. The destroyed equipment was put on display at one of the central city squares to mark the anniversary of the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, which started in late February 2022.

People are mentioning even battles like Fallujah-2 or Raqqa-2 which only had a few thousand KIA. That is a warped view that doesn&#x27;t do the sheer scope of Bakhmut justice. Most of Wagner and tens of thousands of AFU soldiers have been fighting for months with *extreme* intensity.

Air Mobility Command has directed its refueling and cargo planes to obscure the majority of identifying information painted on the aircraft, citing national security concerns -- an unusual move that is alarming to government watchdogs. 
James Stewart, a spokesman for Air Mobility Command, told Military.com in an emailed statement that airmen&#x27;s missions take them around the globe and often involve sensitive movements of cargo -- the main reason behind the change.

                              <span>France 24: UK disappointed as Argentina withdraws from Falklands pact 
The UK government on Thursday insisted the Falkland Islands remained British as Argentina walked away from a cooperation pact and demanded new talks over their sovereignty. 
Known as the Malvinas in Spanish, the UK-ruled islands were the subject of a short but brutal war after Argentina invaded in 1982. Britain drove out the invading force after dispatching a naval armada. 
In 2016, the two sides agreed to disagree about sovereignty, but to cooperate on issues such as energy, shipping and fishing, and on identifying the remains of unknown Argentine soldiers killed in battle. 
But at G20 talks in New Delhi, Argentinian Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero informed UK counterpart James Cleverly that his government was abando…</span>

BBC: Argentina&#x27;s power largely restored after fire hits national grid 
Power has largely been restored in Argentina after more than half of the country was left without electricity for several hours. 
More than 20 million people in major cities and large swathes of the countryside were affected on Wednesday. 
The blackout is believed to have been caused by a large fire in open fields west of the capital, Buenos Aires. 
The blaze brought down crucial power lines and forced a nuclear power station to be taken offline.

BALEDOGLE, Somalia — The promise and perils of America’s counterterrorism campaign were on full display at a remote training base in central Somalia.
It was graduation day for 346 recruits who would join an elite Somali commando unit trained by the State Department, advised by U.S. Special Operations forces, and backed by American air power. 
Since last August, the unit, called Danab, has spearheaded a string of Somali army victories against Al Shabab, an Islamist terrorist group that is considered the deadliest of Al Qaeda’s global branches.

Reuters: Lockheed Martin Profits More From War Than Any Other Company on Earth 
With such horrifying images from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any winners, but there are those who profit from the war, specifically military contractors. U.S. military aid for Ukraine and nearby countries has reached $3.75 billion. Almost all U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are from our stockpiles and will have to be replaced. This means a huge check to companies making military hardware and software. Lockheed Martin Corp is the largest U.S. defense contractor and the domestic company that profits the most from war. 
The financial opportunity for Lockheed Martin and other large contractors is vast. America’s defense budget will be over $800 billion this year. (Here’s how Ukraine’s newly bolstered tank army compares to Russia’s.) 
Lockheed Martin employs 116,000 people. The company reported a total of $66 billion in revenue in 2022 and a profit of $5.7 billion. It has a backlog of orders that stands at $150 billion. Last year, it was No. 55 on the Fortune 500.

Over a hundred Western-made modern battle tanks have been pledged to Ukraine over the past few months - just four have arrived so far. 
February 24 marked the first anniversary of Russia’s war against Ukraine and its people. The grim milestone was met with renewed promises of weapons from dozens of countries, but now that the buzz has died down, the harsh reality behind the handshakes and photo ops is slowly revealing itself. NATO fighter jets will not see combat in Ukraine, tanks will take months if not years to reach the battlefield. Long-term military underfunding is the root cause across Europe. Here, Express.co.uk takes a look at the countries lagging the most when it comes to delivering on their commitments.

Politico: EU looks to dedicate €1B to howitzer shells for Ukraine 
Europe wants to ensure its funds are specifically channeled to the artillery rounds that Ukraine desperately needs to fight Russia. 
BRUSSELS — In a new blueprint for military support to Ukraine, the European Union will propose that €1 billion should be specifically dedicated to ammunition, particularly 155mm artillery shells, according to a document seen by POLITICO. 
The EU is helping supply Ukraine with arms through an off-budget, inter-governmental cash pot called the European Peace Facility, which is used to reimburse countries that export arms to Ukraine. So far, the facility has disbursed €3.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine, with member countries deciding last December to increase its funding by €2 billion in 2023.

The Intercept: Pentagon Developed Contingency Plan for War With Iran 
In January, the U.S. and Israel conducted the largest joint military exercise in history. 
The U.S. military allocated spending for secret contingency operations pertaining to an Iran war plan, according to a classified Pentagon budget manual listing emergency and special programs reviewed by The Intercept. 
The contingency plan, code-named “Support Sentry,” was funded in 2018 and 2019, according to the manual, which was produced for the 2019 fiscal year. It classifies Support Sentry as an Iran “CONPLAN,” or concept plan, a broad contingency plan for war which the Pentagon develops in anticipation of a potential crisis.

Sputnik: Medvedev: Delivery of NATO Aircraft to Kiev Will Mean Alliance&#x27;s War Against Russia 
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The delivery of NATO aircraft to Ukraine and their maintenance on the territory of the alliance will be a direct entry of NATO into the war against Russia, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday. 
Since the 1920s, there has been an understanding that a country can be recognized as a participant in hostilities if, in addition to supplying weapons, it trains personnel to use them, Medvedev recalled. 
&quot;This is how it is happening today: Canadian and German instructors in the EU are already teaching Ukrainian killers how to handle Leopards,&quot; Medvedev said on Telegram.

                              <span>Residents in Taiwan’s capital Taipei have been demanding authorities bring back their bins as hundreds had been removed to reduce pollution and waste.

Taiwan has been implementing new ways to minimise waste in the country, with the waste of every person in Taiwan dropping to less than 20 per cent.

Bins had been replaced with rubbish drop-offs where a truck would pick up rubbish on a corner, however 70 per cent of Taipei citizens have requested to get more bins.

The new Mayor of Taipei is looking to install more bins due to public pressure.</span>

In the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, the volunteers collecting the civilian dead risk becoming casualties themselves. 
“Where? Where?” demands Daniel Wilk, a Canadian driver, in shaky video footage shot recently inside the city and seen by the Guardian. 
Wilk proceeds quickly, the anxiety of the situation visible in his movements as he is directed to a fence, cutting an uncertain path across the snow as another voice cries “no, no” repeatedly.

   Zero Hedge: NBC Reporter Goes To Crimea, Shocks Viewers By Telling The Truth 
Mainstream media correspondents for major US networks rarely, if ever, report from inside Crimea and certainly are nowhere near Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine. However, this week NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons went to Sevastopol, surrounded by a significant Russian military presence given it is home to the Russian Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet, and in a live segment admitted that it&#x27;s not at all realistic Zelensky and Ukrainian forces can ever hope to take Crimea. 
This is especially as the &quot;the people there... view themselves as Russian.&quot; Simmons noted that &quot;This is the closest that any US news crew has got to the Russian Black Sea Fleet in many many years.&quot; He explained that &quot;Vladimir Putin will be determined to defend that port - to not have it take it away from him - he may well do pretty much anything to try to achieve that.&quot;

Video footage has been posted online, allegedly showing a first-person view (FPV) from a drone attacking a Russian Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft. 
It was announced by ByPol, a Belarusian resistance organization formed by former law enforcement officers who changed their loyalties and went on to oppose the regime of the official Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
 ByPol claims the attack was successful and an A-50 aircraft, stationed at the base, was damaged. So far there has been no independent confirmation regarding the result of the attack.

New policies expand transgender procedures to the service academies, allow gender transitions while on-duty, and mandate group shower facility use by both biological sexes if certain administrative requirements are met. Oh, and military commanders are responsible to “not accommodate biases against transgender individuals” 
As RealClear Defense recently reported, on December 20, 2022 the Department of Defense issued an update to DOD Instruction 1300.28, entitled “In-Service Transition for Transgender Service Members,” which “expanded woke transgender mandates in significant ways.”
The article compares the original instruction, issued in the waning days of the Obama administration in October 2016, to the current expansion, with the aide of a study and summary compiled by the Center for Military Readiness (CMR).
Significantly, the CMR study and summary explain the significance of  the changes, which fall into six major areas, and which were issued  “without public debate”:

B92: No manpower, no weapons... And Berlin would fall  
New German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Monday that Germany&#x27;s military is not ready to defend the country if it is attacked.  
&quot;We do not have armed forces capable of defending the country against a brutal offensive and an aggressive war,&quot; he said, during a meeting with members of his Social Democratic Party (SPD). 
According to him, Germany&#x27;s Bundeswehr armed forces are undermanned thanks to decades of neglect by the federal government. Therefore, he believes that Germany will have to invest much more in defense in order to reach NATO standards. 
The highest-ranking officer of the Bundeswehr, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, confirmed Pistorius&#x27;s words in fact, when he declared that even the 100 billion euros earmarked for the German army by Chancellor Olaf Scholz will not be enough for the Bundeswehr to be capable of waging war.

(Bloomberg) — Two thirds of Canadians suspect China attempted to interfere in recent elections that returned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals to power, according to a new poll. 
More than half think the alleged meddling represents a serious threat to Canada’s democracy. A similar proportion says Trudeau’s response to the simmering scandal hasn’t been tough enough.

Politico:  Why Can’t Democrats Explain Themselves on China?  
Biden has yet to find the rhetoric to describe his views on America’s global rival — and that’s a big problem. 
President Joe Biden likes to sum up his approach to China with a snappy mantra: “Competition, not conflict.” He used that construction at the G-20 summit last fall in Bali, Indonesia, after meeting with Xi Jinping to revive their strained relationship. Biden deployed it again in his State of the Union address this month, days after sending warplanes to destroy a Chinese spy balloon off the Atlantic coast.

                              <span>Reuters: Exclusive-US Seeks Allies&#x27; Backing for Possible China Sanctions Over Ukraine War -Sources 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources. 
The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions. 
 It was not clear what specific sanctions Washington will propose. The conversations have not been previously disclosed.  The U.S. Treasury Department, a lead agency on the imposition of sanctions, declined to comment.

WNU Editor: The EU economy is still reeling from the sanctions they imposed on Russian resources. EU sanctions on China will create the perfect storm to not only to create shortages in many finished products that families need, but also the inflationary impact that it will have. 
So the big question is .... will the EU go down this ruinous economic road? 
My answer is yes. But at the beginning it will be limited in its scope.</span>

Global Times: PLA Navy holds 1st amphibious assault ship far sea drills in West Pacific 
The Hainan, the first Type 075 amphibious assault ship of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, recently joined a flotilla and conducted a far sea exercise in the West Pacific, marking the first time that China has held an expeditionary voyage with a warship of this type. 
Such drills displayed the vessel&#x27;s high level of combat readiness and the PLA Navy&#x27;s amphibious landing capabilities in carrying out traditional security missions as well as non-traditional ones like anti-terrorism and humanitarian aid, analysts said on Thursday. 
The far sea joint training flotilla under the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy recently returned to base after successfully carrying out a combat training mission in the South China Sea and the West Pacific over 30 days and across more than 9,000 nautical miles, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Thursday.

                              <span>Wearing flamboyant costumes and masks imitating blue-eyed, bearded Europeans, carnival-goers in Mexico have turned mocking colonizers into an art form.
The colorful celebration stands out from hundreds of other carnivals in Latin America by rekindling the spirit of revenge against erstwhile invaders.
Each year, men in wooden masks playing the role of light-skinned Europeans dance through the streets of Tlaxcala, one of Mexico&#x27;s smallest states, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of the capital Mexico City.
Many sport carefully-trimmed beards resembling those of Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes, while others have mustaches.
Participants in the photogenic festivities recreate the dandy style of the people who crossed the Atlantic to the New World.
Women wear the flowing dresses and elaborate hats of European ladies centuries ago.
The aim is to &quot;mock the invaders... especially their customs and habits, which for the people of Tlaxcala were very effeminate,&quot; tourist guide Eduardo Cuautle Xochitemotl said beneath a mural depicting local history.
The feather-topped masks, hand-embroidered clothes and European-style costumes are a celebration of the cultural collisions that have shaped the region.
The Tlaxcalans allied with Cortes to capture the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan -- today Mexico City -- in 1521.
While their collaboration assured them certain privileges, the Tlaxcalans still faced exclusion by powerful Spanish landowners.
&quot;At the time when we were conquered, the big haciendas held huge parties with music and dance, which we, the indigenous people, could not enter,&quot; said dancer Carlos Gomez Vazquez.
Another target of the mockery is the French influence that took root in the late 19th century under general-turned-president Porfirio Diaz, whose legacy can be seen today in Mexico City&#x27;s Parisian-style architecture.
And in modern-day Mexico, centuries-old foes are not the only subjects of ridicule.
&quot;Nowadays the tradition is to mock today&#x27;s politicians,&quot; Xochitemotl said.

                              <span>A Belgian woman who murdered her five children in a case that shocked the country has been euthanised at her own request, 16 years to the day after their killing, her lawyer said Thursday.
Genevieve Lhermitte slit the throats of her son and four daughters aged three to 14 with a kitchen knife at the family home in the town of Nivelles on February 28, 2007 while their father was away.
She then tried to commit suicide by stabbing herself, but the attempt failed and she ended up calling the emergency services.
Lhermitte was sentenced to life in prison in 2008, before being moved to a psychiatric hospital in 2019.
The 56-year-old&#x27;s lawyer Nicolas Cohen confirmed to AFP reports in local media that his client had died through euthanasia on the sixteenth anniversary of the killings on Tuesday.

                              <span>South African Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius, who killed his girlfriend 10 years ago, will know in about a month whether he will be released on parole, his lawyer said Thursday.
&quot;We have been advised by the parole board that (the) hearing will take place on the 31st of March, 2023,&quot; his lawyer Julian Knight told AFP. &quot;It&#x27;s an internal process&quot;.
Pistorius, 36, shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2013 when he fired four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house.
He pleaded not guilty and denied that he killed Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a burglar.
Pistorius, known worldwide as the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; because of his carbon-fibre prosthetics, was sentenced to 13 years behind bars.
Offenders in South Africa are automatically eligible for parole consideration after serving half of their sentence. Pistorius has served more than half.
A decision is usually known the same day of the parole hearing or a day later, and &quot;if the decision is negative, the offender has the right to approach the courts for review,&quot; said Knight.
A year before killing Steenkamp, Pistorius became the first double-amputee to race at the Olympics at the London 2012 games.
He was initially sentenced to six years in jail but the sentence was later lengthened to 13 after the state appealed that it was unduly lenient.

Anti-French sentiment runs high in some former African colonies as the continent becomes a renewed diplomatic battleground, with Russian and Chinese influence growing in the region.
Macron said France harboured no desire to return to past policies of interfering in Africa ahead of an environment summit in Gabon, the first leg of his trip.
&quot;The age of Francafrique is well over,&quot; Macron said in remarks to the French community in the capital Libreville, referring to France&#x27;s post-colonization strategy of supporting authoritarian leaders to defend its interests.

Their acts -- which included ferrying messages across enemy lines, smuggling packages and helping Resistance fighters and Allied airmen escape -- carried the risk of imprisonment, torture and even death.
And yet for decades after the war, the roles played by unsung war heroes like these were greatly underestimated and rarely documented.
Aged 101, 100 and 96 respectively, de Vasselot, Niles and Agniel spoke to AFP on the eve of International Women&#x27;s Day about their part in combatting tyranny.

The audio clip of the January telephone call, released on social media by a daughter of one of those held, has become a symbol of the courage of the women held in Evin prison and their refusal to stop campaigning even behind bars.

                              <span>Controversial legal reforms being debated in Israel&#x27;s parliament have sparked fears in the high-tech and financial sectors that foreign investors will be scared off in a blow to growth prospects.
The new legislation has been spearheaded by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which took office in December and is regarded as the most right-wing in Israeli history.
It aims to curtail the powers of the Supreme Court and give politicians greater powers over the selection of judges.
The proposals could deal a &quot;severe blow to the economy&quot;, former Bank of Israel governors have warned in the country that dubs itself the &quot;start-up nation&quot;.

                              <span>The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, one of Denmark&#x27;s most iconic landmarks, was vandalised overnight Thursday with a Russian flag painted across the statue&#x27;s base.
The colors of Russia&#x27;s flag had been painted on the stone where the statue rests of the heroine from Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s famous novel, an AFP journalist saw.
Copenhagen police told AFP they had been at the scene in the morning and recorded &quot;a case of vandalism.&quot;
&quot;Investigations have been carried out in the area in order to find traces,&quot; police added.
An investigation had been opened into act, an apparent sign of support for Moscow in the midst of its war in Ukraine.
A few puzzled tourists photographed the vandalized statue on Thursday morning.
The Little Mermaid -- inspired by a character in Danish poet and author Andersen&#x27;s 1837 fairytale of the same name -- is a 175-kilogram (385-pound) statue by sculptor Edvard Eriksen.
The statue, which sits on a relatively secluded waterfront promenade, has been vandalized numerous times over the years -- including when the mermaid&#x27;s head was stolen in 1964 and 1998, as well as when an arm was cut off in 1984.
In 1998, vandals cut off its head again, but it was later returned, before the statue was blown up in 2003.
It has been tagged and painted many times, most recently in 2020 with the mysterious inscription &quot;Racist fish&quot;.

                              <span>Following the announcement of his indefinite touring hiatus, Justin Bieber&#x27;s tour dates appear ultimately to be scrapped, with fan sites and ticketing outlets reporting cancellations.
All of his concerts, including in the United States, Ireland and France, are marked as cancelled on Ticketmaster&#x27;s website.
Neither Bieber, 29, nor his representatives have provided reasons for or official confirmation of the cancellations.
The superstar announced he was taking a break from performing last year, saying he&#x27;d been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, a rare complication of shingles that for him caused partial facial paralysis.
&quot;I need to make my health the priority right now,&quot; he said at the time.
&quot;I&#x27;m going to be OK, but I need time to rest and get better. I&#x27;ve been so proud to bring this show and our message of justice to the world.&quot;
Bieber had dozens of performances across the globe scheduled through March 2023. 
Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can inflame and paralyze the facial nerve and cause a painful rash around the ear or mouth. In addition to facial paralysis, it can cause hearing loss.

Larissa, GREECE (Reuters) - Rescuers resumed a search on Thursday for survivors of Greece&#x27;s deadliest train crash, combing through the buckled and crushed remains of carriages that derailed and then caught fire in a disaster that killed at least 38 people.
The high-speed passenger train with more than 350 people on board crashed head-on with a freight train near the city of Larissa late on Tuesday, and hopes of finding anyone still alive in the wreckage more than 34 hours later appeared slim.
&quot;It will be very difficult to find survivors, due to the temperatures that developed in the carriages,&quot; 40-year old rescuer Constantinos Imamidis told Reuters.
&quot;This is the hardest thing, instead of saving lives we have to dig out bodies.&quot;

                              <span>CNN: Exclusive: US Air Force fires leaders for failing nuclear safety inspection 
Two US Air Force commanders and four of their subordinates at a key nuclear base in North Dakota were relieved of duty this week after their units failed an inspection designed to ensure that the nuclear weapons stockpile is safe and secure at all times, two defense officials told CNN. 
The removals occurred at Minot Air Force Base, which is the only Air Force installation that houses two legs of the “nuclear triad” – ballistic missile silos and strategic bombers. 
The officials told CNN that the six service members were relieved of duty following the failed nuclear surety inspection at the base.  The nuclear surety inspection is a pass/fail test and the results are classified. 
There is no indication that the failed inspection was related to the handling of a nuclear weapon itself. Another defense official said the failure was for “non-compliance vehicle and equipment safety inspections.”

The comments from FBI Director Christopher Wray come after a new DOE report thrust the lab leak theory back into the spotlight. 
 FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday publicly acknowledged the agency’s stance that the COVID-19 pandemic likely resulted from an accidental laboratory leak in China.
“The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan,” Wray told Fox News.

Reuters: Iran can make fissile material for a bomb &#x27;in about 12 days&#x27; - U.S. official 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran could make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in &quot;about 12 days,&quot; a top U.S. Defense Department official said on Tuesday, down from the estimated one year it would have taken while the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was in effect. 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl made the comment to a House of Representatives hearing when pressed by a Republican lawmaker why the Biden administration had sought to revive the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 

 &quot;Because Iran&#x27;s nuclear progress since we left the JCPOA has been remarkable. Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one bomb&#x27;s worth of fissile material. Now it would take about 12 days,&quot; Kahl, the third ranking Defense Department official, told lawmakers.

Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says Ukraine will become a member of the alliance in the &quot;long-term&quot;, but for now it needs to remain independent in the face of Russia&#x27;s invasion. 
Ukraine has sought to join the US-led military alliance for years. 
After Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country, President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for that request to be fast-tracked. 
Ukraine also applied for EU membership days after Russia invaded, and gained candidate status in June. 
&quot;Nato allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective,&quot; Mr Stoltenberg told reporters during a visit to Finland&#x27;s capital, Helsinki.

NBC NEWS HOST: President Zelensky has called for F-16 fighter jets, but President Biden says he&#x27;s not sending them right now. A lot of your colleagues on Capitol Hill say that is the wrong move. They say the administration is giving President Zelensky enough aid to stay in the war but not to win the war. What say you? Should the Biden administration provide the F-16 fighter jets?

Reuters: Zelenskiy Fires a Top Ukrainian Military Commander, No Reason Given 
(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday fired a senior military commander helping lead the fight against Russian troops in the country&#x27;s embattled east but gave no reason for the move. 
In a one-line decree, Zelenskiy announced the dismissal of Eduard Moskalyov as commander of the joint forces of Ukraine, which are engaged in battles in the Donbas region. 
Zelenskiy mentioned Moskalyov in a daily address on Friday when listing the military commanders he had spoken to. 
Moskalyov had been in the post since March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine.  Neither the joint forces&#x27; Facebook nor Twitter accounts made any mention of the dismissal.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.
