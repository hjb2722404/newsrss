Mapped: The World’s Countries Compared by 20 Key Metrics 
Which countries have the largest populations? What about the rural versus urban population divide? And which countries have the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), military expenditures, or tech exports? 
Instead of comparing countries by one metric, this animation and series of graphics by Anders Sundell uses 20 different categories of World Bank data to compare countries. The data was sourced in July 2022 and contains the latest available data for each country. 
Below, we provide some context on eight of the 20 categories, and share some facts on the top ranking countries for each category.

                              <span>Daily Signal: ‘An Atmosphere of Lawlessness’: Attacks on Churches Nearly Triple in 4 Years, New Report Finds 
A Christian leader has blasted the Biden administration for “creating an atmosphere of lawlessness” by ignoring attacks on churches and houses of worship nationwide, which have nearly tripled over the last four years, according to a startling new report. 
These assaults ranged from deadly to defacing, covered every region of the country and denominational background, and often sprang from pro-abortion domestic terrorism or other forms of left-wing enmity against biblical morality. 
Offenders committed at least 420 acts of hostility against 397 separate churches in the United States between January 2018 and September 2022. These cases include everything from arson and gun-related violence to vandalism and bomb threats, the copiously documented, 84-page report specifies.

Henry Kissinger, The Spectator: How to avoid another world war 
The first world war was a kind of cultural suicide that destroyed Europe’s eminence. Europe’s leaders sleepwalked – in the phrase of historian Christopher Clark – into a conflict which none of them would have entered had they foreseen the world at war’s end in 1918. In the previous decades, they had expressed their rivalries by creating two sets of alliances whose strategies had become linked by their respective schedules for mobilisation. As a result, in 1914, the murder of the Austrian Crown Prince in Sarajevo, Bosnia by a Serb nationalist was allowed to escalate into a general war that began when Germany executed its all-purpose plan to defeat France by attacking neutral Belgium at the other end of Europe.

                              <span>DW: Slovakia: Uncertainty ahead after government ousted 
Slovakia&#x27;s parliament voted to topple the country&#x27;s self-proclaimed anti-corruption, reformist government yesterday after two-and-a-half years in office. 
What happens next and how did it come to this?   Slovakia&#x27;s government, which was lead by the OLANO party (ORDINARY PEOPLE and Independent Personalities) and Prime Minister Eduard Heger, was brought down yesterday when 78 of the 120 MPs present in parliament backed a motion of no confidence in the government. 
The result came despite several rounds of protracted negotiations that sought to avert a negative outcome for the government. Heger&#x27;s cabinet had been hoping to survive the vote right up until the end. Finance Minister Igor Matovic even offered to resign if the opposition withdrew its no-confidence motion.
MPs met in the chamber of the National Council at 5 p.m. (CET) ready to cast their votes, but discussions dragged on for another 90 minutes.

Washington Free Beacon: Peace Between Jordan and Israel Unraveling, Report Says 
Israel’s decades-long peace with Jordan is unraveling, a development that threatens to upset a fragile regional stability that is being challenged by countries like Iran, Russia, and China, a think tank report warns.
&quot;Since 2020, if not before then, the Jordanian peace has turned decidedly cold,&quot; according to Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism finance analyst at the Treasury Department who now works at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. While the relationship has been breaking down behind the scenes for some time, Jordan also began to publicly war with Israel in recent years, by refusing to sign the Abraham Accords peace agreements, attacking incoming prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and threatening to fully abrogate the peace deal it signed with Israel in 1994.

Moldovan authorities said that the channels&#x27; licenses were revoked in order to prevent &quot;disinformation&quot; about Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 
Moldova has suspended the broadcast licenses of six television channels over &quot;disinformation,&quot; authorities said. 
The decision to revoke the licenses was announced by Moldova&#x27;s Commision for Exceptional Situations, which was established following Moscow&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 
Moldovan President Maia Sandu called the suspensions &quot;an important step to prevent attempts to destabilize&quot; the country.

                              <span>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Kyiv   
Daily Mail: Rishi Sunak &#x27;orders Goldman Sachs-style audit of how UK supplies are used in Ukraine war&#x27; amid fears he will be overly-cautious during crucial phase of fight against Putin&#x27;s Russia 
* Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has reportedly ordered an audit into the Ukraine war 
* It will review the costs and benefits of Britain arming Ukraine in the invasion  
* The UK has been one of the biggest military suppliers to the country this year  
Rishi Sunak has reportedly asked for a &#x27;Goldman Sachs-style&#x27; audit of progress in the war in Ukraine, sparking fears he is moving towards a more cautious approach to Vladimir Putin&#x27;s invasion.  
Senior government figures are said be concerned the Prime Minister could change the UK&#x27;s stance on the conflict as it enters a crucial phase.   
A source in Whitehall compared the move to a &#x27;Goldman Sachs dashboard&#x27; review of the invasion and Britain&#x27;s supply lines to Ukraine.

Update: Rishi Sunak orders audit of Ukraine war progress, source says (BBC)   
WNU Editor: This is not a real audit. This is a normal British government mandated report and review on the actual military realities in the Russia - Ukraine war. I do not expect this report will ever be made public. I also expect zero change in policy when this report is finalized. 
But what is interesting about this story is how the British media has responded to this leak.  A leak (according to the BBC) from Whitehall. You would think that a thorough examination by the government on the progress of the war would be overwhelmingly supported by the media. Instead, it seems the British media are not only critical that this report is being done (parroting what the Whitehall leaker has said), but they are also deeply concerned that this report may result in a lessening of support for Ukraine.
When did Whitehall (i.e. the bureaucracy) decide what UK policy was to be? It looks like the UK has its own &quot;deep state&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Washington Post: Protesters in Peru refuse to back down as political crisis deepens 
LIMA, Peru — The political crisis roiling Peru deepened Saturday, as President Dina Boluarte’s new government edged toward collapse and protesters across the country refused to back down despite the military enforcing a state of emergency. 
A total of 20 demonstrators are reported to have been killed in clashes with security forces, including eight allegedly shot Thursday by soldiers using live ammunition in the southern mountain region of Ayacucho. 
Protesters have stormed several regional airports, looted businesses and blocked roads, primarily in the impoverished mountain regions of the Andean nation. 
Last year, those areas voted heavily for Pedro Castillo, a rural schoolteacher and former wildcat-strike leader, who was impeached as president last week after he attempted to dissolve Congress and restructure the judiciary.

RT: Putin holds top brass meeting on Ukraine  
The Russian president heard proposals on immediate and medium-term plans for the conflict  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sat down with the country’s top military commanders to discuss the Ukraine conflict, the Kremlin revealed on Saturday. The agenda revolved around Moscow’s actions in the short and medium term.
According to the Kremlin’s readout of the meeting, “throughout Friday, the president worked at the joint headquarters of the military branches involved in the special military operation.” It did not provide details on where the meeting took place.

WNU Editor: The New York Times is correct. This is a rare visit by Putin to the Ukraine War Room .... Putin Makes Rare Visit to Ukraine War Headquarters (DNYUZ/New York Times). 
What this meeting signals to me is that the Generals have developed a plan, and they are briefing President Putin on what they want to do. Putin himself said that he had come to listen to his commanders’ proposals about the Russian military’s “short- and medium-term movements.” 
One more point. And I believe it is an important one. 
At the conclusion of this meeting I did not get the impression that Russia is preparing a large-scale ground offensive operation anytime soon.</span>

Ukraine’s presidential office is criticizing FIFA for refusing to show a video message from President Volodymyr Zelensky in Qatar’s Lusail Stadium ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday. 
The video, which was recorded in English, is meant to be an “appeal for peace,” Ukraine’s presidential office said in a written statement to CNN on Saturday. 
“Qatar supported the President’s initiative, but FIFA blocked the initiative and will not allow the video address of the president to be shown before the final game,” the statement said.

Putin is &#x27;planning for a long war&#x27; and the West must continue to send arms to Ukraine until Russia &#x27;cannot win on the battlefield&#x27;, a NATO chief has said.   
Russia is readying for a protracted war in Ukraine, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.  It comes after Putin sent a nuclear message to the West for a third day running with new deployment of Yars strategic missile as it today unleashed the latest in a series of devastating attacks against Ukraine.

Update: Putin &#x27;planning for a long war&#x27; in Ukraine: NATO chief (France 24)   
WNU Editor: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is saying what this blog has been saying since September. The Kremlin made the decision (probably in August when the decision to call-up reserves was made) that this war is going to last a few years.
The question that should be asked is on NATO&#x27;s commitment to send weapons and monies in the billions of dollars to Ukraine every month that may last for 2, 3 or more years.
Is the public willing to accept this commitment and sacrifice (i.e. high energy prices/inflation/shortages/etc.), and will the political still be there in 2024 or beyond? You tell me.</span>

                              <span>CNBC/Reuters: New Covid model predicts over 1 million deaths in China through 2023 
* China’s national health authority has not reported any official Covid deaths since the lifting of Covid restrictions. The last official deaths were reported on Dec. 3. Total pandemic fatalities stand at 5,235. 
* Other experts expect some 60% of China’s population will eventually be infected, with a peak expected in January, hitting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, the hardest. 
* Key concerns include China’s large pool of susceptible individuals, the use of less effective vaccines and low vaccine coverage among those 80 and older, who are at greatest risk of severe disease. 
China’s abrupt lifting of stringent Covid-19 restrictions could result in an explosion of cases and over a million deaths through 2023, according to new projections from the U.S.-based Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
According to the group’s projections, cases in China would peak around April 1, when deaths would reach 322,000. About a third of China’s population will have been infected by then, IHME Director Christopher Murray said.

Daily Mail: Biden buys 3 million barrels of oil to stock up the emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve after withdrawing 180 million to try and bring down gas prices 
* The department said it will purchase the oil for less than the $96 per barrel it sold its supply for 
* Three million barrels, only 15 percent of daily U.S. demand, is a drop in the bucket of the 180 million DOE has depleted the reserve of since March 
* At the same time the department will tap 1.8 million barrels from the reserve in an emergency exchange after a shutdown of the Keystone pipeline 
The Department of Energy (DOE) announced Friday it will purchase 3 million barrels of oil to replenish the supply it depleted from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to lower gas prices.  
The department said it will purchase the oil for less than the $96 per barrel it sold its supply for. 
Three million barrels, only 15 percent of daily U.S. demand, is a drop in the bucket of the 180 million DOE has depleted the reserve of since March.  
The deal is part of a fixed-price plan that allows refiners to sell oil to the SPR at a stable rate and avoid selling at the volatile oil market&#x27;s rate on any given day.

   Antiwar.com: Serbia Seeks Troop Deployment in Kosovo  
Belgrade formally asked NATO if its troops could return to northern Kosovo, a request unlikely to be granted  
Serbia has formally asked NATO if it can deploy up to 1,000 troops into northern Kosovo, where Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic says ethnic Serbs are being “terrorized” by the Kosovo government based in Pristina. 
Vucic made the request to the commander of NATO forces in Kosovo, known as KFOR. Serbian officials say that a UN resolution that formally ended the Kosovo war allows for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian troops into Kosovo, but Vucic still doesn’t expect the request to be granted. 
“The request says that a certain number of (Serbian troops), from one hundred to up to 1,000, return to Kosovo,” he said.

WNU Editor: The UN resolution that formally ended the Kosovo war allows for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian troops into Kosovo. But it looks like NATO is going to break this agreement and not permit this deployment.If agreements are not going to be honored, the usual outcome is conflict and in the case of the Balkans, war.
 Update: This is not going to happen .... Kosovo submits formal request to join the EU, Serbia angry (AP).</span>

No offensive is imminent, but officials worry that a large-scale attack that threatens Russia’s hold on the peninsula could push Putin to use nuclear weapons. 
A Biden administration official recently told members of Congress that Ukraine has the military capability to retake Crimea, but some officials are concerned any large-scale offensive that threatens Russia’s hold on the peninsula could push Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons, say two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. 
The late November Ukraine briefing to some members of Congress included discussion of the reasons Ukraine will continue to need U.S. weapons and equipment for the foreseeable future. The…</span>

Washington Post: No alien life discovered on Earth, Pentagon says, but search deepens 
A new office at the Pentagon is scrutinizing hundreds of reports of unidentified objects in air, sea, space and beyond, senior U.S. defense officials said Friday, and while it has discovered no signs of alien life, the search is set to expand. 
The issue has taken on increasing seriousness as a bipartisan group of lawmakers presses the Defense Department to investigate instances of unidentified phenomena and disclose publicly what they learn. Established in July, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office is evaluating recent reports and soon could evaluate accounts that date back decades, officials said. 
The Pentagon’s top intelligence official, Ronald Moultrie, told reporters during a news conference, the first to discuss the office and its ongoing work, that “At this time … we have nothing” to affirm the existence of space aliens.

                              <span>Washington Post: &#x27;Massive&#x27; wave of missiles strike Ukraine; civilian and infrastructure targets hit 
A wave of explosions and missile strikes was reported across Ukraine Friday — from the capital, Kyiv, to Kharkiv and Sumy in the northeast and Poltava in central Ukraine. 
Critical infrastructure across seven cities took another wave of hits.    Reporters with The Washington Post heard blasts in Kyiv and the central city of Dnipro. Kyiv officials said the city had experienced “one of the biggest missile attacks” since the beginning of the war. 
A Ukraine air force spokesman said that Russia had launched more than 60 missiles at the country in the latest barrage.  At least three people were killed and 13 injured when a residential building was hit in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, local officials said. 
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy operator, said emergency shutdowns were taking place in all regions of Ukraine as a result of the strikes.

USNI News: U.S. Defense Policy Bill Calls for Pentagon to Prevent Taiwan Takeover by Military Force 
The U.S. military must be able to deter China from taking over Taiwan by force, a provision in the compromise Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act stipulates.
In accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. must “maintain the ability of the United States Armed Forces to deny a fait accompli against Taiwan in order to deter the People’s Republic of China from using military force to unilaterally change the status quo with Taiwan,” according to the policy bill’s explanatory statement. 
For decades, the U.S. has maintained a “strategic ambiguity” policy toward the island. But China’s military build-up in recent years has pushed lawmakers and U.S. military officials to voice concern over China’s push to reunify Taiwan with the mainland.

Defense One:  Inside the Army’s Newest Spy Plane  
Already watching over Ukraine, Leidos’ ARTEMIS is part of the service’s growing fleet of contractor-owned intelligence aircraft. 
From a distance, the all-white business jet parked neatly in a hangar underneath a giant American flag looks a lot like the other sleek, luxurious private planes arriving and departing from this Virginia airport. But inside, this plane is far more working class. 
The cabin, full of server racks, looks more like an IT closet than an executive aircraft. The seats are cloth and two computer consoles are connected to a dozen or so antennas protruding from the plane’s belly. 
To the U.S. Army, this plane—or something like it—is a ticket to the future of warfare, built to monitor the complex communications of an adversary nation-state from standoff distance, rather than the simpler chatter of insurgents right below.

                              <span>Bloomberg: World Debt-GDP Ratio Plummets But Remains Above Pre-Covid Level 
Debt as a share of gross domestic product plunged by the most in seven decades in 2021, but policymakers still face challenges because borrowing remains above pre-Covid-19 levels, the International Monetary Fund said. 
While total public and private debt hit a record $235 trillion last year, it plummeted when expressed as a percentage of economic output, which rebounded last year after the steep Covid-19 recession of 2020, the fund said Monday in a blog accompanying the latest update of its Global Debt Database. 
Total debt fell to 247% of global gross domestic product last year, IMF data showed. That’s 10 percentage points less than in 2020, but is still the second-highest reading in history. 
The data show how many countries are still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic: debt shot up in 2020 because of the economic recession, and so did deficits as governments extended financial help to individuals and businesses. As economies opened up, inflation set in as supply couldn’t meet demand, while food and energy costs rose because of war and climate pressures.

WNU Editor: These numbers are already out of date. Interest rates are rising, and I would say that in the past 6 months individuals/businesses/and governments are taking in even more debt.

he Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) extremist group carried out a deadly gun and bomb attack on a Chinese-owned hotel in central Kabul on December 12. 
The Taliban said it killed all three attackers, and that two foreign nationals were lightly wounded.  Beijing contradicted the Taliban by saying that at least five Chinese hotel guests were injured in the assault. 
More than 30 Chinese citizens were in the hotel at the time of the attack, according to a leading Chinese businessman in Afghanistan. The Emergency Hospital in Kabul said it had received three dead bodies and 18 wounded.

Reuters: Thousands protest in Turkey over Istanbul mayor&#x27;s conviction 
ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Thousands of people rallied in Turkey on Thursday to oppose the conviction and political ban of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, chanting slogans criticising President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party before elections next year.
A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced Imamoglu, a popular rival to Erdogan, to two years and seven months in prison, which like the ban must be confirmed by an appeals court.
The verdict drew wide criticism at home and abroad as an abuse of democracy. 
Late on Thursday, media reports said the prosecutor in the case had launched a legal challenge to the verdict, seeking a longer jail sentence for Imamoglu. No further details were immediately available.

                              <span>Al Jazeera: Peru court extends ex-President Castillo’s jail time by 18 months 
Pedro Castillo’s arrest on charges of ‘rebellion’ and ‘conspiracy’ has fuelled a political crisis. 
Peru’s Supreme Court has granted a request to extend former President Pedro Castillo’s imprisonment for 18 months, as the authorities make their case against him on accusations of “rebellion” and “conspiracy”. 
The decision on Thursday is expected to further inflame political turmoil and protests that have roiled the South American nation since Castillo’s impeachment and detention last week.

                              <span>An investigation by the FRANCE 24 Observers has provoked a furious reaction from Iranians in Iran and around the world. In an article published November 25, the Observers team published photographs showing 13 shotgun cartridges bearing the logos of Cheddite, a French-Italian ammunition manufacturer, that had been recovered from protests in Iran.

They are among the thousands of protesters demanding not only Castillo&#x27;s release but also the resignation of his successor Dina Boluarte, the dissolution of Congress and new elections.

&quot;We&#x27;re tired. We&#x27;re fed up,&quot; added the nurse, who asked that her last name not be reported. &quot;We need a pay rise now to make a living.&quot;

                              <span>Prince Harry accused his brother William of a furious response to his plans to quit royal life but insisted he had few regrets about leaving in final docuseries episodes out on Thursday.
Harry, 38, and his wife Meghan, 41, have lifted the lid on their experiences in the institution in the new series, risking a further rift with his family.
As young boys, the brothers provided the enduring image from their mother Princess Diana&#x27;s funeral, walking behind her coffin.
But they are reportedly now no longer on speaking terms since Harry and Meghan -- also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- left for North America, settling in California.
In the final three episodes of &quot;Harry &amp; Meghan&quot;, Harry recalled a family summit in January 2020 over their plans to move abroad.

Satire, parody and jokes packed with absurdity typically draw laughter, but around the world they are too often mistaken as real, prompting fact-checkers to debunk what they call a leading source of misinformation despite pushback from their publishers.
Several satirical outlets mimic legitimate media websites, often sowing confusion among readers with what appear to be typical news articles but are in fact fabricated stories.
Sometimes even with disclaimers clearly marking their articles as satire, many readers take them at face value.

(Reuters) -Tesla boss Elon Musk disclosed another $3.6 billion in stock sales on Wednesday, taking his total near $40 billion this year and frustrating investors as the company&#x27;s shares wallow at two-year lows.
A U.S securities filing showed he unloaded 22 million shares in the world&#x27;s most valuable carmaker over three days from Monday to Wednesday.
The sale is the second big chunk of stock he has cashed out since his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October. It isn&#x27;t clear if the sales are related to the Twitter acquisition, but they are annoying investors who are upset by a perception he is diverting his focus and resources to Twitter ahead of Tesla.
&quot;It doesn&#x27;t put a lot of confidence in the business, or speak volumes for where his attention is at,&quot;…</span>

                              <span>This week, the FBI arrested Alexey Brayman, a resident of Merrimack, New Hampshire who was using his Etsy craft store as a front to run a weapons-smuggling ring to the Kremlin.
Speaking to CNN&#x27;s Erin Burnett on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) emphasized that this operation is a sign of how dire a toll the global sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine is taking on their ability to procure weapons for their military.
&quot;So, congressman, I do want to ask you about ... this Russian smuggling, Russian weapons smuggling ring here in the United States,&quot; said Burnett. &quot;What does this tell you about Putin? I mean, why he would even be doing this, that he&#x27;s going to such lengths to do something like this?&quot;
&quot;First, I would say that this is not unusual,&quot; said Himes. &quot;For decades — for generations — we&#x27;ve been facing Chinese, Russian, other efforts to get our equipment. Your correspondent is exactly right that this is a sign of desperation, this is stuff that could ordinarily be bought on the open market by the Russian government. But it cannot be bought by the Russian government now that, of course, sanctions and prohibitions are in place.&quot;

Additionally, said Himes, &quot;the FBI is exactly right. Obviously a guy with a trunk full of rounds, that&#x27;s a guy who can assist in the creation of an awful lot of mayhem.&quot;
&quot;But at the end of the day, there is no way in the world that you can restock, rearm, and refurbish the Russian military by guys driving cars across the border of Estonia,&quot; added Himes. &quot;So, we need to continue to take this stuff really, really seriously. But it is a sign of desperation.&quot;

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -A former Twitter Inc manager convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia by sharing user data several years ago and potentially exposing users to persecution was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison on Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors said.
Ahmad Abouammo had been found guilty by a jury in August following a trial in federal court in San Francisco.
Prosecutors had sought a prison term of just over seven years, saying they wanted a &quot;sentence strong enough to deter others in the technology and social media industry from selling out the data of vulnerable users.&quot; Abouammo faced a maximum penalty of decades in prison.
Abouammo&#x27;s attorneys had asked U.S. District Judge Edward Chen for a probationary sentence at his home in Seattle with no prison time. They cited Abou…</span>

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Many of the hundreds of migrants who crossed the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez into El Paso this week were part of a group kidnapped in Mexico as they made their way to the United States, according to nine migrants interviewed by Reuters.
Testimony from the nine migrants suggests there were multiple kidnappings across several days in the northern state of Durango, with people taken to at least two main locations and held against their will while ransoms were demanded.
The kidnappings are a stark reminder of the dangers faced by migrants as they travel across Mexico, crisscrossing areas rife with drug violence and weak rule of law.
Most of the kidnapped migrants were Nicaraguans, who have been leavi…</span>

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru&#x27;s defense minister announced a nationwide state of emergency on Wednesday, which will take effect in the next few hours and allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public safety after a week of fiery protests and road blockades.
The protests were sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo on Dec. 7 in an impeachment vote. Castillo, a leftist elected in 2021, was arrested after illegally trying to dissolve the Andean nation&#x27;s Congress, the latest in a series of political crises the world&#x27;s second-largest copper producer has faced in recent years.
Prosecutors on Wednesday said they were seeking 18 months of pretrial detention for Castillo, who has been charged with rebellion and conspiracy. Peru&#x27;s Supreme Court met to consider the re…</span>

                              <span>Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday Russian athletes should face &quot;complete isolation&quot; and not be welcomed back at the 2024 Olympic Games.
Zelensky told International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach that he strongly opposed moves by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Paris Games provided they do not participate under their countries&#x27; colors or flags.
US officials said Monday there was &quot;unanimous interest&quot; among delegates to an IOC summit to come up with a pathway that would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to competition.
Russia and Belarus have been isolated from international sport ever since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.
However, Zelensky blasted the American moves, claiming that &quot;since February, 184 Ukrainian athletes have died as a result of Russia&#x27;s actions&quot;.
Zelensky told Bach he was disappointed with the presence of the president of the Russian Olympic Committee at the IOC summit on November 9
&quot;One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored,&quot; he said in a statement.
Zelensky added that the only response is &quot;the complete isolation of the terrorist state on the international stage. In particular, this applies to international sports events.&quot;
At this year&#x27;s Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country&#x27;s Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.
However many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.

Following a campaign led by the United States, 29 members of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) voted to expel the Islamic republic from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW) for the remainder of its 2022-2026 term.
Eight countries voted against and 16 abstained. A simple majority was needed to adopt the move, which had been proposed by the United States.
The resolution says it strips Iran of its membership of the commission with immediate effect.

                              <span>Ukraine has announced that another American has been freed as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that a retired U.S. Air Force veteran Suedi Murekezi was captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine earlier this year, his family said. He has now been freed. 
&quot;Another exchange of prisoners,&quot; tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. &quot;We continue to return ours. 64 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, are going home. It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people - Murekez Suedi. The bodies of the 4 dead were also returned.&quot;
His brother said that Murekezi said in a call that he was being held in the Donetsk People’s Republic with two other American nationals. 
The Post report explained that a prisoner swap in September included two U.S. veterans. The latest swap adds up to 1,456 prisoners that have been released by Russia since the start of their invasion. 
&quot;One prisoner of war told The Post he was beaten so badly that his ribs were broken and his kidneys were badly injured,&quot; the piece said.

                              <span>Disgraced crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried is being held in a jail in the Bahamas that&#x27;s known for its poor conditions -- so poor that a warden described it as “not fit for humanity,&quot; the New York Post reports. 
Bankman-Fried is being held in Fox Hill Prison after failing to get bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. The prison is the only correctional facility in the region. As the Post points out, the prison was the focus of a report last year by the US Department of State which looked into possible human rights violations, including violence and abuse by staff.
“Inmates removed human waste by bucket,” the government report noted. 
“Some inmates developed bedsores from lying on bare ground,” the report said, adding that conditions included “overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care.”
“Sanitation was a general problem, and cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” the report noted. 
Bankman-Fried faces criminal charges in the United States, including securities fraud, campaign finance violations and money laundering, over the collapse of his FTX crypto exchange.

Castillo&#x27;s arrest last week after he tried to dissolve parliament and rule by decree has sparked days of nationwide protests in which seven people have been killed.
Last week, a judge ordered Castillo to be held for seven days, and he was meant to be released on Wednesday.
However, prosecutors filed a request late Tuesday to hold him in pre-trial detention for 18 months.
Judge Juan Checkley on Wednesday postponed a hearing on the new request until Thursday after defense attorneys argued they had not received all documents from the public prosecutor.
He also ordered Castillo to remain in detention for another 48 hours.
Castillo, a leftist former school teacher, was in power for only 17 months in the South American nation that is prone to political instability and is now on its sixth president in six years.
His short period in office was marked by a power struggle with the opposition-dominated Congress, and six investigations into him and his family, mainly for corruption.
He was facing his third impeachment bid when, last Wednesday, he announced he was dissolving Congress and would rule by decree.
But lawmakers went ahead and voted to sack him and he was quickly arrested while trying to flee to the Mexican embassy and seek asylum.
Castillo&#x27;s vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in as his successor, but has failed to calm tensions that have led to violent clashes between police and protestors in several parts of the country.

The Paris offices of US consulting giant McKinsey were also searched on Tuesday, the National Financial Prosecutors&#x27; Office said, confirming a report in Le Parisien newspaper.
The use of consultants by Macron&#x27;s governments came under the spotlight in March after a French Senate inquiry concluded that public spending on them had more than doubled from 2018 to 2021, during Macron&#x27;s first term.
&quot;It&#x27;s normal for the judiciary to investigate freely and independently to shed all the light on this subject,&quot; a Renaissance spokesman, Loic Signor, told AFP.

                              <span>A BBC commentator lashed out at the U.S., calling it an “extraordinarily racist country” ahead of it co-hosting the 2026 World Cup, HuffPost reports. 
Former soccer player-turned-commentator Gary Lineker has been covering the World Cup in Qatar and spoke to the  “News Agents” podcast and discussed why Qatar was allowed to host the World Cup. 
“We pointed facts out at the beginning of the tournament; those facts remain. So, lots of people were killed doing the stadiums. Yes, the stadiums are extraordinary, but at a great price. Homophobia is an issue here, women’s rights are a little bit of an issue here,&quot; he said. 
“For me, it was always really more about the corruption side of it because, as I said previously, I think pretty much every country, including our own, has got issues,” he continued. “And we’re off to America in four years’ time, with Canada and Mexico, but obviously America’s an extraordinarily racist country.”

The writer, a 64-year-old French-Swiss citizen now living in the western Swiss city of Lausanne, was sentenced in April by the regional attorney general to three months behind bars for &quot;defamation, discrimination and incitement to hatred.&quot;
That ruling came after Alain Soral -- a pen name for the controversial writer whose real name is Alain Bonnet -- appeared in an online video attacking Swiss journalist Cathy Macherel of the Tribune de Geneve newspaper, who had written an article about him in 2021.

But campaigners warn that more executions will inevitably follow without tougher international action, with a dozen more people already sentenced to death over the protests and a similar number charged with crimes that could see them hanged.

                              <span>Hong Kong police&#x27;s decision to ban a Tiananmen vigil last year was unlawful, a court ruled on Wednesday, as it overturned the conviction of jailed democracy activist Chow Hang-tung.
The ruling is a rare rebuke of authorities in a city where the public commemoration of Beijing&#x27;s deadly 1989 crackdown has been virtually wiped out in recent years.
Chow, a 37-year-old lawyer and one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most prominent democracy activists, led a now-disbanded group that used to organize the city&#x27;s annual candlelight vigils to mourn those killed in Tiananmen Square when China sent troops to crush democracy protests.
Police have banned the last three vigils citing the coronavirus and security fears and the courts have already jailed multiple activists who defied those bans, including Chow.
