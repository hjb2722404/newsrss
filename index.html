The Israeli ground forces have been fighting inside the Gaza Strip and carrying out air strikes on the Hamas-controlled territory. The intensifying military operations have increased concerns for the 2.4 million inhabitants of Gaza, where over 8,300 people have been killed.</span>

Video footage shows an Israeli tank blocking the main highway and opening fire on a car, killing three people. Israel has been vague about its operations in Gaza but recent movements suggest a focus on the main city. The death toll among Palestinians has passed 8,300, with over 1.4 million people in Gaza fleeing their homes. Hospitals in northern Gaza are under threat, with strikes hitting near several medical facilities.</span>

                              <span>China&#x27;s military has accused a Philippine vessel of entering waters near Scarborough Shoal without authorization. The Chinese military has called on the Philippines to cease their actions and avoid further escalation. Tensions between China and the Philippines have been increasing, with multiple incidents occurring in the disputed South China Sea waters. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, which has fueled maritime tensions and territorial disputes in the region.</span>

                              <span>Lebanon&#x27;s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, is working to prevent his country from being dragged into the Hamas-Israel war. He expressed concerns about an escalation and the possibility of Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, opening a new front with Israel. Mikati, who is on good terms with Hezbollah, stated that he cannot reassure the Lebanese people as the situation is still developing. He also warned of the potential for chaos engulfing the entire Middle East.</span>

                              <span>With a significant number of Canadian mortgages set to renew in the next three years, homeowners may face a substantial increase in monthly payments unless interest rates decline. RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic predicts payment shocks of up to 48% in 2026, particularly for those with negatively amortizing loans. The report suggests that the Bank of Canada&#x27;s overnight rate would need to decline significantly to mitigate the payment shock for borrowers.</span>

The Russian authorities were not supporting the event. The attack occurred after a Hamas delegation visited Moscow. The rioters overran the airport, searching for Israeli passengers, and made threats against Jews. The incident is expected to strain diplomatic relations between Russia and Israel. The airport will remain closed until November 6.</span>

Climate-related aid accounted for 39% of all aid pledged to the region in 2021, but the Lowy report noted that climate financing remains insufficient.

                              <span>A former British intelligence worker, Joshua Bowles, has been sentenced to 13 years in jail for attempting to murder a US National Security Agency (NSA) employee. Bowles, who had previously worked at the British intelligence agency GCHQ, stabbed the woman outside a leisure centre in Cheltenham in March. He stated that he targeted her due to her employment at the NSA, believing that American intelligence was the largest contributor in the intelligence community.</span>

                              <span>BBC: Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into north 
Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. 
One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City. 
A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it. 
Later, Israel&#x27;s military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be &quot;doing well&quot;, as an &quot;exciting achievement&quot; that expressed Israel&#x27;s commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages.

Times of Israel: Far from Gaza hardships, Hamas chief and family enjoy easy life in Qatar

 
Thanks to Doha’s sponsorship and the wealth he accumulated as Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh and his children today live a life of wealth and privileges denied to other Gazans 
Shortly after the start of Hamas’s brutal attack against Israel on October 7, a video began circulating of the terror group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh in his elegant office in the Qatari capital Doha, watching the bloody onslaught unfold on Al Jazeera and “prostrating in gratitude” with a group of other Hamas officials for the killing of over 1,300 Israelis, among them at least 1,000 civilians.
For years, Haniyeh has been rebuked by many Palestinians for leading a comfortable life away from the hardships of Gaza in the oil-rich Gulf monarchy, which offers shelter to the terror group’s leaders and an internationally recognized platform to spread its propaganda through Al Jazeera.

The Federalist: No Mitch McConnell, Ukraine Aid Is Not ‘Rebuilding Our Industrial Base’ 
Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to reassure Ukrainian aid skeptics that billions in foreign assistance is being spent on American manufacturers to build weapons at home. 
“If you look at the Ukraine assistance,” McConnell said on CBS, “a significant portion of what’s being spent in the United States and 38 different states, replacing the weapons that we send to Ukraine with more modern weapons, so we’re rebuilding our industrial base.” 
But a closer examination of the aid for Ukraine reveals an overwhelming majority of taxpayer dollars are going overseas. Just a fraction of the $113 billion spent has gone to “rebuilding our industrial base.”

Russia’s Air Force is getting wrecked in the Ukraine War. China’s Air Force is mainly copies of the same Russian planes that are getting wrecked in the Ukraine. 
The US military has no interest in telling everyone how pathetic the Russian and Chinese Air Force is. Why? The US military wants to justify getting more planes and more equipment. The collapse of the Soviet Union and now the failure of the Russian military in the Ukraine has exposed the planes and pilots of potential American opponents as garbage.

Responsible Statecraft:  Tracking the US military build-up today in the Middle East 
An up-to-date accounting of the Pentagon’s response to the Israel-Gaza conflict so far. 
The U.S. has significantly increased its military presence in the Middle East in the nearly three weeks after Hamas launched attacks against Israel and took hundreds of hostages on Oct. 7. Among other things, the Pentagon has deployed two aircraft carrier strike groups as well as a range of fighter aircraft to the region. 
The official reason for the new deployments is to deter Hamas’s allies, including Iran and Hezbollah, from launching attacks against Israel and sparking a wider regional war. That logic will be put to the test in the coming days if Israel follows through on its planned ground invasion of Gaza, which is sure to face sharp condemnation from throughout the Middle East.

The Telegraph: EU delivers only a third of one million artillery shells promised to Ukraine 
The European Union has delivered only a third of the one million artillery shells it had promised to Ukraine, as the bloc’s plan to ramp up munition production falls behind schedule. 
Brussels has supplied Kyiv with about 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition since signing off on the scheme to bolster its dwindling stocks earlier this year, Bloomberg reported.

Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who has held up military promotions for nine months, slammed a proposal being floated to change the chamber’s rules to allow a vote on many of the nominations en masse and attacked the White House and Senate Democrats for not negotiating with him. 
“It’s typical of this place. This administration would rather burn the Senate down and that’s what would happen. … If you change the rules of the Senate then it lasts forever,” Tuberville told CNN’s Manu Raju. “So they would rather burn down the Senate than negotiate.”

The Aviationist: Boeing Flies Third F-15EX Eagle II, The First Built In Final Operational Configuration

 
The F-15EX, designated EX3, is expected to be delivered soon, ahead of the decision for the full rate production. 
After more than two years after the type’s first flight, Boeing flew for the first time the third F-15EX Eagle II, which is also the first to be built in the final operational configuration. 
The aircraft flew only with its primer paint and a small serial number (20-0003) on its twin tails, and will receive its final colors and insignias before the delivery to the U.S. Air Force.

RT:  Multiple US bases attacked with missiles and drones – media

 
Militias in Iraq and Syria have defied American warnings and vowed to keep up the strikes 
 Iran-backed militias have attacked four US bases in Iraq and Syria in a 24-hour period, Al-Mayadeen news reported on Sunday. The attacks came after US forces launched airstrikes against Iranian targets in both countries. 
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced on Sunday that it had targeted the al-Shaddadi base in eastern Syria on Saturday with two drones, and launched rockets at another American base in the al-Omar oil field near Deir ez-Zor, Lebanon-based news channel Al-Mayadeen reported.

 The Center Square:  Illegal border crossers total over 10 million since Biden inauguration

 
Total is greater than the individual populations of 41 states  
More than 10 million people have been reported illegally entering the United States since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the greatest number in history and of any administration. 
They total more than the individual populations of 41 states. 
The number of people illegally entering the country surged after Biden and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas halted many preexisting border security policies, advanced sweeping parole and other policies to release the greatest number of illegal foreign nationals into the country, encouraged people from all over the world to use a phone app to enter the U.S., and facilitated U.S. entry application processes in foreign countries, among others.

Israel has urged Russia to protect &quot;all its citizens and all Jews&quot; after a large mob stormed a Dagestan airport, some shouting antisemitic slogans. 
Video footage apparently from the scene shows an angry crowd running in the airport in Makhachkala, reportedly seeking people arriving from Tel Aviv. 
Some of the crowd ran onto the runway and surrounded aircraft there. 
Russia&#x27;s aviation agency said the situation was under control after authorities had arrived on the scene.

Thousands of people storm food warehouses in Gaza to take flour and basic needs in a mark of growing desperation. 
The United Nations relief agency says thousands of Palestinians, desperate due to three weeks of total siege and bombing, broke into several of its warehouses in the Gaza Strip, taking wheat, flour and other basic goods. 
“This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege,” said Thomas White, director of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza.

In the heart of Istanbul, within a sea of pro-Palestine demonstrators, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey leveled an accusation of war crimes against Israel, promising to take its case before the world. This startling declaration came amid the escalating conflict in Gaza, as the death toll of Palestinian citizens continues to rise.

 
Israel: A War Criminal? 
President Erdogan’s bold accusation came during a pro-Palestine rally in Istanbul, where he criticized Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip. He blamed Western nations for the escalating death toll, alleging their inaction enabled Israel’s incessant attacks. The Turkish president called for a just peace and accused Israel and its allies of fostering a crusade-like atmosphere, further escalating tensions in the region.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk offered the use of his Starlink satellite internet service on Saturday for humanitarian aid organizations in Gaza, as the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continues. 
The Gaza Strip, which is controlled Hamas, has been without internet and telephone communication amid escalating airstrikes and a ground campaign by the Israeli military. This has left civilians unable to call for help and aid organizations unable to communicate.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Wednesday — after being warmly welcomed by other senior leaders. 
Newsom is on a weeklong tour of China, where he will push for climate cooperation. His visit, once customary, is drawing attention after years of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, The Associated Press reported. 
“I’m here in expectation, as you suggest, of turning the page, of renewing our friendship and reengaging [on] foundational and fundamental issues that will determine our collective faith in the future,” Newsom said Wednesday.

Moscow Times/AFP: Hamas Working to Free 8 Russian-Israeli Hostages – Reports 
Hamas is trying to locate eight Russian-Israeli dual citizens among nearly 230 taken hostage during its attack on Israel after Moscow&#x27;s request to free them, Russian news agencies reported Saturday. 
Russia has good relations with the Palestinian militant group, which it does not consider a terror group, and has launched a diplomatic effort to try to free hostages held in Gaza.

Israel has said it believes 229 people were taken hostage by Hamas during its massive attack on Israel on Oct. 7. 
&quot;From the Russian side, via the Foreign Ministry, we received a list of citizens that have dual citizenship,&quot; senior Hamas representative Moussa Abu Marzook said, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.

&quot;We are looking for those people... It is hard but we are looking. And when we find them, we will let them go.&quot;

                              <span>France 24: Kosovo, Serbia leaders break off talks despite EU pressure for breakthrough

 
EU leaders on Thursday failed to convince Kosovo and Serbia to make a breakthrough in the protracted push to normalise ties between the two Balkan neighbours. 
Kosovan Prime Minister Albin Kurti and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic held separate talks with top EU officials and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy in Brussels.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a proposal was put on the table to overcome a key stumbling block on establishing an association of municipalities of Serbian majority in the north of Kosovo. 
&quot;Unhappily, the parties were not ready to agree on that, without preconditions that were unacceptable to the other party,&quot; Borrell said. &quot;We will continue insisting and working in order to get an agreement,&quot; he added. 
The two Balkan leaders blamed each other for the failure of the talks.

One of the warehouses, located in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, is where UNRWA stores supplies delivered by humanitarian convoys crossing into Gaza from Egypt.

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?


	Tapper said Greene&#x27;s censure resolution read like she &quot;learned about the Arab-Israeli conflict maybe ten minutes before.&quot;


	&quot;This is not an insurrection,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Antisemitism is not a cudgel to be used against people for political points. Nor is Islamophobia or racism or anti-gay behavior or misogyny or any other kind of bigotry.&quot;

While Vance agreed that there are &quot;a lot of innocent people in Gaza,&quot; he insisted that terrorists would intercept the aid packages.
&quot;So if you deliver a large amount of humanitarian assistance, who&#x27;s it going to go to?&quot; he asked. &quot;The children in Gaza or to the Hamas fighters on the front line? I fear it&#x27;s going to go to Hamas.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

Brennan pointed out that international organizations like the Red Cross were distributing the aid.
&quot;But I think there&#x27;s still a lot of evidence with a lot of these international organizations that when we send aid into Gaza, a lot of it goes into the wrong hands,&quot; Vance said. &quot;We don&#x27;t want to basically fund two sides of the exact same conflict. Fund Hamas, fund Israel.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#x27;s not aid to Hamas,&quot; Brennan observed. &quot;It&#x27;s aid to the Palestinian people.&quot;
&quot;And if I could wave a magic wand and give aid to the Palestinian children, I will,&quot; Vance quipped.

                              <span>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says US President Joe Biden welcomed the fact that he is going to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping. 

Mr Albanese’s remarks come after the Prime Minister wrapped up a state visit to the United States, strengthening ties and pushing for key AUKUS legislation to be passed this year. 

A major theme of the visit was policy in the Indo-Pacific, particularly towards China, and US President Joe Biden had some pointed criticism for the People’s Republic ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to China in November.  

“Australia and China have different political systems, of course, and different values,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell. 

“One of the reasons why the relationship with the United States is so close is because we do have that common commitment to human rights, to democracy, and to our values. 

“It’s important that Australia stabilise the relationship – that’s something that the US is seeking as well.”</span>

                              <span>The month-long Vatican meeting on the future of the Roman Catholic Church ended without clear positions on issues such as women deacons and LGBT inclusion. The meeting, called a Synod of Bishops, allowed women and lay people to vote on Church affairs for the first time. However, the final report did not take a stand on LGBT issues despite discussions beforehand. The report mentioned the need to hear and accompany marginalized individuals but did not call for greater inclusion. LGBT advocates expressed disappointment with the report. The pope will close the gathering with a Mass on Sunday.</span>

                              <span>The extensive tunnel network built by the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip poses a significant threat to Israeli troops and the Palestinian population. Clearing and collapsing these tunnels is crucial for dismantling Hamas, but it is a challenging task that strips the Israeli military of its technological advantages. The tunnels provide Hamas with hiding places and the ability to choose the time and location of engagement. Israeli airstrikes have targeted these tunnels, but combating underground warfare is difficult due to the abundance of ambush opportunities.</span>

The high number of casualties has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues, making it difficult to perform traditional funeral rituals. Many bodies are unrecognizable due to decomposition or the absence of surviving family members. In an attempt to increase the chances of identification, families are resorting to wearing identification bracelets and writing names on their children&#x27;s bodies.</span>

                              <span>A mariner who went missing off the Washington coast has been found alive in a life raft, but his companion is still missing. The two mariners set off on October 12 from Westport, Washington, but failed to return as scheduled. The Coast Guard conducted a search operation but suspended it due to a lack of leads. A Good Samaritan vessel discovered the life raft with one of the mariners inside, who managed to survive by catching and consuming a salmon.</span>

The number of missing has also increased to 10. The recovery effort has been slow, with aid taking several days to arrive.

                              <span>Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Eli Cohen, has ordered the return of diplomatic representatives from Turkey to reassess the country&#x27;s relations with Turkey. This decision comes after Turkish leaders condemned Israel&#x27;s military campaign against Hamas. Israeli ambassadors stationed in Turkey have been instructed to return to Israel. Turkey&#x27;s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, referred to Hamas as &#x27;mujahideen&#x27; defending their lands and cancelled his visit to Israel. Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, accused Israel of committing &quot;a crime against humanity&quot; in its war in Gaza.</span>

The parade was led by a Ugandan man who had fled his country after being arrested for being gay. The march aimed to raise awareness for LGBT rights in Africa, particularly in Uganda, where the death penalty for homosexuality was introduced in May. South Africa, in contrast, legalized same-sex marriage in 2006 and is the only African country to have done so.</span>

                              <span>College campuses in the United States are experiencing a surge in activism surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict. This activism is characterized by dueling protests and debates, with both pro-Palestinian and Jewish students facing harassment and online attacks. The divisive nature of the conflict, combined with the influence of social media, has led to a lack of consensus among students. This activism has also had broader implications, with some colleges facing accusations of antisemitism and losing donor support.</span>

Thousands of migrants have been camping in the area, attempting to cross into EU member nation Hungary with the help of people smugglers. Police actions are aimed at curbing irregular migration and increasing security in the region. Several have been detained, including individuals suspected of smuggling migrants.</span>

Guterres stated that instead of a pause, there has been an unprecedented escalation that undermines humanitarian objectives. The escalation follows Israel&#x27;s reprisal for an attack by Hamas, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza&#x27;s 2.3 million people. The communication blackout in Gaza is impeding aid efforts, including ambulances and evacuations.</span>

                              <span>Forbes: Russian Planes Reportedly Dropped Mines Along Ukraine’s Safe Corridor For Grain Ships 
Russian planes reportedly have mined the maritime corridor that Ukraine established in the western Black Sea in order to safeguard the export of grain to Europe and Africa. 
It seems to be the first time in Russia’s 21-month wider war that the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s aircraft have deployed sea mines.

Ukraine’s southern command reported the ominous development on Wednesday. 
“The enemy ... dropped four unidentified means of impact, probably bottom mines, in the Black Sea ... in the direction of navigation corridors of civil shipping,” the command stated.

Military Times/AP: No, the US military isn’t ‘laying the groundwork’ for a draft

 
Claim: The U.S. military is planning to reinstitute the draft.

 
AP’s Assessment: False. Defense officials confirm the armed forces have made no such recommendation to Congress or the president, which are the entities empowered to authorize a draft.

 
The Facts: With America’s allies in Europe and the Middle East embroiled in conflicts with no end in sight, social media posts are claiming the U.S. military is considering mandating regular citizens to enlist in the armed forces. 
A number of those are sharing a headline from a Sept. 25 article from the Mises Institute, a libertarian group in Alabama that reads: “The US Military Is Laying the Groundwork to Reinstitute the Draft.”

WNU Editor: &quot;U.S. military draft&quot;  has been trending on search engines for the past few weeks. Videos like the one above and rumors on social media are probably fueling it .... Video of Biden calling for a military draft is AI-generated, not real | Fact check (USA Today). More here .... Fighting &#x27;Joe Biden&#x27;s wars&#x27;: False rumor of &#x27;draft&#x27; spreads across social media as &#x27;medicated&#x27; Gen Z slammed for not signing up (Meaww), and here .... Fact Check: Video of Joe Biden calling for a military draft was created with AI (Reuters).
Just one more note. 
On the eve of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine the Kyiv government was telling everyone to not worry, and to stay home. Within 24 hours of Russia&#x27;s invasion, the Ukraine government immediately closed its border to men of military age who can be drafted. The U.S. government will do the same. Telling everyone that everything is fine, until the very moment that the &quot;shit hits the fan&quot;.</span>

The Air Force is hopeful that the B-21 Raider stealth bomber will take to the skies for the first time before the end of the year. 
The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s first pre-production B-21 Raider stealth bomber is now undergoing taxi testing, moving around the sprawling Plant 42 in Palmdale under its own power. This is the latest developmental milestone for the aircraft as it continues to move closer to its first flight, which could come before the end of the year. 
&quot;I can confirm the B-21 is conducting ground taxi activities. Rigorous testing is a critical step in the B-21 flight test program,&quot; an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to The War Zone today. &quot;Extensive testing evaluates systems, components, and functionalities. This testing allows us to mitigate risks, optimize design, and enhance operational effectiveness.&quot;

Reuters: US halts exports of most civilian firearms for 90 days 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. has stopped issuing export licenses for most civilian firearms and ammunition for 90 days for all non-governmental users, the Commerce Department said on Friday, citing national security and foreign policy interests. 
The Commerce Department did not provide further details for the pause, which also includes shotguns and optical sights, but said an urgent review will assess the &quot;risk of firearms being diverted to entities or activities that promote regional instability, violate human rights, or fuel criminal activities.&quot;

WNU editor: This is unprecedented. The only exceptions to this export ban are Israel and Ukraine. 
So why the ban and this hoarding of weapons and ammo? 
My gut tells me that with US military stockpiles now at an all time low and supply chain disruptions are  growing. In this environment the US has made the decision that with international relations deteriorating and threats of a major war growing everyday, the US needs to replenish some of their stockpiles ASAP.</span>

He said he sincerely hoped his message would reach staff. Lazzarini described the communications blackout as &quot;yet another action taken to try to impede the humanitarian response to the civilians of the Gaza Strip.&quot;</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
