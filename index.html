                              <span>Sky News Brisbane Bureau Chief Adam Walters says the United States has “stolen the show” at the Pacific Island Forum despite Foreign Minister Penny Wong “insisting” climate change would be the dominant issue. 

Mr Walters said Ms Wong welcomed the “dramatic escalation” of the US attention to the region. 

“Everyone knows we are a US ally, and we work with them and with other partners for the sort of region we all want,” Ms Wong said.</span>

“They’re expecting it to remain at 40-year highs, so inflation is going to be coming in for the 12 months to June roughly around that 8.8 per cent,” he said.</span>

                              <span>The United States has vowed to increase its presence in the Indo-Pacific as regional leaders meet in Fiji for the first face-to-face Pacific Island forum since 2019. 

US Vice President Kamala Harris will make a series of announcements when she appears virtually on Wednesday, a move welcomed by Australia. 

“We saw over the previous administration a bit of a withdrawal from international affairs,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio. 

“It is a good thing that the United States is more engaged, and it’s a good thing that we are cooperating.”</span>

Voters anxious over high prices as Democrats face rough midterm campaign  White House officials launched a defensive strike Tuesday against what they expect will be a dour report marking another month of soaring inflation. 
 One day before the release of the consumer price index for June, President Joe Biden’s top economic advisers issued a memo designed to temper the likely public reaction to a new round of recorded price spikes. 
The CPI data coming Wednesday “will largely not reflect the substantial declines in gas prices we’ve seen since the middle of June,” wrote National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Cecilia Rouse, chair of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a five-page memo designed to provide “context” for the upcoming report.

The UnHeard: The German economy is on the brink  
Putin can&#x27;t be blamed for the country&#x27;s economic malaise 
The economist Herbert Stein once wrote that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. 
This became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.

WNU Editor: Germany&#x27;s economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.</span>

                              <span>Sri Lanka&#x27;s embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa flew out of the country early Wednesday.  
Daily Mail: Sri Lanka&#x27;s embattled president FLEES his country after months of widespread protests over the island nation&#x27;s worst-ever economic crisis 
* Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday 
* He, his wife and a bodyguard were among four passengers on board an Antonov-32 military aircraft which took off for the Maldives, immigration sources say 
* &#x27;Their passports were stamped and they boarded the special air force flight,&#x27; an immigration official involved in the process said 
Sri Lanka&#x27;s embattled president flew out of his country early Wednesday, in a probable prelude to his resignation after months of widespread protests over the island nation&#x27;s worst-ever economic crisis. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday and clear the way for a &#x27;peaceful transition of power&#x27;, after fleeing his official residence in Colombo just before tens of thousands of protesters overran it. 
As president, Rajapaksa enjoys immunity from arrest, and he is believed to have wanted to go abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of being detained.

                              <span>Ukrainian police officers serve conscription papers on a man they found relaxing on a beach in Odesa   
Daily Mail: Conscripts are being given call-up papers on the beaches of Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s army suffers heavy losses 
Like many of his male friends, Serhiy no longer leaves his home in western Ukraine for fear of being sent to the front line to replace soldiers killed or injured in the fight against Russia. 
The construction worker spends his days hiding from military officials serving call-up papers at bars, beaches, checkpoints, malls and even church services. 
As casualties mount on both sides, there was anger last week after Ukraine’s military revealed plans to bring in permits prohibiting men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered under martial law.

Update: Ukraine’s military plans to limit free movement to make conscription easier (The Guardian)   
WNU Editor: Everyone in Ukraine knows that if conscripted, it will only be a manner of time before you are sent to the front-lines and the meat-grinder that awaits all those who go there. I personally know a few Russian-Ukrainians AND Ukrainians who are refusing to join, and are looking for a way out of the country. But it is almost impossible as a military age male to escape Ukraine right now. Ukraine is under marshal law, and it is being enforced with rigor. 
On a personal note. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 the first mission my father had was to forcibly conscript Ukrainians into the Soviet Army. He hated it because many men that he had to conscript were also his friends and classmates. When the war was over my father learned that every male he knew who was forcibly conscripted got killed in the war. It is something that my father never forgot.

Sighhhh ... and now history is repeating itself.</span>

    Reuters: Ukraine Receives $1.7 Billion in New Financial Assistance - PM 
KYIV (Reuters) - Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States on Tuesday for its &quot;incredible support&quot; after Ukraine received a further $1.7-billion in international financial assistance. 
Shmyhal confirmed receipt of a grant which he said on Saturday would come from a Single-Donor Trust Fund created by the World Bank&#x27;s International Bank for Reconstruction, the International Development Association and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
&quot;Grateful to U.S. &amp; @POTUS (U.S. President Joe Biden) for incredible support,&quot; he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.

Mushahid Hussain, National Interest: U.S. China Policy Is Heading Towards Disaster 
Five fundamentals are pointers to the United States embarking on an unwinnable Sisyphean quest that will end up hurting its interests more than stopping China’s rise in its tracks. 
Less than a year after the longest, disastrous war in U.S. history ended on a messy military exit from Afghanistan, the Biden administration is apparently embarked on the fast track of fashioning a major new foreign policy design to combat the challenge from China. 
There are signposts to a new Cold War but, interestingly, the United States is resorting to containment of China from a rather outmoded playbook, namely, the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Since anti-Communism still sells, this playbook, too, begins with the demonization of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as its nostalgic throwback to the Communist Party of Soviet Union (CPSU), which presided over the liquidation of the Soviet Union.

   WNU Editor: While preparing my post for &quot;Tweets Of the Day&quot; I came across the above tweet.
It struck home. 
Since the start of the war I have been helping Ukrainian refugees who have lost everything and have hit rocked bottom. 
It has been rough. 
But it has also become a spiritual journey for me, and I have learned the following. 
When we help those who are in need we are also helping ourselves. A priceless reward that I never expected.</span>

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Is Saudi Oil Production At Capacity? 
Use it or lose it – this principle might apply to Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity that is now eyed by the Western world to fill the Russia-sized gap in supply left behind by embargoes. 
However, as Statista&#x27;s Katharina Buchholz details below, Saudi Arabia in the past three years only approached its declared maximum production capacity of 12 million barrels per day in one month, casting doubts on the kingdom’s ability to quickly up its production to stabilize world markets. According to Bloomberg, such predictions have come from UAE leadership, who together with the Saudis are the only OPEC members who have spare production capacity – at least on paper.

Reason: Biden Told Congress U.S. Troops Are Fighting in the Middle East. Now He Says They Aren&#x27;t.  
He claims he&#x27;ll be &quot;the first president to visit the Middle East since 9/11 without U.S. troops engaged in a combat mission there.&quot; But that&#x27;s not true. 
President Joe Biden will travel to the Middle East on Wednesday in an attempt to strengthen ties with some countries and address threats posed by others. Key stops include Israel and Saudi Arabia—neither of which is without controversy. 
Biden took to the pages of The Washington Post to justify the trip in advance and outline what he sees as his administration&#x27;s wins in the Middle East, which he called &quot;more stable and secure than the one [his] administration inherited 18 months ago.&quot; One of his successes, Biden wrote, has been keeping American soldiers out of conflicts: &quot;Next week, I will be the first president to visit the Middle East since 9/11 without U.S. troops engaged in a combat mission there,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s my aim to keep it that way.&quot;

Training sessions are expected to begin as early as this month, he said. 
The Iranian government is preparing to send “several hundred” drones, including some equipped with weapons, to Russia at some point in July, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday. 
Sullivan made the announcement during an afternoon briefing at the White House, where he said he was confident that with support from the West, Ukraine’s capital Kyiv will remain under Ukrainian control.

                              <span>CNN: The euro and the US dollar are at parity for the first time in 20 years 
New York (CNN Business)For the first time in 20 years, the exchange rate between the euro (EUU) and the US dollar has reached parity -- meaning the two currencies are worth the same. 
The euro hit $1 on Tuesday, down about 12% since the start of the year. Fears of recession on the continent abound, stoked by high inflation and energy supply uncertainty caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 
The European Union, which received roughly 40% of its gas through Russian pipelines before the war, is attempting to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas. At the same, Russia has throttled back gas supplies to some EU countries and recently cut the flow in the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany by 60%.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Majority Of Europeans Unwilling To &#x27;Pay The Price&#x27; To Defend &#x27;Democracy&#x27; In Ukraine 
When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, it didn’t take long for the international community to condemn the attack and react accordingly. Within a few days, Western powers imposed strict sanctions on Russia, hoping to cripple the country’s ailing economy and force Putin to retreat. More than four months and tens of thousands of casualties later, hopes of a quick resolution of the conflict have vanished, as a drawn-out war of attrition looks increasingly likely. 
However, as Statista&#x27;s Felix Richter details below, while the sanctions against Russia have thus far failed to deplete Putin’s war chest, their impact is being felt around the world. The embargo of Russian fossil fuels has resulted in sky-high energy prices, while food prices have also surged as a result of the sanctions and Russia’s blockage of Ukrainian grain exports. As both Ukraine and Russia are among the world’s biggest exporters of wheat and other grains, the conflict is threatening food security across the globe, especially in poorer regions that rely on imports from both countries.

* Senior Saudi officials pressed their U.S. counterparts to scrap a policy of selling only defensive arms to its top Gulf partner in several meetings in Riyadh and Washington in recent months, three of the sources said ahead of President Joe Biden’s visit to the kingdom this week.

                              <span>TOKYO, Jul 11 (IPS)  - Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister of Japan, has died. It was a murder caused by a personal grudge rather than political terrorism. And it was not a direct grudge against Mr. Abe. A religious group had supported Mr. Abe, and a murderer with a grudge against the religious group killed him. Murders targeting politicians are often related to political messages or claims. This is a very unique case in that the murder was committed out of a personal grudge, not against the individual for what he did, but against the organization that supported the individual.

                              <span>bitcoin (BTC) could see a massive price rally in the coming months, based on an indicator that marked bear market lows in 2015 and 2018.
What is the Bitcoin Pi Cycle Lower Indicator? 
Nicknamed “Bottom of Pi cycle“, the indicator includes a 471-day simple moving average (SMA) and a 150-period exponential moving average (EMA). In addition, the 471-day SMA is multiplied by 0.745; the result is opposite to predicting the bottom of the underlying market.
Notably, each time the 150-period EMA fell below the 471-period SMA, it signaled the end of a Bitcoin bear market. 
For example, in 2015, the crossover coincided with Bitcoin hits nearly $160 in January 2015, followed by an almost 12,000% bull run towards $20,000 in December 2017.

Officially, the Russian army has suspended its efforts to seize Ukrainian territory.  But in recent days he has intensified its anarchic attacks against civilian areas, with strikes from warplanes, artillery and missiles.  Ukrainian residents and soldiers were terrified, maimed and killed by the strikes.
Ukrainian officials said yesterday that in the past 24 hours Russian strikes have killed at least eight civilians.  In eastern Donetsk province, at least 10 towns and villages have been hit and two people killed, bringing the civilian death toll in the province to nearly 600 since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.

His opening victory this summer European Women’s Football Championship had been satisfying enough, a solid but unspectacular first step towards a major prize he never won.  But with the Lionesses scoring just one goal, England’s main rivals for the title were filling the net and raising the stakes.
Norway scored four goals in their first match.  Spain and Germany soon followed suit.  After France drew five against Italy on Sunday, maybe, just maybe, the tournament host country felt he had to show that he could.


England therefore scored eight.

Charlie Kirkthe potato sack who runs Turning Point USA, falsely asserted that the nation’s founders wanted religion and government to be “mixed.”
Speaking on his show on the Right Side Broadcasting Network on Wednesday, the sensitive potato bag claimed that “there is no separation of church and state.”
He called the partitioning of the two a “fiction” and a “fabrication” invented by humanists.
“It is derived from a single letter which Thomas Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Baptist Convention,” he said, referring to correspondence in which Jefferson – a founder – approved the idea of ​​a “separation wall” between religion and government.
“Of course, we should mix church and state,” the Tuber Talking Collection continued.  “Our founding fathers believed in it.  We can go over the detai…</span>

                              <span>The United Kingdom will likely have a new prime minister by September 5 after the timetable for the Tory party&#x27;s leadership contest was announced.  

The 11 contenders vying to replace Boris Johnson will require the backing of at least 20 MPs - and win 30 votes from colleagues - to enter the race.
  
Nominations will open and close on Wednesday - with backbenchers hoping to shorten the list to two candidates as quickly as possible. 

Mr Johnson has refused to say who he will be backing for the top job position.</span>

                              <span>Shinzo Abe’s former associate John Lee says the former prime minister “changed Japan” in an “enduring” way. 

There was a private wake last night for Mr Abe at the Zojo-Ji Temple in Tokyo – with private and public funerals to be held this week. 

“It’s a recognition that the Japan we know today is largely a reflection of Shinzo Abe, and the legacy now is to honour that,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

“It&#x27;s one I witnessed firsthand just over a week ago on what some have called my holiday to Kyiv,” he said. 

Mr Albanese said it was a “very confronting experience” to witness the damage Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.

He added having a look first-hand at the challenge Russia’s aggression represents does “threaten the peace and stability in which the post-World War II era has been based upon”.</span>

A stunning 94 per cent of Democrats under the age of 30 said they would prefer if Mr Biden did not run for president again. 

Most of the respondents in The New York Times cited President Biden&#x27;s age as a major factor why they do not want him to run again.</span>

Ukraine has touted plans to amass a &quot;million-strong army&quot; equipped with Nato weapons to fight Russian forces. 
However, the comments by Defence minister Oleksii Reznikov are being seen as more of a rallying cry than a concrete plan for a counter offensive. 
They come as Russia makes gains in the eastern Donbas region, and continues to pound areas across Ukraine. 
Mr Reznikov also said that retaking the country&#x27;s southern Black Sea coast was vital to the country&#x27;s economy.

RT: Russia offers fast-track citizenship to all Ukrainians 
All Ukrainians, as as well as citizens of the two Donbass republics, may now apply using a simplified procedure 
Any Ukrainian national may now apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified scheme, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Monday. 
The measure also applies to stateless persons permanently living in Ukraine as well as to citizens of the two Donbass republics, recognized earlier by Russia as independent. 
Ukrainians may now file the relevant request without the need to live in Russia for five years, to have a source of income or to pass a Russian-language test – something foreigners are normally required to do before they can apply for Russian citizenship.

WNU Editor: Kyiv has responded .... Ukraine Condemns Russian Decree Allowing Ukrainians Expedited Citizenship (RFE). 
There is a Russian law that permits the children of former Soviet Union citizens to apply to become a Russian citizen even though they were born in another country. But this new decree apparently makes the entire process simpler and more quicker to apply for.

* Craig Reedie said ban after Ukraine invasion will be maintained   Russia is facing a ban from the Paris Olympics as a consequence of the invasion of Ukraine, Sir Craig Reedie has warned. 
Reedie, an influential International Olympic Committee figure for nearly 30 years, believes there is little chance of Russia and Belarus being allowed back soon into international sport. 

Reedie says most Russian and Belarusian athletes and teams now face a second problem – being unable to compete in those events where qualifying places are on offer for the 2024 Games.

Air Force Magazine: Cost of B-52 Re-Engining Jumps By Half in New Estimate of Refit 
The cost of the B-52 re-engining program has increased 50 percent because of integration issues, according to revelations in a House Armed Services panel hearing. 
Air Force acquisition executive Andrew P. Hunter acknowledged the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP) price hike as voiced in a question from Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) in testimony on service modernization. 
“We currently believe there is cost growth from our design work that we did originally through the middle-tier acquisition program to what we anticipate we’ll be looking at [in] Milestone B,” which evaluates readiness for entry into the engineering and manufacturing development phase, Hunter said.

 CNBC: India set to overtake China as the world’s most populous country in 2023, UN says 
 * “India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country during 2023,” the U.N. says. 
* According to the U.N., its latest projections show that the global population could reach roughly 8.5 billion in 2030 and 10.4 billion in 2100. 
* In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres talks of a “shared responsibility to care for our planet.” 
India is on track to overtake China as the planet’s most populous country next year, according to a U.N. report published on Monday. 
The report, from the population division of the U.N.’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said China and India were each home to over 1.4 billion people in 2022. 
“India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country during 2023,” the U.N. said. 
The Indian government’s census for 2011 put the country’s population at more than 1.2 billion.

                              <span>CNN: China crushes mass protest by bank depositors demanding their life savings back 
Hong Kong CNN  — Chinese authorities on Sunday violently dispersed a peaceful protest by hundreds of depositors, who sought in vain to demand their life savings back from banks that have run into a deepening cash crisis. 
Since April, four rural banks in China’s central Henan province have frozen millions of dollars worth of deposits, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of customers in an economy already battered by draconian Covid lockdowns. 
Anguished depositors have staged several demonstrations in the city of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of Henan, over the past two months, but their demands have invariably fallen on deaf ears. 
On Sunday, more than 1,000 depositors from across China gathered outside the Zhengzhou branch of the country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, to launch their largest protest yet, more than half a dozen protesters told CNN.

Over the past month or so, mainstream media has overtly abandoned President Biden - the man they relentlessly shilled for during the 2020 election as the establishment went to extreme measures to unseat Donald Trump. 
After months of gentile distancing, the media&#x27;s come-to-Jesus finally happened after the White House &#x27;botched&#x27; the response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. CNN published an article last Wednesday titled: &quot;After string of Supreme Court setbacks, Democrats wonder whether Biden White House is capable of urgency moment demands.&quot;

WNU Editor: Zero Hedge is right. The main stream media has turned against the Biden administration. 
So why now? 
My guess is that the Supreme Court ruling against Roe vs. Wade and the Biden administration&#x27;s slow response to it is was what broke the camel&#x27;s back on mainstream media support for President Biden.</span>

National Post/Reuters:  France prepares for total cutoff of Russian gas  
The government is also looking company by company to see which can be forced to lower production to save energy if necessary  
AIX-EN-PROVENCE — The French government is preparing for a total cutoff of Russian gas supplies, which it sees as the most likely scenario in its forward planning, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. 
With about 17 per cent of its supply coming from Russia, France is less dependent on Russian gas than some of its neighbours, but the government has been preparing contingency plans. 
A cutoff is particularly problematic now because France’s nuclear power generation would struggle to pick up the slack as many reactors are currently down for maintenance.

Human rights will be part of the discussions taking place during his trip to the Middle East next week, President Biden wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post on Sunday.   
Why it matters: Biden has faced criticism from some quarters over his planned trip to Saudi Arabia, where he expects to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
* U.S. intelligence concluded MBS was responsible for the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi — an allegation Saudi officials reject. 
* Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said last month that he believed Biden shouldn&#x27;t meet with MBS. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go. I wouldn&#x27;t shake his hand,&quot; he said.

A new UN report has found that Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces bear a large share of the blame for an attack on a nursing home that left vulnerable residents trapped in the firing line. 
Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Russian forces attacked a nursing home in Stara Krasnyanka, about 580 kilometres south-east of Kyiv. 
Dozens of elderly and disabled patients, many of them bedridden, were trapped inside without water or electricity.

                              <span>Daily Mail: Voters in Japan overwhelmingly back slain ex-prime minister Shinzo Abe’s party, handing the Liberal Democrats a parliamentary SUPER-majority that could now see the world’s third-richest country greatly expand its army and global role 
* Ruling party the Liberal Democrats - who have been in government 62 of the past 67 years - are set to gain 
* Added seats could allow Shinzo Abe&#x27;s proposed constitutional changes to pass, sealing late ex-PM&#x27;s legacy 
* Mr Abe, 67, was shot dead with an improvised shotgun while campaigning in Nara, western Japan last Friday 
 * Queen was &#x27;deeply saddened&#x27; by &#x27;sudden and tragic&#x27; loss of Abe, who served as Japan&#x27;s PM from 2012 to 2020 
* Suspect Tetsuya Yamagami was escorted out of Nara Police Station to be taken to the local prosecutor&#x27;s office 
* GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: This story contains graphic content which some readers may find distressing 
The Japanese Liberal Democrats won a landslide victory at national elections held two days after Shinzo Abe, the party&#x27;s ex-leader and Japan&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, was assassinated at a campaign event. 
Prime minister Fumio Kishida&#x27;s ruling party - which has governed Japan for 62 of the past 67 years - was set to win more than 70 of 125 seats in the upper house alongside right-wing allies Komeito. 
Though a change in government via the more powerful lower house was not at stake, today&#x27;s elections are thought to be a referendum on Japan&#x27;s leaders - and the legacy of its slain ex-PM.

                              <span>The Australian Federal Police and international law enforcement agencies will crack down on Australian outlaw bikie gangs in South East Asia. 

It follows talks between the AFP, Asian and European authorities in Vietnam last month.

Bikie gang members have increased their presence in South East Asia to control illicit supply chains, trafficking corridors and money laundering.

Around 70 per cent of the transnational serious organised crime threats impacting Australia come from overseas.</span>

China&#x27;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Australia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Penny Wong and delivered a four-point list of actions Australia must take to get the relationship between the two countries back on track.

Mr Watts said the meeting was “constructive”.

“What Foreign Minister Wong made clear to Minister Wang Yi was while Australia’s government has changed, Australia’s policy settings and our national interests haven’t,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

“There’s just no way that any Australian government is going to give up their sovereignty completely and become a vassal state to China, which is exactly what they want,” he told Sky News Australia.

He said Australia “needs to go back to China with our own set of demands”.

“To say, first and foremost, you need to release Australian and indeed all political prisoners.

                              <span>“The problem is that Kim’s ideals aren’t wrong,” she said.  “But the way she does it is.”
In five and a half seasons, Kim’s long slide to perdition has become undoubtedly the narrative keystone of the series.  It has not always been so.  When it started, “Saul,” a prequel to “Breaking Bad,” seemed mostly focused on transforming slippery but fundamentally decent Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Albuquerque’s sleaziest lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Kim’s ultimate role was then uncertain, even for the screenwriters.
“We had no idea when we started how important his character was going to be,” said showrunner and co-creator Peter Gould.  “If you watch the pilot of the show, she probably has three lines of dialogue.”
It soon became clear, however, that the character of Seehorn, who started (outwardly) as a straight arrow with a promising legal career, would be an integral part of Jimmy’s makeover.  Like Jimmy, Kim was breaking badly.  Unlike Jimmy, however, Kim never appears in “Breaking Bad,” leading many fans to assume the worst.  The stakes were always potentially higher for her than for the guy with her name in the title.
That seems like a lot to bear, given that “Saul” is one of TV’s most critically acclaimed series.  But if so, Seehorn, 50, who has been performing on screens and on stages since the ’90s, handles it with grace.  Unlike the purse-lipped, inscrutable Kim, Seehorn isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, either professionally or, ultimately, in conversation.  She has no problem, for example, talking at length about a rash.  She’s funny and has a blinding, spontaneous smile that made me wonder if I’d ever seen Kim Wexler’s teeth (despite all those teeth-brushing scenes).

“Next spring,” he said in the interview, “I will be leaving the museum. It will soon be 15 years and it’s a long time. The board is rejuvenated and active, it’s a good time .

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: At 79, Biden Is Testing the Boundaries of Age and the Presidency 
WASHINGTON — When President Biden leaves Tuesday night for a four-day swing through the Middle East, he will presumably be more rested than he would have been had he followed the original plan. 
The trip was initially tacked onto another journey last month to Europe, which would have made for an arduous 10-day overseas trek until it became clear to Mr. Biden’s team that such extended travel might be unnecessarily taxing for a 79-year-old president, or “crazy,” as one official put it. 
Aides also cited political and diplomatic reasons to reorganize the extra stops as a separate trip weeks later. But the reality is that managing the schedule of the oldest president in American history presents distinct challenges. And as Mr. Biden insists he plans to run for a second term, his age has increasingly become an uncomfortable issue for him, his team and his party.

Farmers in the Netherlands have formed their own version of Canada’s &quot;Freedom Convoy,&quot; blocking highways with tractors, setting bales of hay on fire and taking other actions to protest the government’s recent goal to cut emissions that could force some farms to shutter. 
&quot;Where is our prime minister? This country is on fire and the farmers are standing up to the government,&quot; a spokesman for the protests said while standing on top of a hay bale in the town of Eerbeek last week, the Guardian reported. 
Roughly 40,000 protesters gathered in central Netherlands to protest plans to curb the emissions of nitrogen and ammonia last month. Weeks later, the protests have continued across the country with no sign of abating.

KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Kyiv&#x27;s ambassadors to five countries, including Germany, and several other envoys, according to presidential decrees announced on July 9. 
The series of short decrees did not give reasons for the dismissals, but listed the ambassadors as those to Germany, Hungary, Norway, the Czech Republic, and India. 
Envoys to the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh were also dismissed, the decrees stated.  The decrees did not say if the removed envoys would be offered other jobs within the Ukrainian government.

                              <span>&quot;This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,&quot; he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv&#x27;s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy&#x27;s predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an &quot;offended liver sausage&quot; when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine&#x27;s ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia&#x27;s attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of &quot;distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.&quot;
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. &quot;Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,&quot; Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations &quot;absurd.&quot;
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.</span>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms.

                              <span>Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister is not just a portentous political event. His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.
Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…</span>

From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham&#x27;s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God&#x27;s order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world&#x27;s largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…</span>

                              <span>A day after the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, a steady stream of mourners, many in tears, arrived at the scene of his murder in western Japan to offer flowers and prayers.
People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
&quot;I&#x27;m just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers,&quot; the company worker told AFP.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president&#x27;s offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president&#x27;s office said.

                              <span>Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s lawsuit blaming China for COVID-19 was dismissed Friday when a federal judge ruled his court has no jurisdiction over foreign governments.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in a 38-page ruling, wrote that a federal law setting rules for when a sovereign foreign entity could be sued in U.S. courts doesn’t allow any part of the lawsuit filed by Schmitt in April 2020 to continue.

“All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh wrote.

Schmitt’s office filed a notice of appeal immediately after Limbaugh made his ruling.

When Schmitt filed the lawsuit, he claimed China was responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to cause a global pandemic by covering up the initial infection…</span>

&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,&quot; Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…</span>

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s main opposition Labour party on Friday threatened to call a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get him to quit immediately, after he was forced to resign by a cabinet revolt.
Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
&quot;Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world&quot;, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France&#x27;s condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called &quot;absolutely unforgivable&quot;.
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
&quot;We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this,&quot; he said.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia&#x27;s largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney&#x27;s west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia&#x27;s east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
&quot;The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,&quot; state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia&#x27;s most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
&quot;We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,&quot; Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia&#x27;s annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia&#x27;s east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum.
Shouts of &quot;When will you stop the war&quot; and &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop the war&quot; were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.
Underlining tensions in the buildup, Retn…</span>

                              <span>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com &quot;Love Actually,&quot; asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist&#x27;s ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 &quot;Morning @snb19692,&quot; tweeted Grant. &quot;Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?&quot;
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
&quot;Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being &#x27;lynched,&#x27; as they put it, by the January 6 Committee,&quot; reported Julia Davis. &quot;Appearing on Tuesday’s…</span>
