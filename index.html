                              <span>Royal Expert Tom Bower says King Charles has made a &quot;terrible mistake&quot; by granting the title of prince and princess to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&#x27;s children.

Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2, are now sixth and seventh in line to the British throne.

The author of &#x27;Revenge: Megan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors&#x27; criticised the Monarch for providing royal privileges to the Sussexes despite their exit from the institution in 2020.

&quot;Harry and Meghan have undermined the monarchy- [Charles] should have cut them off straight away,&quot; Mr Bower said.

A palace insider claimed the King wants to reconcile with his youngest son for &quot;strategic&quot; reasons, according to The Daily Beast.</span>

                              <span>French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne avoided parliamentary censure in an early morning vote on Saturday after she forced the government&#x27;s budget plan through the National Assembly without a vote. 
The motion to censure Borne – the 18th levelled at her since she assumed the office – was brought by the left-wing Nupes alliance after the prime minister activated Article 49.3 to adopt the public finance bill without a vote.
The motion received just 193 of the 289 votes needed to succeed, an unsurprising outcome in light of the lack of support from the centre-right.
Its rejection constitutes the adoption of the 2023-2027 budget program, which now moves to the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament.
The speaker for Nupes, socialist Philippe Brun, accused the government of &quot;favouring with the greatest servility a very well-endowed minority of the French&quot; despite &quot;an immense inflationary crisis&quot;.
President Emmanuel Macron had &quot;tried to make parliament disappear with his repeated (use of) 49.3&quot;, Brun added.
The far right had supported the left&#x27;s motion of censure, accusing Borne of the &quot;repeated and abusive use of 49.3&quot;.
Borne, for her part, hit back at both factions, saying &quot;demagoguery is your only budgetary course&quot;.
The government also resorted to Article 49.3 earlier this year to push through unpopular pension reforms, sparking violent protests.

                              <span>Dangerous and life-threatening torrential rain caused widespread disruptions in the New York City area. Roads were closed, subway services were disrupted, and basements were overwhelmed. The city experienced a month&#x27;s worth of rain in just three hours, and more heavy rainfall is expected. New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, urging residents to stay home due to dangerous travel conditions. Floodwater also affected schools, subways, railways, and airports in the region. The National Weather Service warned of a considerable risk of flash flood damage and a Level 3 flash flood risk for the Northeast.</span>

                              <span>The Biden administration plans to admit more refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean next year, as the number of migrants arriving at the US southern border continues to rise. The administration aims to admit 35,000 to 50,000 refugees from the region, compared to this year&#x27;s goal of 15,000. The number of refugees admitted from Europe and Central Asia will decrease. The decision on the refugee cap comes amid pressure on the administration to address the border issue. The US had only admitted about 51,000 refugees out of a possible 125,000 by August.</span>

Shakur, known for his raw and controversial lyrics, was fatally shot in a drive-by incident in Las Vegas in 1996. The case has made Shakur even more popular in death, and he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.</span>

The shooter&#x27;s mental health has been a topic of debate, with experts providing conflicting opinions. The actual sentence will be imposed on December 8, and survivors and families will have the opportunity to share their experiences with the judge.</span>

He then outlined what he learned about this period of American history and how President Bush helped to shape U.S. policy, as Washington debated whether or not to invade. He then discussed the role of fear and anxiety and how these two emotions contributed to U.S. government thinking about threats, vulnerability, and how best

                              <span>The head of Italy&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics national team, suspended after a group of former athletes made allegations of bullying over their weight and diets, received a simple warning on Friday.
Emanuela Maccarani had been relieved of her role within the Italian gymnastics federation (FGI) pending investigations into her behaviour.
On Friday, the FGI disciplinary commission, followed recommendations of the body&#x27;s federal prosecutor Michele Rossetti that &quot;there was no evidence of intentionally or excessively vexatious behavior in relations with the gymnasts&quot;.
&quot;There was no relentless effort to obtain an additional medal,&quot; he added.
Maccarani&#x27;s assistant Olga Tishina was cleared of any fault.
In late October, three former rhythmic gymnastics, including two double world champions, made claims of abuse in a series of interviews with daily La Repubblica.
One of the gymnasts, Anna Basta, said she had twice thought about killing herself, while 19-year-old Nina Corradini quit the national set-up in 2021 after spending &quot;every minute of the previous few months wishing I could escape&quot;.
Giulia Galtarossa, a world champion in 2009 and 2010 who is and now 31, said she was berated by a coaching assistant for eating a pear, and handed her diet sheet with the message &quot;we have a little piggy in the squad&quot;.
Maccarani had held the position of Italy&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics team&#x27;s technical director since 2018. She was also the team&#x27;s long-time head coach.
She had denied claims of psychological abuse, saying the accusations came from disgruntled gymnasts who were not selected for Olympic squads.
Parents of gymnasts training at the national centre in Desio wrote a letter to the head of Italy&#x27;s Olympic Committee in support of the 57-year-old, who has won a raft of medals for Italy since taking charge in 1996.

&quot;The most important thing for me is to represent our girls in Afghanistan,&quot; she said.

Women&#x27;s sport in Afghanistan was effectively banned by the Taliban when they returned to power in 2021.
That meant no women traveling from Afghanistan in the delegation of more than 120 competitors, coaches and supervisors.

                              <span>Spain’s conservative leader saw his final bid to become prime minister rejected by parliament on Friday, paving the way for Socialist incumbent Pedro Sanchez to have another shot at cobbling together a majority – with the backing of separatist parties whose support could cost him dearly.
Two months after an inconclusive general election resulted in a hung parliament, Spain’s protracted political horse-trading has delivered a first, highly expected verdict: there will be no conservative government led by Alberto Nunez-Feijoo – at least not in this legislature.
On Friday, the leader of the right-wing Popular Party (PP) conceded defeat in his second attempt to win the backing of Spain’s Congress of Deputies, the lower house of parliament, falling short of the 176 seats required for a majority…</span>

In a rare interview with Fox News last week, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was asked about Mohammed al-Ghamdi, a retired school teacher sentenced to death in July for posts on X, formerly Twitter, where he had around 10 followers.
Prince Mohammed acknowledged that details of the case described in media reports were &quot;true&quot; and said he disapproved of the judgement.
&quot;We are not happy with that. We are ashamed of that,&quot; he said, blaming &quot;bad laws&quot; he had so far been unable to change.
He also raised the possibility that Ghamdi might be spared death.
&quot;I&#x27;m hoping that in the next phase of trials, the judge there is more experienced…</span>

                              <span>Donald Trump Thursday night took a swipe at Fox News and the GOP debates, calling on an end to the primary and on those in the media to &quot;stop with the bad debates and negative ads.&quot;
Trump on Thursday suggested that some of the GOP candidates did better than others at the recent Republican debate, even giving a report card for his rivals.

After that, he called for an end to the debates altogether.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Trump, who has skipped the first two debates and said he plans to avoid them all, had this to say late Thursday.

&quot;The second Republican Primary Debate on FoxNews had the Lowest Viewership since 2016. Their overall Ratings are down 30%,&quot; he added. &quot;FOX NEEDS MAGA, THEY JUST DON’T KNOW IT YET. STOP WITH THE BAD DEBATES &amp; NEGATIVE ADS, NO MORE. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE! DJT.&quot;</span>

* Dianne Feinstein, the oldest member of the U.S. Senate and the longest-serving senator from California, has died at age 90. 
* Feinstein’s death leaves vacant her powerful Senate seat, requiring Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint a temporary successor.
* The Democratic senator’s decades-long career was studded with major legislative achievements on issues including gun control and the environment. 
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has died at age 90, her office confirmed Friday.

Feinstein, a Democrat, was the oldest member of the Senate, where she served since 1992. 
She held her seat in the chamber longer than any other woman, and any senator from California.

She passed away Thursday night at her home in Washington, D.C.

Pressure is on Newsom to quickly appoint Feinstein’s temporary replacement (Politico). My gut tells me he is not going to rush into it. As a reader of this blog astutely told me this morning. This gives Newsom an opportunity to appoint Vice-President Harris to take the job, and remove her as an opponent to his own Presidential aspirations.

                              <span>RT:  Ukrainian troops surrendering en masse – TASS

 
More than 10,000 of Kiev’s forces have reportedly laid down arms in recent weeks, using a special radio channel to contact the Russian military 
Large numbers of Ukrainian troops have surrendered to the Russian military in recent weeks, using a special radio frequency designed for fighters willing to lay down arms, TASS reported on Wednesday. 
The frequency, 149.200 call sign ‘Volga’, was set up by the Russian military during the summer. Thus far, it has been used by more than 10,000 Ukrainian servicemen who were subsequently taken into Russian custody, according to a source with knowledge of the situation cited by TASS. The person added that the radio frequency is active along the entire front line.

Update #1: Over 10,000 Ukrainian fighters surrender since summer using special radio frequency (TASS). 
Update #2: The source named the number of people who used the open frequency 149.200 “Volga” to surrender military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Top War) 
WNU Editor: Ukraine is also claiming the same thing. Aside from paying people to defect .... Ukraine pays USD 500,000 to Russian pilot who surrendered with Mi-8 helicopter (Euromaidan), Kyiv is also making the claim that Russian soldiers are surrendering .... Over 200 Russian soldiers surrender to Ukraine thanks to &quot;I Want to Live&quot; project (Ukrinform). 
I am always skeptical of these reports. But what I do find is disturbing is a large discrepancy in the number of POWs that both sides claim to have. On the Russian sides I understand there are thousands of POWs currently in detention. On the Ukraine side the number is only a few hundred.</span>

Seattle Times/New York Times: Who’s gaining ground in Ukraine? This year, No one  
The front line in Ukraine changed little in the winter. Russia aimed to capture the entirety of the Donbas, but it only inched forward. 
Ukraine has made minimal gains in its counteroffensive. Dense Russian minefields and fortifications have made every attack extremely costly. 
Despite nine months of bloody fighting, less than 500 square miles of territory have changed hands since the start of the year. A prolonged stalemate could weaken Western support for Ukraine. 
Both sides started the year with lofty ambitions: Russia wanted to capture the eastern Donbas region, while Ukraine aimed to split Russian forces with an attack in the south. 
Neither offensive has gone to plan. The front line, after months of combat and heavy casualties, remains largely unchanged.

WNU Editor: Two things stick out in the above New York times report. (1) Russia now controls nearly 200 square miles more territory in Ukraine compared with the start of the year.&quot; And (2) .... Russia’s forces are outnumbering Ukraine’s nearly three to one on the battlefield.

 
Update #1: The Western media narrative remains the same. Ukraine is slowly gaining ground in this war .... Ukrainian Forces Are &#x27;Gradually Gaining Ground&#x27;, NATO Chief Says (Reuters).

                              <span>Australia’s trade relations with China have undergone a major $160 million development.

The sanction on the export of Australian hay has been lifted after three years of being implemented. 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed in September that exports of Australian hay to Chinese ports will resume in the coming weeks.

The announcement follows the lifting of sanctions on products like coal, cotton and timber but they remain in place on some other items, like Australian wine.

Before the pandemic, the hay trade with China was worth around $160 million a year.</span>

                              <span>CNN: A NATO country could soon have a pro-Russian leader 
Slovakia is getting ready to elect its fifth prime minister in just four years, and with Kremlin sympathizer Robert Fico’s opposition party leading the polls, it is one being watched with alarm in the West. 
 Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Slovakia has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies. The two countries share a border, Slovakia was the first country to send air defenses to Ukraine and it welcomed tens of thousands of refugees. 
But all that could change if Fico comes to power. The former prime minister makes no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and has blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Russia’s President Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Putin has used to justify his invasion.

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year 
Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year, funneling massive resources into its Ukraine offensive to fight what it calls a &quot;hybrid war&quot; unleashed by the West. 
With Moscow&#x27;s &quot;special military operation&quot; now dragging through its 20th month, both sides have been digging deep and procuring weapons from allies in preparation for a protracted conflict. 
The announcement came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the defense ministers of Britain and France visited Kyiv, where President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied for more air defense systems.

Biden referred to the MAGA movement as an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of democracy. Despite facing low approval ratings and concerns about his age, Biden is focused on protecting democratic institutions. He chose Arizona, near the McCain Institute, to honor the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican who prioritized country over party. Biden aims to avoid alienating moderate Republicans while addressing the spread of anti-democratic rhetoric.</span>

                              <span>The US Senate is pushing for a bipartisan stopgap funding bill to prevent a government shutdown, while the House prepares to vote on partisan Republican spending bills. The Senate bill, which would extend federal spending until November 17 and authorize funding for domestic disaster response and aid to Ukraine, has already been rejected by Republicans in the House. The funding fight revolves around a small portion of the overall budget and does not involve cuts to popular benefit programs. The risk of a shutdown remains high as the two chambers take different approaches to funding.</span>

Approximately 18,000 Gazans have permits to work outside the enclave, providing an injection of $2 million a day to the territory&#x27;s economy.

The army responded to the attack with ground troops and helicopters. Niger has experienced a decline in attacks under former President Mohamed Bazoum, who engaged with Islamists and rural communities. Protests have also been held demanding the withdrawal of French troops.</span>

                              <span>Six female migrants trapped inside a refrigerated food truck were rescued by French police after one of the women made a distress call to a reporter, the BBC and French authorities said Thursday.
The women — four Vietnamese and two Iraqis — hid for hours in a truck loaded with boxes of bananas in northern France, believing the vehicle was on its way to the U.K. or Ireland.
When they realized that the truck was going the opposite way, they started to panic in the cold and cramped, dark space. One of them managed to reach a BBC reporter in London, who then helped the women alert French police Wednesday.
French prosecutor Laetitia Francart said the truck driver, who was in fact heading for Italy, was not at fault. The women told investigators that the driver wasn’t involved, “saying that they…</span>

                              <span>Twin shootings in Rotterdam on Thursday have resulted in an unknown number of fatalities, police said.
A gunman dressed in combat gear opened fire in a flat in the Dutch city then burst into a nearby medical centre. Fires broke out in both places but were later extinguished.
“The two shooting incidents in Rotterdam have resulted in fatalities. We will first inform family and relatives and will explain more later,” the city police said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.
Elite police units had burst into the hospital in the Dutch city searching for the suspect, who was armed with a handgun, authorities said.
The suspect is 32 and the motive for the attack is unknown, local news agency ANP said, citing police. He is suspected of carrying out both shootings and there is not a second shooter, police said.
Pictures from the scene showed people streaming out of the hospital, including medics and patients, as police in body armour moved in. Police helicopters buzzed overhead.
Medics in white coats wheeled patients out on stretchers and wheelchairs
Police had earlier said the suspect was wearing “combat-style” clothes, was tall, with black hair and carrying a backpack.
“First there was a shooting on the fourth floor. Four or five shots were fired. Then a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the education centre,” said a medical student cited by RTL Nieuws, who did not give his name.
“There was a lot of panic and screaming... I didn’t hear any shots, just the panic and that’s what I started to act on,” public broadcaster NOS cited another eyewitness as saying.
Rotterdam is often the scene of shootings, usually attributed to score settling by rival drug gangs.
Authorities were expected to hold a news conference shortly to give more details.
In 2019, three people were shot dead on a tram in Utrecht, sparking a huge manhunt.
And in 2011, the country was left shocked when 24-year Tristan van der Vlis killed six people and wounded 10 others in a rampage at a packed shopping mall.

                              <span>Veteran actor Michael Gambon, who was known to many for his portrayal of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in six of the eight “Harry Potter” films, has died, his publicist said Thursday. He was 82.
A statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following “a bout of pneumonia.”
“We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside,” his family said.
No matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice. He was cast as the much-loved Dumbledore after the death of his predecessor, Richard Harris, in 2002.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
