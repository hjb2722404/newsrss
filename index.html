Bloomberg: Japan, India Hold First Joint Air Drill As China Concerns Grow 
Japan and India held their first joint air drills in an area outside of Tokyo as both countries step up military exercises with other countries amid worries about China’s assertiveness. 
About four F-2 and four F-15 fighters are expected to take part in the drills that started Monday and will run through around Jan. 26 at an airbase in Ibaraki prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, Japan’s Defense Ministry said. 
While the two have trained together before in other countries, this is the first one-on-one training of its sort, it said. 
The exercise comes as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida completed a trip this month to Italy, the UK, Canada and the US to bolster his country’s alliances to help deter China.
Japan is also a member of the Quad grouping that includes India, Australia and the US and is seen as a check on Beijing’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.

Reuters: Sweden, Finland must send up to 130 &quot;terrorists&quot; to Turkey for NATO bid 
ANKARA (Reuters) -Sweden and Finland must deport or extradite up to 130 &quot;terrorists&quot; to Turkey before the Turkish parliament will approve their bids to join NATO, President Tayyip Erdogan said. 
The two Nordic states applied last year to join NATO following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine but their bids must be approved by all 30 NATO member states. 
Turkey and Hungary have yet to endorse the applications. 
Turkey has said Sweden in particular must first take a clearer stance against what it sees as terrorists, mainly Kurdish militants and a group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt.
&quot;We said look, so if you don&#x27;t hand over your terrorists to us, we can&#x27;t pass it (approval of the NATO application) through the parliament anyway,&quot; Erdogan said in comments late on Sunday, referring to a joint press conference he held with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson last November.

                              <span>Washington Post: Bloody Bakhmut siege poses risks for Ukraine 
Ukraine faces difficult choices about how much deeper its military should get drawn into a protracted fight over the besieged city of Bakhmut, as Kyiv prepares for a new counteroffensive elsewhere on the front that requires conserving weapons, ammunition and experienced fighters. 
Russia has escalated its assault in the area in recent days, unleashing savage fighting that has underscored the high cost of the battle. 
Russian mercenaries and released convicts from the Wagner group pushed into the neighboring salt-mining town of Soledar and inched closer to Bakhmut, the capture of which has eluded them for months despite an advantage in firepower and the willingness to sacrifice troops.

WNU Editor: The Washington Post puts a lot of focus on Ukrainian reports of Russian casualties while ignoring Ukrainian casualties. But as the above France 24 video report on the Battle of Bakhmut reveals, just one hospital alone receives 100 wounded Ukrainian soldiers a day (14:00 mark in the above video)!!!! 
The Washington Post is also pushing the narrative that Bakhmut is not important. I disagree. Bahkmut is the gateway to the major cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk that are only 35km and 40km from Bahkmut. Bahkmut in Russian hands automatically begins the battle for Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the last two major cities in the Donbas that is in Ukrainian hands.</span>

Reuters: Davos 2023: Recession casts long shadow over opening of WEF summit 
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) -The prospect of imminent global recession cast a long shadow over Davos on Monday as participants gathering for the opening of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s annual meeting counted the likely cost for their economies and businesses. 
Two-thirds of private and public sector chief economists surveyed by the WEF expect a global recession this year, with some 18% considering it &quot;extremely likely&quot; - more than twice as many as in the previous survey conducted in September 2022. 
&quot;The current high inflation, low growth, high debt and high fragmentation environment reduces incentives for the investments needed to get back to growth and raise living standards for the world&#x27;s most vulnerable,&quot; WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi said in a statement accompanying the survey results.

* Since 2020, the richest 1% of people have accumulated close to two-thirds of all new wealth created around the world, a new report from Oxfam says. 
* Taxes must be increased for the ultra-rich as a “strategic precondition to reducing inequality and resuscitating democracy,” Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International said. 
Over the last two years, the richest 1% of people have accumulated close to two-thirds of all new wealth created around the world, a new report from Oxfam says. 
A total of $42 trillion in new wealth has been created since 2020, with $26 trillion, or 63%, of that being amassed by the top 1% of the ultra-rich, according to the report. 
The remaining 99% of the global population collected just $16 trillion of new wealth, the global poverty charity says. 
“A billionaire gained roughly $1.7 million for every $1 of new global wealth earned by a person in the bottom 90 percent,” the report, released as the World Economic Forum kicks off in Davos, Switzerland, reads.

                              <span>Washington Post: Peru extends state of emergency as deadly protests roil the country 
Peru’s government extended a state of emergency in the country’s capital and three other regions Sunday as President Dina Boluarte refused calls to resign amid anti-government protests that have killed at least 47 people, about one-third of whom have died in the last week. 
The 30-day order, which follows a now-expired nationwide state of emergency, suspends several constitutional rights, including freedom of transit, freedom of assembly and the right to privacy in the home. 
The mandate also gives special authority to Peru’s national police and armed forces to seek to restore peace.
In addition to the capital of Lima, the state of emergency applies to the Cusco, Puno and Callao regions, as well as several provinces. Puno, where protesters have stormed an airport and torched a Congress member’s home, is subject to a nighttime curfew.

The Hill: White House counsel: No visitor logs for Biden Delaware home 
The White House says no visitor logs exist for President Biden’s private residence near Wilmington, Del., where classified documents were found, after House Republicans called for the release of such records. 
“Like every President across decades of modern history, his personal residence is personal,” the White House counsel’s office said in a statement to numerous news outlets on Monday. 
“But upon taking office, President Biden restored the norm and tradition of keeping White House visitors logs, including publishing them regularly, after the previous administration ended them,” it added.
A Secret Service spokesman also told CNN that while the agency provides security for Biden’s home, it does not independently maintain visitor logs for it.

WNU editor: I can understand why no visitor logs were maintained after Vice-President Biden left office. He is out of office, so why maintain them. But the optics still look very bad.</span>

Christine Lambrecht has resigned as Germany&#x27;s defense minister following a much-criticized New Year&#x27;s eve message. Her year in office became a succession of minor scandals and statements that many saw as tone-deaf. 
Germany&#x27;s Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht, of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), on Monday formally announced her resignation, following a weekend of speculation about her future.  
Lambrecht had been under intense pressure over a video she posted on Instagram on New Year&#x27;s Day from the streets of Berlin, in which she attempted to recapitulate her experiences of the war in Ukraine but was almost drowned out by the noise of fireworks exploding around her.

Zero Hedge: Why Was Hunter Paying Joe Biden $50k Per Month To Rent House Where Classified Documents Found? 
A Thursday tweet from the NY Post&#x27;s Miranda Devine containing a background check for Hunter Biden has people asking questions. 
 &quot;The now-52-year-old began listing the Wilmington home as his address following his 2017 divorce from ex-wife Kathleen Buhle — even falsely claiming he owned the property on a July 2018 background check form as part of a rental application,&quot; the Post reported. 
Yet, upon closer inspection, Hunter lists the &quot;Monthly Rent&quot; as $49,910 - or roughly $550,000 for the 11 months he indicated he lived there?

WNU Editor: Nice home. But it is not worth $50,000/month. 

I had a business partner who was treated the same way as Hunter Biden is/was treated by his father. We were making good money, but all the money that my business partner was taking in was going to his father. And even though he complained all the time, he still gave him everything.</span>

Reuters: Iran on agenda when U.S. national security adviser visits Israel 
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and threats posed by Tehran will be discussed when U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan travels to Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s new government. 
&quot;I&#x27;ll be going to Israel and that will be a substantial topic of conversation when I go,&quot; he said. 
Speaking to reporters traveling with President Joe Biden on a trip to Mexico City, Sullivan did not say when his trip would take place. A National Security Council spokesperson said dates were still being worked out. 
Sullivan said efforts to revive an Iran nuclear deal opposed by Israel had been set aside for now while Washington pressures Iran to stop sending drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine and seeks to stop a crackdown on Iranian demonstrators.

WNU Editor: The priority right now for the White House is the Russia - Ukraine war, and to do everything possible to weaken Russia. I suspect the reason why White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wants to go to Israel is to discourage any plan by the Netanyahu government to launch a military strike against Iran. 
A military strike would not only result in war, but a closure of the Straits of Hormuz and removing almost a quarter of the world&#x27;s oil supply. This would result in a massive spike in prices, and a huge windfall for the Russian government.</span>

Israel’s outgoing army chief Aviv Kochavi said in a series of farewell interviews on Friday that Israel has devised three operational plans to attack Iran to “neutralize” its nuclear program.  
Days before being replaced by his successor Herzi Halevi, Israel’s army Chief of Staff said that Iran has an “active weapons team,&quot; which “has been working at a very slow pace, and this is in violation of the nuclear deal.” 
According to Kochavi, Iran currently has enough fissile material for the production of four bombs using highly enriched uranium.

Iran currently has enough enriched uranium to make four nuclear bombs, Israel&#x27;s outgoing military chief informed reporters on Friday. 
&quot;Iran today has enough enriched material to produce four nuclear bombs, three at 20 per cent and one at 60 per cent,&quot; Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported outgoing Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi telling reporters.
Kochavi shared that over the last year, the Israeli army prepared three programmes to launch an attack in Iran as a retaliatory strike, unrelated to the nuclear programme, to destroy nuclear facilities supporting the nuclear project.

France 24: Logistical challenge looms for Ukraine over promised tanks 
Paris (AFP) – The imminent arrival in Ukraine of Western-made light tanks and armoured vehicles, as well as possibly heavy tanks, means Kyiv will need to quickly train up troops to use and maintain the sometimes complex equipment, analysts say. 
Ukraine&#x27;s European allies have sent Kyiv more than 300 modernised Soviet tanks since Russia invaded more than 10 months ago. 
But they have so far held off on dispatching the Western-made heavy tanks that Ukraine has repeatedly requested to push forward against Russian invaders. 
Near the battleground city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian captain Volodymyr Tchaikovsky said NATO tanks had &quot;a huge advantage&quot; for any soldier inside. 
 &quot;If he has the coordinates of his target, he can destroy the target with one shot,&quot; the 54-year-old said.

WNU Editor: Before the war Ukraine had almost 900 tanks. I can only presume the reason why Ukraine is pleading for more tanks is that many of them have been either been destroyed or disabled. The same will happen with these promised tanks. And there is also the problem of fuel and repairing these tanks. Tanks are heavy fuel consumers. The trucks that carry this fuel are going to be priority targets. But given a choice of tanks or no tanks. I would still prefer the tanks.</span>

EurAsian Times: You’re Dead! Loaded On Su-57 Stealth Fighters, Ukrainian Pilot Calls Russia’s R-37M Missile ‘Most Dangerous’ 
In a recent interview, a Ukrainian fighter pilot described Russia’s long-range R-37M air-to-air missile as a dangerous weapon employed by the Russian Air Force.  
On January 9, the UK Ministry of Defense (MoD) said in an assessment that Russia is “almost certainly” deploying its most powerful warplane, the Su-57 Felon, in operations against Ukraine in a way that minimizes the risks to the aircraft. 
According to the UK MoD, the Su-57s were probably restricted to flying over Russian territory and firing long-range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine to avoid getting detected and shot down by Ukrainian air defense systems. 
While Russian media reports have been claiming the use of Su-57s in the ongoing Ukraine war since May 2022, and the latest assessment from the UK MoD corroborates a report by the Russian state-owned TASS news agency, which said that the Su-57s have been operating “outside the zone of active destruction by enemy air defense systems.” 
Among the long-range weaponry of the Felon, the long-range R-37M air-to-air missile is of particular concern to the Ukrainian pilots, according to an American media outlet, which cited a Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot describing it as “f*****g dangerous.”

Military.com: Attacks on Satellites May Trigger Military Response, US and Japanese Officials Say 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced alongside Japanese officials on Wednesday that they would consider military retaliation in response to attacks on satellites, a policy that puts China and Russia on notice amid looming threats in space. 
Space Force and U.S. Space Command are in charge of monitoring and protecting America&#x27;s satellite fleet. With additional treaty obligations between the U.S. and Japan, American forces could be drawn into a skirmish if Japanese satellites are targeted.

Dmitry Medvedev accuses Fumio Kishida of shameful subservience to US after Joe Biden meeting  Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida of shameful subservience to the US and suggested he should ritually disembowel himself. 
His remarks on Saturday were the latest in a long line of shocking and provocative statements from Medvedev, who was once seen as a western-leaning reformer but has reinvented himself as an arch-hawk since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.

News 360: Stoltenberg anticipates more heavy weapons deliveries to Ukraine in «near future» 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has anticipated further arms deliveries to Ukraine on the eve of new talks on the matter to be held at Ramstein Air Base. 
In fact, the secretary general has advocated an increase in shipments of heavy weaponry given that, in his view, the war in Ukraine is in a &quot;decisive&quot; phase between &quot;fierce battles&quot;. 
&quot;Recent commitments are important,&quot; Stoltenberg said of the UK&#x27;s recent announcement to deliver Challenger 2 tanks to Ukrainian forces, &quot;and I expect more in the near future.&quot;

CNN: How Ukraine became a testbed for Western weapons and battlefield innovation  
Last fall, as Ukraine won back large swaths of territory in a series of counterattacks, it pounded Russian forces with American-made artillery and rockets. Guiding some of that artillery was a homemade targeting system that Ukraine developed on the battlefield. 
A piece of Ukrainian-made software has turned readily available tablet computers and smartphones into sophisticated targeting tools that are now used widely across the Ukrainian military. 
The result is a mobile app that feeds satellite and other intelligence imagery into a real-time targeting algorithm that helps units near the front direct fire onto specific targets. And because it’s an app, not a piece of hardware, it’s easy to quickly update and upgrade, and available to a wide range of personnel. 
US officials familiar with the tool say it has been highly effective at directing Ukrainian artillery fire onto Russian targets.

Defence Blog: UK denies media report it plans to supply Apache helicopters to Ukraine 
British Ministry of Defense denied media reports it plans to supply its AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to Ukraine. 
The Ministry of Defense has said that a Daily Mirror’s article claiming the UK will send Apache attack helicopters to Ukraine is incorrect, according to Sky’s defence and security editor Deborah Haynes. 
Western media outlets reported yesterday that UK will provide Ukraine with up to four AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. 
“Britain will send attack helicopters armed with deadly Hellfire missiles to Ukraine in a move hailed as a game-changer,” Daily Mirror reported Saturday. 
Daily Star, in turn, has reported that potential package will set the UK back a pretty “penny though”, with each Apache worth a cool £70million – while the British Army have also been equipped with the same model. 
Eventually, Daily Mirror has deleted their publication, and Daily Star still left their article without editing.

                              <span>[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Although women are stereotypically considered to shy away from competition, they are competing for valuable social resources in modern society. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2020) and the International Labour Organisation (2020), 47.66% of women aged above 15 worldwide are competing in the job market. Facing competition for social resources, people should resort to competence, a highly valued trait in this context.   Unfortunately, women continuously experience marginalisation, while the benefits brought by physical attractiveness seem obvious especially for them. Competition may lead women to value their physical features over their inner qualities (including personalities, thoughts and feelings), a phenomenon known as self-objectification. Those who engage in self-objectification, perceive and treat themselves merely as objects to be evaluated based on looks.   In addition, this effect could be more robust among women who believe they can achieve a sense of control over others, especially men, through their sexuality—the belief that sex is power. In other words, physical attractiveness is used as a tool or a “shortcut” for these women to gain an advantage over their competitors.  To test whether competition, in either work settings or a broad form of resource fighting, would interact with the “sex is power” belief to result in self-objectification among women, Dr WANG Xijing, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences, worked with other researchers to confirm these predictions across five studies: competition or a sense of competition as a feature of the working environment (Study 1); a real state in one’s life (e.g. job hunting, Study 2) or a temporarily activated state via experiments (Studies 3-5); results in self-objectification among women who believe sex is power (Study 1); or enter such a mindset temporarily (Studies 2-5). In addition, such…</span>

Can they reflect political and social situations? If you believe that recipe books can only teach you how to cook, you may be underestimating some important sources that reflect our history.  Numerous scholars have argued that recipe books can be regarded as a reflection of the history, culture, society and identity of a country or place. Research on recipe books for communal canteens is especially rare in the field of China’s history. Dr FAN Ka-wai, Associate Professor of CityU’s Department of Chinese and History, has conducted research to discuss three recipe books created for communal canteens published in 1959. He used recipe books as the historical material, supplemented with government documents, booklets published by local authorities, newspapers and memoirs, among others, to reveal the diet of the Chinese people during the Great Famine, thus broadening our understanding of the Chinese Communist Party leaders’ thoughts and how they exercised control in the countryside.  In early 1958, China initiated the “Great Leap Forward” campaign. Although previous studies broadened our understanding of this campaign, there is still plenty of room for us to discover more valuable historical sources to provide a more comprehensive picture of this campaign and the ensuing famine. In 1958, the people’s communes were established as an administrative entity in rural China. One of the most important elements of the commune were the communal canteens, which were established to ensure that all the members within the commune obtained a fair share of economic growth while forbidding the preparation of food at home.  By the end of October 1958, over 2.65 million communal canteens were established across the country, and 70-90% of villagers ate in communal dining halls. Since free meals were provided every day, it was difficult for the canteens to design and cook many different dishes…</span>

                              <span>[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  We get to know people by gaining knowledge about them, such as talking to them, talking to others about them, or observing how they react in certain situations. This is known as the uncertainty reduction process in interpersonal communication. In the contemporary media environment, what people publish about themselves on social network sites (SNSs) provides information seekers with plenty of knowledge about the person. Previous research, however, showed that the SNSs information did not help an information seeker reduce uncertainties or feel closer to a person as much as directly interacting with the person.  To explain this, previous research proposed a distinction between interpersonal and personal knowledge. Personal knowledge refers to how a target person feels, thinks, and behaves in certain situations. Interpersonal knowledge, on the other hand, refers to how a target reacts to an information seeker in a unique fashion different from how the target responds to others. It is argued that interpersonal knowledge can only be gained from direct interactions and it is the kind of knowledge that ultimately makes up the essence of affinity and intimacy.  To answer further inquiries about how the information one can find about a target online contributes to an information seeker’s personal and interpersonal certainties about the target, Dr Nancy DAI Yue, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Media and Communication, led a research project  to investigate how the information seeker’s interpersonal and personal certainties about a target person were influenced by (1) positive and negative information on SNSs about a target person, (2) the source of the information, and (3) an information seeker’s positivism bias in interpersonal interactions. It is the first empirical attempt to separate interpersonal and personal certainties in person perception.  The research team designed an experiment to verify if interpersonal and…</span>

                              <span>[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Social media platforms such as YouTube are becoming increasingly popular for information sharing, and for identity performance. Online video-mediated communication has been further popularised by the COVID-19 pandemic which sees more recreational and educational content posted online to reach a global audience. Online video-sharing platforms provide a space for influencers or educators to interact with audiences from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, thus creating opportunities for intercultural communication through online videos. In particular, how cultural identities are conveyed through the multimodal affordances of online videos warrants further investigation.  Multimodal resources play an important role in the creation of video-based materials. The multimodality of videos offers content creators an enlarged set of resources, in addition to the use of language, to make meaning, and to perform their cultural identities. The notion of interculturality emphasises the interconnectedness of different cultures and considers how participants use different resources available to them to perform their cultural identities.  Dr Jenifer HO, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of English, investigated how a multilingual YouTube influencer and his co-presenter who have a transnational trajectory orchestrate their multilingual and multimodal repertoires to make aspects of their identities relevant or irrelevant in a strategic way, to perform their multiple cultural identities.   The study found that interculturality is made visible in online videos through influencers’ performance of dynamic and flexible multilingual practices. Furthermore, medium affordances such as images, camera angle, video-editing effects and so on are also deployed to construct the influencers’ transnational cultural identities.   The study has implications for influencers, educators and the general public who want to create video-based…</span>

Several years later, in 1988, her jailed mother was one of thousands killed in mass executions. Now an anthropologist, Marakemi explains that the Iranian regime has long used state violence for control, setting up a sort of &quot;contract&quot; to keep society within their &quot;red lines&quot;. She says the current protests, which began four months ago following the death of Mahsa Amini, are a sign that Iranians are no longer accepting the regime&#x27;s &quot;game of terror&quot;.</span>

Denaro is the most significant mafia boss in Italy and his arrest in his native Sicily is a great victory for the state in its war against organized crime.</span>

                              <span>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is directly lobbying members of US Congress to continue supporting the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.

He says the pact is essential in strengthening Australia&#x27;s defence capabilities and that it is a good agreement for the US and UK.

It follows criticism in America from two senators who warned President Joe Biden the AUKUS deal could be a zero-sum game for the allocation of scarce, highly advanced US nuclear boats. 

Mr Albanese is confident Joe Biden will stick to the AUKUS agreement despite domestic political pressure.</span>

US officials are sold on Japan’s new military posture. Japan’s public might not be.

 Protests in Peru related to the arrest of former President Pedro Castillo have become increasingly violent, leading to many deaths, and show no real signs of abating. Despite the unprecedented political violence and calls for her resignation, Castillo’s successor and former vice president, President Dina Boluarte, refused on Friday to step down, saying, “My commitment is with Peru.”

Jerusalem Post: Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Putin afraid of coup, will retire in 2023 - report 
A former ally of the Russian President talked about the possibility that Putin might retire soon, rather then potentially getting killed in a coup. 
A source who was close to Putin once claimed that &quot;the president will nominate his chosen heir already this year, instead of risking his downfall,&quot; the British Daily Mail reported on Friday.

DW: Power struggle in the Russian armed forces  
Sergey Surovikin has been removed as head of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine and replaced by Valery Gerasimov. Is there a power struggle raging in Moscow? 
General Sergey Surovikin was commander-in-chief of the &quot;special military operation,&quot; as Russia still officially calls its war of aggression against Ukraine, for just three months. On Thursday, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu demoted him to deputy commander. He will now answer to Russia&#x27;s chief of the general staff, General Valery Gerasimov, who will take over the leadership of Russia&#x27;s military in Ukraine — nominally, a…</span>

Hot Air: China admits nearly 60k COVID deaths in the past month but some experts say it&#x27;s much higher 
Just over one month ago, China finally dropped its zero-COVID measures. Since then there have been multiple reports that Chinese hospitals, funeral parlors and crematoriums have been overwhelmed. Thursday NBC News reported that you could see the crowds at Chinese crematoriums from space:   
Satellite images taken over multiple cities in China show heightened activity outside crematoriums and funeral homes, appearing to contradict the country’s low official Covid-19 death figures and illustrating the severity of the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. 
The images, taken by the Colorado-based space technology company Maxar in late December and early January and shared with NBC News, show a parking lot has been built since early December at a funeral home in Tongzhou, on the outskirts of Beijing, the capital. 
Other images from cities around the country show a greater number of cars parked outside funeral homes compared with similar periods in past years.

HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Exactly five years ago on Friday, Hawaii residents and visitors woke up to a terrifying emergency alert on their cell phones that sent a wave of panic across the state. 
The message warned of a ballistic missile heading for Hawaii. 
It read, “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” 
That was on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2018.

WNU Editor: In the 1970s I was a teenager playing soccer in the park when the air raid/missile alert system went on. In the few minutes that it took me to run home to turn on the radio to find out what was happening, I was totally overwhelmed with fear. 
It was simply an exercise that no one bothered to tell us, but that fear is something that I will always remember.</span>

                              <span>Washington Times: FBI reveals it uses CIA and NSA to spy on Americans  
The FBI revealed how the bureau uses the CIA and National Security Agency to probe the private lives of Americans without a warrant in its updated rulebook, which is the first version made public since the Obama administration.  
The handbook, rewritten in 2021, confirms a decade-old leak showcasing the bureau’s collaboration with the CIA and NSA for FBI probes that may involve surveillance without court orders against people not accused of any crimes. Such probes are known as “assessments” at the FBI. 
The revelations will fuel critics who have long accused the FBI of abusing its national security surveillance powers.

The vast majority of U.S. active duty military members believe the Pentagon has become politicized, according to data obtained exclusively by Breitbart News. 
Sixty-eight percent of active duty members say they have “witnessed a growing politicization,” while 53 percent say the military has become “too politicized.” Sixty-eight percent also say such politicization would impact their decision to encourage their children to join the military. 
The data, gathered by the National Independent Panel on Military Service and Readiness (NIPMSR), show specific policy areas of concern for active duty military at a time when President Joe Biden’s Pentagon has been criticized by many for conducting social experiments in the ranks of the military, as opposed to focusing on national defense. The NIPMSR was empaneled by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts.

 Politico: Menendez vows to block plan to sell fighter jets to Turkey 
The senator blasted Turkey&#x27;s human rights record in a statement. 
The chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is vowing to continue blocking the transfer of warplanes to Turkey unless Ankara improves its human rights record and ceases threatening U.S. regional allies. 
The Biden administration is considering a $20 billion transfer of 40 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to Turkey and, separately, F-35 fighter jets for Greece, a development first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday and later confirmed by a person familiar with discussions who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity. 
Such a deal would require congressional approval and for Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to end his longstanding opposition to sending fighter jets to Ankara. 
But in a statement Menendez’s office drafted for the media and obtained ahead of time by POLITICO, the senator said he hasn’t changed his mind.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Retired general Petr Pavel scored a narrow win over billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis in the first round of the Czech presidential election on Saturday, securing a solid base for a runoff in two weeks, nearly complete results showed. 
The post does not carry executive authority but has significant powers in appointing prime ministers, central bank chiefs and nominating judges for the constitutional court. 
Presidents also have a limited say in foreign affairs and are chief army commanders.  Results from 99.99% of the voting districts showed Pavel won with 35.39%, ahead of Babis with 35.00%.

LONDON -Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s office said late on Saturday that Britain would send 14 of its main battle tanks along with additional artillery support to Ukraine, disregarding criticism from the Russian Embassy in London. 
A squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks will go into the country in the coming weeks and around 30 self-propelled AS90 guns, operated by five gunners, are expected to follow, the British prime minister’s office said in a statement. 
The UK will also begin training Ukrainian forces to use the tanks and guns in the coming days.

                              <span>Politico: More documents found at Biden&#x27;s Delaware home  
The additional information was discovered and reported earlier this week and turned over the Justice Department. 
Aides to President Joe Biden on Thursday evening found five additional classified documents at his Wilmington, Del., home, the White House announced Saturday. 
The additional information was discovered and reported earlier this week and turned over the Justice Department, according to a statement from Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president. 
Sauber, who has necessary security clearance to review sensitive materials, said he went to Biden’s home in Delaware on Thursday to provide the Justice Department with the classified materials that Biden’s team had discovered a day earlier. 
While there, he found the five additional pages with classification markings. The Justice Department officials with him immediately took possession of those materials, Sauber said.

                              <span>CNBC/Reuters: China reports huge rise in Covid deaths after WHO criticized Beijing for heavily undercounting 
* China said on Saturday nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital since it abandoned its zero-COVID policy last month. 
* In early December, Beijing abruptly dismantled its strict three-year anti-virus regime of frequent testing, travel curbs. 
* The World Health Organization said this week that China was heavily under-reporting deaths from COVID, although it was now providing more information on its outbreak. 
China said on Saturday nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital since it abandoned its zero-COVID policy last month, a huge increase from previously reported figures that follows global criticism of the country’s coronavirus data.
In early December, Beijing abruptly dismantled its strict three-year anti-virus regime of frequent testing, travel curbs and mass lockdowns after widespread protests in late November, and cases have surged since then across the nation of 1.4 billion. 
A health official said on Saturday that COVID fever and emergency hospitalizations had peaked and the number of hospitalized patients was continuing to decline.

                              <span>OilPrice.com: China’s Oil Demand Is Set To Hit A Record High In 2023 
China’s oil consumption is expected to jump by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year to a record 16 million bpd, after Beijing abandoned the strict ‘zero Covid’ policy and re-opened its borders, a median estimate of 11 China-focused consultants polled by Bloomberg News showed. 
Following the initial exit Covid wave after the strictest curbs were lifted, Chinese oil demand is set to rebound from the second quarter onwards, also raising global oil demand for this year, many analysts say. 
Despite the fact that China’s crude oil imports in 2022 were slightly lower than the previous year, for a second consecutive year, crude imports in December rose by 4% annually for the third highest monthly purchases in 2022, data showed on Friday.

Update: Chinese Oil Demand Seen Hitting Record on Covid Zero Pivot (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: As energy consumers we have been incredibly lucky this winter. Covid has tempered Chinese demand for oil, and an unusually war winter in Europe has lowered energy consumption. 
Will our luck hold for the rest of 2023? If China is any indication, the answer is unfortunately a no.</span>

                              <span>Breaking Defense: Ukraine war leaves British Army ‘very uncomfortable’ with Future Soldier capabilities  
A British defense committee meeting heard about concerns brought on by the war in Ukraine, the state of British tanks (some Ukraine-bound) and a potential recovery for the Ajax recon vehicle program.  
BELFAST — A top UK military leader revealed this week that operational analysis of the Ukraine war led the British Army to feel “very uncomfortable” with aspects of its Future Soldier modernization program. 
Lt. Gen. Sharon Nesmith, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, said the Eastern European conflict had in “the first instance” caused the army to reconsider how to address air defense, uncrewed systems, deep fires and intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance (ISTAR) capability gaps. 
During the three-hour-long Wednesday UK defense committee hearing — which provided the clearest glimpse yet into the war’s impact on UK land strategy — Nesmith told lawmakers that in an attempt to fix the problems, the service has already completed an “internal balance of investment” and continues to look for opportunities to accelerate procurement. 
But the new approach could be troubled by “two realistic constraints,” Nesmith said: supply chain difficulties and industrial capacity.

ABC News Australia: Ukraine&#x27;s Zelenskyy plans UN visit on anniversary of Russian invasion 
Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member United Nations General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia&#x27;s February 24 invasion, if the security situation permits, a senior foreign ministry official says.
Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova told The Associated Press (AP) that Mr Zelenskyy would only attend if the military situation allowed, amid a Ukrainian intelligence warning that Russia is planning &quot;a very serious offensive in February&quot;. 
 &quot;Our president would want to come, he has a will or intention to come,&quot; she said, &quot;but it&#x27;s still a question if there will be a security situation that will allow him to come&quot;.

Reuters: Russia fires new wave of missiles at Ukraine after hitting Kyiv infrastructurey 
KYIV (Reuters) - Russia fired a second wave of missiles at Ukraine on Saturday, forcing people to take cover as sirens blared across the country just hours after morning air strikes that hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv. 
Authorities in Mykolaiv, the western city of Lviv and the Black Sea port of Odesa said air defences were trying to shoot down incoming missiles. Explosions were heard in the central Vynnytsa region, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported. 
Moscow, which invaded last February, has been pounding Ukraine&#x27;s energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since October, causing sweeping blackouts and disruptions to central heating and running water as winter bites.

WNU Editor: One of my cousins, with her husband and 20 year old daughter, are leaving Ukraine today. They are currently in central Ukraine (west of the Dnieper river) and are on their way to Kyiv, then Lviv, and from there to Warsaw. They will be flying later in the week to Toronto (where I will meet them for the day), and from there they will be flying to Winnipeg to meet a friend. she told me this morning that the city she is leaving has power 2 hours on, 2 hours off, and there has been no water for three days.

                              <span>At least 3 submarines and a large landing ship have departed Novorossiysk today. This is highly unusual and may indicate ongoing operations.   
Atlas News: Russian Warships Depart Black Sea Naval Base 
On January 11th, 2023, Naval News reported that several Russian warships departed Novorossiysk Naval Base on the Black Sea. According to their sources: 
 “The group included the Project 11711 Ivan Gren class landing ship, Pyotr Morgunov, the largest amphibious ship in the Black Sea. It also contained all three Project 636.3 Improved-Kilo class submarines which were present at the base. Analysis suggests that other warships were also sailing, leaving only a few warships and support vessels in the port. It is likely the most empty that Novorossiysk has been in many months.”

DW: German media report defense minister soon to resign 
German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht may leave her post as soon as next week, according to German news outlets. 
Lambrecht was recently criticized for a New Year&#x27;s Eve message posted on social media.   German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht intends to resign, several German media outlets reported on Friday.    
What do we know so far? 
The revelation was first reported by German newspaper Bild, with the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper following soon thereafter. Both cited unnamed sources and said she may step down as soon as next week.  
 However, on the record, spokespeople for German government only responded initially on Friday evening by saying that the reports constituted &quot;rumors,&quot; on which &quot;we do not comment.&quot;

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday he seriously doubted that ramped up Chinese military activities near the Taiwan Strait were a sign of an imminent invasion of the island by Beijing.
&quot;We&#x27;ve seen increased aerial activity in the straits, we&#x27;ve seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan,&quot; Austin said during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts.
&quot;But whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, you know, I seriously doubt that,&quot; Austin said.

It debuted in the top ten album charts in both the U.S. and the U.K. A poster promoting Lovato’s pop-punk record featured the 30-year-old singer-songwriter “bound in a bondage-style outfit whilst lying on a large, cushioned crucifix,” accordin...</span>

Since their far-right hero Jair Bolsonaro lost elections in October, they have camped in the capital Brasilia, clamoring for the military to launch a coup to rid the country of his leftist successor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
As their call went unanswered, on Sunday they launched the assault. Hundreds flooded the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court in a rampage organized days in advance on Telegram and WhatsApp.
They sang the national anthem, hurled insults and objects at law enforcers, and left mass destruction in their wake.
But who are they?

                              <span>(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday mocked Russian claims to have taken over parts of the eastern city of Soledar, saying that fighting was still going on.
Russian mercenary group Wagner on Tuesday claimed it had taken full control of Soledar but that fighting continued in the city centre. Soledar is a salt-mining town near the city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of a Russian assault aimed at capturing the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
&quot;The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that part of our town of Soledar ... is some sort of a Russian possession,&quot; Zelenskiy said in a video address.
&quot;But fighting continues. The Donetsk theatre of operations is holding.&quot;
In a separate statement on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the Russians were suffering heavy losses as they tried to take Soledar and cut off the supply routes for pro-Kyiv units.

Donelan told BBC radio a deal reportedly negotiated by the British Museum&#x27;s chairman, George Osborne, was not about the permanent return to Greece of the ancient sculptures.
That was &quot;not his intention&quot;, Donelan said referring to Osborne, a former finance minister under ex-prime minister David Cameron.

                              <span>Peru&#x27;s top prosecutor&#x27;s office on Tuesday said it launched an inquiry into new President Dina Boluarte and members of her cabinet over violent clashes that have seen at least 40 killed and hundreds injured since early December.
The inquiry comes after 17 civilians were killed in the country&#x27;s southern Puno region on Monday - the most lethal day of protests since former President Pedro Castillo was ousted and detained last month. The violence continued on Tuesday with a police officer dying after his car was torched. 
The attorney general&#x27;s office said it was investigating Boluarte along with Prime Minister Alberto Otarola, Defense Minister Jorge Chavez and Interior Minister Victor Rojas on charges of &quot;genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries.&quot;

One of the most powerful figures in the Roman Catholic Church, Pell died at the age of 81 on Tuesday in Rome due to heart complications following a hip operation.
The man who was convicted, jailed and then cleared of molesting two 13-year-old choirboys in the 1990s remains deeply polarizing.
&quot;It was very sad personal news to hear and quite a shock,&quot; said Archbishop of Melbourne Peter Comensoli.
But Phillip Nagle, an abuse survivor in Victoria, said he believed Pell knew more about sexual abuse than he let on.

The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that its member associations have until July 1 to complete the name change.
Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China but competes separately from the country in international sports, including at the Olympics.
Fewer than 20 of the 83 Hong Kong sports organizations listed on the Olympic Committee&#x27;s website have &quot;China&quot; in their names.
There is the Hong Kong China Swimming Association for example. However, Hong Kong&#x27;s football association currently has no reference to China in its name.

The Gare du Nord is a busy commuter hub which also serves as a departure point for trains to northern France, London and northern Europe.
Police were treating the stabbings as attempted murder, not as a terrorist attack, a source close to the case said.
The attacker&#x27;s motive was not immediately clear.
One of the six people was seriously wounded in the attack at 6:42 am (0542 GMT), while the other five sustained light injuries, prosecutors said.
The entire incident was over within two minutes, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters at the scene.
It was not immediately clear what type of weapon the attacker had used.

Archbishop Peter Comensoli, the Archbishop of Melbourne, said Pell had died from heart complications following hip surgery. An Australian appeals court ruling in 2020 quashed convictions that Pell sexually assaulted two choir boys in the 1990s. The ...</span>

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy stripped four political figures of their Ukrainian citizenship on Tuesday, including pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk who was transferred to Russia last year in a prisoner swap deal.
&quot;I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk,&quot; Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
&quot;If people&#x27;s deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate.&quot;
Medvedchuk, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, headed a banned pro-Russian party the &quot;Opposition Platform - For Life&quot; in Ukraine and was facing treason charges before being transferred to Moscow in September 2022.
Kozak and Kuzmin had been both elected to Ukraine&#x27;s parliament as members of Medvedchuk&#x27;s party.
The United States imposed sanctions on Kozak, the owner of three television channels, in January of 2022 for alleged spreading of Russian disinformation, after Kyiv sought his arrest on treason charges.
Ukraine has also charged Kuzmin with high treason.
Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker also sanctioned by Washington, was charged in the United States in December with money laundering and sanctions violations.
He had been accused of helping Russia interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2020.

                              <span>Thousands of &quot;hostile&quot; web attacks launched from Russian IP addresses have targeted an online auction of prints by British graffiti artist Banksy in aid of Ukraine, the charity Legacy of War Foundation said Tuesday.
The elusive street artist is selling 50 new limited edition screen-prints through the charity to raise funds to support Ukrainian civilians affected by conflict.
To get one of the £5,000 ($6,080) prints, which show a mouse sliding down the side of a box with &quot;FRAGILE&quot; printed on it, supporters have to register online with the charity.
But a message posted on its website said it had &quot;received over 1 million requests (and 3,500 hostile attacks from Russian IP addresses), so we would appreciate your patience at this time&quot;.
&quot;We are currently sifting through the registered entries and will notify successful applicants shortly,&quot; it added.
Banksy previously said he supported the charity as he had seen one of its teams &quot;sweep in and provide medical attention, heaters, fresh water and a friendly face to some very desperate people in a bombed-out building&quot;.
The artist confirmed he was behind seven murals that appeared on destroyed buildings around Kyiv last year.

                              <span>The French government presented its proposed pension reforms on Tuesday – measures President Emmanuel Macron has long argued are necessary to make the system affordable over the long term, an argument critics vociferously contest. FRANCE 24 spoke to several workers who do arduous jobs – and who are up in arms about the plans to take away the cherished right to retire at 62.
There’s been talk of Macron renewing his pensions reform for months – but everyone knows the broad outline. The centerpiece of the legislation will be raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, and increasing the number of years people must have worked to qualify for a full pension.
Macron became the first French president in a generation to lose a National Assembly majority in last year’s parliamentary elections. That m…</span>

PARIS (Reuters) -The French should work two years longer before they can retire, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said, detailing an unpopular reform of the pension system that risks strikes and will test President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s ability to deliver change.
The long-delayed overhaul pushes the retirement age to 64, a move opposed by four in every five citizens according to an Odoxa poll, at a time when many are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis.
&quot;I&#x27;m well aware that changing our pension system raises questions and fears among the French,&quot; Borne said on Tuesday, adding that her government would work on convincing the French that the reform was necessary.
&quot;We offer today a project to balance our pension system, a project that is fair,&quot; …</span>

Daniel Edmund Duggan was arrested in Australia late last year and now faces extradition to the United States, where he is accused of violating an arms embargo.
The 54-year-old was a highly-regarded jet pilot who spent 12 years in the US Marine Corps, reaching the rank of Major and working as a tactical flight instructor.
An indictment filed in 2016 -- but only unsealed in December last year -- alleged Duggan broke US arms control laws by providing &quot;defence services&quot; to &quot;Chinese foreign nationals&quot; after he left the military.

                              <span>French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo doubled down on its ridicule of Iran&#x27;s religious rulers on Tuesday, with fresh cartoons of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei despite protests from Iran and its allies.
&quot;The mullahs aren&#x27;t happy. The caricatures of their supreme leader... do not seem to have made them laugh,&quot; the paper&#x27;s editor, known as &quot;Riss&quot;, writes in the latest edition, which hits newsstands on Wednesday.
&quot;Laughing at themselves has never been a strong point of tyrants,&quot; he added.
The paper was hit by a cyber attack after publishing cartoons of Khamenei in last week&#x27;s special edition, which marked the anniversary of the 2015 attack on its Paris offices that left 12 dead.
&quot;A digital attack doesn&#x27;t leave anyone dead, but it sets the tone. The mullah&#x27;s regime feels in such danger that it considers it vital to its existence to hack the website of a French newspaper,&quot; Riss wrote.
&quot;It is an honour in one sense, but above all proves that they feel their power is very fragile.&quot;
There have been months of protests in Iran sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a woman arrested for allegedly violating the country&#x27;s strict dress code.
Iran issued an official warning to France over the &quot;insulting and indecent&quot; cartoons in last week&#x27;s Charlie Hebdo.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian movement in Lebanon, also condemned the cartoons, saying Khamenei was not just a ruler but &quot;a religious symbol for tens of millions of believers&quot;.</span>

Similar protests by Tesla owners have sprung up in cities including Henan, Wuxi and Hangzhou in recent days, according to owners and social media posts. Tesla has faced online backlash over previous price cuts in China before but nothing as widespread as the current spontaneous protests.
The groups protesting across China were in touch with each other and would continue to press Tesla to offer them some compensation, said Damon Yu, 29, who bought a Model Y in September.

                              <span>At least 11 people have died in storms across the Philippines in the past week, with more heavy rain expected in already sodden regions of the disaster-prone country, authorities said Tuesday.
Bad weather has plagued the country&#x27;s southern and central islands since the Christmas weekend when downpours triggered flooding and landslides that left 52 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Since January 3, back-to-back storms have killed 11 people as floodwaters swept through houses, cut roads and swamped crops, the civil defense office said.
The state weather forecaster warned Tuesday of &quot;serious flooding&quot; in low-lying areas and landslides in the mountains of the central island of Samar.
Heavy rain has already inundated villages, with water levels reaching three meters (10 feet) in some places.
So far, one person was missing and more than 2,200 people had been evacuated from their homes, said Josh Echano, Northern Samar provincial disaster officer.
The number of evacuees was expected to rise.
&quot;The flood is progressing since yesterday, it&#x27;s not subsiding,&quot; Echano said.
&quot;This could be fatal. This could be one of the worst (floods).&quot;
The Philippines is ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, and scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer.

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s attempt to become the first European nation to launch satellites into space ended in bitter disappointment early on Tuesday when Virgin Orbit said its rocket had suffered an anomaly that prevented it from reaching orbit.
The &quot;horizontal launch&quot; mission had left from the coastal town of Newquay in southwest England, with Virgin&#x27;s LauncherOne rocket carried under the wing of a modified Boeing 747 called &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;, and later released over the Atlantic Ocean.
&quot;We appear to have an anomaly that has prevented us from reaching orbit,&quot; the company said. &quot;We are evaluating the information.&quot;
The failure deals a further blow to European space ambitions after an Italian-built Vega-C rocket mission failed after lift-off from French Guiana in late December.

While some snow started to fall again early this week, Europe has seen &quot;extreme&quot; warm winter weather in recent days, experts say, with 2023 already posting record January temperatures across the region.
From Austria to France, Italy and Switzerland, slopes have melted away -- with temperatures too high even to make artificial snow.
Many lower-lying resorts have had to close, while others are offering reduced services.
&quot;In the last days it&#x27;s not been cold or wintery... so winter holidaymakers probably don&#x27;t really feel like skiing,&quot; Nazar Nydza, managing director of the Semmering Hirschenkogel Bergbahnen told AFP.

                              <span>A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit deep under the ocean off Indonesia and East Timor early Tuesday, injuring at least one person after rattling nearby islands, damaging homes and forcing residents to flee in panic.
The epicentre of the quake was 427 kilometres (265 miles) south of the Indonesian island of Ambon at a depth of 95 kilometres, the US Geological Survey reported.
Indonesia&#x27;s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said the tremor was felt on the eastern islands of Timor, the Maluku archipelago and Papua. It reported some aftershocks at a magnitude of 5.5.
&quot;I was in bed, then I felt a little shake. I woke up and found out that many of my friends felt it too,&quot; Hamdi, an Indonesian in Ambon, told AFP.

                              <span>A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would likely fail if the United States helps defend the island -- but at a debilitating cost to the American military itself, according to a US think tank Monday.
Military experts brought together by the Center for Strategic and International Studies to wargame the conflict said every likely direct participant in a war -- the United States, China, Taiwan and Japan -- would experience &quot;enormous&quot; losses.
Chinese missiles would likely destroy US air bases in Japan and as far as Guam, and sink two US aircraft carriers and between 10 and 20 destroyers and cruisers as the invasion opened.
But the Chinese invading force itself would be heavily destroyed before it ever occupied any significant part of Taiwan.
Ultimately it would be prevented from its goal of capturing …</span>
