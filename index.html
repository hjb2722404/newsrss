                              <span>Education Minister Jason Clare says he shares the anger, frustration and grief being experienced in the United States and across the world after the US Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v Wade ruling.

Protests have broken out across America after the US Supreme Court overturned the landmark ruling – ending the constitutional rights to abortion.

Mr Clare spoke to Sky News Australia about the issue. 

&quot;Thank God we are a country here in Australia where abortion is not an issue that divides the Labor Party and the Liberal Party,&quot; Mr Clare said. 

&quot;I&#x27;m thinking at the moment for women who live in some of those states that will be – they&#x27;re basically being told today that if you want to have an abortion then get on a bus and travel a couple of hundred kilometres.

&quot;I share the anger, frustration and the grief that people are experiencing and talking about in the United States and right across the world at the moment.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says there were more signs of the “slightest of moves” towards rapprochement between Australia and China last week. 

“The Chinese Ambassador to Australia gave an address in Sydney on Friday where he talked of bright prospects for future Australia-China cooperation,” Mr Clennell told Sky News Australia. 

“There does seem to be a degree of movement from both Australia and China in the relationship between the two governments, but that movement seems to be slow but steady, inch by inch. 

“And the Australian government is making it clear that for proper relations to return, the government would want or require the lifting of all sanctions which includes the ones in place on wine, barley and beef.”</span>

                              <span>Deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley says the decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn the historic Roe v Wade ruling on abortion rights is a “step backwards for women” in the United States. 

“I come back to two things on this topic. One is that education of young women, of rural and regional women and of women from all walks of life, is absolutely paramount and that starts obviously at school with good guidance,” Ms Ley told Sky News Australia. 

“But also, I agree with Bill Clinton, abortion should be safe, legal and rare,&quot; she said. 

“This has been a step backwards for women in the US. I feel discomforted by anything that puts a personal and sensitive issue that a woman has to grapple with in many instances – or a family has to grapple with – in the same sentence as criminal. 

“We should always approach these issues with sensitivity and respect.”</span>

                              <span>The Guardian: Norway on highest terror alert after two killed in mass shootings  
PST security service believes suspect is radicalised Islamist with history of mental illness and violence 
Norway’s security service has raised its terror alert to the highest level, saying it believes the suspect arrested after two people were killed in overnight shootings in Oslo is a radicalised Islamist with a history of mental illness. 
Norway’s PST intelligence service said on Saturday that the 42-year-old Norwegian national of Iranian origin had been known to security services since 2015. 
Roger Berg, the acting PST chief, told a news conference the terror alert was being raised from “moderate” to “extraordinary”. He said the attacks were “an extreme Islamist terror act” and that there was “an unresolved terrorist situation”.

                              <span>The Guardian: Ecuador at standstill after two weeks of protests over cost of living crisis  
During demonstrations, started by an Indigenous federation, roads were blocked and vehicles torched, and police fired teargas 
Ecuador has been brought to a near standstill after two weeks of tumultuous protests over a spike in fuel and food prices as global inflation inflames discontent over widening inequality across Latin America. 
At least five people have died after demonstrators blocked roads, torched vehicles and hurled stones, while police responded with teargas during several days of clashes. 
Ecuador’s health ministry has said two people died in ambulances delayed by road blockades. Twelve police officers are reported injured. 
Ecuador’s powerful Indigenous federation Conaie began the protests a fortnight ago setting out 10 demands amid the spiralling cost of living. Among them are a freeze on fuel prices, a moratorium on bank debts, subsidies for fertiliser and no mining in Indigenous territories.

Europeans are sending weapons to Ukraine and are angry that Serbia “is not in their shoes,” President Aleksandar Vucic claims 
Many EU states are in “a direct war” with Russia and are “angry” with Belgrade for refusing to go along with sanctions, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Saturday. 
Speaking at a press conference two days after attending a meeting between the 27 EU leaders and six heads of government from the West Balkans, Vucic claimed the Balkans “were not important that day” for the EU, as the bloc is “completely at war with Russia” and its priority was to provide Ukraine and Moldova with EU candidate status.

Warzone/The Drive: Construction Of Airbase On Tinian Island In Case Guam Gets Knocked Out Has Begun 
The alternate airbase facilities now under construction on Tinian would offer an alternative to Andersen Air Force Base if Guam gets attacked. 
Satellite imagery shows major construction at Tinian International Airport that we can say with near certainty is linked directly to plans to expand the facility&#x27;s ability to act as a divert airfield for the U.S. military in a crisis. More than a decade in the making, the project is intended to provide a vital alternative operating location to the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s massive Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam, just to the southwest of Tinian, should that base be put out of action for any reason. Concerns about Andersen&#x27;s vulnerability, specifically to a Chinese missile barrage, during the opening stages of potential future conflict in the region have been growing in recent years, something highlighted in The War Zone&#x27;s previous reporting on this proposed airfield expansion effort.

RTE/AFP: Charity warns global food crisis &#x27;will kill millions&#x27; 
The global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine will kill millions by leaving the hungriest more vulnerable to infectious diseases, potentially triggering the world&#x27;s next health catastrophe, the head of a major aid organisation has warned. 
A Russian naval blockade of Ukraine&#x27;s Black Sea ports has stopped grain shipments from the world&#x27;s fourth-largest exporter of wheat and corn, raising the spectre of shortages and hunger in low-income countries. 
The knock-on effects of the food shortages mean many will die not only of starvation but from having weaker defences against infectious diseases due to bad nutrition, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said.

                              <span>Lawrence Person&#x27;s BattleSwarm Blog: Sri Lanka Is Screwed 
Remember how Sri Lanka managed to wreck agricultural yield by forcing the country to use organic fertilizer? “Not only had Sri Lanka’s ban on fertilizers, pesticides, weedicides, and fungicides resulted in massive food shortages, it also led to the doubling in price of rice, vegetables, and other market staples.” 
Turns out that was just the tip of the iceberg. 
Sri Lanka’s prime minister is increasing efforts to revive the country’s “completely collapsed” economy amid a lack of foreign exchange reserves and severe shortages of essential items.           
“We are now facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel, gas, electricity, and food. Our economy has faced a complete collapse,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament on June 22. 
“It is no easy task to revive a country with a completely collapsed economy, especially one that is dangerously low on foreign reserves,” he said. This video goes into more depth of just how badly Sri Lanka is screwed.

 CNN: Japan says Chinese coast guard ships in longest violation of its territorial waters in a decade 
Tokyo CNN  — Two Chinese coast guard ships navigated Japan’s territorial waters near a chain of disputed islands for more than 64 hours this week, Japanese authorities said Friday – the longest incursion of its kind in a decade.
Japan’s coast guard said Friday the Chinese vessels entered Japanese waters in the East China Sea during the early hours of Tuesday and remained to surveil a Japanese fishing boat that was operating in the area, before exiting Thursday evening. 

At one point on Thursday, one of the Chinese vessels came within 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) of the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, known in China as the Diaoyu Islands, well past the internationally recognized 12-mile (19.3 kilometer) limit that defines a country’s territorial waters, according to the coast guard.

Breaking Defense:  US-made jets, air defense on Ukrainian fighter pilots’ wishlist, but not Gray Eagle 
 &quot;I&#x27;d say that the ground-based air defense was the key in this war, and it&#x27;s still the key [moving forward],” said a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter squadron commander who goes by the callsign “Moonfish.” 
WASHINGTON: Ukrainian fighter pilots expect to speak to US government officials to make the case for the top two technologies needed to repel Russia’s air force: additional ground-based air defense systems and Western fighter jets. 
What’s not on the list of priorities? 
The MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone, which has been the focus of recent arms sale negotiations but is, according to the airmen, too big of a target for Russian forces.

CNN: US conducts Taiwan Strait flyover amid tensions with China 
A US Navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance plane flew over the Taiwan Strait on Friday in a demonstration of the United States’ “commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” just days after 29 Chinese warplanes entered Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone, US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement. 
“A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace on June 24. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows including within the Taiwan Strait. By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and freedoms of all nations. The aircraft’s transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the statement read.

Politico: Biden&#x27;s pick for NATO chief confirmed 
Gen. Christopher Cavoli currently commands U.S. Army forces in Europe and will succeed Gen. Tod Wolters as the head of U.S. European Command and NATO supreme allied commander. 
The Senate has signed off on President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead U.S. forces in Europe and be NATO’s top commander. 
Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli was confirmed Thursday evening as the U.S. and European allies work to help Ukraine blunt Russia’s offensive and NATO looks to expand to include Sweden and Finland in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion. 
 Cavoli, who now commands U.S. Army forces on the continent, will succeed Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters as the head of U.S. European Command and NATO supreme allied commander. Cavoli will assume command in a change of command ceremony on July 1. 
He takes the reins as Russian forces slowly begin to gain ground in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.

                              <span>There is a real risk that multiple famines will be declared this year - and 2023 could be even worse.
We need strong political and private sector leadership for a coordinated multilateral response.
We cannot accept mass hunger and starvation in the 21st century.
— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) June 24, 2022
   Reuters: World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis, U.N. chief says 
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - There is a &quot;real risk&quot; of multiple famines this year, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday and urged ministers meeting on food security to take practical steps to stabilize food markets and reduce commodity price volatility. 
&quot;We face an unprecedented global hunger crisis,&quot; Guterres told the meeting in Berlin via video. &quot;The war in Ukraine has compounded problems that have been brewing for years: climate disruption; the COVID-19 pandemic; the deeply unequal recovery.&quot; 
More than 460,000 people in Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan are in famine conditions under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a scale used by U.N. agencies, regional bodies and aid groups to determine food insecurity. This is the step before a declaration of famine in a region.

                              <span>Casey Michel, The Atlantic: Decolonize Russia  
To avoid more senseless bloodshed, the Kremlin must lose what empire it still retains. 
The former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski once said that without Ukraine, Russia would cease to be an empire. It’s a pithy statement, but it’s not true. Even if Vladimir Putin fails to wrest back Ukraine, his country will remain a haphazard amalgamation of regions and nations with hugely varied histories, cultures, and languages. The Kremlin will continue ruling over colonial holdings in places including Chechnya, Tatarstan, Siberia, and the Arctic. 
Russia’s history is one of almost ceaseless expansion and colonization, and Russia is the last European empire that has resisted even basic decolonization efforts, such as granting subject populations autonomy and a meaningful voice in choosing the country’s leaders. And as we’ve seen in Ukraine, Russia is willing to resort to war to reconquer regions it views as its rightful possessions.

* European leaders are growing increasingly concerned about the possibility of a full shutdown of gas supplies from Russia. 
* Europe — which receives roughly 40% of its gas via Russian pipelines — is trying to rapidly reduce its reliance on Russian hydrocarbons. 
* When asked if he was concerned that Russia could fully cut gas supplies, Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told CNBC: “I’m fully aware that they can ... It’s their choice.”

Wade made abortion legal. Abortion-rights activists are protesting in the streets of U.S. cities, while anti-abortion demonstrators are celebrating the court’s decision.

                              <span>Behold Mr. Happy Face, crowned the world&#x27;s ugliest dog at a contest in Petaluma, California
Petaluma (United States) (AFP) - With a tuft of punk-style hair and a tongue sticking perennially out the side of his mouth, a dog named Mr Happy Face has been crowned the world&#x27;s homeliest pooch.
This 17-year-old Chinese crested defeated nine competitors Friday in the World&#x27;s Ugliest Dog Contest, a decades-old event held annually in Petaluma, California.
The champ was adopted as a rescue last year by a 41-year-old Arizona musician, Jeneda Benally.
&quot;During the pandemic, I had hoped to either have a baby or adopt a dog. Since having a baby would have been an act of God, I opted to adopt a dog,&quot; Benally said as she introduced this one at the contest.
At the shelter she said she was told about an older dog with health problems, a creature that &quot;could be inbred because he was so ugly.&quot;
&quot;The shelter staff tried to prepare me for what I was about to see. I saw a creature who was indeed old, needed a second chance and deserved to be loved,&quot; said the proud owner.
She said Mr. Happy Face had previously lived with a person who hoarded and conditions were abominable. &quot;He was a survivor of abuse and neglect,&quot; she said.
Vets said that with his poor health the dog might only live a few weeks.
&quot;Love, kindness and mommy kisses have helped him defy the anticipated short life that we all expected him to have with our family,&quot; Benally added.
&quot;His hobbies include sleeping, snoring, woofing in his sleep and making odd sounds when he is happy.&quot;
Contest organizers say this of the contest itself: &quot;Dogs of all breeds and sizes have warmed our hearts and filled our lives with unconditional love. This world-renowned event celebrates the imperfections that make all dogs special and unique.&quot;</span>

PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Saturday she is backing a parliamentary bill to add abortion rights to the country&#x27;s constitution.
The move comes after the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decision on Friday to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling which recognized a woman&#x27;s constitutional right to an abortion and legalized it nationwide.
&quot;For all women, for human rights, we must engrave this acquired right in stone,&quot; Borne wrote on Twitter. &quot;The Parliament must be able to rally very strongly around this bill.&quot;
Her comment came a day after French President Emmanuel Macron said abortion was a &quot;fundamental right for all women.&quot;

(Reuters) - Anti-abortion activists should be concerned with other issues that can threaten life, such as easy access to guns, poverty and rising maternity mortality rates, the Vatican&#x27;s editorial director said on Saturday.
In a media editorial on the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling to end the constitutional right to abortion, Andrea Tornielli said those who oppose abortion could not pick and choose pro-life issues.
&quot;Being for life, always, for example, means being concerned if the mortality rates of women due to motherhood increase,&quot; he wrote.
He cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a rise in maternity mortality rates overall and that the rate was nearly three times higher for black women.

RABAT/MADRID (Reuters) -Dozens of migrants were pictured lying by a Moroccan border fence, some bleeding and many apparently lifeless, in video showing the aftermath of an attempted mass crossing into a Spanish enclave on Friday in which at least 18 died.
Moroccan authorities said the disaster occurred after migrants attempted to breach a fence into the Melilla enclave, with some dying in a crush after what authorities called a stampede, and others falling as they climbed.
The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) local head Omar Naji said its members and sympathisers had shot the footage, which showed large numbers of badly injured people piled together with Moroccan security forces standing over them.
He said migrants had lain injured for hour…</span>

Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon Magnus and Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre visited the site of a shooting in Oslo that targeted a gay bar, leaving two people dead and 21 others injured.
They placed a bouquet of flowers at the popular London Pub, which bills itself as Oslo&#x27;s &quot;gay headquarters since 1979,&quot; as a crowd of people looked on.
Crown Princess Mette-Marit and several members of the Norwegian government were also on hand for the visit. The chimes of city hall, meanwhile, played &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&quot;
Norway&#x27;s PST intelligence service described the shooting as an Islamist terrorist attack. The suspect - a 42-year-old Norwegian with Iranian roots - is in police custody.

After the deadly shootings in Oslo, the Norwegian secret service has raised the terror alert level to the highest level.
The danger of a terrorist threat is assessed from three to five and thus to &quot;exceptionally&quot; high, the Norwegian secret service PST announced at a press conference on Saturday, as reported by the broadcaster NRK.
A suspected lone gunman shot dead two people in the centre of the Norwegian capital on Saturday night. At least 21 others were injured, 10 of them seriously, by gunshots in and around a well-known bar on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) scene, according to police.
Investigations into suspected terrorism are ongoing. Hate crime is strongly suspected, police said in the morning. The attacker is said to be a Norwegian with Iranian roots. The suspect had already been arrested during the night.

Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko issued a demand for clarification after a slew of deep fake videos fooled mayors in European capitals into thinking they were talking with him.
&quot;This is criminal energy. It must be urgently investigated who is behind it,&quot; Klitschko said in a video shared by the Bild newspaper on Saturday.
&quot;Several mayors in Europe have been contacted by a fake Klitschko who has said absurd things,&quot; Klitschko said, adding that official talks would only be organized through official channels in Kiev.
He also never needs a translator for talks in German or English, he added.

Rapper Maykel Castillo, 39, better known as Osorbo, was sentenced to nine years, while 34-year-old performance artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara was given five years in prison, the attorney general&#x27;s office said on Friday.
Alcantara, leader of the San Isidro (MSI) free speech protest movement, was found guilty of &quot;offending the symbols of the homeland, contempt and public disorder,&quot; and Castillo of contempt and assault, it said.

Authorities have issued extreme weather warnings in multiple regions, while experts warned that these phenomena were more evidence of the impact of climate change.
How bad are the floods?
Summer floods are common in China, especially in the low-lying Pearl River delta region in the south.
This year, however, the National Climate Center forecast that flooding will be &quot;relatively worse&quot; and &quot;more extreme&quot; than before.

The four-month-old survived bombardments that killed around a third of animals on the meat and dairy facility in Mala Rogan, a village around 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Ukraine&#x27;s second city Kharkiv.
It was a &quot;nightmare&quot; recalls owner Lyubov Zlobina, 62, who says she is &quot;haunted by the howls of cows burned alive&quot; during the attacks on March 26.

The number of crashes and near-misses involving the two-wheelers has prompted Rome authorities to impose some order on a booming rental market that began two years ago.
The havoc came to a head earlier this month when two US tourists attempted a night-time drive down the Spanish Steps, causing over 25,000 euros ($26,300) worth of damage to the 18th century monument.
Caught on security footage, the couple in their late 20s were fined 400 euros each.
For now, it&#x27;s remarkably easy -- requiring just a cell phone app -- to hire one of the 14,500 scooters currently available in Rome, provided by seven licensed com…</span>

                              <span>A gunman went on a terrifying rampage in a gay bar and surrounding streets in Oslo on Saturday, killing two people and seriously injuring 10 on the day the city&#x27;s LGBTQ community was due to celebrate its annual Pride parade.
The victims were shot inside and outside the London Pub, a well-known gay bar and nightclub open since 1979, as well as at one other bar in the centre of the Norwegian capital. &quot;I saw a man arrive with a bag, he picked up a gun and started to shoot,&quot; said journalist Olav Roenneberg of public broadcaster NRK, who was in the area. &quot;Then I saw the windows breaking and understood that I had to take cover.&quot;
A suspect, a 42-year-old Norwegian citizen of Iranian origin, was detained minutes after, according to police who said they believed he acted alone. Two weapons, including a fully automatic gun, were retrieved from the crime scene, they added.
&quot;There is reason to think that this may be a hate crime,&quot; officers told a news conference. &quot;We are investigating whether the Pride was a target in itself or whether there are other motives.&quot; Oslo police spokesman Rune Hekkelstrand told Reuters the attack was also being investigated as a possible act of terrorism.
Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere decried the shootings as a &quot;terrible and deeply shocking attack on innocent people&quot;. The suspect was known to authorities, including for violence of a less severe nature, police said.
The shooting happened in the early hours of Saturday, and just months after Norway marked 50 years since the abolition of a law that criminalised gay sex. Eleven people also suffered minor injuries, police said.
Organisers of Oslo Pride cancelled Saturday&#x27;s parade, citing police advice. &quot;We will soon be proud and visible again, but today we will mark Pride celebrations at home,&quot; they said. Norway, a country of 5.4 million, has lower crime rates than many other Western nations, though it has experienced hate-motivated shootings, including when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011.

                              <span>The US Supreme Court&#x27;s historic end to nationwide abortion rights on Friday drew unusual criticism from some of America&#x27;s closest allies and bucks a global trend to more liberal reproductive rights.
The decision came one day after the Supreme Court also struck down some of the modest restrictions on guns -- an issue that, along with the US embrace of the death penalty, has long shocked other Western nations.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- a Conservative who worked closely with former president Donald Trump, whose judicial nominations paved the way for Friday&#x27;s decision -- said the Supreme Court decision will have &quot;massive impacts&quot; worldwide.

                              <span>A US navy destroyer sunk during World War II has been found nearly 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) below sea level off the Philippines, making it the world&#x27;s deepest shipwreck ever located, an American exploration team said.
The USS Samuel B Roberts went down during a battle off the central island of Samar on October 25, 1944 as US forces fought to liberate the Philippines -- then a US colony -- from Japanese occupation.
A crewed submersible filmed, photographed and surveyed the battered hull of the &quot;Sammy B&quot; during a series of dives over eight days this month, Texas-based undersea technology company Caladan Oceanic said.
Images showed the ship&#x27;s three-tube torpedo launcher and gun mount.
&quot;Resting at 6,895 meters, it is now the deepest shipwreck ever located and surveyed,&quot; tweeted Caladan Oceanic founder Victor Vescovo, who piloted the submersible.
&quot;This small ship took on the finest of the Japanese Navy, fighting them to the end,&quot; he said.
According to US Navy records, Sammy B&#x27;s crew &quot;floated for nearly three days awaiting rescue, with many survivors perishing from wounds and shark attacks&quot;. Of the 224 crew, 89 died.
The battle was part of the larger Battle of Leyte, which saw intense fighting over several days between US and Japanese forces.
Sammy B was one of four US ships sunk in the October 25 engagement.
The USS Johnston, which at nearly 6,500 meters was previously the world&#x27;s deepest shipwreck identified, was reached by Vescovo&#x27;s team in 2021.
In the latest search, the team also looked for the USS Gambier Bay at more than 7,000 meters below sea level, but was unable to locate it.
It did not search for the USS Hoel due to the lack of reliable data showing where it may have gone down.
The wreck of the Titanic lies in about 4,000 meters of water.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces have been ordered to withdraw from the key battleground city of Sievierodonetsk after weeks of fierce street fighting, in order to limit more casualties and regroup, but the move will be seen by Russia as a significant victory.
Ukraine officials said there was very little left to defend in the bombed-out eastern city, where hundreds of civilians remain trapped in a chemical plant.
The order to withdraw on Friday came four months to the day since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops over the border, unleashing a conflict that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and reduced whole cities to rubble.

And on Thursday he invalid a New York State gun safety law restricting the public carrying of firearms.  The result in these cases was not surprising.  The court ruled in favor of the religious litigants in a overwhelming number cases, and the outcome of the gun case was disengage oral argument before the judges in November.
What is surprising is how the 6-3 decision in the Maine case, Carson v. Makin, will practically matter.  And the reason offers a glimpse of hope for those worried about a future dominated by the court’s conservative supermajority — including the many Americans troubled by the court’s decision in the gun case, …</span>

                              <span>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler is in talks with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officials on a “memorandum of understanding” on digital asset regulation.  Together, the agencies can ensure market integrity, Gensler told the Financial Times in an interview published Thursday.  “I’m talking about a rule book on the exchange that protects all trades, regardless of the pair – [be it] security token for security token, security token for commodity token, commodity token for commodity token,” Gensler told the newspaper. 
Gensler’s desire to be collaborative comes as a variety of legislative initiatives have been introduced to create a more comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets.  The Digital Goods Exchange Act, introduced in its latest form in Apriland the law on responsible financial innovation, presented in Juneboth gave the CFTC greater market authority. 
Debbie Stabenow, chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, and senior committee member John Boozman are would have is also drafting a crypto regulation bill, which is expected to expand the powers of the CFTC.  Gensler, who led the CFTC from 2009 to 2013, said expressed skepticism about changes to the status quo.
The SEC has so far taken the lead in crypto regulation, but frequently to the displeasure of industry and lawmakerswho criticize his methods of supposedly regulate by application.  Crypto Industry Leaders have explicitly asked for clearer regulationsand SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce pressed for policy changes in the commission.

Regulation is not just a matter of authority.  The Financial Times quotes blockchain analytics firm Elliptic as saying US regulators have raised $3.35 billion through enforcement actions in the crypto industry over the years, more than 70% of this sum being donated to the SEC.

Mr Jordan said “red states” would be more restrictive on abortion because “that’s the consensus of the people that live there”.

“Just like the different states, different laws in many different ways reflect the values of those estates,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

The peak body for swimming FINA made a historic decision to effectively ban most transgender women from participating in female competitions. 

Ms Seebohm said she is supportive of the open category being suggested into the swimming completion. 

“I’m happy that there’s finally been a decision made,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“We can all move on – like, we can all just go back to the sport that we love and enjoying it … it’s going to be a fair level playing field.”</span>

                              <span>A huge number of protesters are marching in North Carolina following the “contentious” US Supreme Court decision, says Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen.

Protesters have started across the US, in response to the landmark case of Roe v Wade being overturned by the US Supreme Court. 

Ms Nielsen said up to ten US states are uncertain to enact bans on abortion.

“This is a hugely divisive issue in America,” she told Sky News Australia.  

“There is a huge groundswell of support for the pro-choice movement, as we’ve seen, as with the pro-life movement – which is why this has gotten so contentious.”</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]    Waves of immigration have been seen again recently from politically and economically less stable and prosperous regions to those so-called Western democratised and industrialised countries. Rapid changes in the geopolitical terrain, along with a drastic transformation in the appeal of the defining elements of democracy and prosperity in the past decade, has made immigration to Western countries less attractive nowadays, but some still hold a perception of Western liberalism as the ultimate goal of immigration.  Regardless of what reasons a person has for deciding to immigrate, some basic challenges presented by the process of immigration and integration into Western host societies include barriers of language, culture, ethnicity, education, recognition of credentials and professional experience, and employment. This does not mean the development and upward mobility of immigrants and their offspring  are hamstrung for good, but empirical research has generally shown that different life trajectories for immigrants and their offspring in Western host societies emerge in the process of assimilation. Some immigrants successfully move to a better-off class—termed the white Protestant middle-class in America by scholars—while many remain in the labouring classes or even urban underclasses, leading a life of poverty and marginalisation.  The picture will be more complicated for the offspring of immigrants. This is because immigrant parents need to overcome the invisible obstacles of intricate educational and social systems to help their children succeed academically and obtain a prestigious college degree as a credential for upward mobility, consonant with what Portes, Fernandez-Kelly, and Haller (2009) mentioned: “(w)ithout the costly and time-consuming achievement of a university degree, such dreams are likely to remain beyond reach” (p. 1081). Specifically, recent research on immigration authored by Dr Jerf YEUNG Wai-keung, Associate Professor of CityU’s Department of Social and…</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]  The past few years have seen huge growth in mobile fitness apps globally. Expecting increased revenue to be generated from this category, app designers strive to add features to enhance the user experience and motivate better performance.   Dr HUANG Guanxiong, Dr Crystal JIANG Li, and doctoral student SUN Mengru from CityU’s Department of Media and Communication surveyed 643 WeRun users to examine the effects of social networking functions of fitness apps on users’ participation in physical activity. WeRun is a fitness plugin embedded in the most widely used mobile social networking app WeChat in China and has accumulated more than 100 million active users. Similar to other fitness apps, WeRun tracks users’ daily step counts and ranks them among WeRun friends. Users can also “like” their friends’ step counts, and the app will notify the users about the “likes” received.   The study focused on the ranking and “liking” functions and linked them to social comparison and social support mechanisms. The survey found that checking WeRun rankings and following more friends on WeRun were positively correlated with participation in physical activity. The social comparison mechanism appeared more dominant than the social support mechanism. Specifically, upward comparison (comparing oneself with those who are more competent in a particular task) was positively associated, and downward comparison (comparing oneself to those who are less competent) was negatively related to physical activity participation.   The more frequently users checked the rankings, the more friends they followed on WeRun and the more upward comparison, leading to more participation in physical activity.    The study has several implications for motivating physical activity and promoting fitness apps. Fitness app design can benefit from sending more notifications to encourage users to compare their behaviour more often. The design can leverage the positive effects of upward comparison by sending messages like “You are…</span>

But is that really the case? To investigate this question, research authored by Dr Jun ZHANG, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Asian and International Studies, takes as entry point technological nationalism among middle-class professionals in urban China in the context of the Sino-American trade war of recent years.   Nationalism is a form of identity that is built on—as Benedict Anderson famously argues—an imagined community within a bounded territory. Unlike much existing research, this work does not see ICTs as merely the medium through which nationalism is expressed. Instead, it looks into how ICTs are entangled in people’s everyday lives and how such entanglement shapes “socio-technical imaginaries” of their relationship with their country. Experts may understand ICTs through theories, algorithms and experiments. But when many ordinary people talk about ICTs, they are actually talking about things such as smartphones, and daily practices such as ordering food and hailing a car through online platforms—a way of life that can be called a “platformised lifestyle”.  This research draws on over a decade’s conversations with middle-class professionals and observation of their lifestyles in the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta. It is found that these middle-class professionals are proud of their platformised lifestyle with its unique socio-technological features, high-end smartphones made by Chinese companies, and development in ICTs by tech companies such as Huawei—seemingly advanced enough to alert the American government and thereby leading to Huawei being sanctioned. For many professionals, these achievements suggest that China is moving beyond its sweatshop factory reputation and becoming a rising power in technology. This matters a lot to these professionals.

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]  In contemporary US politics, the Democratic Party is often regarded as the most welcoming to racial minority groups. Even so, each election cycle sees many members of these groups cast their vote for the Republican Party. In 2016, for example, Chinese Americans from the East Coast to Silicon Valley organised rallies for Republican candidates. Even though former President of the US, Donald Trump consistently used anti-Asian rhetoric throughout the pandemic, he received an even higher share of votes from Asian Americans in 2020 than in 2016. Why do some Asian Americans support a seemingly anti-minority party?   Although existing research underscores the importance of majority-minority relations to voting behaviour, work done by Dr LIU Dongshu, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Public Policy, and other researchers, proposes a new “minority-minority” perspective. He argues that some Asian Americans feel victimised by pro-minority policies promoted by the Democratic Party as they perceive those policies to only help African Americans and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans. This perceived competition results in Asian Americans supporting the Republican Party, whose policies they perceive to, at least, undermine their competitors from other minority groups. In short, we argue that Asian Americans support the seemingly anti-minority Republicans because they feel more threat from other minority groups.  To assess this, the research team relied on two representative surveys of Asian Americans from 2012 and 2016, along with an experiment Liu and his team conducted in 2018. The surveys find that Asian Americans who perceive themselves to have less in common politically with African and Latino Americans are more likely to support the Republican Party. Experimentally, the team uses affirmative action in university admissions, which many Asian Americans believe to disproportionately favour African and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans, to show that Asian…</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]   As one of the most perceptive authors of Chinese contemporary literature, Eileen Chang’s fictional writings are best known for her acute observation of all walks of life and the rich tapestry of human relationships in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the 1940s and 50s. Although it has already been 27 years since Chang’s death, her works are still loved by readers of different generations, and provide evergreen inspiration for numerous screen adaptations, such as Ang LEE’s Lust, Caution and Ann HUI’s latest film Love After Love.   To give secondary school students multiple perspectives to understand Chang’s work and her writing style, CityU’s Department of Chinese and History (CAH) organised three events based on her literary works for secondary school students and teachers, to enhance students’ writing skills, and share relevant teaching techniques with other Chinese subject teachers.  Eileen Chang’s Literary Work in Film  Several of Chang’s novels have been made into plays and films in recent decades. The latest adaptation was Love After Love, a movie adapted from Chang’s Agarwood Incense: The First Censer, which was also award-winning director Ann Hui’s third adaptation of Chang’s work. The first event of the series, held on 5 March 2022, originally planned to show Love after Love to students on a large screen in the assembly hall of a secondary school. However, this had to be taken online due to the outbreak of the pandemic’s fifth wave. In spite of that, the event still attracted 256 participants from over 30 secondary schools. Secondary school teacher and juvenile fiction series writer YAN Pui-kei hosted the event and guided students to compare the text with the adaptation. Two teachers from local secondary schools were also invited to discuss Chang’s works in greater depth with students.    Mastering Techniques of Novel-writing  The characters in Chang’s works have well-defined personalities. The change of psychology in the protagonists was vividly captured using trivial…</span>

    Defence View: Two French CAESAR howitzer have been captured by the Russian military 
A French journalist announced the capture of the Caesar self-propelled guns transferred to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
The French self-propelled 155 mm CAESAR artillery units, handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine only a few weeks ago, have already been captured by the Russian military. With such information, the French journalist, lawyer and politician Régis de Castelnau noted that due to the oversight of the Ukrainian military, the Armed Forces of Ukraine not only lost two Caesar self-propelled artillery mounts, but the latter were captured by the Russian military, who had already sent NATO weapons for study.

WNU Editor: Russian media is saying that these captured French self-propelled 155 mm CAESAR artillery units were actually sold to them by Ukrainian soldiers. A Russian arms manufacturer that is studying these captured artillery pieces is not impressed with its capabilities. They are also mocking the French President  .... Russian arms maker mocks France&#x27;s Macron (RT).
I am the first to admit that this could be a Russian disinformation effort.  But the thing is that this story is plausible when it comes to a place like Ukraine.</span>

Newsweek: Kremlin Official Sees NATO Preparing for War With Russia 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday said he believes NATO and the European Union (EU) are building a coalition that could eventually wage war with Russia. 
Russia state media outlets reported Lavrov made the comments while speaking at a news conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, following a meeting with Jeyhun Bayramov, Azerbaijan&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs. 
During the conference with reporters, Lavrov discussed the EU&#x27;s Thursday decision to grant candidacy status to Ukraine and Moldova. The move by the EU, which is the first step in the process to full membership, was seen as sign of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. (Both Ukraine and Moldova applied to join the union soon after Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in late February.)

                              <span>Politico:  Zelenskyy wants to replace Ukraine’s top spy after security failures 
Ivan Bakanov was tapped to revamp the controversial Security Service of Ukraine. But after a string of failures and the loss of Kherson, he’s fallen out of favor with the Ukrainian president. 
KYIV — You think you know someone, and then Russia invades your country and your childhood friend turned top intelligence official flubs it and some of his senior spies flee their posts, apparently helping the Kremlin’s forces avoid landmines and direct its attack aircraft to blast your cities. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy isn’t getting a lot of sleep these days, and the man he appointed to lead Ukraine’s domestic intelligence and security agency can’t be helping matters. 
Ivan Bakanov — his friend from way back who once ran his entertainment company and then his presidential campaign — is on thin ice in Kyiv. 
Zelenskyy is looking to replace Bakanov, who now runs Ukraine’s spy agency, with someone more suitable to serve as the wartime chief of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), according to four officials close to the president and a Western diplomat who has advised Kyiv on reforms needed to revamp the SBU.

The package, which will be drawn from existing Defense Department stocks, also includes 18 patrol boats for monitoring coasts and rivers, and small arms. 
The most significant part of the package is the four additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, wheeled vehicles capable of launching barrages of guided rockets at targets up to approximately 40 miles away.

Paul Poast, Washington Post: The war in Ukraine is on track to be among modern history’s bloodiest 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is entering its fifth month, and there is no end in sight. The grueling conflict has shifted to the eastern provinces, where Russian progress in the Luhansk region has been described as “plodding.” Still, military experts predict that the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk may fall. At the same time, the Ukrainians — increasingly well-equipped, courtesy of the West — talk boldly of reclaiming the southern city of Kherson, which the Russians took early in the conflict. 
American attention has drifted somewhat from the war to domestic concerns, which makes it easy to overlook that what’s unfolding in Ukraine is one of the deadlier conflicts of the past 200 years. That it is a “mere” proxy war, rather than a clash between two great powers, also tends to obscure its scale. But the rate at which soldiers are dying is already significantly higher than in the typical war of the modern era — and both sides are digging in, meaning it will steadily climb the list of conflicts that have caused the most overall fatalities.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukrainian troops may need to pull back from the key frontline city of Lysychansk to avoid being encircled after Russian forces captured two villages to its south, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Thursday. 
The retreat of Ukrainian troops from Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, the last two Ukrainian-held cities in Luhansk, would bring Moscow closer to one of its key war aims of capturing all of that region. 
Divided by a river, the cities have become a key battleground in Russia&#x27;s assault on the industrial heartland of Donbas and the fighting is nearing a &quot;fierce climax,&quot; a top official said on Wednesday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s global ratings have sunk to 20-year lows as the Russia invasion of Ukraines enters its fourth month, according to a Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday. 
A median of 9% of respondents in 18 countries said they have confidence in Putin “to do the right thing regarding world affairs,” Pew said. 
That compares with 18% confidence in Chinese leader Xi Jinping and 60% for U.S. President Joe Biden and 59% German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 
Putin&#x27;s worldwide approval has been on a downward trend during his two decades in power.

Ukrainian guerrillas claimed on Friday they killed a Kremlin-backed politician in the Russian-held southern region of Kherson, the latest in a series of attacks aimed at destabilizing the occupation authorities.
Dmitry Savluchenko, the head of the region’s Youth and Sports Department, exploded in his car, Ukrainian and Russian officials said, in what appeared to be part of a growing insurgency fueled by public anger over deteriorating economic, security and humanitarian conditions as Moscow pushes to Russify the region.
Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-appointed administration, called the attack “a despicable act of terrorism”.

As a black woman who rejects the imposition of the “strong black woman” myth in my life, this sentence is one that has always struck me as an unjust demand that we endure serious harm.  Death, in this framework, is indirectly disentangled from the processes of progressive exhaustion of a person.  There’s an immediacy that underlies the cliché saying that if something doesn’t kill you then, then persevering makes you better.  There’s no room for contempt or anger at the thing that didn’t explicitly kill you because you’re now better off for resisting it.

                              <span>“Giannis: The Unlikely Rise of an NBA MVP,” Biography of Mirin Fader by Giannis Antetokounmpo, portrays the Greek-born basketball superstar as a young man of gentle innocence and irrepressible enthusiasm.  Immigrating to the United States to play professional football for the Milwaukee Bucks, where he was the 15th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, he sees everything through eyes of innocent wonder: he’s dazzled by cream chocolate bars and hot dogs, by peanut butter bars and mixed berry smoothies.
Even American jargon fascinated him.  “The day he learned the phrase ‘Yo mama’,” Fader writes, “he ran into the locker room yelling, ‘Yo mama! Hi mom! Hi mom!&#x27;”


That boyish charm, as much as his generational talent, is what endeared Giannis to legions of NBA fans, many of whom don’t support th…</span>

The search gave Canadian-born Galt MacDermot a most unlikely choice: he was slightly older than his colleagues and a straight arrow with an eclectic musical background but little Broadway experience.  Mr. MacDermot wrote the melody for the versions of “Aquarius” and several other songs, on request, in less than 36 hours.  It immediately became clear that he was the perfect choice to set the lyrical ruminations of Mr. Rado and Mr. Ragni to rock show music.
A demo soon followed in Mr. Papp’s office, with Mr. MacDermot singing along and playing the trio’s new songs.  Impressed, Mr. Papp announced that he would …</span>

But the strategy, which was adopted by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and combines direct sales with a limited number of stores and service centers, appears to prove naysayers wrong.  The company dominates the growing electric car market, even as other manufacturers struggle to sell cars due to a shortage of computer chips.
Tesla’s approach, which has been copied by other young electric car makers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, could eventually have major ramifications for the auto industry.  Most automakers and car dealerships are making big profits right now, as the shortage of new cars ha…</span>

Germany warned residents and businesses on Thursday that the country is going through a natural gas crisis that could worsen in the coming months.
“The situation is serious and winter will come,” Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, told reporters at a press conference in Berlin.  He said the government had triggered the second stage of its three-stage energy gas plan;  the next step would allow the government to begin gas rationing.
“Even if you don’t feel it yet: we are in a gas crisis,” he said.  “Gas is now a rare commodity.  Prices are already high and we must be prepared for further increases.  It will affect industrial production and become a big burden for many consumers.

                              <span>Recession fears are rise in power as the Federal Reserve embarks on an aggressive campaign to raise interest rates, and politicians and members of the public increasingly question why central bankers plan to cause trouble for the economy.
The short answer is: it’s the tool the Fed has to control inflation.
The central bank is trying to force the rise in prices to slow down.  It does this by raising interest rates, which makes mortgages, auto loans, and business loans more expensive.  As silver becomes more expensive, it weighs on spending and hiring, weakening the job market and the economy in general, perhaps in particular.  Slower growth will give supply a chance to catch up with demand.
The adjustment process is already unpleasant: Stock prices have fallen, home sales are starts to slow…</span>

Andrea Prudente, 38, and Jay Weeldreyer, 45, were told their baby had no chance of surviving, but doctors refused to intervene despite her fear of deadly infection due to Malta&#x27;s total ban on terminations.
&quot;Medical evacuation got us safely to Spain where Andrea is out of harm&#x27;s way and finally receiving the medical care and treatment denied her in Malta,&quot; Weeldreyer said in a text message to AFP.
Asked how they were feeling, he said: &quot;Relief. And the sudden, smashing waves of grief at losing our little girl.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been so consumed with fear and intense focus on Andrea&#x27;s safety, that now she&#x27;s finally out of…</span>

                              <span>Around 2,000 migrants tried to storm the border separating Spain&#x27;s Melilla enclave from Morocco on Friday, the first such attempted mass crossing into the territory since the two nations mended diplomatic ties in March.
Some 2,000 migrants made their way to the border at dawn and over 500 managed to enter the border control area after cutting a fence with shears, the Spanish government&#x27;s local delegation said in a statement.
Of these 130 sub-Saharan African migrants, &quot;all of them men and apparently adults&quot;, managed to enter Melilla, it added.
Morocco deployed a &quot;large&quot; amount of forces to try to repel the assault on the border, who &quot;cooperated actively&quot; with Spain&#x27;s security forces, the delegation said earlier in a separate statement.

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement that it is &quot;deeply disturbing that Israeli authorities have not conducted a criminal investigation&quot; in the six weeks since Abu Akleh&#x27;s killing, which sparked international outrage.

Yet alongside admiration for the prowess of Ukraine in projecting its message through modern media, Western sources express scepticism over some of the claims made by Kyiv in an intense information conflict.
The Ukrainian government issues a daily catalogue of Russia&#x27;s losses in the four-month long conflict, while remaining cagey about its own casualties and destroyed hardware.
According to its latest update Friday, Russia has lost over 34,500 troops and sustained hardware losses that include over 1,500 tanks, 216 planes and 183 helicopters.

After converting to Judaism and undertaking three intensive years of Jewish study, Peretz recently became one of the few women in Israel to receive an Orthodox rabbinical ordination.
Female rabbis have grown increasingly common in more liberal Jewish denominations, but among the Orthodox opportunities for high-level religious study and positions of religious authority are reserved for men.
Israel&#x27;s Orthodox-controlled chief rabbinate has also refused to recognize Peretz&#x27;s credentials, meaning she cannot officiate at a recognized synagogue.

As many as 65 turtles, most of them of the Olive Ridley variety, and 14 dolphins were discovered dead earlier this week, Guatemala&#x27;s National Council of Protected Areas told AFP.
The agency didn&#x27;t say where exactly the dead animals were found.
Officials at the agency believe the deaths could have been caused by heavy rains in recent days, which could have carried some toxic materials from the mainland into the sea.
Investigators are also looking into whether industrial fishing being developed offshore could have played a role.
Experts in this Central American nation will now study the animals&#x27; remains to determine what caused the deaths.
Local officials together with volunteers were also looking to see if more dead species were to be found.

The news came shortly after the European Union made a strong show of support for Ukraine, granting the former Soviet republic candidate status, although there is still a long path ahead to membership.
Capturing Severodonetsk has become a key goal of the Russians as they focus their offensive on eastern Ukraine after being repelled from Kyiv and other areas following their February invasion.

The proposed changes would allow the government to seize company assets and impose criminal penalties.</span>

Al-Monitor: Iran replaces IRGC&#x27;s intelligence chief 
Taeb&#x27;s apparent dismissal comes after Israeli media outlets identified him as masterminding plots against Israeli citizens in Turkey. 
Iran has replaced the head of the intelligence unit for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Taeb, the IRGC confirmed on Thursday. 
“Guard Corps chief Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami appointed Gen. Mohammad Kazemi as the new head of the IRGC Intelligence Organization,” spokesman for the IRGC Ramezan Sharif said in a statement. Kazemi had previously run the IRGC’s Intelligence Protection Organization. 
Iran&#x27;s state broadcaster IRIB reported Thursday that Taeb will now serve as an adviser to IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami.

Zero Hedge: NATO Chief Calls For Sweden And Finland To Join &#x27;As Soon As Possible&#x27; 
Why is NATO so anxious to induct multiple countries near the borders of Russia into the fold without concern for the geopolitical consequences?  Probably because the war in Ukraine is not going so well.  Or, perhaps the goal is to deliberately create an even wider conflict.  Either way, NATO&#x27;s behavior suggests that there is considerable information that is not being revealed to the general public. 
NATO Chief General Jens Stoltenberg has been pushing for swift approval of applications from Sweden and Finland, with Department of Defense officials in the US calling on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to quickly approve the requests.

Hurriyet Daily News: Turkish intelligence busts Iranian plans to kidnap, attack Israelis 
Türkiye’s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) and police busted the Iranian intelligence service SAVAMA in Istanbul on June 17. 
They were allegedly preparing to kidnap and attack Israeli diplomats and tourist groups in Istanbul. 
They have determined that the shooters who planned to take part in the attacks were in Istanbul. 
MİT and police have received information that kidnappings and killings were planned against Israelis living or visiting as tourists in Istanbul and against a former Israeli ambassador and his wife who were staying at a hotel in the Beyoğlu district.

* But any accession process to the EU is likely to take years if not decades 
* Ukrainian President Zelensky said he had been calling EU leaders to make case 
The European Parliament has approved Ukraine&#x27;s bid to join the EU in a vote backed by an overwhelming majority of MEPs. 
Leaders of the member states will gather in Brussels later today to discuss calls to formally grant Ukraine &#x27;candidate status&#x27; to join the bloc, as Russian forces slowly advance in the eastern Donbas region. 
But some member states have been lukewarm about letting Ukraine join the EU, and any accession process is likely to take years if not decades.

Insider: Putin is meeting leaders of China, Brazil, and India, showing Russia still has powerful allies despite the Ukraine invasion 
* Putin is meeting leaders of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) alliance this week. 
* Putin said Russian trade with BRICS nations rose 38% between January and March despite Western sanctions. 
* The meeting shows Putin still has friends despite the backlash to his Ukraine invasion. 
President Vladimir Putin is meeting this week with a group of prominent world leaders, a reminder that Russia still has powerful allies despite the backlash to its invasion of Ukraine. 
Putin is attending a virtual meeting of the BRICS alliance on Thursday, a group made up of Russia, India, China, Brazil, and South Africa founded in 2009. 
The leaders released pre-recorded speeches on Wednesday, all which went without criticism of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

Euronews/AFP: Moscow renames US embassy street after Donetsk separatists 
The city of Moscow has renamed the official address of the US embassy in Moscow after pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. 
The street housing the embassy building has now been labelled &quot;Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic Square&quot;. 
The move now forces the US diplomatic mission to refer to the separatist territory in Ukraine&#x27;s eastern Donbas region. 
Russia recognised the independence of the region in February -- just before it launched its invasion of Ukraine -- but the US and the West have not recognised it. 
&quot;The US embassy in Russia has a new official address,&quot; Moscow City Hall said in a statement.

Alex Vershinin, The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI): The Return of Industrial Warfare  
Can the West still provide the arsenal of democracy? 
The war in Ukraine has proven that the age of industrial warfare is still here. The massive consumption of equipment, vehicles and ammunition requires a large-scale industrial base for resupply – quantity still has a quality of its own. The mass scale combat has pitted 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers, together with 450,000 recently mobilised citizen soldiers against about 200,000 Russian and separatist troops. The effort to arm, feed and supply these armies is a monumental task. Ammunition resupply i…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON — Members of the World Trade Organization announced several agreements on Friday at the end of their first in-person ministerial conference in four years, pledging to curb harmful government policies that have encouraged overfishing and to relax some controls on intellectual property in an effort to make coronavirus vaccines more widely available.
The agreements were hotly contested, after several long nights of talks and long periods during which it appeared that the meeting would yield no major agreement.  Indeed, while the parties were able to reach a compromise on vaccine technology, the rift remained so deep that both sides criticized the outcome.

Hours after the House Committee on Oversight and Reform released a memo saying Snyder had interfered with the investigation, Goodell said he believed Snyder had been held accountable by the league’s assessment of a $10 million fine in the team and that Snyder is stepping away from day-to-day team operations over the past year.

The San Francisco Police Department received a call around 10 a.m. about a shooting at the Forest Hill station of the Muni subway, the city’s public rail system, officer Kathryn Winters told reporters on Wednesday.  When officers arrived they found the train had left the station and was heading towards Castro Station, one stop northeast of Forest Hill Station, Officer Winters said. 
“Most of the people on the train got off the train quickly,” Constable Winters said, adding that police were unsure how crowded the train or station was at the time of the shooting.

Jonah, 15, and his mother, Stacie Fang, stepped out onto their patio and looked up, thinking the disturbing noise was coming from the roof of the 13-story Champlain Towers South condominium in Surfside, Florida.  But standing on the 10th floor, they couldn’t see anything wrong, so they settled in for the night.
Everything was calm.  No alarm sounds.  No evacuation order came.  But the condo tower was about to collapse.

Russian soldiers who control a giant nuclear power plant in Ukraine are detaining workers and subjecting them to brutal interrogations for possible saboteurs, prompting many employees to leave and raising security concerns, according to Ukrainian officials.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest in Europe – is located in southern Ukraine, in the town of Enerhodar on the eastern bank of the Dnipro, opposite territory still held by Ukrainian forces.  With 11,000 workers, the factory is strategically important, and security issues at the factory make any Ukrainian counter…</span>

‘It’s a coup attempt,’ Mr Kinzinger said wrote on Twitter.
Unlike a large majority of his fellow Republicans, Mr. Kinzinger remained firm in his condemnation of what happened that day and President Donald J. Trump’s role in stoking it.  Some of those colleagues initially blamed Mr. Trump, but then backtracked on their criticisms and downplayed the severity of the attack.

WASHINGTON — “It’s my Super Bowl,” an off-camera news anchor said during public hearings held by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.  But what’s a Super Bowl without stars, or even fans, I thought.  Former President Donald J. Trump and his family would certainly not show up in person.  Neither Rudolph W. Giuliani, once his personal attorney and former mayor of New York, nor any other who would be recognizable to anyone but a student of politics.
And unlike last month’s libel lawsuit involving Johnny Depp and his estranged wife, Amber Heard – in which the public’s passion for salacious celebrity gossip was unmistakable – eager supporters didn’t appear to be lining up to …</span>

It was unclear exactly what investigators were looking for, but Mr. Clark played a pivotal role in President Donald J. Trump’s failed efforts in late 2020 to force the nation’s top prosecutors to support his election fraud allegations.
The law enforcement action at Mr. Clark’s home in suburban Virginia came just a day before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol is set to hold a hearing examining Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department after his election defeat.

Fifteen Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Minority Leader, joined Democrats in a crucial test vote that paved the way for the Senate to pass the measure as early as Thursday.  The 65-34 vote more than crossed the 60-vote threshold needed to break a Republican filibuster, breaking a three-decade string of failures over gun legislation.  A Republican senator was absent.

                              <span>A new Granite State poll of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire signals waning support for former President Donald J. Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee — and growing strength for Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida.
Among more than 300 likely Republican primary voters, 37% said they wanted Mr. Trump to be the party’s next presidential nominee, compared with 39% who said they would support Mr. DeSantis, within the margin of error of 5.5% for this question.  Mr. Trump is now “statistically linked” to Mr. DeSantis, according to the poll.
That’s a significant change from October, when a Granite State poll showed Mr. Trump had the support of 43% of likely Republican voters;  Mr. DeSantis was at 18%.


But Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the poll, warned there was still plenty of time before the 2024 presidential cycle: “It’s daylight saving time.  We haven’t even had the midterm elections yet.


The tightening between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis is “part of a typical pattern,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.  “As the primary draws closer, new candidates are emerging and attracting more media attention, and therefore more voter attention, than the losing candidate from the previous election.”
The survey was conducted from June 16 to 20.  It also showed that among more than 840 likely voters in the 2024 general election, Mr. DeSantis was a stronger Republican challenger than Mr. Trump to face President Biden in the next presidential election.
Mr. Biden, who won the state in 2020, would get 50% of the vote if he ran against Mr. Trump, who would get 43%, according to the poll.  But Mr. Biden was only expected to get 46% against Mr. DeSantis, who would get 47%, according to the poll.
In a brief interview, Mr. Smith described waning support for Mr. Trump as voters “move away from last year’s model to look at this year’s model”.

A bill that would allow New York to build state-owned renewable energy has suddenly been thrown into play, after being considered dead.  It passed the Senate despite strong opposition from energy producers, and after hours of fervent grassroots lobbying, activists proclaimed they had enough votes in the Assembly to pass.
But Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie never introduced the bill, and the session ended without a vote.


The failure to force Mr. Heastie’s hand was a glaring example of how more left-leaning state lawmakers have encountered headwinds this year, but it wasn’t the only one: proposals to protecting tenants from eviction, creating universal hea…</span>

“One of the central elements of the movement for better policing is the demand that those who serve in uniform better represent the communities they police,” Mayor London Breed said. said.  “We can’t say, ‘We want more black officers,’ or ‘We want more LGBTQ officers,’ and then treat those officers with disrespect when they step in and serve.”

                              <span>The long-awaited effort to prevent Eric Greitens from becoming the Republican nominee for Missouri Senate is finally underway.  The big question is whether it is too late to stop it.
A robust and well-funded Republican campaign to highlight The personal scandals of Mr. Greitens — which include allegations of domestic and sexual abuse — using at least $1 million in paid TV ads as of Friday, according to five people familiar with the project.
Politics first signaled the arrival of the new super PACShow Me Values, which is run by Johnny DeStefano, a former campaign and White House aide to former President Donald J. Trump.

                              <span>WASHINGTON — The Senate is debating a bipartisan bill to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, the product of a compromise that could result in the most significant gun safety legislation in decades .
The bipartisan Safer Communities Act, drafted by a small group of Republicans and Democrats in the wake of back-to-back mass shootings, would improve background checks on gun buyers between the ages of 18 and 21, encourage states to enact “red flag” laws that allow firearms to be temporarily confiscated from people deemed dangerous, and provide hundreds of millions of dollars for mental health and school safety.  It would also extend to dating partners a federal law that prohibits domestic abusers from purchasing firearms.

Trump’s efforts to use the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election results, and l one of the many officials there who pumped the brakes on the plan.
Mr. Donoghue has repeatedly pushed back against Mr. Trump’s voter fraud allegations in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona, and he refused to follow when Mr. Trump insisted that the department “simply say the election was corrupt” and “leave the rest to me,” according to notes Mr. Donoghue took during a Dec. 27, 2020, call with Mr. Trump and Jeffrey A.

A dispute over sanctions in Kaliningrad is a reminder of the security risks across Europe.
 Kaliningrad is the latest spot in Europe caught up in spillover tensions from the Ukraine war.
That Kaliningrad flared up is not all that surprising considering, well, geography. Kaliningrad is a chunk of Russia wedged between Lithuania and Poland, who are both members of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is heavily militarized. Russia has deployed nuclear-capable missiles to the oblast, or administrative region, and it is the base for Russia’s Baltic Fleet, and its only year-round ice-free port. Min…</span>

Ukraine and Moldova won backing from European Union leaders on Thursday to become official candidates to join the bloc, a seminal move that comes after months of lobbying from the war-torn country and its neighbour to start the long road to membership.
The decision is &quot;a strong signal towards Russia in the current geopolitical context&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron said in Brussels,

&quot;That is why we ask foreign media to tell the truth about this war and continue to tell the world about Russia&#x27;s crimes in our country,&quot; she told AFP.
Portraits of reporters and media workers who have become victims of the conflict stare down at passers-by from large black and white boards in the capital&#x27;s centre.

                              <span>A gun battle left four police officers and eight suspected gang members dead in Mexico&#x27;s western state of Jalisco, authorities said Thursday.
The clash happened on Wednesday night at a house in El Salto on the outskirts of the city of Guadalajara and, according to witnesses, lasted for more than an hour.
Eight suspects were killed and three others seriously injured, Jalisco Governor Enrique Alfaro said.
Two people being held captive inside the building were rescued following a tip-off that gunmen had been seen taking gagged people into the house, prosecutor Luis Mendez Ruiz told reporters.
Several people were arrested, and weapons and ammunition were seized.
Ten police officers have been murdered this year in Jalisco, one of Mexico&#x27;s most violent states due to the presence of criminal gangs, according to official figures.
The western region, one of the country&#x27;s most prosperous, is the cradle of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which authorities blame for numerous deaths and disappearances.
Its leader, Nemesio &quot;El Mencho&quot; Oseguera, is one of the world&#x27;s most wanted drug lords, with the US Drug Enforcement Administration offering $10 million for his arrest.
More than 340,000 people have been killed in a spiral of bloodshed in Mexico since the government deployed the army to fight drug cartels in 2006.
