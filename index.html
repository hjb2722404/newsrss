                              <span>Elon Musk has teased fans on Twitter by weighing in on whether former president Donald Trump will be allowed to return to the social media platform after being kicked off in January 2021.

“If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump was coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money,” Elon Musk tweeted.

Fans of the 45th president begged the new owner to allow him back on the platform, with one user calling Donald Trump’s permanent suspension “the most outrageous act of censorship in modern America”.</span>

                              <span>Prince Harry was slammed by a royal expert as an &quot;emotionally needy&quot; man who has been &quot;completely and utterly taken over&quot; by his wife Meghan Markle.

Tina Brown, author of &#x27;The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor - the Truth and the Turmoil&#x27;, told The Telegraph ahead of the release of her new book earlier this year that the Duke of Sussex&#x27;s &quot;whole personality has changed&quot;.

&quot;He’s so emotionally needy that he’s been completely and utterly taken over by Meghan and his whole personality has changed. It’s a really sad thing to a great many people,&quot; she told the publication.

&quot;Meghan seems to answer some huge need in Harry and it seems like they are in a powerful co-dependency. And I do question how it will end.&quot;</span>

                              <span>China has warned a build-up of defence assets in the Northern Territory could start an arms race in the region. 

This comes amid reports the US Air Force could deploy nuclear-capable bombers to the Northern Territory.

“The relevant US behaviours have increased regional tensions, seriously undermined regional peace and stability and may trigger an arms race in the region,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. 

“China urges the parties concerned to abandon the outdated cold war and … narrow-minded geopolitical thinking.”</span>

Mr Biden stated during a recent press conference that the current record profits of oil companies “are not because they are doing something new or innovative”.

“Their profits are a windfall of war,” he said.</span>

                              <span>Around 3 million Texans have already cast their vote in next week&#x27;s midterm elections. 

The southern state hosts several interesting contests - including for the Governorship - as Democrat and failed presidential candidate Beto O&#x27;Rourke tries to oust Republican Greg Abbott. 

With the midterm elections approaching quickly, more and more Americans are talking about the issue of cost of living. 

Sky News spoke to Texans to discuss their key election issues as Americans gear up to head to the polls for the midterms, with some pointing to the cost of living crisis, gun laws, and abortion rights.</span>

He said the reason the Republicans stand to do well in the midterms is because the Democrats continue to talk about abortion when undecided voters are more focussed on the economy and the cost of living crisis.</span>

It was so fraught with misfortune that diverted audiences’ attention from the opera’s musical richness. Many think Maria Stuarda includes some of the composer’s best works.  Maria Stuarda premiered at La Scala in Milan in 1835 amid a climate of political censorship and suffered neglect shortly after. This operatic gem was revived in Bergamo, Italy in the mid-20th century and many performances were staged around the world subsequently.  In this operatic interpretation of a royal conflict, where 16th-century England meets 19th-century Europe, Donizetti sheathed the themes of honour, virtue, piety, pride and purity in…</span>

* Ukraine has claimed that 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday as its forces continue to make gains 
* It marks the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin&#x27;s troops since Russia&#x27;s the invasion began in back in February 
* Footage has emerged showing panicked soldiers fleeing attack on armoured vehicle - only for it to flip over 
* Comes as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and push them to the front lines, regardless of skill 
Nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in one day in Ukraine, Kyiv has claimed, marking the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin since his troops invaded eight months ago.
Ukrainian forces have been making gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the country&#x27;s east and in the southern city of Kherson. 
 In a blow to Putin&#x27;s invasion, 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday, pushing the Russian death toll up to at least 71,200, Kyiv has claimed.

WNU editor: If you want to follow war reports from the Ukraine Ministry of Defense, the link is here (link here) 

I personally follow their reports everyday. But needless to say I am skeptical. And in the past few weeks I have found their reports very hard to believe like the claim that 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday. But they are a reference tool that all those who are following the war should check out each day. 
As for those who want to follow the Russian Ministry of Defense website. It is unfortunately blocked for outsiders. This may change in the future, so the link is here https://eng.mil.ru/</span>

   DW: Norway raises army alert level in response to Ukraine war 
The Norwegian armed forces will do less training and more active operations, the country&#x27;s prime minister said. Oslo is concerned about sabotage to its energy infrastructure. 
Norway&#x27;s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Monday that his country&#x27;s military would be put on a raised level of alert as part of increased security measures in response to the war in Ukraine. 
&quot;This is the most severe security situation in several decades,&quot; Stoere told a press conference  &quot;
There are no indications that Russia is expanding its warfare to other countries, but the increased tensions make us more exposed to threats, intelligence operations and influence campaigns.&quot; 
The increased alert level would be valid from Tuesday.

Insider: Chinese leader Xi Jinping&#x27;s power grab fueled a $6 trillion stock selloff and the yuan&#x27;s decline. These 4 charts capture the market meltdown 
* China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power — and that has rocked markets. 
* Investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout as Xi shut reformers out of decision making. 
* These 4 charts show how deep the meltdown in China-linked assets went last week. 
China&#x27;s leader Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power, shutting out reformers to effectively take sole charge of the world&#x27;s second-largest economy — and that has rocked markets. 
President Xi unveiled a new decision-making team stacked with like-minded political allies and publicly disrespected his business-friendly predecessor at the Communist Party congress last week. 
Spooked investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout Monday, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, the tightly-managed onshore yuan continued to lose ground to the dollar, having already dropped sharply this year.

Reuters: EU examines classifying Iran Revolutionary Guards as terrorists - Germany 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and the European Union are examining whether to classify Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Sunday. 
&quot;I made it clear last week that we will launch another package of sanctions, that we will examine how we can also list the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation,&quot; Baerbock said in a interview with ARD broadcaster on Sunday. 
Her comments come after the head of the Revolutionary Guards warned protesters that Saturday would be their last day of taking to the streets, in a sign that security forces may intensify their already fierce crackdown on widespread unrest.

 In accordance with Israeli law, no more polls will be published until the exit polls begin at 10 p.m. on Tuesday evening. 
 On Saturday, Meretz and Hadash Ta’al continued their strategy of calling people to vote for them so they won’t fall under the electoral threshold, known colloquially as “gevalt” campaigns.

                              <span>VICE: Facebook’s Monopoly Is Imploding Before Our Eyes 
Competition, miscalculations, and regulatory scrutiny have all but killed the advertising giant&#x27;s dreams of diversifying its business and rolling up the digital world into its platform. 
For years, the definition of success for many tech employees has been getting a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). 
Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, meanwhile, are often the five major companies people think of when they think of &quot;big tech.&quot; 
But there is evidence that Facebook—once a dominant monopoly rightly blamed for all sorts of societal ills—is on the precipice of dropping out of this group through years of sheer mismanagement, a failure to innovate, setting money on fire in pursuit of a metaverse that seemingly no one wants, a vulnerable business model that Apple is squarely taking aim at, and upstart competitors like TikTok that the company seemingly has no answer for. What seemed impossible just a year or two ago—that Facebook will become just another tech company, more or less—now seems like a very real possibility.

It’s become routine since Russia invaded Ukraine: President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak by phone whenever the U.S. announces a new package of military assistance for Kyiv. 
But a phone call between the two leaders in June played out differently from previous ones, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden had barely finished telling Zelenskyy he’d just greenlighted another $1 billion in U.S. military assistance for Ukraine when Zelenskyy star…</span>

The United States is preparing to deploy up to six nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to northern Australia, a provocative move experts say is aimed squarely at China. 
An investigation by Four Corners can reveal Washington is planning to build dedicated facilities for the giant aircraft at Tindal air base, south of Darwin. 
The US has drawn up detailed plans for what it calls a &quot;squadron operations facility&quot; for use during the Northern Territory dry season, an adjoining maintenance centre and a parking area for &quot;six B-52s&quot;.

* Ms Truss became fixated with the weather after hearing about possibility 
When Liz Truss was told, during the dying days of her mayfly Premiership, that the security services were picking up intelligence that Vladimir Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine it sent a chill down her spine. 
The Prime Minister was still adjusting to getting used to a new mobile phone number, for the first time in over a decade, as a result of a hack suspected to have been backed or orchestrated by the Kremlin, potentially giving Putin access to information about Western support for President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s regime. 
 In particular, Ms Truss was told that Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea, which would show the West what he was capable of without triggering a full-scale nuclear war.

Jerusalem Post: Israel must get rid of its nuclear weapons, UNGA majority decides 
Israel never admitted to possess nuclear weapons, but nevertheless, the UNGA resolution was aimed at Israel, not Iran.
Israel must dispose of all its nuclear weapons and place its nuclear sites under the International Atomic Energy Agency’s purview, the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee stated in an initial 152-5 vote. 
The five nations that opposed Friday’s resolution on the “risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East” were: Canada, Israel, Micronesia, Palau and the United States. Another 24 countries abstained, including European Union members.

DNYUZ/Newsweek: Putin Should Be Overthrown, Majority of Americans Say: Poll 
A majority of American voters believe seeking to remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power is a “reasonable objective,” according to a new survey conducted exclusively for Newsweek. 
On February 24 Putin ordered his army into Ukraine, triggering one of the biggest wars in Europe since the end of World War II. 
After the Russians initially made significant gains, Ukraine has recaptured some territory over the past couple of months, particularly around the northern city of Kharkiv and Kherson in the south. 
According to the Redfield and Wilton poll, conducted for Newsweek, 60 percent of U.S. voters think seeking to “remove Vladimir Putin from power would be a reasonable objective.”

   CBS News: Republicans head into final week with lead in seats, voters feel things are &quot;out of control&quot; — CBS News Battleground Tracker poll 
The election is already underway; millions have voted, and tens of millions more will before Nov. 8. Amid that, eight in 10 likely voters describe things in the country today as &quot;out of control,&quot; as opposed to &quot;under control.&quot; 
That doesn&#x27;t bode well for the party in power: Republicans are winning those who say &quot;out of control&quot; right now by more than 20 points, though they&#x27;re often the ones feeling that way to begin with.   So where do things stand?

Update #2: It looks like some Governor-ships are flipping Republican .... Governor’s Races Enter Final Sprint on a Scrambled, Surprising Map (New York Times).   
WNU Editor: The CBS/YouGov poll does not say how much of their sample size is Democrat/Republican/Independent. 
FiveThirtyEight says it is a dead heat, but when you look at their map projections it looks like the Republicans are going to pick up a minimum of two seats. 
The New York Times assessment on the governor-ships is blunt. A number of Republican pick-ups.
Bottom line. It is going to be a good night if you are a Republican.</span>

“If investigations ramp up and Hunter Biden comes to the forefront , and we there’s so much there and we’ve only scratched the surface, the interest of his family is the only thing that can get him to step aside – I think,” Ms McEnany told Jesse Watters.

“But then he loses the pardon power doesn’t he? To pardon his son Hunter Biden if he’s no longer president.”</span>

                              <span>A tweet by US President Joe Biden has been fact-checked on Twitter barely two days after Elon Musk finalised his $US44 billion takeover deal of the popular social networking service.

On Friday, the president was called out by Twitter readers for inflating the number of corporations that were making billions, according to Fox News.

In a tweet said to be giving &quot;the facts&quot;, Mr Biden claimed that 55 corporations made $US40 billion in 2020 and &quot;paid zero in federal taxes&quot;.

The tweet had an &quot;added context&quot; stamp applied to it by readers indicating the Inflation Reduction Act imposed a minimum tax on corporations with average pre-tax earnings greater than $US1 billion.

It also noted &quot;of the 55 corporations mentioned by President Biden, only 14 had earnings greater than $1 billion and would be eligible under Biden’s tax law&quot;.</span>

StraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons 
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. 
Defending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. 
Preventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.

WNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.

The same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.</span>

   From Instapundit .... “Grab the popcorn, baby! It’s on! Maybe a questionable decision this early in his tenure as Chief Twit, but we’re here for the show, and we couldn’t write a better opening episode. This tweet would have gotten flagged for disinformation or taken down by Twitter in the before times. Now it’s out there in all its glory for people to read, debate, criticize, and all the other things that should happen in a free society where ideas are discussed with words INSTEAD of resorting to violence. It’s a new day!” 
Wow!!!! 
If this Santa Monica article is true (link here), it completely changes the narrative behind the Pelosi assault story.   This tweet by Elon Musk perfectly illustrates why the political establishment is freaking out over Elon Musk&#x27; ownership of Twitter.</span>

America’s latest chip war sanctions risk wider conflict in physical and economic spheres.  
The United States has gambled big in its latest across-the-board sanctions on Chinese companies in the semiconductor industry, believing it can kneecap China and retain its global dominance. 
From the slogans of globalization and “free trade” of the neoliberal 1990s, Washington has reverted to the technology-denial regimes that the US and its allies followed during the Cold War. While it might work in the short run to slow down Chinese advances, the cost to the US semiconductor industry of losing China – its biggest market – will have significant consequences in the long run. 
In the process, the semiconductor industries of Taiwan and S…</span>

A Haitian politician has been shot dead outside his home, authorities have said, as international concerns intensify over the gang violence, political turmoil and humanitarian crises that have seized control of the country. 
Eric Jean Baptiste was killed on Friday night outside his home in the capital Port-au-Prince, local police told CNN.
He was the leader of the Rally of Progressive National Democrats Party (RNDP), a minor political party in Haiti, and launched a longshot presidential bid in 2016.  A security guard was also killed in the attack, the police spokesperson said. Baptiste survived an earlier attempt on his life in 2018, escaping with a bullet wound.

OilPrice.com: U.S. LNG Cannot Replace The Russian Natural Gas That Europe Has Lost 
* Europe has relied on U.S. LNG imports to offset the loss of Russian gas, with nearly 70% of U.S. LNG exports heading to Europe in September. 
* In the long term, Europe will have to find other sources of natural gas as its inventories are likely to drain over the upcoming winter. 
* Ultimately, Europe will have to reduce demand for natural gas going forward as there is very little available supply left. 
Europe cannot rely solely on imports of U.S. LNG to offset the pipeline gas supply it will have lost from Russia when it starts rebuilding inventories after the end of this winter, according to BloombergNEF. 
So far this year, American LNG has been crucial in meeting demand in Europe, which is scrambling for gas supply and willing to pay up for spot deliveries, outbidding most of Asia.
The United States is shipping record volumes of LNG to Europe to help EU allies and nearly 70% of all American LNG exports were headed to Europe in September, according to Refinitiv Eikon data cited by Reuters.

Update: Europe Can’t Rely on US Gas to Plug Growing Shortfall Next Year (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: I am sure the EU is going to be able to get the natural gas that it needs this winter. But it is not going to be cheap, nor reliable. And the bigger problem will be next year, since Russian gas will  no longer be available to fill up their reserves unless purchased through middle-men like Turkey or China at exoborant prices. 
And that is the crux of the problem. 
Europe&#x27;s industrial base is dependent on having access to cheap natural gas. No more now.</span>

* Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, said Twitter will have to “fly by our rules” after Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of the company. 
* Tech companies will face greater pressure to remove illegal content under the EU’s incoming Digital Services Act. 
* Companies can be fined up to 6% of global annual revenues for violations of the rules, which are expected to come into force in 2024. 
A top European Union official had a warning for Elon Musk Friday about his $44 purchase of Twitter, telling the billionaire he will have to play by the rules. 
After a cryptic tweet from Musk suggesting he’d completed his acquisition of Twitter, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, warned Musk that he will have to comply with the bloc’s new digital regulations. 
“The bird is freed,” Musk tweeted. In response, Breton quote-tweeted Musk saying: “In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.”

The film, a joint Russian-Ukrainian production, was released in both countries on 2 April 2015, and its international premiere took place two weeks later at the Beijing International Film Festival. 
The movie revolves principally around the events of the siege of Odessa and the siege of Sevastopol of 1941-42.</span>

   The Cradle: ‘US has no plans to withdraw from Syria or end sanctions’: Official  
Despite claiming its presence in Syria is solely to fight ISIS, US forces instead maintain regime change policies against Damascus and illegally loot the country’s oil  
The Coordinator of Strategic Communications for Washington’s National Security Council, John Kirby, said on 28 October that the US has no plans to either ease the Caesar Act sanctions against Syria or to withdraw its illegally occupying forces from the country. 
 The Caesar Act, passed by Congress in 2019, imposes harsh sanctions against Syria and targets any state, business, or individual involved with the Damascus government.  In an attempt to justify the US presence in Syria, Kirby said that “only a thousand American soldiers” were stationed there, whose mission he claimed was solely to combat ISIS.

The head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards has told protesters that Saturday will be their last day of taking to the streets, in a sign that security forces may intensify their crackdown on unrest sweeping the country. 
Iran has been gripped by protests since the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, in the custody of the morality police last month, posing one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution.

Russia has announced it is suspending its involvement in the internationally-brokered deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its Black Sea ports. 
 It comes after Russia accused Ukraine of a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea. 
Ukraine has not admitted the attack and President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Russian move &quot;rather predictable&quot;. 
Without providing evidence, Russia also accused British troops of being involved in Saturday&#x27;s attack. 
It also accused the UK of blowing up gas pipelines last month.

   Warzone/The Drive: Ukraine Unleashes Mass Kamikaze Drone Boat Attack On Russia’s Black Sea Fleet Headquarters  
Russia says Ukrainian aerial drones and unmanned surface vessels targeted the home of its Black Sea Fleet, damaging at least a minesweeper.  
The largest city in Crimea and the home of Russia&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet woke up to heavy explosions and anti-aircraft fire during an attack Russian officials say included aerial drones and especially unmanned surface vessels (USV), both of which were &#x27;suicide&#x27; or &#x27;kamikaze&#x27; types mean to explode when they arrive at their targets. 
The Ukrainian Armed Forces have since released incredible footage purportedly from aboard several unmanned surface vessels used in the attack. The video shows the purported attack run on a guided missile frigate and Russian forces engaging the USVs with machine-gun fire.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil&#x27;s heated presidential race has tightened ahead of a Sunday vote, several opinion surveys showed on Saturday, with right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro eroding a slight advantage for leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in most polls. 
Surveys by pollsters Datafolha and Quaest both showed Lula with 52% of valid votes against 48% for Bolsonaro, down from a 6 percentage-point lead three days prior, putting the incumbent in striking distance of a come-from-behind victory. 
A survey by pollster MDA showed Lula&#x27;s edge slipping to just 2 percentage points, equal to the margin of error for the poll commissioned by transport sector lobby CNT.

                              <span>Mass protests continue in #Moldova calling for the removal of the pro-EU regime of Maya Sandu. 
The Western media has completely blacked out these mass protests in Moldova. They are peddling the CIA nonsense instead blaming Russia for this. pic.twitter.com/kpvPQEk0aZ

   WNU Editor: Inflation that is over 30% and climbing. Interest rates at 21% and climbing. A economy that has imploded, coupled with the country now facing its worse energy crisis in its history .... sighhhh .... this is what is fueling these protests .... President says Moldova facing worst energy crisis in its history (BNE Intelligence). 
Kudos to Reuters for following these protests closely and reporting on why they are happening, and how large they are .... Thousands in new Moldova anti-government protest (Reuters). 
The Washington Post has a different analysis. Quoting Ukrainian intelligence sources they are labeling these protests as a Russian destabilization operation (see below):

                              <span>Saturday is chore day for me. Also helping this afternoon an elderly Ukrainian couple move to a home that a Ukrainian-Canadian family have opened for them to stay with them for a few months. Charity work never ends. 
Blogging will return this evening.
Just some final thoughts. 

The timing of the Sevastopol attack only hours after the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the UK of being responsible for damaging the Nord Stream pipeline attacks is bothering me on every level. 
This war is clearly escalating to an entirely new level. 
On another note. 
The Western narrative is saying that Russia is losing the war and Putin is facing great opposition within Russia itself. But what I see on the ground is the opposite. A rush from the West to supply more money and weapons to Ukraine, more sanctions, massive electrical black-outs in Ukraine, and now numerous reports from Russia of direct Western involvement in the war on the ground.  
We are also seeing a growing protest movement against EU policy towards the war (link here), and link here.

   WNU Editor: I suspect US drones are flying in the region 24/7. But optics is everything, and this has all the looks of being a coordinated attack by Ukraine and NATO against the Russian fleet at Sevastopol. 
There are now reports (yet to be confirmed) that some Russian warships were damaged in the attack. 
 I am surprised that the tracker was not turned-off by this US drone.</span>

                              <span>BBC: &#x27;Massive&#x27; drone attack on Black Sea Fleet - Russia 
Ukraine has carried out a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, damaging one warship, Russia says.  Nine drones were used, a top official said. Ukraine has not commented. 
Without providing evidence, Russia accused British troops of being involved in that attack - and in blowing up gas pipelines last month. 
The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was &quot;peddling false claims of an epic scale.&quot;  Saturday&#x27;s attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by occupying Russians. 
Russia has replied by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country&#x27;s energy grid.
