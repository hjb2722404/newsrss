                              <span>UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is “modelling herself” on former UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher as the race for leadership of the Conservative Party narrows, social commentator Prue MacSween says. 

“Whether she is going to be as good as Thatcher, the jury is out. But she seems to be tough,” Ms MacSween told Sky News host Peta Credlin.</span>

                              <span>US President Joe Biden &quot;has a history&quot; of saying things that are &quot;just not true,&quot; according to Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

“Here, we call it being a fabulist, which is not just exaggerating things, but adding stuff on to give yourself kind of a sense of bravado or charisma or an attempt to place yourself, almost like Zelig in ... every event that&#x27;s ever happened,” Ms Bruce told Sky News Australia host James Morrow. 

“And it comes from a lack of self-esteem and also from perhaps a desire to manipulate.

“But the American people have seen this from him for 50 years.

“He’s not as smooth with it these days.”

Ms Bruce&#x27;s comments come after the White House recently retracted a statement made by US President Joe Biden following a blunder during a speech in Massachusetts.</span>

                              <span>Sky News Australia host James Morrow says “the knives are well and truly out” in America as criticism mounts against President Biden and his administration. 

Mr Morrow said calls are growing in America that it is “time for Joe to go”. 

He also said the left in the US “still does get its marching orders from late-night tv”. 

“And what’s being said there? … well basically late-night tv is also saying it’s time for Joe to go,” Mr Morrow said.  

Mr Morrow said the &quot;knives are well and truly out&quot; in the &quot;wake of the White House’s tepid action to fight for the only freedom the left cares about, no not freedom of speech or religion or self-defence – but to have an abortion&quot;.</span>

Daily Mail: How can they let him out? Fury after military vet who tried to assassinate NY governor candidate Lee Zeldin with &#x27;Made in USA&#x27; blade is still roaming free under state&#x27;s lax bail laws as politician says he&#x27;s ramped up security for remainder of campaign 
* Military veteran David Jakubonis, 43, was released without bail hours after he attacked Zeldin, who, fittingly, was giving a speech on bail reform 
* Jakubonis, 43, approached the candidate on Thursday and told him: &#x27;Okay, you&#x27;re done&#x27; 
* &#x27;The suspect will likely be right back out on the street immediately,&#x27; Zeldin predicted after the attack 
* The suspect was quickly subdued by Marine Corps combat veteran Joe Chenelly 
* Photos from the scene show authorities recovered what appeared to be a set of brass knuckles with a sharp blade in the shape of a cat 
* New York&#x27;s GOP chairman blamed Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul for the attack after her campaign posted details about Zeldin&#x27;s event 
A man who attempted to stab US Rep. Lee Zeldin at a New York campaign rally on Thursday is still roaming free as the New York gubernatorial candidate said his ‘guard’ was completely down when he saw the attacker approach him wearing a veteran&#x27;s hat. 
&#x27;The first thing I saw was that he was wearing a hat that says he was a veteran and the way that I&#x27;m wired when I see somebody wearing a hat that is a veteran - my guard couldn&#x27;t possibly be more dropped,&#x27; Zeldin said at a Friday press conference.

                              <span>UPI: Pelosi: Pentagon worried China would shoot down her plane if she visits Taiwan 
U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hinted that the Pentagon expressed concern her plane &quot;would get shot down&quot; by the Chinese if she makes a rumored visit to Taiwan this summer. 
The California Democrat is planning a trip to the self-governing island next month, a report in the Financial Times earlier this week claimed, drawing an angry response from Beijing. 
Pelosi refused to confirm the trip during a weekly press conference Thursday, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t ever discuss my travel plans.&quot;  &quot;You never even hear me say if I&#x27;m going to London, because it is a security issue,&quot; she said.

In addition, gaps are growing between the promised and received aid

   WNU Editor: What has been given is just a drop in the bucket of what is needed. It should be noted that the above amount does not include the tens of billions that are being spent on taking care of the 9.5 million Ukrainians who have so far fled the country. Nor the hundreds of billions that will be needed when this war is finally over.</span>

Russia&#x27;s objectives in Ukraine now extend beyond the eastern Donbas region into the country&#x27;s south, a senior government minister has said. 
As the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state media that the &quot;geography is different.&quot; 
&quot;It is far from being only DPR (Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic) and LPR (Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic), it is also Kherson Region, Zaporizhzhia Region and a number of other territories, and this process continues, it continues steadily and persistently,&quot; Lavrov said during an interview with RIA Novosti, published Wednesday. 
Lavrov&#x27;s remarks signal the Kremlin&#x27;s refocused approach to the war in Ukraine.

Reuters: Iran doesn&#x27;t want a nuclear deal, British spy chief says 
ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) -Britain&#x27;s spy chief said on Thursday he was skeptical that Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei actually wants to revive a nuclear deal with world powers but said Tehran won&#x27;t try to halt talks either. 
Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) known as MI6, said he still believed that reviving the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement was the best way to constrain Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.  Under the deal, Iran had limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.

                              <span>CNN: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are final candidates in race to succeed Boris Johnson as UK Prime Minister 
London (CNN)Boris Johnson will be succeeded as prime minister of the United Kingdom by either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss after the Conservative Party leadership race was on Wednesday narrowed down to the final two candidates. 
Johnson resigned as party leader earlier this month after a series of scandals led to dozens of ministerial resignations. Ten Conservatives stood in the contest to replace him, and over five rounds of voting, members of parliament whittled those down to two. 
Sunak won 137 votes and Truss got 113 votes in the final round, while Penny Mordaunt with 105 votes lost out. 
Both of the final two candidates took to Twitter to comment on the result.

The poll showed 62 per cent of Tory members would vote for Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and 38 per cent would go for Mr Sunak.  

“The thing about me is what you see is what you get,” Ms Truss said. 

“I’ve always been honest with people about what I can deliver, I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I will completely level with the public about, first of all, how tough things are going to be. 

“But also, the hope that they can have about the future because I have a positive vision for Britain, and I will be helping families immediately with the cost of living.”</span>

                              <span>US Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy says the US-Australia partnership is her focus. 

“I think the US-Australia partnership is really my focus and the work that we do together in the region, security, economic engagement, climate change, health security, all of those things,” she said during a media conference on Friday following her arrival in Australia. 

“So I think that China certainly is a big presence here in the region, but I think our partnership is what I’ll be focused on.”</span>

                              <span>Chinese officials have claimed Australia&#x27;s AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom and the United States is an attempt to get nuclear weapons - a claim which has been rejected by Canberra. 

The security deal between the three countries will allow the Royal Australian Navy to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in the future. 

Beijing will take its argument to a high-level meeting at the United Nations next month in a 32-page report, which a spokesperson for the Chinese government says gives “detailed statistics and facts” for China&#x27;s campaign against the security deal between Australia and its allies.</span>

                              <span>Europe is the latest place to succumb to higher interest rates, with the European Central Bank overnight raising its cash rate by half a per cent. 

Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood said the bank has taken its cash rate back to zero. 

“That’s a far cry from, as you can see, where they had been previously,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“The grave fear right now is that there is another recession on the way; that’s the reason the European Central Bank acted overnight.”</span>

Sputnik: Scoop: NATO Doesn’t Trust Ukraine With HIMARS, Operating Advanced Artillery Themselves, Source Says 
The US has delivered 12 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine, and the Pentagon announced Wednesday that Washington would soon send at least four more in the near future. The Russian military and the Donbass People’s Militias have accused Kiev of using the installations to strike civilian areas. 
The HIMARS mobile artillery operating Ukraine are manned by outstaffed career NATO military personnel, and information regarding the advanced weapons systems’ operation is not being transferred to the Ukrainian side due to a lack of trust, a Russian security source has told Sputnik, citing intelligence received from sources inside the Ukrainian military.

WNU Editor: A lot of bombshells in the above report. 
NATO does not trust Ukraine to operate these weapons. Manned by &quot;out-staffed career NATO military personnel?!?!?!? Guarded by private military contractors close to the Pentagon?!?!?! Targets are being selected by US intelligence and US military personnel. 
I do not know if this report is true, but Russian media and the Russian government do believe it is true. That NATO is now directly engaged on the ground against Russian forces in Ukraine.</span>

RT: Russia warns it could stop oil exports 
Foreign crude sales could be suspended if US-driven scheme succeeds, top official says 
 Russia will stop global oil exports if the West’s proposed price cap makes it unprofitable to continue production, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday. 
“If these prices which they are talking about are lower than the costs for oil production… naturally, Russia will not ensure the supply of this oil to the world markets, which means that we simply will not work at a negative profit,” he explained, as cited by TASS.

Politico: Pelosi to Blinken: Label Russia as terrorist state, or else Congress will  
Her comments highlight the chasm in the actions lawmakers want the administration to take and what the secretary is comfortable doing.  
Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a message for Secretary of State Antony Blinken: Designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism — otherwise, Congress will. 
The warning, made on a call between the two earlier this week, was described to POLITICO by two sources familiar with the conversation. Spokespersons for the State Department and Pelosi’s office declined to comment. 
Congress gave the power to label another country as a state sponsor of terrorism to the secretary of state. Some in Congress, though, say lawmakers could pass a law to make the designation without the State Department, thus pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin on their own.

A bipartisan group of senators this week urged the Pentagon to &quot;consider&quot; deploying war planes to Ukraine as it continues to grapple with Russia’s months-long deadly war. 
In a letter led by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to Secretary of Defense Llyod Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, a bipartisan group of six senators urged the Department of Defense to &quot;consider fourth-generation fighter aircraft and necessary flight training&quot; to be included in upcoming military aid packages.

* There had been concerns across the region that there could be a complete shutdown of gas supplies via the pipeline after it was closed earlier this month for maintenance.

* On July 10, the last day of operations before the maintenance work began, flows were at roughly the same level, just above the 29,000,000 kWh/h. 
The operator of Nord Stream 1, a key gas pipeline which runs from Russia to Germany, said Thursday it was in the process of resuming flows to Europe.

Rome, Italy (CNN)Italy&#x27;s President Sergio Mattarella dissolved parliament on Thursday, triggering a snap election following the resignation of the country&#x27;s Prime Minister Mario Draghi earlier in the day. 
Mattarella branded the move &quot;inevitable&quot; following the political upheaval faced by the European Union&#x27;s third largest economy over the last 24 hours. 
Thanking Draghi and his ministers &quot;for their efforts over the past 18 months,&quot; Mattarella said in a short address from his Quirinale Palace in Rome.

WNU editor: Former Italian Premier Mario Draghi looks happy and relieved that he is no longer running the government. It makes you wonder if the reason why he is happy to now be out of power is because he knows how difficult and rough the coming months are going to be for Italy, and for the EU has a whole. 
As to who is poised to take power after elections? If polls continue to hold, it looks like this group will take power, and if they do it will be a geo-political earthquake for Italy and in the EU as a whole .... Italy’s far right celebrate Draghi’s downfall and look poised to take power (The Guardian).

More Americans are unhappy with President Biden&#x27;s job in office than at any point in his presidency, according to a dim new Quinnipiac poll. 
Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove. 
Among registered voters, 33 percent said they approved while 59 percent disapprove.   The low approval spelled bad news for Biden&#x27;s 2024 prospects.

CBS: CIA director William Burns says ties between Russia, Iran suffer from &quot;limits,&quot; lack of trust 
CIA Director William Burns downplayed the utility of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s recent visit to Iran on Wednesday, saying an alliance between the two countries would be limited by their historic rivalry in energy exports and an overall lack of trust. 
&quot;I think beneath the images that that we all saw, the reality is that Russians and Iranians need each other right now,&quot; Burns said. 
&quot;Both federally sanctioned countries, both looking to break out of political isolation as well — but if …</span>

ABC News Australia: CIA estimates about 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine war  
Around 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and a further 45,000 have been wounded in the war in Ukraine, the United States believes. 
CIA director William Burns said Russia&#x27;s efforts to occupy about a fifth of Ukraine had come at a great cost for both countries. 
&quot;The latest estimates from the US intelligence community would be something in the vicinity of 15,000 [Russian forces] killed, and maybe three times that wounded,&quot; he said.

WNU Editor: The CIA Director gives out the Russian casualty number, but he admits in his interview that this is an estimate, and no one really knows what the real number. Translation. He does not know. 
The BBC did a thorough analysis on the number of Russian military casualties a few weeks ago, and their estimate is around 4,000 .... War in Ukraine: Can we say how many people have died? (BBC). This number does not included casualties among Chechen and separatist forces (who have been doing a great deal of the ground fighting since April). 
My sources in Russia tell me that the BBC number is about right, and if you include Chechen and separatist forces the number is around 10,000. 
Ukraine also does not report its casualties. But the numbers that I hear from my sources in Ukraine that I trust are shocking, and I am going to wait until there is an official statement before posting it here.

William Burns&#x27; comment is a blow to Putin&#x27;s critics who believed the Russian leader was ill.   Vladimir Putin is “entirely too healthy,” CIA Director William Burns said Wednesday, throwing cold water on constant rumors that the Russian president is suffering from illness as he pursues his war on Ukraine. 
Burns, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, noted that his declaration was “not a formal intelligence judgment.” Still, given his position, Burns’ comment could help dampen hopes among Putin’s adversaries that the Russian’s demise is near.

(Kitco News) - Ukraine&#x27;s Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova confirmed that the nation sold around $12 billion worth of gold during Russia&#x27;s invasion of the nation. 
She said, &quot;We are selling (this gold) so that our importers are able to buy necessary goods for the country,&quot;  The situation has shown no signs of improving, and the war could be a long, drawn-out process. 
This scenario is something Ukrainian President Zelensky wanted to avoid. Foreign nations are reluctant to step into Ukraine and help as it could escalate the situation. Instead, they have committed to continue to arm the Ukrainian efforts from afar.

Profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, Tesla said, up from $3.3 billion in the first quarter, which was a record.  Sales fell to $16.9 billion from $18.8 billion in the first quarter.
The automaker was also hit by a sharp drop in Bitcoin price.  Tesla said in early 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency.  The company said on Wednesday that it had sold around 75% of its Bitcoin by the end of June.


Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profit almost doubled.  And earnings for the quarter beat analysts’ estimates.  But because Tesla is a fast-growing company, its progress, o…</span>

Usually, bond investors expect to be paid more for tying up their money for a long time, so interest rates on short-term bonds are lower than those on longer-term bonds.  Plotted on a graph, the different bond yields create an upward sloping line – the curve. 


But from time to time, short-term rates exceed long-term rates.  This negative relationship distorts the curve into what is called an inversion and signals that the norm…</span>

“We were unable to provide enough staff for this remote restaurant,” Laurie Schalow, the company’s director of general affairs, said in a statement.  Ms Schalow added that “due to these staffing challenges, there is no likelihood of reopening in the foreseeable future, so we have made the decision to permanently close the restaurant”.

                              <span>The White House has been forced to make an embarrassing clarification after US President Joe Biden said he has cancer during a speech in Somerset, Massachusetts.

During his remarks, President Biden was describing the fumes emitted from the oil refineries near his childhood home in Claymont, Delaware.

&quot;That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer and why for the longest time Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation,” President Biden said.

The White House was forced to make a quick clarification, stating that Mr Biden was referring to the non-melanoma skin cancers he had removed before his presidency.</span>

                              <span>Sri Lanka has elected former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as its new President.

However, the decision has not gone down well with protesters.  

Many in Sri Lanka consider Mr Wickremesinghe as a close associate of the Rajapaksa family, who they blame for the country’s economic crisis. 

On the spot where presidents are normally sworn in, protest leaders demanded Mr Wickremesinghe’s removal.  

“We will not stop this protest until Ranil Wickremesinghe is stepped down from the presidency and we get a president … the whole country can accept as one president,” a protester said.</span>

Mr Biden was discussing the effects of oil refinery emissions when he indicated he had cancer.

“The fact that he said he had cancer very clearly too, I think, is part of a general decline of his cognitive ability,” Mr Creighton told Sky News Australia. 

“In the 14-15 months I’ve been following his remarks closely, it’s getting worse and worse.”</span>

(CNN)Russia&#x27;s objectives in Ukraine now extend beyond the eastern Donbas region into the country&#x27;s south, a senior government minister has said. 
As the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state media that the &quot;geography is different.&quot;
&quot;It is far from being only DPR (Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic) and LPR (Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic), it is also Kherson Region, Zaporizhzhia Region and a number of other territories, and this process continues, it continues steadily and persistently,&quot; Lavrov said during an interview with RIA Novosti, published Wednesday.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi won a confidence motion in the upper house Senate on Wednesday, but three main coalition parties refused to take part in the vote, effectively torpedoing his administration. 
The motion asked the house to approve a speech made by Draghi earlier in the day, when he demanded unity from his coalition allies. 
The vote was approved by 95 to 38 with many dozens of senators absenting themselves.

* The plan asks the 27 EU nations to cut their gas consumption by 15% between 1 August 2022 and 31 March 2023. 
* The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant Gazprom claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc. 
European countries are being asked to curb their consumption of natural gas by at least 15% until next spring, as part of a wider plan to deal with reduced supplies from Russia. 
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, on Wednesday presented a strategy on how countries can prepare for the winter period, when their energy needs are much higher. 
The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant, Gazprom, claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc — a major headache for European nations given they have been so dependent on Russian energy before the invasion of Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The situation is becoming incredibly difficult in Europe. Implementing a 15% reduction in the consumption of natural gas will not only be difficult to maintain, but near impossible if Europe experiences a severe and cold winter.

   Politico: European Commission sets out joint weapon-purchase plan 
Aim is to replenish stocks of arms after many EU countries supplied Ukraine 
The European Commission laid out plans Tuesday that will allow European Union nations to jointly purchase weapons, amid growing appeals from Ukraine for more military support in their pushback against Russian forces. 
The initiative will allow the EU to replenish arms that have already been provided to Ukraine, the Commission’s Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said.

* Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin met face-to-face in Iran on Tuesday 
* It was the first meeting between the two leaders since war in Ukraine started 
* But Erdogan kept Putin waiting for 48 seconds in what appeared to be a snub 
* Putin was &#x27;humiliated&#x27;, Ukraine foreign ministry adviser said, while others said it showed how far his standing has fallen since the war 
Vladimir Putin was snubbed by Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who left him twiddling his thumbs in front of TV cameras during a summit in Iran yesterday. 
The Russian leader was holding face-to-face talks with his sometimes-ally in Tehran on Tuesday for the first time since ordering the invasion of Ukraine back in February. 
 But he was left waiting for a toe-curling 48 seconds in front of the world&#x27;s press as Erdogan failed to arrive on time for a hand-shaking photo-op.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Kissinger Warns Biden Against Endless Confrontation With China 
 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said geopolitics today requires “Nixonian flexibility” to help defuse conflicts between the US and China as well as between Russia and the rest of Europe. 
While warning that China shouldn’t become a global hegemon, the man who helped reestablish US-China ties in the 1970s said that President Joe Biden should be wary of letting domestic politics interfere with “the importance of understanding the permanence of China.” 
“Biden and previous administrations have been too much influenced by the domestic aspects of the view of China,” Kissinger, 99, said in an interview Tuesday in New York with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “It is, of course, important to prevent Chinese or any other country’s hegemony.”

You don’t need the help of someone familiar with the city’s 22 km of public beaches to have a perfect day.  But I recently enjoyed a tour from a dedicated guide around Brighton Beach, and was looking forward to sharing it with you all.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, endorsed the recommendation of a panel of vaccine experts who had unanimously approved the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.  The decision removes the final regulatory hurdle for the fourth Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the United States.
The Novavax vaccine is expected to play a limited role in the country’s vaccination campaign, at least initially.  Last week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized it as a primary vaccination for adults, but has not yet considered it for a booster shot.

You’ll find pintxo bars littered with waxy paper napkins and people munching on savory two-bite snacks, like croquetas or Spanish tortillas, on a slice of bread and skewered with a toothpick;  and sidrerías (cider bars) nestled in the verdant mountains, with patrons slicing into a forearm-sized fire-grilled steak while sipping sparkling natural cider.
