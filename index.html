                              <span>Former president Donald Trump has declared he would &quot;win&quot; in a potential 2024 GOP showdown with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, according to a new report.

The New Yorker revealed on Monday Mr Trump was &quot;very close to making a decision&quot; amid growing speculation he is about to launch a third consecutive presidential run.

The outlet asked the former president if he&#x27;s worried about the Florida governor entering the race.

“I don’t know if Ron is running, and I don’t ask him,” Trump said.

“It’s his prerogative. I think I would win.”</span>

                              <span>Russia has been building new military bases while opening gas and oil fields across the Arctic, many of them along the North-East Passage - a valuable trading route that is opening up due to melting ice which Putin hopes he will be able to monetise in the years to come, along with $30trillion in natural resources 
Daily Mail: Putin&#x27;s icy grip on Arctic &#x27;battleground of the future&#x27;: West urged to &#x27;wake up&#x27; to Russian threat as Moscow builds new military bases, races to extract natural resources worth $30trillion and exploit new shipping routes with China&#x27;s help 
* West urged to &#x27;wake up&#x27; to Russian threat in the Arctic, with dozens of new military bases built in last decade     * Putin will rely more heavily on region as Europe turns off gas supply and Western sanctions bite, report says 
* Kremlin hopes to plunder $30tr in Arctic resources, and exploit new shipping lanes opened by melting ice 
* Moscow is increasingly partnering with China in these missions, giving Beijing back-door access to region 
The West has been told to &#x27;wake up&#x27; to Russia&#x27;s growing plot to weaponise and monetise the Arctic, turning the once pristine and peaceful polar region into the &#x27;battleground of the future.&#x27; 
For years Vladimir Putin has been building airbases, missile launch pads, radar stations and naval yards north of the Artic Circle - but the region is now set to take on renewed importance after Russia was hammered by Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, which also trashed its reputation as Europe&#x27;s second-most powerful army.

Nairobi (AFP) – East African leaders met in Kenya on Monday to discuss the security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo&#x27;s violence-torn east. 
The meeting comes as heavy fighting revives decades-old animosities between Kinshasa and Kigali, with the DRC blaming neighbouring Rwanda for the recent resurgence of the M23 militia. 
Rwanda has repeatedly denied backing the rebels, while both countries have accused each other of carrying out cross-border shelling. 
After weeks of sabre-rattling, the leaders of six of the seven nations in the East African Community (EAC) met in the Kenyan capital Nairobi to discuss the way forward.

Dmytro Kuleba, Foreign Affairs: How Ukraine Will Win  
Kyiv’s Theory of Victory 
As Russia’s all-out war of aggression in Ukraine drags on for a fourth consecutive month, calls for dangerous deals are getting louder. As fatigue grows and attention wanders, more and more Kremlin-leaning commentators are proposing to sell out Ukraine for the sake of peace and economic stability in their own countries. Although they may pose as pacifists or realists, they are better understood as enablers of Russian imperialism and war crimes. 
It is only natural that people and governments lose interest in conflicts as they drag on. It’s a process that has played out many times throughout history. The world stopped paying attention to the war in Libya after former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi was toppled from power, in 2011. It disengaged from Syria, Yemen, and other ongoing conflicts that once generated front-page news. And as I know well, the rest of the world lost interest in Ukraine after 2015, even as we continued to fight Russian forces for control over the eastern part of the country.

Israel will undergo its fifth general election in only three years after the country&#x27;s ruling coalition collapsed. 
Far-right prime minister Naftali Bennett has led a polarised coalition alongside centrist party leader and foreign minister Yair Lapid, who will now take over as PM. 
Mr Bennett told the press today: &#x27;I stand here with my friend Yair Lapid, who will soon take over as prime minister in accordance with an agreement between us.&#x27;

Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - The West&#x27;s Response As It Meets With Reality 
This morning I watched an hour long discussion (vid) by &#x27;experts&#x27; at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies about assessing Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine. I have to say that these folks know nothing that is relevant. They seem to have never heard of Sun Tsu&#x27;s dictum &#x27;Know your enemy&#x27;: 
 Sun Tzu says, “To know your enemy, you must become your enemy,” but how do you become your enemy? You need to put yourself in the place of your enemy so you can predict his actions.
Not once did the CSIS people consider the view of Russia or its real intent. They talk about this or that U.S. option but do not even once consider how the other side would react to it. 
One of the CSIS &#x27;experts&#x27; says that Russia had planned to take Kiev but failed. Take Kiev with what? There were some 20-30.000 Russian soldiers near Kiev which has some 3 million inhabitants. Historically one needs one soldier for every 40 civilians to occupy a city or country after the fighting is mostly over. Russia would have needed more than two and a half times the number of troops it had around Kiev to take and hold the city.

                              <span>Reuters: Russia warns NATO-member Lithuania over Kaliningrad transit 
 LONDON (Reuters) - Russia warned NATO member Lithuania on Monday that unless the transit of goods to Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic Sea was swiftly restored then Moscow would take undisclosed measures to defend its national interests. 
With east-west relations at a half-century low over Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Vilnius banned the transit of goods sanctioned by the European Union through Lithuanian territory to and from the exclave, citing EU sanction rules. 
Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry summoned Lithuania&#x27;s top envoy in Moscow to deliver a protest while the Kremlin said the situation was beyond serious. 
&quot;The situation is more than serious,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. &quot;This decision is really unprecedented. It&#x27;s a violation of everything.&quot;  Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry demanded Vilnius reverse what it cast as an &quot;openly hostile&quot; move immediately.

New laws also increase quotas on Ukrainian-language speech and music on television and radio 
Ukraine’s parliament has voted through two laws that will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music as Kyiv seeks to break many remaining cultural ties between the two countries following Moscow’s invasion. 
One law will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, unless they renounce their Russian passport and take Ukrainian citizenship. 
The ban will only apply to those who held Russian citizenship after the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule.  It will also ban the commercial import of books printed in Russia, Belarus and occupied Ukrainian territory, while also requiring special permission for the import of books in Russian from any other country.

CNN: China claims successful anti-ballistic missile interceptor test 
Seoul, South Korea (CNN)China successfully conducted an anti-ballistic missile test on Sunday night, according to the country&#x27;s Defense Ministry, part of ongoing military efforts to enhance the country&#x27;s defensive capabilities. 
It was a land-based mid-course missile tested within China&#x27;s borders, the ministry said in a brief statement, adding the test was defensive in nature and not targeted against any country. 
Anti-ballistic missile systems are meant to shield a country from potential attacks by using projectiles to intercept incoming missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). 
Some analysts liken it to shooting down a bullet with another bullet.

Task &amp; Purpose: Russia keeps having close calls with American forces in Syria  
CENTCOM politely said that Russian forces are being &quot;provocative.&quot;  
Tensions between the United States and Russia almost spilled over into direct fighting in Syria. The Wall Street Journal reported this past week of a Russian airstrike on an American military base in Syria. No American forces were wounded or killed at the al-Tanf garrison, as they were not on site, and Russia warned the U.S. in advance, saying it was targeting forces opposed to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. It was one of several close calls in June. 
Al-Tanf, a U.S. outpost set up in southeastern Syria near Jordan. American troops have been using it as a base of operations for counterterrorism and training local allied Kurdish forces to fight remnants of ISIS. Just under 1,000 soldiers are in Syria. The exact number of troops at al-Tanf isn’t known, but reports put it at around 150-200, with the majority of Americans there being part of special operations forces.

WNU Editor: At least the Russians called the US to tell them that they were going to launch an air strike. But all that it takes is one small mistake and/or miscommunication .... and before we know it US and Russian military forces are fighting against each other.

An adviser to Ukraine&#x27;s interior minister on June 19 cited a heightened risk north of Ukraine&#x27;s second-largest city, Kharkiv, as Russian troops seek to once again make it a &quot;frontline city.&quot; 
Vadym Denysenko told Ukrainian national television that enemy forces are seeking to get closer to Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, in order to shell it. 
&quot;Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city,&quot; Denysenko said.  Within hours of his warning, Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry claimed it had struck a tank-repair plant in Kharkiv with Iskander missiles.

Former fighter in the M-19 militia beat populist business tycoon and fellow political outsider Rodolfo Hernández in runoff on Sunday 
Colombia has elected a former guerrilla fighter Gustavo Petro as president, making him the South American country’s first leftist head of state. 
Petro beat Rodolfo Hernández, a gaff-prone former mayor of Bucaramanga and business mogul, with 50.47% of the vote in a runoff election on Sunday and will take office in July amid a host of challenges, not least of which is the deepening discontent over inequality and rising costs of living. 
Hernández had 47.27%, with almost all ballots counted, according to results released by election authorities.

President Emmanuel Macron failed to win a majority in the French Parliament today as the Far-Right National Rally was expected to fill a record 89 seats, according to early projections. 
Instead, it was Marine Le Pen of the National Rally who was celebrating a massive victory, according to an early IPSOS poll.

Without access to vaccines, parents of young children have faced nearly impossible choices since the pandemic began.  Many children have been kept away from schools, family gatherings and other activities, and deprived of normal childhood experiences.  Now, all of that could change.
On Saturday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for children as young as 6 months old.  The decision means injections will be given to these young children for the first time, possibly as early as Tuesday.

Fifty years ago, NASA published a big 253-page book called “Project Cyclops”.  It summarizes the results of a NASA workshop on how to detect extraterrestrial civilizations.  What was needed, the assembled group of astronomers, engineers and biologists concluded, was Cyclops, a vast network of radio telescopes with up to a thousand antennas 100 meters in diameter.  At the time, the project would have cost $10 billion.  According to astronomers, it could detect extraterrestrial signals from as far away as 1,000 light-years away.

                              <span>For 17 years, biologist Zeb Hogan has been searching for the largest freshwater fish in the world.  On June 13, his team found it – a giant freshwater stingray, or Urogymnus polylepis.
The stingray, which emerged from the troubled waters of the Mekong in Cambodia, was 13 feet long before being returned to the river.  And at 661 pounds, it was 15 pounds heavier than a giant Mekong catfish caught in Thailand in 2005.  Dr Hogan said he had previously established that freshwater fish were the biggest ever caught.
Although this species of giant stingray has an extremely dangerous venomous barb that can grow to nearly a foot in length, it does not generally pose a threat to humans.  Most often, they end up on the market as a cheap source of protein.

This particular performance took place in December 2017, on the evening of the winter solstice, at Aunt Charlie’s Lounge, a beloved queer dive bar in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood.  The two, both now 32, were struck that evening by the age of the performers, which they estimated to be around 60 on average.
Hailing from Wisconsin and friends since meeting on Myspace when they were 14, Mr. Antheus and Mx.  Hanson, who uses a gender-neutral title and courtesy pronouns, “had a lack of queer elders growing up,” Mx.  Hanson said.

Peanut butter is a clever shorthand ingredient, used to anchor the tasty five-ingredient sauce.

(But you should make this salmon tonight.)
I was most excited for the collar, a fat cut that comes from between the gills and the head.  Jump at the chance to cook one, if you can get it from your fishmonger or someone who fishes offshore.

High-end ships are filling up
Ocean-going, river and luxury expedition ships, which tend to be much smaller than those of mainstream cruise lines, have less trouble filling space.
“Luxury has been off the charts since Covid,” Ms Fee said, noting that many are filled with bookings pushed back by canceled trips over the past two years.  “These are people who travel and realize that if I don’t rebook I will lose my chance because the ships are smaller.”
Still, there are immediate offers for the few remaining vacancies.  Until June, River Cruises Uniworld Store offers half-price fares on 20 European river itineraries, such as an eight-day Rhine cruise from Basel to Amsterdam from $2,999 pp in August, which includes an open bar and excursions, after the discount.
“A sale of this caliber is not common for us, but we are constantly monitoring booking trends and listening to our customers,” Ellen Bettridge, president and CEO of Uniworld, wrote in an email.  “As a result, we are seeing shorter booking windows continue to increase for travel in the months ahead.”
The selection is narrow on some offers. AmaWaterways, another river specialist, sells select seven-night itineraries through December from $5,499, including round-trip airfare and airport transfers, which are normally extra;  the company says the inclusions are worth more than $2,000.  The offer, valid until June 30, is available in Provenceon the Rhine and in Holland and Belgium.

                              <span>Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday that they would submit a bill next week to dissolve the country&#x27;s parliament, which if passed would trigger new elections with Lapid serving as caretaker prime minister. 
&quot;After exhausting all efforts to stabilize the coalition, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and... (Foreign Minister) Yair Lapid have decided to submit a bill&quot; dissolving parliament &quot;next week&quot;, the two leading Israeli coalition partners said in a statement. Lapid and Bennett were expected to issue statements at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)
They also said that if the bill is approved, Lapid will take over as premier of a caretaker government. 
Should that eventuate, it would be Lapid who would host US President Joe Biden during his scheduled visit to Israel next month.
The ideologically divided eight-party alliance was forged one year ago and includes religious nationalists, like Bennett, Lapid&#x27;s centrist Yesh Atid party, left-wingers and, for the first time in Israeli history, lawmakers from an Arab Islamist party.
But the coalition, cobbled together to end the tenure of divisive leader Benjamin Netanyahu, was under threat from its inception. It lost its majority in Israel&#x27;s 120-seat parliament in April when a member of Bennett&#x27;s Yamina party announced her departure.
Recent divisions over the renewal of a measure that allows Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank to live under Israeli law caused fresh friction, with some left-wingers refusing to back it.
That was anathema to hawks in the alliance, notably Justice Minister Gideon Saar, who reject any notion that West Bank settlers live outside Israel.
The Netanyahu-led opposition had warned it would submit its own bill to dissolve parliament on Wednesday but Bennett and Lapid appear to have moved to pre-empt that opposition move.

                              <span>The daughter of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has said she is concerned about her father&#x27;s welfare after his transfer to a penal camp where conditions are tougher.
&quot;No one notified the attorneys or the family about this transfer,&quot; Dasha Navalnaya told US broadcaster CNN on Monday.
&quot;It is very concerning,&quot; she said. She said the conditions where he is now are very different from those people imagine in usual prisons. &quot;This is one of the most dangerous and famous high security prisons in Russia, known for torturing and murdering the inmates,&quot; she said.
&quot;They fenced off a separate barrack in the area to really create a prison within the prison so that he can&#x27;t speak publicly and isolate him from any information,&quot; she said, calling this &quot;purely psychological torture.&quot;
Navalny, one of the most prominent critics of the Kremlin, was in quarantine after being transferred to penal colony 6 in Melekhovo near the city of Kovrov, he said last week on Instagram.
The camp has particularly harsh detention conditions and is located about 150 kilometres further away from the Pokrov penal colony, or some 260 kilometres north-east of Moscow.
At the time, his aide said she feared for his life. Navalny narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in August 2020, for which he blames Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny has made many enemies with his revelations about corruption and abuse of power in the Russian state apparatus.
In May, a court confirmed Navalny&#x27;s nine-year prison sentence for fraud. This made the transfer to a penal camp with harsher detention rules legally binding.</span>

A trial against alleged officials and members of the banned neo-Nazi network &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; has begun at the Munich I Regional Court. The men are alleged to have continued the &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; organization, which was banned by the German Ministry of the Interior in September 2000, and to have spread right-wing extremist ideas. Peter Kneffel/dpa
Alleged members of the banned neo-Nazi network &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; went on trial on Monday in the southern German city of Munich.
Prosecutors allege that senior figures in the network are among the 10 defendants, who are accused among other things of spreading right-wing extremist propaganda.
The men are accused of keeping the organization going despite the fact it was banned by the federal government in September 2000.
Some of the accused are alleged to have sold music CDs with banned right-wing rock music and merchandise with banned neo-Nazi symbols.
The public display of Nazi symbols, such as the swastika or the Hitler salute, are criminal offences in Germany.</span>

                              <span>SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The boat used by killed British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira to travel Brazil&#x27;s Amazon was found on Sunday evening, authorities said in a press statement.
The speedboat was submerged about 20 meters (65 ft) deep under the Itacoai river in the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil with the help of six sandbags, authorities said.
They added they were led to the site of boat&#x27;s sinking by the latest suspect in the killings, Jeferson da Silva Lima, or &#x27;Pelado da Dinha&#x27;, who surrendered himself to police on Saturday.
Phillips, a freelance reporter, was doing research for a book on the trip with Pereira, a former head of isolated and recently contacted tribes at federal indigenous affairs agency Funai.
They were reported missing on June 5 after traveling together by boat through the Javari Valley, a remote region bordering Peru and Colombia. According to police, both were shot with hunting ammunition.
Shock at their fate has echoed across Brazil and around the world, highlighting the overhaul of indigenous agency Funai under President Jair Bolsonaro, along with a rising tide of violence and criminal incursions on native lands.
On Sunday, police identified five more suspects for the murders.

DOLLOW, Somalia (Reuters) -Each morning in this Somali border town, 11-year-old Bashir Nur Salat plots his day&#x27;s mission behind a crooked wire fence. Armed with only a friend&#x27;s yellow school shirt, a borrowed book and toothy grin, he eyes his prize through the mesh: lunch.
Bashir lives where three crises converge - global warming, spiralling food prices and war. He, like millions of others in Somalia, are in the crosshairs of what some aid workers are calling the &quot;The Three Cs&quot;: climate change, costs and conflict.
The worst drought in four decades in war-torn Somalia forced his family to leave their farm three months ago and to move about 100 kilometers (62.5 miles) north to the town of Dollow, on the border with Ethiopia.
Now, he leads a pack of younger children who g…</span>

It also continued a trend in recent years that has seen many countries in the region swing to the left, although some would argue those are populist moves as much as ideological ones.
Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Bolivia and Honduras have all moved to the left in their last elections and Petro&#x27;s victory sparked a feeling of fraternity amongst these leaders.
&quot;Your victory validates democracy and ensures the path towards an integrated Latin America in this time when we demand maximum solidarity amongst brother peoples,&quot; said Argentina President Alberto Fernandez on Twitter.

                              <span>Pope Francis has fueled the rumor mill with a postponed Africa trip and the curious timing of an upcoming meeting of cardinals -- but experts caution against assuming a resignation is nigh.
Hobbled by pain in his knee and forced to use a wheelchair in recent weeks, the 85-year-old pontiff postponed a July trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan last week.
That move, along with an unusual decision to hold a consistory to name new cardinals during the vacation month of August, triggered intense speculation about his plans for the future, including the most radical -- that he was planning to step down.
Not so fast, many say.
&quot;In the pope&#x27;s entourage, the majority of people don&#x27;t really believe in the possibility of a resignation,&quot; a Vatican source told AFP.

                              <span>Allies of French President Emmanuel Macron started working Monday to cobble together a working parliamentary majority to salvage his second term, after his alliance crumbled in the election against surges from the left and far-right. 
Macron&#x27;s Ensemble (Together) coalition emerged as the largest party in parliamentary elections but was dozens of seats short of keeping the parliamentary majority it had enjoyed for the last five years.
It will now begin work to try and find a majority by forming deals with other parties on the right, stirring up turmoil unprecedented in French politics in recent years.
Macron, 44, now also risks being distracted by domestic problems as he seeks to play a prominent role in putting an end to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and as a key statesman in the EU.

                              <span>A Japanese court ruled on Monday that the country&#x27;s failure to recognize same-sex marriage is constitutional, in a setback for activists after a landmark verdict last year found the opposite.
The district court in western Japan&#x27;s Osaka rejected arguments made by three same-sex couples as part of a series of suits filed by activists seeking marriage equality.
&quot;From the perspective of individual dignity, it can be said that it is necessary to realize the benefits of same-sex couples being publicly recognized through official recognition,&quot; the court ruling said.
But the present failure to recognize such unions is &quot;not considered to violate... the Constitution&quot;, the ruling added, saying &quot;public debate on what kind of system is appropriate for this has not been thoroughly carried out&quot;.
The verdict comes after a district court in northern Sapporo last year found the opposite, ruling that the government&#x27;s failure to allow same-sex marriage violated the constitution&#x27;s provision guaranteeing equality under the law.
That ruling was welcomed by campaigners as a major victory that would pile pressure on lawmakers to accept same-sex unions.
Japan&#x27;s constitution stipulates that &quot;marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes&quot;.
But in recent years, local authorities across the country have made moves to recognize same-sex partnerships, although such recognition does not carry the same rights as marriage under the law.
The prefecture of Tokyo last month said it would begin recognizing same-sex partnerships from November, revising current rules.
More than a dozen couples filed suits seeking marriage equality in 2020 in district courts across Japan. They said the coordinated action was intended to put pressure on the only G7 government that does not recognize gay unions.

Several allies - including Cabinet ministers - of French President Emmanuel Macron are being forced to resign after losing their legislative seats in a less-than-stellar showing for the president&#x27;s centrist bloc at weekend elections.
Macron&#x27;s La Republique en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) had hoped to build on his recent re-election and score a parliamentary majority in this month&#x27;s elections, so the president would be able to push through his policies.
Instead, Sunday&#x27;s run-off vote left LREM with 245 of 577 seats, making it the largest bloc, but still reliant on other parties if it hopes to get key legislation passed.
Before the vote, LRE…</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday that there was no point having any nuclear arms reduction talks with the United States and that Moscow should wait until the Americans begged for negotiations. Russia and the United States, by far the world&#x27;s biggest nuclear powers, have negotiated a series of major strategic nuclear arms reduction treaties since Ronald Reagan came to power in 1981. But Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most serious disruption in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when many people feared the...</span>

As domestic pressure mounted on him to intervene in the WikiLeaks founder&#x27;s case, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he is sticking to comments he made while in opposition last year that &quot;enough is enough&quot;.
&quot;I do not see what purpose is served by the ongoing pursuit of Mr Assange,&quot; Albanese said at the time.
But the Australian leader took a swipe at &quot;people who think that if you put things in capital letters on Twitter and put an exclamation mark, then that somehow makes it more important&quot;.

Under a sweltering sun, 84-year-old Nguyen Co looks out from the stone steps of a temple on Ly Son Island off the coast of central Vietnam. A broad grin spreads across his leathery face, even as he turns his gaze to a huge mound where a six-metre-long whale lies buried - the sea creature he has come to worship.
Co is the leader of a group of worshippers on the island who pray to whale spirits, asking for a good catch and protection at sea.
Dressed in a striking red-and-gold traditional áo dài, a long tunic worn over trousers, Co explains whales have been known to rescue fishermen caught in storms at sea.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy predicted Russia will escalate its attacks this week as European Union leaders consider whether to back Kyiv&#x27;s bid to join the bloc and Moscow presses its campaign to win control of the country&#x27;s east.
&quot;Obviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities,&quot; Zelenskiy said in his Sunday nightly video address. &quot;We are preparing. We are ready.&quot;
Ukraine applied to join the EU four days after Russian troops poured across its border in February. The EU&#x27;s executive, the European Commission, on Friday recommended that Ukraine receive candidate status.

A report by The Australian suggests 41 asylum seekers are due to be flown from Christmas Island back to Colombo. 

After being granted bail by a Sri Lankan court, one woman said she decided to make the journey after being told by people smugglers the new Australian government would allow them to stay, according to The Australian. 

Food shortages due to the ongoing economic crisis have caused an influx of people trying to leave Sri Lanka.</span>

Reuters: U.S. drone sale to Ukraine hits snag - sources 
ST LOUIS, Missouri (Reuters) - The Biden administration&#x27;s plan to sell four large, armable drones to Ukraine has been paused on the fear its sophisticated surveillance equipment might fall into enemy hands, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The technical objection to the sale was raised during a deeper review by the Pentagon&#x27;s Defense Technology Security Administration charged with keeping high value technology safe from enemy hands. Previously the plan, which has been circulating since March, had been approved by the White House, three people said. 
The plan to sell Ukraine four MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones that can be armed with Hellfire missiles for battlefield use against Russia was first reported by Reuters earlier in June.

NBC: The Navy has fired a dozen leaders but won&#x27;t explain why  
A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including five in one week, the Navy said.
 The Navy has fired nearly a dozen officers in leadership positions in less than three months, including five in one week, due to a “loss of confidence” in their ability to command — an unusual string of terminations across land, air and sea teams, experts said.  At least nine commanding officers and two senior advisers have been relieved of their duties since April, when a cluster of suicides on the USS George Washington warship sparked widespread concerns of a mental health crisis.  A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including 12 in the Navy and one in the Marine Corps, the Navy said. Most recently, four Naval commanding officers and a top leader were ousted from June 8 to June 14.

                              <span>BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian federal police on Sunday said that five more suspects helped hide the bodies of British journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, after having already arrested three men for their murder in the Amazon rainforest.
The police did not name the new suspects, adding in a short statement that ongoing investigations aim to &quot;clarify all the circumstances, motives and those involved in the case&quot;.
So far, Amarildo da Costa Oliveira, a fisherman who police say confessed to killing the two victims, his brother, Oseney da Costa, and a third man, Jeferson da Silva Lima, have been arrested.
Phillips, a freelance reporter who had written for the Guardian and the Washington Post, was doing research for a book on the trip with Pereira, a former head of isolated and recently contacted tribes at federal indigenous affairs agency Funai.
They were reported missing on June 5 after traveling together by boat through the Javari Valley, a remote region bordering Peru and Colombia. According to police, both were shot with hunting ammunition.
Shock at their fate has echoed across Brazil and around the world, highlighting the overhaul of indigenous agency Funai under President Jair Bolsonaro, along with a rising tide of violence and criminal incursions on native lands.

                              <span>By Mimosa Spencer and Gilles Guillaume PARIS (Reuters) -Voting was underway in France on Sunday in a parliamentary election that could deprive newly re-elected centrist President Emmanuel Macron of the absolute majority he needs to govern with a free hand. Initial projections were expected at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) from the election that could change the face of French politics. Turnout by midday was a bit stronger - at 18.99% - than at the same time during a first round of voting last Sunday and than in 2017, when it reached only 18.43% and 17.75% respectively. Macron won a second term in presiden...</span>

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron may find himself without a ruling majority during his second term and unable to push through his economic reform agenda with a free hand after a new left-wing alliance did well in the first round of voting.
The second round will be held on Sunday. Here are three possible outcomes.

Scared off by increasingly strident warnings against Jean-Luc Melenchon&#x27;s radical left platform, voters elect more than 289 Macron-supported candidates to parliament.

                              <span>If the Browns were looking to trade Watson, he would have to waive the no-trade clause in his contract and sign his new destination, as he did when he left Houston.  Either way, a deal would be difficult to strike, as many teams would be reluctant to accept his salary, and the majority of clubs have solidified their quarterback rooms in the draft and free agency.
The outright release of Watson without meaningful return seems unlikely due to Cleveland’s efforts to acquire him and because the Browns lack a long-term succession plan.
The team has excused its former starter, Baker Mayfield, from his offseason program as the front office seeks to trade him, and current replacement, journeyman Jacoby Brissett, is not considered a multi-year starter.  The best way forward for the Browns, said Bill Polian, the former Buffalo Bills and Indianapolis Colts general manager who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015, is to wait for the NFL’s final decision.
“They have no choice,” Polian said.  “The facts are what they are.”
At an NFL meeting in Atlanta in May, commissioner Roger Goodell said the league’s personal conduct investigation was “nearing its conclusion” and the process would soon be turned over to a disciplinary officer.  The NFL can sanction Watson regardless of the outcome of the lawsuits against him if it believes he violated the league’s personal conduct policy.
How did Browns fans react?
Browns fans, deprived of the satisfaction of a championship since 1964, are unhappy, if not close to mutiny.
“It’s just sickening,” said lifelong Browns fan Robyn Lockner, 51. 
Lockner, who runs the Cleveland Browns Women’s Group on Facebook, said the allegations against Watson made it that much harder to be a Browns fan.  “You slap your female fan base in the face;  that’s kind of how I felt,” she said.

Among them: Each has had a generational player vying for Mount Rushmore in their position.
In the 1980s, Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics faced Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Los Angeles Lakers.  Michael Jordan’s Bulls ruled the ’90s, then passed a wavering torch — a championship here and there, but never twice in a row — to the San Antonio Spurs with Tim Duncan.
Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant snuck in a Lakers hat-trick in the early 2000s.
And then there was…none.  There were other all-time players – LeBron James, of course.  And James’s Heat came one step closer to becoming champions in 2012 and 2013, but fell apart soon af…</span>

                              <span>RFE: Lithuania Bans Transit Of Sanctioned Russian Goods To Kaliningrad 
Lithuania has begun a ban on the rail transit of goods subject to European Union sanctions to the Russian far-western exclave of Kaliningrad, transport authorities in the Baltic nation said on June 18. 
The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials, and advanced technology. 
Anton Alikhanov, the governor of the Russian oblast, said the ban would cover around 50 percent of the items that Kaliningrad imports. 
Alikhanov said the region, which has an ice-free port on the Baltic Sea, will call on Russian federal authorities to take tit-for-tat measures against the EU country for imposing the ban. He said he would also seek to have more goods sent by ship to the oblast.

                              <span>DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Saturday told the United Arab Emirates that Tehran gave a high priority to improving ties with its neighbours, Iranian state media reported, a day after the UAE voiced concern over Tehran&#x27;s nuclear programme.
The UAE&#x27;s envoy at the United Nations&#x27; nuclear watchdog on Friday said he hoped Iran would work with the body to provide reassurances to the international community and the region about Tehran&#x27;s nuclear programme.
In a phone call with his UAE counterpart, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian &quot;pointed to the priority of neighbours in Iran&#x27;s foreign policy and called for more consultation ... to expand bilateral ties,&quot; state media said.
In 2019, U.S.-allied UAE started engaging with Iran after years of tense relations.
Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear deal have stalled since March and Tehran has restricted the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s ability to monitor the Iranian nuclear programme after a dispute with the U.N. watchdog.

                              <span>An iceberg trade is most often executed by large institutional investors.
Iceberg orders, also known as reverse orders, are primarily used by market makers, which is another word for an individual or company that provides bids and bids.  When it comes to such large crypto transactions, we are mostly talking about institutional crypto investors.  They often trade large amounts of cryptocurrencies, which can have a huge impact on the market.
As an observer, it is possible to look for the order in the order books, but only a small part of the iceberg orders of the market makers are visible on the level 2 order books. Level 2, in the crypto world, contains all bids and asks on an exchange, including price, volume, and timestamp — this is real-time data collection.
They call it the tip of the iceberg for a reason: the rest of the order is “below the surface of the water”.  For small investors like private traders, placing an iceberg order is unusual.
