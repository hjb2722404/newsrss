Damascus (AFP) - Syria&#x27;s foreign ministry on Sunday condemned a surprise visit by the United States&#x27; top military officer to an army base in the Kurdish-held northeast, dubbing it &quot;illegal&quot;, state media said.
In his snap visit Saturday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met US troops stationed in areas of war-torn Syria under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
About 900 US troops are deployed in several bases and posts across northeastern Syria as part of the fight against Islamic State group remnants.
Official news agency SANA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying &quot;Syria strongly condemns the illegal…</span>

                              <span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself against a possible nuclear attack from Iran during a Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday.

Netanyahu was responding to remarks from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi after the IAEA and Iran reached agreement on Saturday on inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.
&quot;International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi just said in Tehran that an Israeli attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities is against the law,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;Against which law?&quot;
He noted that Iran openly called for the destruction of Israel and said that it was clear that Israel was allowed to defend itself.
&quot;I say this because nothing will deter us from defending our country and preventing our enemies from eliminating the state of the Jews,&quot; Netanyahu said.
On Saturday, the IAEA and Iran&#x27;s Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI) announced that experts from the UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog would be permitted to carry out closer inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.
The IAEA&#x27;s cameras would also to be put back into operation, after they and other monitoring equipment were dismantled last year, Grossi said.
Since the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal that restricted uranium enrichment, Iran has enriched uranium to a purity level of 60%, raising international concerns that it was close to being able to build a nuclear weapon.
Israel is convinced that Iran is working to develop a nuclear weapon and sees its existence as threatened. Israeli leaders have repeatedly said they will not allow Iran to become a nuclear power and have refused to rule out a preventive strike.</span>

But Netanyahu also pushed back against censure of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, accusing foreign powers of playing down Palestinian violence like the Feb. 26 killing of two Israeli brothers in Huwara village that sparked a settler rampage there.

DNYUZ/New York Times: They’re Exporting Billions in Arms. Just Not to Ukraine. 
CHANGWON, South Korea — A year after Russia invaded Ukraine, the war has spurred a global effort to produce more missiles, tanks, artillery shells and other munitions. And few countries have moved as quickly as South Korea to increase output. 
Last year, South Korea’s arms exports rose 140 percent to a record $17.3 billion, including deals worth $12.4 billion to sell ​tanks, ​howitzers, ​fighter jets and multiple rocket launchers to Poland, one of Ukraine’s closest allies. 
But as South Korea expands weapons sales globally, it has refused to send lethal assistance to Ukraine itself. Instead, it has focused on filling the world’s rearmament gap while resisting any direct role in arming Ukraine, imposing strict export control rules on all its sales.

Citing a Feb. 16 congressional hearing, a DoD report reveals that 77% of Americans in the above age group could not physically qualify to enter the armed forces - a 6% increase from 2017.

Polling stations reopened this morning in Estonia as the country votes in its first general election since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine last year. 
The centre-right Reform Party of Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, one of Europe’s most outspoken supporters of Ukraine, is a favourite to win.
She faces a challenge from the far-right opposition Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia, or EKRE, which is seeking to limit the Baltic nation&#x27;s exposure to the Ukraine crisis and is blaming the government for citizens&#x27; economic misery.

Republic World: China Calls US &#x27;largest Nuclear Threat&#x27; To World, Says It Must Fulfill Key Duty To Disarm 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that the US was using the alleged nuclear threat posed by China as a pretext to expand its own arsenal. 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, stated that the United States needs to reconsider its security policy regarding nuclear weapons since it poses the world&#x27;s largest nuclear threat. During a news briefing on Friday, Ning suggested that the US should prioritize its duty to disarm and take practical measures to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in its national security policy. Additionally, she emphasized the need for the US to take steps towards minimizing nuclear risks.
According to a report from TASS, her exact statement was &quot;the United States is the world&#x27;s largest source of nuclear threat. It should carefully rethink its nuclear policy, diligently fulfill its special and primary duty to disarm, thus reducing the role of nuclear weapons in the national security policy, and take meaningful practical steps to ease nuclear risks&quot;.

Mr Trump also vowed that he and his supporters would &quot;never go back&quot; to a Republican Party run by &quot;freaks and fools&quot; who had engaged in &quot;endless foreign wars&quot;. 
The former president said America should stop spending billions of dollars on defending Ukraine, that he would end the war in &quot;one day&quot; if elected, and demanded that Nato allies pay more toward the cost of the conflict.

US-NATO response to fall of Bakhmut is likely an assault on Crimea, which in turn will spark Russian attacks on Eastern Europe  
Ukrainian forces are pulling out of Bakhmut and the battle for the small Donetsk city is nearly finished. So what happens next? 
There appear to be two stages to the Bakhmut pullout. The first started perhaps a month ago, though that isn’t certain. The troops pulled out comprised foreign fighters and Yellow Armband troops. 
The Russians say they have not seen any foreign fighters for about a month. Most of these were said to be from Georgia and Abkhazia. (Abkhazia is the area in Georgia carved out by the Russians and declared an independent entity.)

The multi-day, table top exercises have been carried out at a war-gaming facility at a U.S. Army base in Wiesbaden, Germany, where the top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, visited on Thursday. 
U.S. officials declined to talk through the potential battlefield scenarios that Ukrainian military staff were examining during the drills, which involve thought exercises to evaluate potential military courses of action.

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has inspected one of the command centers coordinating the military operation in Ukraine, the ministry said on Saturday. The minister flew by helicopter to meet with service members from the ‘Vostok’ (East) combat group at an undisclosed location in the “South Donetsk direction.” 
Shoigu discussed the work of medical units and broader supply issues. He emphasized the need to house troops in secure quarters, according to a statement from the Defense Ministry. The minister handed out medals, thanking soldiers and officers for “fighting admirably.”

WNU Editor: Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu is a high priority target for the Ukraine military. He would not be in Ukraine if the situation was a threat to him and/or the Russian military was not in complete control. This is a strong indication to me that the tide of the war may be shifting in Moscow&#x27;s favor. 
On another note. You cannot tell much from a one minute video that has been heavily edited, but it looks like the war has significantly aged the Russian Defense Minister. He had the appearance of a man who is always in meetings 24/7, making life and death decisions that will impact thousands.

                              <span>Reuters: Ukraine&#x27;s economy stabilizes after shock of war 
KYIV (Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, the shelves of the Novus supermarket chain in Kyiv quickly emptied as its supply chains - domestic and overseas - collapsed.
Fresh produce became scarce and panic buying spread.  Oleksiy Panasenko, deputy director general for operations at the popular outlet, recalls how the business reeled before Novus, like many other large retail chains, managed to adapt. 
&quot;On the second day (of the war), there was already fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;In February and March, our shops became more than a place to buy food: they were a place to meet, to communicate; so-called islands of stability.&quot;

WNU Editor: Aside from the retail sector, there is no Ukraine economy. The industrial base has been more or less destroyed. The official inflation rate is around 30%, but everyone I know in Ukraine is telling me the rate is significantly higher. The official unemployment rate is over 35%, but again everyone I know in Ukraine is telling me that it is much higher. The entire country is dependent on Western aid and debt at a level that is simply not sustainable. And as for investment. Not going to happen as this war grinds on.

France is staging its biggest military exercises to date – an operation involving 12,000 troops including NATO allies. 
The first leg of the Orion 2023 war games started on 23 February and will last until 11 March. The drills come one year after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. 
&quot;The geopolitical context justifies this exercise,&quot; says Yves Metayer, commander of the troop deployment division at the French chiefs of staff. 
He adds that the plan has been in the works since 2020 and builds on the French Ministry of Defence&#x27;s 2017 Strategic Review of Defence and National Security.

The United States and South Korea are planning to hold new military exercises starting on March 13 for an 11-day period, the US Forces Korea (USFK) said on Friday. 
Field exercises will be integrated into the staff exercise, which is based on computer simulations, according to USFK. 
A series of field exercises, called Warrior Shield FTX, are already underway, a USFK spokesman said. 
It was initially unclear how many soldiers would be deployed in the exercises, which seek to improve military cooperation between the two countries&#x27; armed forces through &quot;air, land, sea, space, cyber and special operations,&quot; he said.

Milley believes an &quot;enduring defeat&quot; of ISIS is possible, but didn&#x27;t say how far away that is.   Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, made an unexpected visit to U.S. forces in Syria. 
The top general visited American troops in the country’s northeast to hear from them about how the fight against ISIS is going. The visit also comes after recent attacks on bases housing American soldiers. 
Milley was asked by reporters if the mission in Syria was worth the risk, per Reuters. He directly connected U.S. presence in the country with the nation’s national security. 
“If you think that that’s important, then the answer is ‘Yes,’” he said. ”I happen to think that’s important.”

The National People&#x27;s Congress is set to open on Saturday and expected to continue for approximately two weeks as delegates rubber-stamp a reshuffling of personnel. 
The legislative meeting — an annual event commonly called the &quot;two sessions&quot; — is expected to see major shake-ups at the top levels of party leadership.

Estonia led charge calling for tribunal to examine potential Russian war crimes 
UNITED NATIONS, New York — Estonia has criticized NATO allies for not doing enough to continue supporting Ukraine as Russia’s invasion drags on past the one-year mark, and it also raised concerns that the U.N. may not be able to fulfill its duty in holding those in power responsible for alleged war crimes. 
&quot;Members have not done enough,&quot; Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. 
&quot;This is my comprehensive assessment.&quot;  &quot;The Western camp has supported weapons aid, given around 50 billion euros approximately, and this is far from being satisfying,&quot; Reinsalu added. &quot;If we want to invest to Ukrainian victory, not only to invest to Ukraine, that they can survive and not lose, we have to change the paradigm of our support.&quot;

Thomas Meaney, New York Times: In Ukraine, the United States Is In Over Its Head 
The greatest blunder President Vladimir Putin may have made so far in Ukraine is giving the West the impression that Russia could lose the war. The early Russian strike on Kyiv stumbled and failed. The Russian behemoth seemed not nearly as formidable as it had been made out to be. The war suddenly appeared as a face-off between a mass of disenchanted Russian incompetents and supercharged, savvy Ukrainian patriots. 
Such expectations naturally ratcheted up Ukrainian war aims. President Volodymyr Zelensky was once a member of the peace-deal camp in Ukraine. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,” he declared one month into the conflict. Now he calls for complete victory: the reconquering of every inch of Russian-occupied territory, including Crimea. Polls indicate that Ukrainians will settle for nothing less. As battles rage across Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine’s leaders and some of their Western backers are already dreaming of Nuremberg-style trials of Mr. Putin and his inner circle in Moscow.

VOA: US Army Secretary Lays Out Strategy for War with China  
Washington — The Biden administration official with direct responsibility for the U.S. Army laid out in surprising detail this week a multi-pronged strategy for deterring, and if necessary, prevailing in any future war with China. 
“I personally am not of the view that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent,” U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on Monday. “But we obviously have to prepare, to be prepared to fight and win that war.” 
Elements of the plan include placing more troops in Asia and arming them with upgraded equipment, including ship-to-shore vessels and hypersonic weapons, much of which will be pre-positioned in the region.

 El Pais: Ukraine outgunned 10 to 1 in massive artillery battle with Russia 
 Kyiv urgently requires ammunition as the Kremlin seeks a breakthrough on the eastern front, where Moscow is sending waves of infantry to deplete the defenders’ stocks of heavy shells 
The Ukraine war has become a ferocious battle dominated by artillery and Ukrainian forces are operating at a huge disadvantage: Russia has numerical superiority of 10 heavy guns to every one at the disposal of Kyiv. Furthermore, Ukraine is running low on ammunition and requires urgent supplies of shells, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government has warned. 
On the Luhansk front, at one of the Ukrainian army’s advanced positions in the area around the occupied city of Kreminna where the fighting is particularly intense, an artillery brigade is busy tuning a TRF1 howitzer cannon installed amid their sodden trenches. They received the French 155mm gun a few months ago and it is proving key to repelling Russian troops. But as the war enters its second year, Kyiv is in desperate need of fresh materiel. “We need more; we need all the ammunition they can provide. And we need it now,” says Sergey, the brigade commander, anchored next to the cannon in the mud.

WNU editor: My father commanded an artillery unit in the Second World War. He always credited Soviet artillery as the reason why Germany was defeated on the Eastern front. And the stats back my father. In the last two years of that war, artillery strikes accounted for 70% of all combat casualties. I suspect the same thing is happening right now in the Russia - Ukraine war.</span>

Defense News: Pentagon orders engine vibration fix for entire F-35 fleet worldwide 
WASHINGTON — All F-35 fighter jets should be retrofitted within 90 days with a fix intended to solve a potential engine vibration problem, the F-35 Joint Program Office said Thursday. 
The JPO issued an order Wednesday evening recommending the fleetwide retrofit — globally, not just American aircraft — over the next three months, as well as immediately putting it in place for a “small number” of fighters that have been grounded since December.

Bloomberg: Putin Orders New Rules for Defense Firms in Case of Martial Law 
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Friday laying out new rules for tightening control of companies that fail to fulfill defense contracts in the event martial law is imposed, the latest step in the Kremlin’s preparations for militarizing the economy as its invasion of Ukraine stretches into a second year. 
Under the decree, the state would get the power to take over firms that fail to meet their obligations under military contracts during the period of martial law, suspending the rights of owners and shareholders. 
A government working group is to be set up on the operations of arms companies under martial law, according to the order, the text of which was published Friday.

In a letter addressed to his counterparts in the European Union, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov called for 250,000 artillery shells per month to be sent to Ukraine.

WNU Editor: For the past few weeks I have been reading reports that Ukraine is using 3,000 to 7,000 artillery shells a day, and the Russian military is using anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 shells a day. Even at 250,000 shells a day, Ukraine will not have enough to match what Russia is using.</span>

                              <span>A mob of men wielding sticks and knives attacked a shelter for LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers from sub-Saharan Africa on February 23. Police called to the site arrested at least eight people from sub-Saharan Africa, even though they have refugee status and are therefore legal residents in Tunisia. This is the latest violence to occur in a climate of growing hostility towards Black Africans, spurred by a campaign of repression by the authorities and xenophobic comments made by the Tunisian president.</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) — Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has paid a rare visit to Russia&#x27;s forces deployed in Ukraine, awarding medals to military personnel and meeting senior commanders during the trip, a statement and videos issued by his ministry showed on Saturday. 
Russia&#x27;s top military chiefs have visited front lines in Ukraine only sparingly since Moscow sent tens of thousands of Russian troops into the neighbouring country just over a year ago in what it calls a &quot;special military operation&quot;.</span>

Earlier this week, several companies announced that Canada&#x27;s federal health agency had allowed them to produce and sell cocaine.
The announcement came a month after the province of British Columbia launched an experimental decriminalization process meant to address an opioid overdose crisis that has killed thousands.
The province decriminalized the possession -- but not sale -- of small amounts of cocaine and other hard drugs, under a three-year pilot project, with the aim of removing the stigma associated with drug use that keeps people from seeking help.

                              <span>Scores of disemboweled sharks have washed up on a South African beach putting the spotlight on a pair of shark-hunting killer whales whose behaviour has fascinated scientists and wildlife enthusiasts.
Marine biologists were alerted to the find by beach walkers who stumbled upon the grim sight last week in Gansbaai, a small fishing port 150 kilometers (93 miles) south east of Cape Town.
&quot;The dead sharks are torn open at the pelvic girdle, they have Orca teeth marks known as rake marks on their pectoral fins and their liver is missing,&quot; said Alison Towner, 37, a shark scientist with the Dyer Island Conservation Trust.
All evidence points to &quot;Port&quot; and &quot;Starboard&quot;, an infamous pair of killer whales spotted off Gansbaai only three days earlier.

                              <span>Olive oil, fragrant rose and orange blossom: the special &quot;chrism&quot; or holy anointing oil for the coronation of Britain&#x27;s King Charles III has been blessed in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City.
Friday&#x27;s ceremony was carried out at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe Jesus was buried.
&quot;The chrism oil which will be used to anoint His Majesty The King on May 6 2023 has been consecrated in Jerusalem,&quot; Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
The unique mix was &quot;perfumed with essential oils&quot;, and also included extracts of sesame, jasmine and cinnamon, it added.
Based on the same ingredients as the oil used at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, it is based on a formula &quot;which has been used for hundreds of years&quot;, the palace said Friday.
The oil, which will also be used to anoint Queen Consort Camilla, the wife of King Charles III, was consecrated in a special by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, and the Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum.
Now stored in an ornate silver flask, the oil came from the Mount of Olives, the ridge overlooking the walled Old City.
The olives were harvested from two groves, the Monastery of the Ascension and the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, where Charles III&#x27;s grandmother is buried, Princess Alice of Greece.
The olives were pressed just outside the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican church, said the coronation oil reflects Charles III&#x27;s &quot;personal family connection with the Holy Land&quot;, the palace statement added.
Welby, who will carry out the coronation service, said the oil signified the &quot;deep historic link between the coronation, the Bible and the Holy Land&quot;.
&quot;From ancient kings through to the present day, monarchs have been anointed with oil from this sacred place,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Africa&#x27;s National Olympic Committees have followed their Asian counterparts in giving the green light on Saturday for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Russia and its ally Belarus have been sidelined from most Olympic sports since Russian forces invaded Ukraine last February.
However, in January the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was seeking a &quot;pathway&quot; for Russians to take part in the Games.
Following that announcement, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) offered athletes from both countries the chance to compete in this year&#x27;s Asian Games.
That was a significant move because they could gain qualifying marks in competition in Asia to allow them to compete in Paris.
Africa has now followed suit.

Researchers believe they have found the earliest evidence of horseback riding, by the ancient Yamnaya people in Europe some 5,000 years ago.
Their conclusions, based on an analysis of human skeletal remains found in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, were published on Friday in the journal Science Advances.
Domestication of horses for milk is widely accepted to have begun around 3500 BC to 3000 BC, the study said, but the &quot;origins of horseback riding remain elusive.&quot;
The researchers from the University of Helsinki and other European institutions date the earliest horsemanship to 3000 BC to 2500 BC among members of the Yamnaya culture.
&quot;Our findings provide a strong argument that horseback riding was already a common activity for some Yamnaya individual…</span>

                              <span>Rafael Vinoly, a Uruguayan-born and New York-based architect known for designing landmark buildings around the world, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Friday.
Vinoly&#x27;s death Thursday was announced by his son Roman on the website of the family firm, Rafael Vinoly Architects.
&quot;He was a visionary who will be missed by all those whose lives he touched through his work,&quot; the son&#x27;s statement said.
Vinoly&#x27;s sometimes controversial work features more than 600 structures around the world, including office and residential buildings, hotels, concert halls, stadiums and airports.
One of his better known works is the so-called Walkie Talkie building in London -- an almost cartoonish skyscraper that is broader at the top than the bottom and looks like it is sagging. 
Britain&#x27;s Manchester City football team, for which Vinoly designed its training ground, called City Football Academy, expressed its condolences on Twitter.
Some of Vinoly&#x27;s projects have drawn criticism.
One is 432 Park Avenue, an 85-floor residential building in Manhattan, some of whose multi-millionaire tenants have sued over what they say are banging and creaking noises and vibrations coming from the building.
In London, the Walkie Talkie building at 20 Fenchurch Street raised eyebrows in 2013 because sunlight reflected off its mirrored concave side melted various parts on a Jaguar car parked nearby.
&quot;He leaves a rich legacy of distinctive and timeless designs that manifested in some of the world&#x27;s most recognizable and iconic structures,&quot; Roman Vinoly wrote.

                              <span>When &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; first premiered back in September, there was little to suggest it was about to wage an all-out campaign for Oscar votes.
The German-language World War I film comes from Netflix, which had a roster of far more expensive &quot;prestige&quot; movies primed for Academy Award pushes, from Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu&#x27;s &quot;Bardo&quot; to the star-studded &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.&quot;
But while those have largely fallen by the wayside, with one nomination each, &quot;All Quiet&quot; has emerged from the crowded trenches of awards season hopefuls as an Oscars frontrunner, with nine nods, including for much-coveted best picture honors.
&quot;It really feels like a wave of joy and luck that has come over us,&quot; director Edward Berger told AFP, days before his film wo…</span>

                              <span>German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann has resolved to remove any remaining terms from the Nazi era from the statute books.
In a letter to his departmental colleagues, he recently pointed out &quot;that there are still laws and ordinances that use terminology from the Nazi era or in which the &#x27;Reich&#x27; is mentioned,&quot; the lawyer told Sunday&#x27;s edition of Die Welt newspaper in comments seen in advance by dpa.
The linguistic remnants appear in laws ranging from those on banking to practitioners of alternative medicine, he said.
&quot;My goal is to eliminate these pre-constitutional remnants,&quot; the politician from the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) continued. For example, he said, there are still formulations in the criminal code for the offences of murder and manslaughter that go back to a &quot;National Socialist theory of types of perpetrators.&quot;
&quot;In general, I have set myself the goal this year of bringing the entire special section of the criminal code up to date,&quot; the justice said.
In the end, it is always up to the legislators to decide. However, he sees &quot;a great openness&quot; in the ruling coalition in which his party is the junior partner with the Greens and the Social Democrats (SPD).</span>

MALATYA, Turkey (Reuters) - The Trend Garden Residence, an upscale serviced apartment building in the Turkish city of Malatya, boasted a gym, freshly-furnished rooms and a roof-top cafeteria.
But when a powerful earthquake jolted the city in the early hours of Feb. 6, the seven-floored building disintegrated, killing 29 people, according to two government officials. It was as if the structure had “liquefied,” one survivor said.
Beneath its colourful facade, the building had been extensively remodelled a few years ago without the necessary permits, but was later registered thanks to a 2018 zoning amnesty promulgated by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to a Reuters review of municipal and amnesty documents, architects drawings an…</span>

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At around 11 a.m. on Feb 14, some 20 Indian tax officials and police burst into the BBC&#x27;s offices in New Delhi, shouting at staff to step away from their computers and hand over their mobile phones, according to two people present.
At the company&#x27;s bureau in India&#x27;s financial capital, Mumbai, tax officials launched a second raid. The government said the BBC had failed to respond to repeated requests to clarify its tax affairs related to the profits and remittances from its Indian operations.
The BBC has said it is cooperating fully with tax authorities and hopes to resolve matters quickly, adding its journalists would continue to report &quot;without fear or favour&quot;. It declined to comment for this story.

&quot;Over 1,000 allegedly fraudulent paintings have been seized. The total number produced and sold is unknown,&quot; Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Kari Dart told a news conference.
Some of the paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars to unsuspecting buyers across Canada and internationally.

The choice of the two European nations and close allies is widely seen as an attempt to build post-Brexit bridges and an acknowledgement of the affection the late Queen Elizabeth II had for France.
The visits will take place from March 26 to March 31, ahead of the king&#x27;s coronation on May 6.
The tour &quot;will celebrate Britain&#x27;s relationship with France and Germany, marking our shared histories, culture and values,&quot; the palace said.
Charles and his wife Camilla will be in France from March 26 to March 29, and will join President Emmanuel Macron for a ceremony of remembrance and wreath laying at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

                              <span>Daily Mail: A shot over China&#x27;s bows? Incredible moment Air Force breaks ship IN HALF with a single 2,000 pound &#x27;quicksink&#x27; bomb dropped by F-15E Strike Eagle with &#x27;torpedo-like&#x27; accuracy 
* The bomb, a JDAM, tested in the video  is called the Quicksink because of the rate at which it sinks ships 
* The JDAM is a relatively inexpensive way to convert unguided bombs into all-weather precision-guided munitions 
* An F-15E Strike Eagle fighter launched the modified bomb, successfully striking the target by detonating a GPS-navigated bomb underneath the vessel 
Recently released footage shows the decimation of a cargo ship by a 2,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munition dropped by the Air Force from an F-15E Strike Eagle. 
In the roughly one-minute video taken last April, an old, derelict cargo ship - the Courageous - is seen floating in the Gulf of Mexico.
Moments later a JDAM approaches from above and the Courageous is literally lifted out of the water and split in half, as waves begin to crash on the decks.

                              <span>James Rikards, Daily Reckoning: One of the Biggest Propaganda Campaigns Ever  
It’s extremely difficult to find the truth about the war in Ukraine. 
The first reason for this is because… it’s a war. Wars are always difficult to gauge in real-time. The phrase “fog of war” was invented to convey the uncertainty and imprecision about the progress of any particular war. 
Still, there’s another reason the war in Ukraine is confusing for so many. 
It’s because the Ukrainian propaganda effort is one of the most astonishingly effective concoctions of lies ever seen. 
From the “Ghost of Kyiv” fighter ace to the “Heroes of Snake Island” to wildly exaggerated claims of Russian casualties to the suppression of any news that reflects badly on Ukraine, the Ukrainian propaganda machine has been firing on…</span>

Peter Frankopan, Spectator: Is Putin winning? The world order is changing in his favour 
‘This is not about Ukraine at all, but the world order,’ said Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a month after the invasion. ‘The unipolar world is irretrievably receding into the past … A multi-polar world is being born.’ The US is no longer the world’s policeman, in other words – a message that resonates in countries that have long been suspicious of American power. The West’s core coalition may remain solid, but it has failed to win over many of the countries that refused to pick sides. Moscow’s diplomatic mission to build ties and hone a narrative over the past decade has paid dividends.
Look at Africa. In March last year, 25 African states out of 54 abstained or didn’t vote in a UN motion condemning the invasion, despite huge pressure from western powers. Their refusal to side clearly with Ukraine was testament to Russia’s ongoing diplomatic efforts in the developing world.

Reuters: Russia journal: Moscow mulls possible use of nuclear arms to fend off US attack  
A Russian defence ministry journal says Moscow is developing a new type of military strategy using nuclear weapons to protect against possible U.S. aggression, RIA news agency reported on Thursday. 
The article is the latest in a series of combative remarks by Russian politicians and commentators after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, suggesting Moscow would, if necessary, be prepared to deploy its vast nuclear arsenal.
RIA said the article, published in the Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought) magazine, concluded Washington was worried it might be losing dominance over the world and had therefore &quot;apparently&quot; prepared plans to strike Russia to neutralise it.

WNU Editor:  In the past few months I have noticed this change among many of my Russian family members and friends on the possibility that the US may launch a nuclear first strike against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine worsens for Kyiv. This  Russian defence ministry journal is voicing what many fear Washington will do next.

Update: I take Russian nuclear threats seriously. I completely disagree with this point of view .... Russian Nuclear Threats Are Empty, Part of ‘Information Operation:’ ISW (Newsweek).

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
