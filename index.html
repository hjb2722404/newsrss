CIA director Bill Burns is visiting Israel and other countries in the region this week for talks on the war in Gaza and the efforts to release hostages held by Hamas, two Israeli officials confirmed to Axios.

 
Why it matters: Burns&#x27; trip is part of the Biden administration&#x27;s ongoing engagement with key parties in an effort to get a humanitarian pause in the fighting and prevent a regional war.

                              <span>BBC: Israel Gaza war: Hamas-run health ministry says Gaza death toll passes 10,000 
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month.

More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry said. 
The number surpasses the UN&#x27;s figure of about 5,400 killed in Gaza in all of Israel&#x27;s previous conflicts with Hamas since it took control of the territory in 2007.
Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed 1,400 people and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October. 
It says it is destroying Hamas infrastructure and killing its fighters so that it will no longer be able to pose a threat to Israel.

CNBC: ‘It’s going to be bloody’: Why Israel’s long war ahead will be nothing like what it’s faced before  
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned his country that a “long and difficult war” lay ahead. 
* The IDF is supplementing heavy aerial bombardment of the besieged territory with what’s been described as a ground incursion, the details of which have been kept closely guarded. 
* Prolonged urban combat will bring a slew of deadly challenges for the IDF – and likely some key advantages for Hamas, military analysts say. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned his country that a “long and difficult war” lay ahead. 
The Israeli Defense Forces, after launching the largest military mobilization of troops in its history, has now entered into the “second phase” of its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 
The IDF is supplementing heavy aerial bombardment of the besieged territory with what’s been described as a ground incursion, the details of which have been kept closely guarded.

WNU Editor: The attack by Hamas on October 7th was different in many ways(the size of the attack and the high civilian casualty numbers and kidnapped Israelis). Israel&#x27;s declaration of war while making it a commitment to completely wipe out Hamas was also new and unprecedented.
Bottom line. Israel is facing urban and attrition warfare coupled with astronomical casualty numbers. And when completed, Gaza is going to look like what Mosul looked like after the Iraqi army was successful in wiping out ISIS. 
So yes. Israel’s long war ahead will be nothing like what it’s faced before</span>

At least 10,022 Palestinians have been killed including 4,104 children in Israeli strikes on Gaza since Oct. 7, the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza said. 
GAZA (Reuters) - U.N. agency leaders saying &quot;enough is enough&quot; demanded a humanitarian ceasefire on Monday nearly a month into Gaza&#x27;s war, as health authorities in the enclave said the death toll from Israeli strikes now exceeded 10,000. 
Israel has rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire, saying hostages taken by Hamas militants during their rampage in southern Israel on Oct. 7 should be released first. 
&quot;An entire population is besieged and under attack, denied access to the essentials for survival, bombed in their homes, shelters, hospitals and places of worship. This is unacceptable,&quot; the U.N. chiefs said in a joint statement.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel took the highly unusual step on Sunday of suspending a far-right minister from his government, after the minister said that dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza and killing everyone there was “one way” of dealing with the threat from Hamas. 
Mr. Netanyahu’s swift action came amid an immediate and broad outcry over the comments made on Sunday morning by Amichay Eliyahu, the minister of heritage from the ultranationalist Jewish Power party. 
In his remarks, made to a Hebrew radio station, Mr. Eliyahu also said that there was no such thing as noncombatants in Gaza.

Bloomberg: Putin’s move to secure Libya bases is new regional challenge for US, European allies 
Russia is moving to expand its military presence in eastern Libya, a plan that could lead to a naval base, giving it a significant foothold on Europe’s southern doorstep. 
A defense accord is being hammered out between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Libya’s eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar following their meeting in Moscow in late September, according to people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive issues.

The Aviationist: In A First, Israeli F-35I Adir Shoots Down Cruise Missile 
The kill, scored against a missile likely launched from Yemen, is the first interception of this kind by the 5th gen fighter. 
The Israeli Air Force disclosed today that one of its F-35I Adir fighters recently shot down a cruise missile which was about to enter Israeli airspace from the southwest. 
The cruise missile, possibly launched from Yemen, was detected and tracked by the air defense as F-35Is were scrambled to intercept it, scoring the first cruise missile kill by the 5th generation fighter.

NBC News: Israel shot down a ballistic missile fired from Yemen, U.S. officials say 

  Israel says that it took down the missile with its Arrow system and that Israeli fighter jets intercepted drones launched from the same direction. 
Militants believed to be Houthi rebels fired a medium-range ballistic missile from Yemen toward Israel on Tuesday, according to two U.S. officials. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the missile was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow air defense system, which was jointly developed by Israel and the U.S. The IDF confirmed that a surface-to-surface missile had been fired toward Israeli territory from the direction of the Red Sea, but not did specify whether it had originated in Yemen.
The U.S. officials said the missile, which had a range of 2,000 kilometers (about 1,240 miles) or more, did not threaten U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea or U.S. troops or personnel in the area.

 Business Insider: An Ohio-class submarine, possibly equipped with ballistic missiles, has arrived in the Mediterranean 
* CENTCOM on Sunday confirmed an Ohio-class submarine has traveled to the Mediterranean Sea. 
* Ohio-class submarines can be equipped with advanced ballistic or Tomahawk missiles. 
* The sub was pictured appearing to sail through the Suez Canal in Egypt, which connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas. 
An Ohio-class submarine, a type of vessel which can be equipped with advanced ballistic or Tomahawk cruise missiles, has arrived in the Mediterranean as the US continues to bolster its defensive posture amid the Israel-Hamas war. 
CENTCOM, the Department of Defense combatant command with authority over US forces in the Middle East and West and Central Asia, posted a photo on Sunday of the submarine on X, formerly Twitter, confirming it had arrived in the region. 
The disclosure of the submarine&#x27;s location is significant as the whereabouts of the vessels are typically kept secret for security regions.

Reuters: US plans $425 million Ukraine weapons aid announcement 
The Biden administration plans to announce a $425 million military aid package for Ukraine on Friday including counter drone rockets and munitions, two U.S. officials said on Thursday. 
The package is not expected to include additional ATACMS missiles. Senior congressional Republicans have urged President Joe Biden to send longer-range missiles to Ukraine, despite pushback from some conservative lawmakers against more aid. 
The planned aid package for Ukraine includes about $300 million worth of laser-guided munitions to shoot down Russian drones, according to a document seen by Reuters and one of the officials. The funds for those munitions come from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) program, which allows the Biden administration to buy weapons from industry rather than pull from U.S. weapons stocks.

Wall Street Journal: Escalating Militia Attacks on U.S. Troops Risk Washington-Tehran Confrontation 
When a drone laden with explosives was found late last month lodged in the upper floors of U.S. barracks in Iraq, Pentagon officials quickly realized how close the suspected militia-launched weapon came to killing American personnel. 
In this case, the explosives failed to detonate, and there were no reports of injuries. But as the number of these attacks escalates, so too does the risk of a deadly incident that will demand a response from the U.S. military, edging it closer to direct confrontation with Iranian-backed groups it suspects are responsible. 
“They are aiming to kill,” a U.S. defense official said. “We have just been lucky.”

Reuters: Pro-Palestinian crowds try to storm air base housing U.S. troops in Turkey 
ADANA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish police used tear gas and water cannon as hundreds of people at a pro-Palestinian rally on Sunday tried to storm an air base that houses U.S. troops, hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due in Ankara for talks on Gaza. 
Turkey, which has stepped up its criticism of Israel as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened, supports a two-state solution while hosting members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Since the Israel-Hamas war started, protests have erupted across the country. 
Earlier this week, the IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation, an Islamist Turkish aid agency, organised a convoy to travel to the Incirlik air base in the Adana province in southern Turkey to protest Israeli attacks on Gaza and U.S. support for Israel.

President Biden is trailing Donald J. Trump in five of the six most important battleground states one year before the 2024 election, suffering from enormous doubts about his age and deep dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy and a host of other issues, new polls by The New York Times and Siena College have found. 
The results show Mr. Biden losing to Mr. Trump, his likeliest Republican rival, by margins of three to 10 percentage points among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Mr. Biden is ahead only in Wisconsin, by two percentage points, the poll found.

That&#x27;s around 1.1 million children packed into one of the most densely populated territories in the world. The UN says the majority are displaced, staying with their families in overcrowded shelters or camped in hospital grounds. The Hamas-run health authority says at least 4,104 children have been killed in Israeli strikes since the start of the war. In this edition of Perspective, we focus on the work of a charity set up to help children impacted by war. It&#x27;s called INARA (International network for aid, relief and assistance) and was founded by former CNN correspondent Arwa Damon. She spoke to FRANCE 24&#x27;s Gavin Lee.</span>

                              <span>The United States and China held talks on nuclear arms control, marking the first meeting on this issue since the Obama administration. The talks aim to ease mistrust between the two countries ahead of an expected presidential summit. The US has expressed concern over China&#x27;s growing nuclear arsenal. While no breakthroughs were expected, the talks are seen as a way to manage the relationship and prevent conflict. China currently has over 500 operational nuclear warheads, with estimates suggesting they could have over 1,000 by 2030. The US has around 3,700 nuclear warheads.</span>

                              <span>Jordan has stated that it is considering all options in response to Israel&#x27;s failure to differentiate between military and civilian targets in its attack on Gaza. Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh did not provide details on what actions Jordan would take. Last week, Jordan recalled its ambassador from Israel and declared Israel&#x27;s ambassador persona non grata. Jordan is reviewing its economic, security, and political ties with Israel and may suspend further steps in implementing the peace treaty if the situation worsens.</span>

The situation in Gaza is dire, with food, medicine, fuel, and water running low, and the UN-run shelters are overcrowded.

                              <span>A new commemorative coin celebrating the King’s 75th birthday and paying tribute to his passion for the natural world has been unveiled by the Royal Mint. To mark the occasion, the Mint is looking for 75 people turning 75 years old this year, to give them a special £5 coin, in honour of the King’s birthday. To honour the King’s lifelong commitment to sustainability, a special birthday coin has also been made from a blend of silver recovered from industrial and medical x-ray films. Those celebrating their 75th birthday in 2023 can submit their name and contact details via the Royal Mint to be in with a chance of receiving an uncirculated £5 commemorative coin. The winners will be drawn at random and asked to provide photographic evidence of age. They will be contacted via email from early December 2023.</span>

                              <span>Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has gained a considerable amount of ground over Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, according to the latest Newspoll.

In the first major poll since the Voice referendum was defeated, the Coalition now leads Labor on the primary vote.

The poll reports the primary vote for the Coalition is at 37 per cent whilst Labor trails behind now at 35 per cent.

On two-party preferred voting the Coalition has also tightened the gap at 48 per cent, coming in close to Labor’s 52 per cent.

This latest data has marked the closest contest since the election.</span>

                              <span>Massive explosions are hitting Gaza City and its surroundings as Israel continues on with its deadliest campaign to destroy Hamas following the terrorist group&#x27;s unprovoked attack on October 7.

The IDF on Sunday said its troops were “encircling Gaza city” and conducting “widespread strikes”.

Health officials in the Palestinian territory claimed 53 people died in two blasts at refugee camps.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his rejection for a ceasefire on Sunday until the some 240 hostages taken by Hamas on October 7 are released.

&quot;There will be no ceasefire without the return of the hostages. This should be completely removed from the lexicon,&quot; Mr Netanyahu said.

&quot;We say this to our friends and to our enemies. We will simply continue until we defeat them. We have no alternative.&quot;</span>

Israeli airstrikes hit two refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip on Sunday, killing at least 45 people, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. The strikes came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his Middle-eastern tour with an unannounced visit to Iraq, as Washington tries to prevent a regional spillover. Tensions increased with neighbouring Lebanon as an Israeli strike in the south of the country killed three children and their grandmother, Lebanese authorities said.

                              <span>More than 20 people were killed in Sudan after shells hit a market in a suburb of the capital, Khartoum. The fighting between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo has been ongoing since April. The conflict has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and 5.5 million people being displaced, according to estimates by the United Nations. The actual toll is believed to be higher as many of the wounded and killed do not reach hospitals or morgues.</span>

                              <span>Ohio voters will decide on Tuesday whether to add explicit protections for abortion rights to the state&#x27;s constitution. The referendum will determine whether the constitution guarantees the freedom to make reproductive decisions, including abortion. The US Supreme Court revoked the national right to abortion last year, leaving it up to individual states to decide. Ohio currently has a law that would ban abortions after a heartbeat is detected, but it is temporarily suspended due to legal challenges.</span>

                              <span>The office of President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday chastised Ukraine&#x27;s top military commander for publicly declaring the war at a stalemate, suggesting the comments would help the Russian invasion. It was a striking public rebuke that signaled an emerging rift between the military and civilian leadership at a challenging time for Ukraine. The public censure of Zaluzhny came a day after the president&#x27;s office replaced one of his deputies, the head of special operations forces, who after his firing said he had been blindsided by the dismissal.</span>

The protest coincided with a poll showing that over three-quarters of Israelis believe Netanyahu should resign. Netanyahu has not taken personal responsibility for the failures that allowed the surprise assault, which has led to growing public fury and criticism of the government&#x27;s response.

The man, who had driven his vehicle through the gates with his 4-year-old daughter inside, was arrested and the girl is unharmed. The airport had been closed since Saturday night when the armed man broke through a gate and fired shots. The man&#x27;s wife had previously reported a child abduction, and it is believed to be a custody battle. No one was injured during the standoff.</span>

The polls also show that voters across income levels feel Biden&#x27;s policies have hurt them personally, while they credit Trump&#x27;s policies for helping them.</span>

Anticipating a more robust financial year ahead, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has forecasted a 2.8 percent expansion in Russia’s GDP in 2023, a significant bounce-back from a 2 percent contraction experienced in the previous year. Siluanov attributes this hopeful outlook to full compensation for last year’s decrease and the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. 
Rebound from Economic Contraction 
The predicted growth in Russia’s economy marks a recovery from the challenging economic climate of 2022 when the nation grappled with a 2 percent economic decline. Siluanov, however, projects a promising 2.8 to 3 percent expansion in the upcoming year, viewing it as a reparation for the previous year’s downturn.

Update #1: Russia&#x27;s economic situation develops steadily – Putin (TASS)
 
Update #2: Russia brings back capital controls to shore up the ruble (CNN)

 
WNU Editor: The Western media likes to focus on the rise and fall and rise of the Russian ruble, but the Russian economy is more than just that. So here is my recap. The civilian economy is booming and it is causing problems (inflation, labor shortages, etc.). And as for that part of the economy that is dedicated to military production .... I cannot even express in words on how huge of an impact that is having on the economy as a whole. 
But the big story on the Russia economy that many in the West have not caught up on is the Kremlin&#x27;s priority to re-industrialize the country. I know the money is there to make it happen,  but the big problem that I see will be having the workers to make this all happen. 
Update #3: The Duran&#x27;s analysis on the Russian economy (see below) concurs with what I know is happening in Russia.</span>

AFP: &#x27;We&#x27;re losing&#x27;: Ukrainians reel from war chief&#x27;s stalemate warning 
In eastern Ukraine, where another gruelling winter is descending -- along with it a likely freeze in major frontline movements -- one Ukrainian soldier had a grim assessment of the conflict. 
The 35-year-old fighting near the war-battered town of Bakhmut went further than comments from Ukraine&#x27;s most senior military official, who conceded this week that the war with Russia had reached a stalemate. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve been saying that for some time now already. Step by step we&#x27;re losing the war,&quot; the serviceman, who uses the call sign &quot;Mudryi&quot; (Wise), told AFP. 
&quot;The longer this static war continues, the worse it is for us,&quot; he said in a phone interview.

WNU Editor: The above AFP news report is a sober read and confirms what I have been hearing. The failure of the counter-offensive to break the Russian lines coupled with tens of thousands of casualties has stunned everyone I know in Ukraine. They expected at least some advances. They certainly never expected a stalemate nor Russian advances in the northeastern part of the country.</span>

Kyiv Post: Zelensky’s Office Issues Warning After Zaluzhny’s ‘Stalemate’ Interview 
President Zelensky&#x27;s deputy chief-of-staff suggested that military officials should perhaps keep quiet about the situation on the front lines, lest they give the Russians an advantage.
Ihor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of the President&#x27;s Office, has advised military officials against publicly disclosing sensitive information about the situation at the front lines. 
Zhovkva&#x27;s comments came in response to an interview with Valery Zaluzhny, the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for The Economist. The interview also contained a link to a lengthy essay by Zaluzhny replete with military assessments. 
The deputy chief-of-staff suggested that by making comments &quot;we make it easier for the aggressor to work.&quot;

A Russian nuclear-powered submarine has conducted a ballistic missile test, with the projectile traveling several thousand kilometers from the northern to the easternmost part of the country, the Defense Ministry has said.
In a statement in the early hours of Sunday, the ministry said that the submarine ‘Emperor Alexander III’ had “successfully launched the Bulava sea-based intercontinental ballistic missile from the White Sea to the Kura test range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.” It added that the missile was fired underwater and that its warheads reached the target on time.

Military.com: The Army Suddenly, and Chaotically, Told Hundreds of Soldiers They Have to Be Recruiters Immediately 
 Without warning, hundreds of noncommissioned officers were ordered via email to report to the recruiting school at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in less than a week, with hundreds more set to start at the school in December -- a sudden unexpected move by the Army as the service scrambles to boost its recruiting force by 800 by the end of the year. 
The orders came after a breakdown in how the Army tracks how many recruiters it has coming through the pipeline along with retention of existing ones, according to Lt. Gen. Douglas Stitt, the Army&#x27;s top personnel officer. 
The sudden depletion of recruiters caught Army planners flat-footed, with officials unable to provide a clear explanation as to what went wrong. Now, NCOs will likely have to move during the holiday season and in the middle of the school year, sowing chaos for families.

Daily Mail: Maps show devastating impact of America&#x27;s new super-nuke on Russian capital: B61-13 &#x27;gravity bomb&#x27; has 24 times more power than the one dropped on Hiroshima 
* The Biden administration is developing a new nuclear bomb - the B61-13 has the potential to cause significant devastation in Moscow 
* Simulation of bomb&#x27;s estimated maximum yield of 360 kilotons of TNT could see many deaths with more than 300,000 killed and hundreds of thousands injured 
* Development of the weapon is primarily intended as a deterrent and to provide assurance to allies 
Maps have been released depicting the destruction that could be unleashed should a new type of nuclear bomb being developed by the Biden Administration be dropped on Moscow. 
The Pentagon announced this week that it is developing a new nuclear &#x27;gravity bomb&#x27; that is 24 times more powerful than the nuke detonated in Hiroshima. 
The B61-13 is the 13th variant of the B61 family of &#x27;gravity bombs,&#x27; which fall to their target rather than being guided.

President Volodymyr Zelensky denied on Saturday that Ukraine&#x27;s war with Russia had reached a &quot;stalemate&quot;, pushing back at suggestions Western leaders were lobbying for peace talks. 
The sprawling frontline between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked. 
&quot;Time has passed, people are tired... But this is not a stalemate,&quot; Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv with EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. 
The Ukrainian leader also rejected the idea Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks would entail.

                              <span>ABC News Australia/AFP: Fighting between Myanmar&#x27;s junta and ethnic rebel groups near shared border with China displaces thousands  
Thousands of people are newly displaced, with some crossing into China, as fighting intensifies between Myanmar&#x27;s junta and ethnic rebel groups in areas near the border. 
The junta launched a second day of air strikes on Wednesday, bombing territory in the northernmost Kachin state controlled by ethnic armed group Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a rebel spokesperson told AFP. 
Since Friday, the junta also has been battling an alliance of ethnic rebel groups across the neighbouring north-eastern Shan state.

Business Insider: Pentagon says there are no limits on how Israel uses US weapons as death toll climbs amid airstrikes in Gaza 
* The Pentagon says there are no limits on how Israel uses US-provided weapons in their attacks in Gaza. 
* A spokesperson said it&#x27;s up to the IDF how it uses the weapons. 
* Israeli airstrikes have devastated the Gaza Strip, and a new ground offensive could do further damage. 
The US is not putting any limits on how Israel uses US-provided weapons in its bloody war against Hamas that has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and destroyed parts of the Gaza Strip, the Pentagon says as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ramps up its retaliatory attacks in the area. 
On Monday, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told that &quot;we are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that [are] provided,&quot; Voice of America National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin reported. 
&quot;We&#x27;re not putting any constraints on that,&quot; she said.

In the wake of Hamas&#x27; surprise attack on Oct. 7, U.S. leaders reaffirmed the long-standing strategic and military alliance with Israel — but political disagreements have delayed a new security assistance package.

Newsweek: Hezbollah Targets Israel With &#x27;Volcano&#x27; Rockets as Tensions Soar 
The militant group Hezbollah launched missile strikes against Israel on Saturday using rockets dubbed &quot;The Volcano,&quot; as tensions continue to soar along the country&#x27;s northern border with Lebanon. 
The Associated Press reported Saturday that Israel had launched airstrikes along the Lebanese border, as Hezbollah carried out several strikes of its own against Israeli military sites. 
One of these Israeli sites, known in Lebanon as Jal al-Allam, was struck by two large Burkan missiles, according to the AP. 
Translated as &quot;volcano&quot; in Arabic, Burkan missiles have an operational range of 500-2,000 meters and are outfitted with sizeable warheads that can weigh hundreds of kilograms.

The Israeli military exchanged fire with Hezbollah militants on Saturday as skirmishes with the group continue at the Lebanon-Israel border. 
Israel launched airstrikes on multiple Hezbollah positions near the Lebanese border as the Iran-backed militant group launched rockets towards Israeli targets, the Associated Press reported.

Hezbollah has repeatedly threatened escalation amid Israel’s war with Hamas, an ally of the group, in Gaza. 
“What the Israelis do to Lebanon will also determine how we will act,” leader Hassan Nasrallah said Friday. “All options are on the table on the Lebanese front.”

                              <span>She tried to censure and it came up short. 
Now she&#x27;s shaming the names who didn&#x27;t vote in favor. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
&quot;List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib,&quot; Greene said on Wednesday. &quot;This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC.&quot;

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn&#x27;t have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn&#x27;t running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn&#x27;t gaining a coalition in Congress.
&quot;I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger,&quot; she said. &quot;And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate.&quot;
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker&#x27;s swing and miss Wednesday.
&quot;Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib,&quot; tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: &quot;motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans.&quot;

And CNN&#x27;s Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: &quot;House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Sen. Tommy Tuberville&#x27;s (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville&#x27;s protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they&#x27;d be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn&#x27;t be there if it wasn&#x27;t for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It&#x27;s the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.</span>

That line is budging. 
Officials are fuming at  Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) after it was discovered over the weekend that Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith, who had been doubling as both the top No. 1 and No. 2 Marine Corps leader since July, suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized on Sunday — leaving a three-star general to hold the prestigious post, according to a report published by Politico.

The potential overextension of Smith and the stalling of more than 300 critical leadership roles was iced out by Tuberville&#x27;s blockade installed as a protest against the Pentagon&#x27;s policy to permit time off and reimbursement for abortions.

The fact that Republicans are demanding an increase in tax evasion as their condition of supporting a key U.S. ally&#x27;s military is not an accident, argued Talking Points Memo&#x27;s Josh Marshall on MSNBC Tuesday, but a sign of how low the GOP has sunk.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
