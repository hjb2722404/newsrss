                              <span>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is directly lobbying members of US Congress to continue supporting the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.

He says the pact is essential in strengthening Australia&#x27;s defence capabilities and that it is a good agreement for the US and UK.

It follows criticism in America from two senators who warned President Joe Biden the AUKUS deal could be a zero-sum game for the allocation of scarce, highly advanced US nuclear boats. 

Mr Albanese is confident Joe Biden will stick to the AUKUS agreement despite domestic political pressure.</span>

US officials are sold on Japan’s new military posture. Japan’s public might not be.
 US officials this week affirmed their commitment to Japan’s plans for rapidly scaling up defense spending amid rising tensions with China and North Korea after decades of limited investment post-World War II. But despite the support of the US and other allies, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s plan to turn Japan’s Self-Defense Forces into an army to counter threats from their neighbors will depend on Japanese people’s willingness to pay for — and staff — the surge. 
Japan’s new security posture will increase the nation’s military budget by 56 percent, from about 27.47 billion yen to about 43 billion yen (an increase from about $215 million to $336 million). Histori…</span>

Protests after the arrest of former President Pedro Castillo emphasize Peru’s deep stratification.
 Protests in Peru related to the arrest of former President Pedro Castillo have become increasingly violent, leading to many deaths, and show no real signs of abating. Despite the unprecedented political violence and calls for her resignation, Castillo’s successor and former vice president, President Dina Boluarte, refused on Friday to step down, saying, “My commitment is with Peru.”
Boluarte’s government extended a state of emergency in the capital, Lima, and three other regions late Saturday after an earlier 30-day order expired. In the just over a month since the protests began, 49 people, including children and police officers have been killed, the Ass…</span>

Though the Islamic Republic has a history of protest, this year’s unrest is unique.
 For four months, protests have gripped Iran — protests that have not only been surprisingly durable, but also led primarily by women. 
Activists believe at least 16 people have been sentenced to death by the Islamic Republic, headed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for participating in the protests, according to the Associated Press. Executions began in December, when the regime executed 23-year-old Mohsen Shekari for the crime of “waging war against God,” or moharebeh in Farsi.

A push to cut the defense budget likely won’t happen. But it’s interesting anyway.
 The new conservative House of Representatives has taken power and is ready to take on President Joe Biden and his foreign policy.
As part of the deal that emerged as Rep. Kevin McCarthy persevered through 15 rounds of votes to secure the speakership last week, a group of 20 far-right lawmakers reportedly won concessions to cap the federal budget at 2022 levels in exchange for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling.

Jerusalem Post: Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Putin afraid of coup, will retire in 2023 - report 
A former ally of the Russian President talked about the possibility that Putin might retire soon, rather then potentially getting killed in a coup. 
A source who was close to Putin once claimed that &quot;the president will nominate his chosen heir already this year, instead of risking his downfall,&quot; the British Daily Mail reported on Friday.

DW: Power struggle in the Russian armed forces  
Sergey Surovikin has been removed as head of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine and replaced by Valery Gerasimov. Is there a power struggle raging in Moscow? 
General Sergey Surovikin was commander-in-chief of the &quot;special military operation,&quot; as Russia still officially calls its war of aggression against Ukraine, for just three months. On Thursday, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu demoted him to deputy commander. He will now answer to Russia&#x27;s chief of the general staff, General Valery Gerasimov, who will take over the leadership of Russia&#x27;s military in Ukraine — nominally, a…</span>

Hot Air: China admits nearly 60k COVID deaths in the past month but some experts say it&#x27;s much higher 
Just over one month ago, China finally dropped its zero-COVID measures. Since then there have been multiple reports that Chinese hospitals, funeral parlors and crematoriums have been overwhelmed. Thursday NBC News reported that you could see the crowds at Chinese crematoriums from space:   
Satellite images taken over multiple cities in China show heightened activity outside crematoriums and funeral homes, appearing to contradict the country’s low official Covid-19 death figures and illustrating the severity of the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. 
The images, taken by the Colorado-based space technology company Maxar in late December and early January and shared with NBC News, show a parking lot has been built since early December at a funeral home in Tongzhou, on the outskirts of Beijing, the capital. 
Other images from cities around the country show a greater number of cars parked outside funeral homes compared with similar periods in past years.

                              <span>Hawaii News Now: 5 years ago today, a false missile alert threw Hawaii into a panic 
HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Exactly five years ago on Friday, Hawaii residents and visitors woke up to a terrifying emergency alert on their cell phones that sent a wave of panic across the state. 
The message warned of a ballistic missile heading for Hawaii. 
It read, “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” 
That was on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2018.

WNU Editor: In the 1970s I was a teenager playing soccer in the park when the air raid/missile alert system went on. In the few minutes that it took me to run home to turn on the radio to find out what was happening, I was totally overwhelmed with fear. 
It was simply an exercise that no one bothered to tell us, but that fear is something that I will always remember.</span>

The FBI revealed how the bureau uses the CIA and National Security Agency to probe the private lives of Americans without a warrant in its updated rulebook, which is the first version made public since the Obama administration.  
The handbook, rewritten in 2021, confirms a decade-old leak showcasing the bureau’s collaboration with the CIA and NSA for FBI probes that may involve surveillance without court orders against people not accused of any crimes. Such probes are known as “assessments” at the FBI. 
The revelations will fuel critics who have long accused the FBI of abusing its national security surveillance powers.

The vast majority of U.S. active duty military members believe the Pentagon has become politicized, according to data obtained exclusively by Breitbart News. 
Sixty-eight percent of active duty members say they have “witnessed a growing politicization,” while 53 percent say the military has become “too politicized.” Sixty-eight percent also say such politicization would impact their decision to encourage their children to join the military. 
The data, gathered by the National Independent Panel on Military Service and Readiness (NIPMSR), show specific policy areas of concern for active duty military at a time when President Joe Biden’s Pentagon has been criticized by many for conducting social experiments in the ranks of the military, as opposed to focusing on national defense. The NIPMSR was empaneled by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts.

 Politico: Menendez vows to block plan to sell fighter jets to Turkey 
The senator blasted Turkey&#x27;s human rights record in a statement. 
The chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is vowing to continue blocking the transfer of warplanes to Turkey unless Ankara improves its human rights record and ceases threatening U.S. regional allies. 
The Biden administration is considering a $20 billion transfer of 40 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to Turkey and, separately, F-35 fighter jets for Greece, a development first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday and later confirmed by a person familiar with discussions who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity. 
Such a deal would require congressional approval and for Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to end his longstanding opposition to sending fighter jets to Ankara. 
But in a statement Menendez’s office drafted for the media and obtained ahead of time by POLITICO, the senator said he hasn’t changed his mind.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Retired general Petr Pavel scored a narrow win over billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis in the first round of the Czech presidential election on Saturday, securing a solid base for a runoff in two weeks, nearly complete results showed. 
The post does not carry executive authority but has significant powers in appointing prime ministers, central bank chiefs and nominating judges for the constitutional court. 
Presidents also have a limited say in foreign affairs and are chief army commanders.  Results from 99.99% of the voting districts showed Pavel won with 35.39%, ahead of Babis with 35.00%.

                              <span>Euronews/Reuters: Britain to send 14 of its main battle tanks, more weaponry to Ukraine 
LONDON -Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s office said late on Saturday that Britain would send 14 of its main battle tanks along with additional artillery support to Ukraine, disregarding criticism from the Russian Embassy in London. 
A squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks will go into the country in the coming weeks and around 30 self-propelled AS90 guns, operated by five gunners, are expected to follow, the British prime minister’s office said in a statement. 
The UK will also begin training Ukrainian forces to use the tanks and guns in the coming days.

                              <span>CNBC/Reuters: China reports huge rise in Covid deaths after WHO criticized Beijing for heavily undercounting 
* China said on Saturday nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital since it abandoned its zero-COVID policy last month. 
* In early December, Beijing abruptly dismantled its strict three-year anti-virus regime of frequent testing, travel curbs. 
* The World Health Organization said this week that China was heavily under-reporting deaths from COVID, although it was now providing more information on its outbreak. 
China said on Saturday nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital since it abandoned its zero-COVID policy last month, a huge increase from previously reported figures that follows global criticism of the country’s coronavirus data.
In early December, Beijing abruptly dismantled its strict three-year anti-virus regime of frequent testing, travel curbs and mass lockdowns after widespread protests in late November, and cases have surged since then across the nation of 1.4 billion. 
A health official said on Saturday that COVID fever and emergency hospitalizations had peaked and the number of hospitalized patients was continuing to decline.

ABC News Australia: Ukraine&#x27;s Zelenskyy plans UN visit on anniversary of Russian invasion 
Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member United Nations General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia&#x27;s February 24 invasion, if the security situation permits, a senior foreign ministry official says.
Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova told The Associated Press (AP) that Mr Zelenskyy would only attend if the military situation allowed, amid a Ukrainian intelligence warning that Russia is planning &quot;a very serious offensive in February&quot;. 
 &quot;Our president would want to come, he has a will or intention to come,&quot; she said, &quot;but it&#x27;s still a question if there will be a security situation that will allow him to come&quot;.

Reuters: Russia fires new wave of missiles at Ukraine after hitting Kyiv infrastructurey 
KYIV (Reuters) - Russia fired a second wave of missiles at Ukraine on Saturday, forcing people to take cover as sirens blared across the country just hours after morning air strikes that hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv. 
Authorities in Mykolaiv, the western city of Lviv and the Black Sea port of Odesa said air defences were trying to shoot down incoming missiles. Explosions were heard in the central Vynnytsa region, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported. 
Moscow, which invaded last February, has been pounding Ukraine&#x27;s energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since October, causing sweeping blackouts and disruptions to central heating and running water as winter bites.

WNU Editor: One of my cousins, with her husband and 20 year old daughter, are leaving Ukraine today. They are currently in central Ukraine (west of the Dnieper river) and are on their way to Kyiv, then Lviv, and from there to Warsaw. They will be flying later in the week to Toronto (where I will meet them for the day), and from there they will be flying to Winnipeg to meet a friend. she told me this morning that the city she is leaving has power 2 hours on, 2 hours off, and there has been no water for three days.

Atlas News: Russian Warships Depart Black Sea Naval Base 
On January 11th, 2023, Naval News reported that several Russian warships departed Novorossiysk Naval Base on the Black Sea. According to their sources: 
 “The group included the Project 11711 Ivan Gren class landing ship, Pyotr Morgunov, the largest amphibious ship in the Black Sea. It also contained all three Project 636.3 Improved-Kilo class submarines which were present at the base. Analysis suggests that other warships were also sailing, leaving only a few warships and support vessels in the port. It is likely the most empty that Novorossiysk has been in many months.”

DW: German media report defense minister soon to resign 
German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht may leave her post as soon as next week, according to German news outlets. 
Lambrecht was recently criticized for a New Year&#x27;s Eve message posted on social media.   German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht intends to resign, several German media outlets reported on Friday.    
What do we know so far? 
The revelation was first reported by German newspaper Bild, with the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper following soon thereafter. Both cited unnamed sources and said she may step down as soon as next week.  
 However, on the record, spokespeople for German government only responded initially on Friday evening by saying that the reports constituted &quot;rumors,&quot; on which &quot;we do not comment.&quot;

The Guardian: ‘Pandemic potential’: bird flu outbreaks fuelling chance of human spillover  
Experts say record waves of avian influenza have been setting off alarms, with fears virus could adapt to spread among people 
Multiple waves of avian influenza have left a trail of devastation across the globe, leading to the deaths and culling of more than 300 million chickens, ducks and geese and an unknown number of wild birds between 2005 and 2021. 
Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans. 
“There is concern about it having pandemic potential,” says Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. “Before Covid was on anybody’s radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.”

                              <span>New York Times: Did Aliens Land on Earth in 1945? A Defense Bill Seeks Answers. 
For the casual student of U.F.O. history, the modern idea of life beyond our planet usually dates to 1947, when a top-secret U.S. military balloon crashed in the desert near Roswell, N.M. The wreckage prompted decades of conspiracy theories and gave rise to the idea that Roswell was the site of an alien crash landing. 
Now, thanks to a new congressional spending bill, U.F.O. enthusiasts may look to 1945 as the beginning of that era. 
An amendment tucked into this year’s $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Defense Department’s annual operating budget, requires the department to review historical documents related to unidentified aerial phenomena — government lingo for U.F.O.s — dating to 1945. That is the year that, according to one account, a large, avocado-shaped object struck a communication tower in a patch of New Mexico desert now known as the Trinity Site, where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated that July. 
Experts said the bill, which President Biden signed into law in December, could be a game changer for studying unidentified phenomena.

                              <span>CNN: Global experts worry simultaneous crises could become the new norm  
Business executives, politicians and academics are bracing for a gloomy world battered by intersecting crises, as rising volatility and depleted resilience boost the odds of painful simultaneous shocks.
In its annual survey of risks published Wednesday, the World Economic Forum found that more than 80% of respondents expected either “persistent crises” or “multiple shocks” over the next two years, at best leading to “divergent trajectories” for countries and at worst triggering “catastrophic outcomes.” 
Global experts identified the cost-of-living crisis as the most severe short-term risk, as high prices for necessities like food slam vulnerable households and lift the odds of civil unrest and protests.

Last year, Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine dominated the discourse in Davos. 
This time the fallout from the war will once again take center stage, as the world grapples with an energy crunch and edges toward a recession. 
The Davos crowd is returning to a familiar setting. But the lush green meadows that formed the backdrop of the first-ever &quot;spring Davos&quot; last May have been replaced by snow-covered slopes, where snow boots and fur coats have made a comeback. 
While the weather may have changed from last year, the main talking points remain the same.The war in Ukraine and its massive economic fallout is once again expected to dominate the agenda of the annual event in the Swiss Alpine resort.

US News and World Report: China Signals Military Response as U.S., Japan Accelerate Defense Plans  
Dramatic escalations in Japan’s own military investments combined with new security cooperation with the U.S. announced this week prompted new warnings from Beijing. 
China on Thursday signaled plans to retaliate militarily to new security initiatives between Japan and the U.S., warning that the allies’ accelerated cooperation will create new threats for themselves in the region. 
Citing a Chinese military analyst, the English-language Global Times newspaper warned that if Japan continued dramatic increases in military spending and new security postures coordinated with the U.S. – particularly with regard to Taiwan – then the Chinese military “is sure to take countermeasures, including holding more exercises and patrols in international waters and airspace around Japan.”

Business Insider: Ongoing headaches with F-35 fighter jets are rippling through the rest of the US military&#x27;s combat aircraft fleet 
* The F-35 program has been plagued by years of delays, cost overruns, and technical glitches. 
* Those problems have prompted the Pentagon to extend the service lives of older combat jets. 
* Extensions keep jets flying but don&#x27;t guarantee they will meet future needs, a government watchdog says. 
Years of delays, cost overruns, and technical glitches with the F-35 have put the Pentagon in a dilemma. 
If F-35s aren&#x27;t fit to fly in sufficient numbers, then older aircraft such as the F-16 must be kept in service to fill the gap. 
In turn, having to extend the lifespan of older planes consumes money that could be used to acquire new aircraft and results in aging warplanes that may not be capable of fulfilling their missions on the current battlefield. 
&quot;While service life extension programs are one way to keep current aircraft capable and in operation, they do not guarantee that those aircraft will be available when needed or that they will possess required capabilities to meet future needs,&quot; the Government Accountability Office warned in a new report on US tactical aircraft.

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen increased aerial activity in the straits, we&#x27;ve seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan,&quot; Austin said during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts.
&quot;But whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, you know, I seriously doubt that,&quot; Austin said.

It debuted in the top ten album charts in both the U.S. and the U.K. A poster promoting Lovato’s pop-punk record featured the 30-year-old singer-songwriter “bound in a bondage-style outfit whilst lying on a large, cushioned crucifix,” accordin...</span>

Since their far-right hero Jair Bolsonaro lost elections in October, they have camped in the capital Brasilia, clamoring for the military to launch a coup to rid the country of his leftist successor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
As their call went unanswered, on Sunday they launched the assault. Hundreds flooded the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court in a rampage organized days in advance on Telegram and WhatsApp.
They sang the national anthem, hurled insults and objects at law enforcers, and left mass destruction in their wake.
But who are they?

Russian mercenary group Wagner on Tuesday claimed it had taken full control of Soledar but that fighting continued in the city centre. Soledar is a salt-mining town near the city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of a Russian assault aimed at capturing the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
&quot;The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that part of our town of Soledar ... is some sort of a Russian possession,&quot; Zelenskiy said in a video address.
&quot;But fighting continues. The Donetsk theatre of operations is holding.&quot;
In a separate statement on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the Russians were suffering heavy losses as they tried to take Soledar and cut off the supply routes for pro-Kyiv units.

Donelan told BBC radio a deal reportedly negotiated by the British Museum&#x27;s chairman, George Osborne, was not about the permanent return to Greece of the ancient sculptures.
That was &quot;not his intention&quot;, Donelan said referring to Osborne, a former finance minister under ex-prime minister David Cameron.
Such a move would &quot;open a can of worms&quot; and &quot;open the gateway to the question of the entire contents of our museums&quot;, she said.

                              <span>Peru&#x27;s top prosecutor&#x27;s office on Tuesday said it launched an inquiry into new President Dina Boluarte and members of her cabinet over violent clashes that have seen at least 40 killed and hundreds injured since early December.
The inquiry comes after 17 civilians were killed in the country&#x27;s southern Puno region on Monday - the most lethal day of protests since former President Pedro Castillo was ousted and detained last month. The violence continued on Tuesday with a police officer dying after his car was torched. 
The attorney general&#x27;s office said it was investigating Boluarte along with Prime Minister Alberto Otarola, Defense Minister Jorge Chavez and Interior Minister Victor Rojas on charges of &quot;genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries.&quot;

One of the most powerful figures in the Roman Catholic Church, Pell died at the age of 81 on Tuesday in Rome due to heart complications following a hip operation.
The man who was convicted, jailed and then cleared of molesting two 13-year-old choirboys in the 1990s remains deeply polarizing.
&quot;It was very sad personal news to hear and quite a shock,&quot; said Archbishop of Melbourne Peter Comensoli.
But Phillip Nagle, an abuse survivor in Victoria, said he believed Pell knew more about sexual abuse than he let on.
&quot;None of us will be shedding any tears,&quot; he was quoted as saying in Melbourne&#x27;s The Age …</span>

The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that its member associations have until July 1 to complete the name change.
Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China but competes separately from the country in international sports, including at the Olympics.
Fewer than 20 of the 83 Hong Kong sports organizations listed on the Olympic Committee&#x27;s website have &quot;China&quot; in their names.
There is the Hong Kong China Swimming Association for example. However, Hong Kong&#x27;s football association currently has no reference to China in its name.

                              <span>An attacker stabbed six people on Wednesday at the busy Gare du Nord station in Paris before being shot and apprehended by police, authorities said.
The Gare du Nord is a busy commuter hub which also serves as a departure point for trains to northern France, London and northern Europe.
Police were treating the stabbings as attempted murder, not as a terrorist attack, a source close to the case said.
The attacker&#x27;s motive was not immediately clear.
One of the six people was seriously wounded in the attack at 6:42 am (0542 GMT), while the other five sustained light injuries, prosecutors said.
The entire incident was over within two minutes, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters at the scene.
It was not immediately clear what type of weapon the attacker had used.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy stripped four political figures of their Ukrainian citizenship on Tuesday, including pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk who was transferred to Russia last year in a prisoner swap deal.
&quot;I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk,&quot; Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
&quot;If people&#x27;s deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate.&quot;
Medvedchuk, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, headed a banned pro-Russian party the &quot;Opposition Platform - For Life&quot; in Ukraine and was facing treason charges before being transferred to Moscow in September 2022.
Kozak and Kuzmin had been both elected to Ukraine&#x27;s parliament as members of Medvedchuk&#x27;s party.
The United States imposed sanctions on Kozak, the owner of three television channels, in January of 2022 for alleged spreading of Russian disinformation, after Kyiv sought his arrest on treason charges.
Ukraine has also charged Kuzmin with high treason.
Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker also sanctioned by Washington, was charged in the United States in December with money laundering and sanctions violations.
He had been accused of helping Russia interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2020.

Relationships:
 


•Irregular Warfare is the military contribution to Political Warfare
 

•Political Warfare is the essence of the gray zone in strategic competition
 

•Competitive Statecraft at the national level is required for effective political warfare

                              <span>Thousands of &quot;hostile&quot; web attacks launched from Russian IP addresses have targeted an online auction of prints by British graffiti artist Banksy in aid of Ukraine, the charity Legacy of War Foundation said Tuesday.
The elusive street artist is selling 50 new limited edition screen-prints through the charity to raise funds to support Ukrainian civilians affected by conflict.
To get one of the £5,000 ($6,080) prints, which show a mouse sliding down the side of a box with &quot;FRAGILE&quot; printed on it, supporters have to register online with the charity.
But a message posted on its website said it had &quot;received over 1 million requests (and 3,500 hostile attacks from Russian IP addresses), so we would appreciate your patience at this time&quot;.
&quot;We are currently sifting through the registered entries and will notify successful applicants shortly,&quot; it added.
Banksy previously said he supported the charity as he had seen one of its teams &quot;sweep in and provide medical attention, heaters, fresh water and a friendly face to some very desperate people in a bombed-out building&quot;.
The artist confirmed he was behind seven murals that appeared on destroyed buildings around Kyiv last year.

                              <span>The French government presented its proposed pension reforms on Tuesday – measures President Emmanuel Macron has long argued are necessary to make the system affordable over the long term, an argument critics vociferously contest. FRANCE 24 spoke to several workers who do arduous jobs – and who are up in arms about the plans to take away the cherished right to retire at 62.
There’s been talk of Macron renewing his pensions reform for months – but everyone knows the broad outline. The centerpiece of the legislation will be raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, and increasing the number of years people must have worked to qualify for a full pension.
Macron became the first French president in a generation to lose a National Assembly majority in last year’s parliamentary elections. That m…</span>

PARIS (Reuters) -The French should work two years longer before they can retire, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said, detailing an unpopular reform of the pension system that risks strikes and will test President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s ability to deliver change.
The long-delayed overhaul pushes the retirement age to 64, a move opposed by four in every five citizens according to an Odoxa poll, at a time when many are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis.
&quot;I&#x27;m well aware that changing our pension system raises questions and fears among the French,&quot; Borne said on Tuesday, adding that her government would work on convincing the French that the reform was necessary.
&quot;We offer today a project to balance our pension system, a project that is fair,&quot; …</span>

Daniel Edmund Duggan was arrested in Australia late last year and now faces extradition to the United States, where he is accused of violating an arms embargo.
The 54-year-old was a highly-regarded jet pilot who spent 12 years in the US Marine Corps, reaching the rank of Major and working as a tactical flight instructor.
An indictment filed in 2016 -- but only unsealed in December last year -- alleged Duggan broke US arms control laws by providing &quot;defence services&quot; to &quot;Chinese foreign nationals&quot; after he left the military.

                              <span>French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo doubled down on its ridicule of Iran&#x27;s religious rulers on Tuesday, with fresh cartoons of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei despite protests from Iran and its allies.
&quot;The mullahs aren&#x27;t happy. The caricatures of their supreme leader... do not seem to have made them laugh,&quot; the paper&#x27;s editor, known as &quot;Riss&quot;, writes in the latest edition, which hits newsstands on Wednesday.
&quot;Laughing at themselves has never been a strong point of tyrants,&quot; he added.
The paper was hit by a cyber attack after publishing cartoons of Khamenei in last week&#x27;s special edition, which marked the anniversary of the 2015 attack on its Paris offices that left 12 dead.
&quot;A digital attack doesn&#x27;t leave anyone dead, but it sets the tone. The mullah&#x27;s regime feels in such danger that it considers it vital to its existence to hack the website of a French newspaper,&quot; Riss wrote.
&quot;It is an honour in one sense, but above all proves that they feel their power is very fragile.&quot;
There have been months of protests in Iran sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a woman arrested for allegedly violating the country&#x27;s strict dress code.
Iran issued an official warning to France over the &quot;insulting and indecent&quot; cartoons in last week&#x27;s Charlie Hebdo.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian movement in Lebanon, also condemned the cartoons, saying Khamenei was not just a ruler but &quot;a religious symbol for tens of millions of believers&quot;.</span>

Similar protests by Tesla owners have sprung up in cities including Henan, Wuxi and Hangzhou in recent days, according to owners and social media posts. Tesla has faced online backlash over previous price cuts in China before but nothing as widespread as the current spontaneous protests.
The groups protesting across China were in touch with each other and would continue to press Tesla to offer them some compensation, said Damon Yu, 29, who bought a Model Y in September.

                              <span>At least 11 people have died in storms across the Philippines in the past week, with more heavy rain expected in already sodden regions of the disaster-prone country, authorities said Tuesday.
Bad weather has plagued the country&#x27;s southern and central islands since the Christmas weekend when downpours triggered flooding and landslides that left 52 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Since January 3, back-to-back storms have killed 11 people as floodwaters swept through houses, cut roads and swamped crops, the civil defense office said.
The state weather forecaster warned Tuesday of &quot;serious flooding&quot; in low-lying areas and landslides in the mountains of the central island of Samar.
Heavy rain has already inundated villages, with water levels reaching three meters (10 feet) in some places.
So far, one person was missing and more than 2,200 people had been evacuated from their homes, said Josh Echano, Northern Samar provincial disaster officer.
The number of evacuees was expected to rise.
&quot;The flood is progressing since yesterday, it&#x27;s not subsiding,&quot; Echano said.
&quot;This could be fatal. This could be one of the worst (floods).&quot;
The Philippines is ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, and scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer.

The &quot;horizontal launch&quot; mission had left from the coastal town of Newquay in southwest England, with Virgin&#x27;s LauncherOne rocket carried under the wing of a modified Boeing 747 called &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;, and later released over the Atlantic Ocean.

While some snow started to fall again early this week, Europe has seen &quot;extreme&quot; warm winter weather in recent days, experts say, with 2023 already posting record January temperatures across the region.
From Austria to France, Italy and Switzerland, slopes have melted away -- with temperatures too high even to make artificial snow.
Many lower-lying resorts have had to close, while others are offering reduced services.
&quot;In the last days it&#x27;s not been cold or wintery... so winter holidaymakers probably don&#x27;t really feel like skiing,&quot; Nazar Nydza, managing director of the Semmering Hirschenkogel Bergbahnen told AFP.

                              <span>A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit deep under the ocean off Indonesia and East Timor early Tuesday, injuring at least one person after rattling nearby islands, damaging homes and forcing residents to flee in panic.
The epicentre of the quake was 427 kilometres (265 miles) south of the Indonesian island of Ambon at a depth of 95 kilometres, the US Geological Survey reported.
Indonesia&#x27;s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said the tremor was felt on the eastern islands of Timor, the Maluku archipelago and Papua. It reported some aftershocks at a magnitude of 5.5.
&quot;I was in bed, then I felt a little shake. I woke up and found out that many of my friends felt it too,&quot; Hamdi, an Indonesian in Ambon, told AFP.

Military experts brought together by the Center for Strategic and International Studies to wargame the conflict said every likely direct participant in a war -- the United States, China, Taiwan and Japan -- would experience &quot;enormous&quot; losses.
Chinese missiles would likely destroy US air bases in Japan and as far as Guam, and sink two US aircraft carriers and between 10 and 20 destroyers and cruisers as the invasion opened.
But the Chinese invading force itself would be heavily destroyed before it ever occupied any significant part of Taiwan.

Biden is visiting Mexico for the first time as president to meet Lopez Obrador and also hold three-way talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at what is dubbed the &quot;Three Amigos&quot; summit.
