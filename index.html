                              <span>China has been closely watching the developments in Europe at the NATO summit, says Sky News Reporter Trudy McIntosh. 

Ms McIntosh said China&#x27;s state-owned news outlet China Daily criticised Mr Albanese’s comments on China&#x27;s stance on the Ukraine crisis as “ill-informed”. 

“Beijing has long bristled at the suggestion that there is any connection between Russia’s ongoing invasion and China’s potential intentions when it comes to invading Taiwan,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“The language from Beijing’s side continues to heat up.”</span>

Recycled &#x27;NEWater&#x27; was first introduced in 2003 to ease pressure on the country&#x27;s water supply.</span>

                              <span>Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).
I love to read in the tub, but I fall asleep easily and end up with a soggy creature rather than a readable book.  It works well for authors, because I’m always going to buy another copy.  I bought and drowned four copies of Jenny Odell’s “How to Do Nothing” – that’s how powerful her message is.  Otherwise, I like it to be summer and the breeze, the air scented with spicy flowers, me in a comfy chair or couch with a cup of coffee and a pen to underline.
What’s your favorite book that no one else has heard of?
I will cite three lesser-read novels by well-known authors.  I deeply love “The Catherine Wheel”, by Jean Stafford, for its extraordinary and often very funny phrases.  It’s set during a summer in Maine in a dusty old to…</span>

                              <span>BECKET, Mass.  – Among the main attractions of Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival is its bucolic setting here in the Berkshires.  But new this year is a return to the great interior.  In 2020, the double blow of the pandemic and a fire that ravaged one of the two halls of the festival forced the cancellation of all performances.  Last year the shows were outdoors, weather permitting.  The main stage — the barn that festival founder Ted Shawn converted into the first theater in the United States dedicated to dance 80 years ago — was undergoing necessary renovations.
The Ted Shawn Theater is open for business again, half of its weathered, historic-looking wood exterior, the other half clean and new.  (The second theater has not yet been rebuilt.)

When Alex Lawther’s frail Danish prince drags himself onto the stage in Robert Icke’s modern production of “Hamlet,” which kicked off Tuesday night at the Park Avenue Armory, he is reminded of 19th-century poets Arthur Rimbaud and Percy Shelley, a bright but discouraged young man.  who seems intent on his grief – and a tragic end.
Over the past decade, Icke has gained notoriety for his heightened and contemporary adaptations of classics.  This “Hamlet” played in the West End in 2017, with the hot priest sized package of magnetizing charisma known as…</span>

Altogether 49 start-ups specialising in bio and health technology, deep tech, information technology and artificial intelligence (AI), fintech and other areas have been selected to receive up to HK$1 million each. With funding worth over HK$46 million, CityU aims to enhance the business development of these start-ups and boost innovation technology in Hong Kong and beyond by encouraging practical applications of the University’s research and technology output.  In his opening remarks, Mr Lester Garson Huang, Chairman of the CityU Council, congratulated the start-ups on securing awards from the HK Tech 300 Angel Fund, and expressed his hope that their successful experience would inject new energy into the drive for innovation and technology in Hong Kong and beyond. “The investments are more than mere financial backing for these start-ups,” said Mr Huang, emphasising the fruitful achievements of the HK Tech 300 programme a year into its establishment. “They also signify CityU&#x27;s determination to support young people in their quest for innovation and technology.”  President Way Kuo of CityU said that through its internationally acclaimed science and technology research projects, CityU had made a substantial contribution to the community. “CityU is committed to bringing about positive changes in society through the transfer of new knowledge and technology,” he said.

President Biden on Thursday said the U.S. and its allies would provide support “as long as it takes” for Ukraine to win its war against Russia. 
“We are going to stick with Ukraine, and all of the alliance is going to stick with Ukraine as long as it takes to in fact make sure that they are not defeated … in Ukraine by Russia,” Biden told reporters at a press conference at the NATO summit.

Sri Lanka is telling its citizens to stay home and grow their own food, as a government minister announced that fuel reserves have hit “rock bottom.” 
Jason Anthony has been in a two-kilometre fuel queue for two days now. In the capital city of Colombo, in the crisis-hit South Asian nation of Sri Lanka, the 35-year-old sleeps in his tuktuk when he’s exhausted, or sits on the pavement with other drivers who have been there for several days too.   When the fuel station closes for the day, he walks several kilometres back home, only to return the next day to queue up. He showed VICE World News his makeshift home by the road over a video call.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: White House Is Quietly Modeling For $200 Oil &quot;Shock&quot; 
While the Biden administration is hoping and praying that someone - anyone - will watch the comical &quot;Jan 6&quot; kangaroo hearsay court taking place in Congress and meant to somehow block Trump from running for president in 2024 while also making hundreds of millions of Americans forget that the current administration could very well be the worst in US history, it is quietly preparing for the worst. 
As none other than pro-Biden propaganda spinmaster CNN reports, when it comes to what really matters (at least according to Gallup), namely the economy, and specifically galloping gasoline prices, the White House is in a historic shambles.       
For an administration that ended last year forecasting a leveling off of 40-year high inflation and eager to tout a historically rapid recovery from the pandemic-driven economic crisis, there is a level of frustration that comes with an acutely perilous moment. Asked by CNN about progress on a seemingly intractable challenge, another senior White House official responded flatly: &quot;Which one?&quot;

Bloomberg: US Hypersonic Missile Fails in Test in Fresh Setback for Program 
(Bloomberg) -- A flight test of a hypersonic missile system in Hawaii ended in failure due to a problem that took place after ignition, the Department of Defense said, delivering a fresh blow to a program that has suffered stumbles.
It didn’t provide further details of what took place in the Wednesday test, but said in a statement sent by email “the Department remains confident that it is on track to field offensive and defensive hypersonic capabilities on target dates beginning in the early 2020s.” 
“An anomaly occurred following ignition of the test asset,” Pentagon spokesman Navy Lieutenant Commander Tim Gorman said in the statement.

National Grid could cut off pipelines to Netherlands and Belgium amid Russia-Ukraine war pressures 
Britain may stop supplying gas to mainland Europe if the country is hit by extreme shortages in the coming months, it has emerged. 
National Grid could cut off gas pipelines to the Netherlands and Belgium under emergency measures as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts pressure on global energy supplies. 
Shutting off the pipelines – known as interconnectors – would be part of a four-step plan that would include cutting supplies to big industrial users and asking consumers to reduce their household consumption, the Financial Times reported.

WNU Editor: The authorities are downplaying this prospect, saying a gas supply emergency was an “extremely unlikely” scenario. If that is the case, why issue the warning in the first place?</span>

TASS: Multipolar world order evolving globally, process irreversible — Putin 
&quot;The position of Russia and many other countries is that this democratic, more just world order should be built on the basis of mutual respect and trust, and, of course, on the generally accepted principles of international law and the UN Charter,&quot; the President emphasized 
MOSCOW, June 30. /TASS/. A multipolar world order is evolving globally now, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.
&quot;A multipolar system of international relations has been actively evolving.
The process is irreversible, it has been unfolding in front of our eyes and it is objective in its nature,&quot; Putin said, addressing the 10th St. Petersburg International Legal Forum (SPBILF).

NATO has been preparing for a war with Russia since 2014, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday following the NATO summit. 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been preparing for a conflict with Russia since 2014, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. 
Addressing media reporters following the NATO summit in Madrid, he revealed that ever since Russian troops overhauled power in the Crimean Peninsula, the military alliance started beefing up its troops in eastern Europe. He revealed that they have been anticipating a confrontation with Russian troops ever since.

Update: NATO prepared for confronting Russia since 2014 — Stoltenberg (TASS).   
WNU Editor: Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg&#x27;s admission that NATO has been preparing for a conflict with Russia since 2014, coupled with former Ukraine President Poroshenko&#x27;s admission two weeks ago that the Minsk deal and the failure to implement it was only used to buy time (link here), only feeds into the Kremlin narrative and justification on why they had to invade Ukraine .... Senior MP says NATO’s Madrid rhetoric confirms refusal to comply with Minsk deal (TASS). More from the former Russian President and Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev .... Medvedev says Russia in its operation in Ukraine used UN-backed right for self-defense (TASS). 
Bottom line. 
From the Russian perspective these &quot;admissions&quot; will only mean one thing when this war is finally over. It is going to take decades before a Russian leader will trust the West.</span>

The SUN: Air Force regularly fires at UFOs in war zones, service member reveals after military’s 11 ‘near misses’ bombshell 
THE US Air Force has fired at UFOs in active war zones, an active duty service member exclusively told The Sun. 
This contradicts what military officials told Congress during May&#x27;s historic, public hearing about UAPs - unidentified aerial phenomena - and the impacts on national defense. 
&quot;The Air Force routinely observes, and at times, even kinetically engages UAP in operationally sensitive areas around the world to this day,&quot; a service member with direct knowledge of recent UAP Air Force engagements said.

Redstate: 14,000 Army Guard Troops Could Be Axed Thursday for Refusing COVID Vax 
With crime exploding, border crossings at an all-time high, and the nation’s travel system in chaos, what else could you do to make Americans less safe? 
Well, if you’re Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, you could force out up to 14,000 Army National Guard troops who refuse to get the COVID vaccine. 
That very well could happen Thursday, as the deadline for troops to get vaxed hits. The number could go even higher, as the Associated Press reports:       
Up to 40,000 Army National Guard soldiers across the country — or about 13% of the force — have not yet gotten the mandated COVID-19 vaccine, and as the deadline for shots looms, at least 14,000 of them have flatly refused and could be forced out of the service. 
Guard soldiers have until Thursday to get the vaccine. According to data obtained by The Associated Press, between 20% to 30% of the Guard soldiers in six states are not vaccinated, and more than 10% in 43 other states still need shots.

   Taipei Times: University student prefers music study despite mapping China’s military bases 
A university student has gained the spotlight for an interactive map he designed detailing all of China’s military bases and installations throughout the Indo-Pacific region. 
Soochow University music student Joseph Wen (溫約瑟), who calls himself an amateur military enthusiast, said he created the map to “help people better understand the cross-strait situation.” 
Wen originally posted the map online on June 14 last year, but it gained greater attention after he mentioned it during an appearance on a China Television talk show.

                              <span>Hot Air: Oil industry agrees. Refineries likely not coming back online under current conditions 
President Joe Biden and his allies have continued to badger the American oil and gas industry to produce more gasoline in an effort to bring down prices ahead of the midterm elections. At the same time, they have been hurling accusations of “corporate greed” at major industry players and attempting to claim that the high prices are all the fault of the producers. As we’ve discussed here repeatedly, however, those allegations and characterizations of the industry are demonstrably false. What we’re dealing with is a lack of refinery capacity. The United States currently has the lowest number of functioning refineries capable of producing gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that we’ve seen since 2016, largely as a result of government policies. Industry analyst S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights reports this week that our existing refineries are running at or very near maximum capacity, and the odds of any of the shuttered refineries coming back online are slim to none.

L.A. Times: Vice President Harris says Biden &#x27;intends&#x27; to run for reelection in 2024 
Vice President Kamala Harris created new uncertainty Wednesday about President Biden&#x27;s intentions to run for reelection in 2024, pulling back from a definitive statement she had made earlier in the week. 
 “The president intends to run and if he does, I will be his ticket mate. We will run together,” Harris told a Times reporter Wednesday as she prepared to depart for California aboard Air Force Two. 
Advisors had told the reporter that Harris wanted to come to the back of the plane to clarify what she told CNN on Monday. In an interview with CNN&#x27;s Dana Bash, Harris was asked about speculation that Biden would not run and about her own potential candidacy. 
&quot;Joe Biden is running for reelection, and I will be his ticket mate,&quot; Harris told CNN. &quot;Full stop.&quot;

WNU Editor: President Biden will not be running for re-election. Running a campaign from his basement home may have worked during the Covid lock-downs in the 2020 Presidential election. But 2024 is going to be different, and he will need to hit the campaign trail and engage with the public. I do not see him having the energy to do it. On second thought .... forget about 2024. He does not have the energy or focus to do it now.</span>

Chron.com: &#x27;Mystery rocket&#x27; that crashed into the Moon baffles NASA scientists  
So far, no space exploring nations have claimed responsibility for the rocket. 
NASA has discovered the crash site of a &quot;mystery rocket body&quot; that collided with the Moon&#x27;s surface earlier this year. The impact left behind a widespread &quot;double crater,&quot; meaning it wasn&#x27;t the average rocket. 
However, since its crash landing, none of Earth&#x27;s space-exploring nations have claimed responsibility for the mysterious projectile, leaving NASA scientists baffled as to who was behind its launch. New images shared on June 24 by NASA&#x27;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter show the unusual impact site.

Reuters: With Israel&#x27;s Knesset set to dissolve, PM Bennett says he will not seek re-election 
JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel on Wednesday moved closer toward its fifth election in less than four years, plunging it deeper into political uncertainty as it grapples with rising living costs amid renewed international efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran. 
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced he would not run in the upcoming election but would retain his position as alternate prime minister after his coalition partner Yair Lapid takes over as head of the caretaker government. 
&quot;I leave behind a thriving, strong and secure country,&quot; he told reporters on Wednesday. &quot;We proved this year that people with very different opinions can work together,&quot; he added, referring to his ideologically diverse coalition.

                              <span>In “Accepted,” director Dan Chen takes us into the world of TM Landry, a private school in Louisiana whose videos of African-American students garnering Ivy League college acceptances have gone viral.  But nine months after the filmmakers’ first visit to the school, the New York Times published reports of physical abuse, tampered transcripts and “bigoted” behavior from its founders, Mike and Tracey Landry.  “Accepted” viewers get a front-row seat to experience the shattering impact of the school’s collapse through the stories of four promising high school students: Adia, Alicia, Cathy and Issac.
As we watch both the documentary’s subjects — and its director — navigate shocking real-time development, a quiet probing film emerges that pierces the mythos of America’s meritocracy.


Chen makes the choice to walk at the same measured pace throughout — even after the TM Landry scandal came to light — and forgo the cryptic notation we’re used to hearing when the jig is up.  Likewise, Chen and Daphne Qin Wu’s cinematography seamlessly oscillates between intimate handheld shots and aerial views of western Louisiana landscapes that reflect the eventual loss of access to the Landrys and the ‘school.


Ultimately, it’s the resilience of the film’s teenage subjects that elevates “Accepted” to new heights.  As they sit for close-ups in front of a swirling blue backdrop, the Georgetown and Stanford sweatshirts are gone, and the hopes they once held.  But in their place is a clear understanding of the misguided pressures on individual minority students to succeed in a society that systematically disadvantages them, and a surprisingly powerful story about peace with imperfection.

Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony continued to be talked about late into Wednesday night.  Statements from Trump’s former White House aide on Tuesday were so powerful that Fox News hosts appeared speechless on air, especially an awkwardly long pause during a show with Bret Baier, Sandra Smith and John Roberts.


“They couldn’t settle on a cohesive narrative like they usually do,” Meyers said.  “They just walked a bunch of different lines, from shouting about media bias to saying everyone knows Trump is getting mad to dismissing Hutchinson as a low-level staffer who allegedly self -saying ulterior motives.”

“Whew.  It’s like when you get in the car with your parents after they take you to see a movie where there was a lot more nudity than they expected. —SETH MEYERS




“Andrew, honey, I hope you know you lost, not because of your swollen bee sting head, or because you have a smile like a jack-o’-lantern, or because you have no qualification. You lost because your last name is now toxic, because your father had a week after 9/11 when he was considered a hero, but he ruined everything when he left [expletive]    nuts.” — CHELSEA HANDLER, guest host of “Jimmy Kimmel Live”
“There are so many unanswered questions.  Would Andrew have lost if his dad hadn’t tried to overthrow the Democracy of a landscaping store or sweat some sauce at a press conference?  We’ll never know. — CHELSEA MANIPULATOR

Pieces to watch
James Corden took “The Late Late Show” to London this week, where John Boyega, Minnie Driver and Sam Smith discussed the best breakup songs on Wednesday night’s show.

Then, as the wedge-shaped beast rumbled through the schoolyard, they burst into cheers, waving their fists and leaping into the air.
It was a spontaneous expression of the emotion the Italian sports car maker inspires and motivates those who can afford it to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases millions, to get one.
But Lamborghini, Ferrari and a handful of other companies that make so-called supercars – a loosely defined category of vehicles that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and offer race car-level performance – face an existential threat.  The automotive industry is moving inexorably towa…</span>

He had made the same 30-minute trip to the Port of Los Angeles twice that day;  if things were going well, he would do it twice more.  Mr. Alvarado has learned that an average of four pickups and deliveries a day is what it takes to give his wife and three children a comfortable life.
“It’s been my life – it’s helped me support a family,” said Mr. Alvarado, who for 17 years hauled goods between Southern California warehouses and the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, a global hub that handles 40% of the country’s maritime imports.

ISLE OF GRAIN, England – The calm waters near the entrance to the River Medway seem best suited to sailboats and other pleasure craft, but some of the world’s biggest ships head here for a jetty.
Simon Culkin, the import terminal manager at the facility called Grain LNG, jokes about making sure none of these vessels are manned by a “learner learner”.
The behemoths, some of which are more than 300 meters long, carry cargoes of liquefied natural gas.  Once the ships latch onto a rack of pipes on the pier, their frigid fuel flows into massive, 160-foot-tall concrete-lined storage tanks.

                              <span>WASHINGTON — With Democrats and reproductive rights advocates clamoring for President Biden to forcefully oppose the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, his health secretary, Xavier Becerra, appeared Tuesday at a lectern to list the steps his department would take to preserve and expand access to abortion.
The list, for now anyway, is short. 
“There’s no magic formula,” Mr. Becerra told an early morning press conference, “but if there’s something we can do, we’ll find it and we’ll do it.”
The Supreme Court’s decision on Friday eliminating the constitutional right to abortion was not unexpected, but neither the White House nor Mr. Becerra’s agency had immediate policy responses ready.

                              <span>Co-op apartments in a luxury doorman building on Billionaires’ Row sell for as low as $100,000 for a studio and $659,000 for a three-bedroom penthouse with a terrace.
But the problem in the unique New York scenario is that the owners of the 324-unit building must pay a total of $280 million to buy the land under the structure, or face an additional $26 million a year in land rent in addition to the current $4.4 million per year.  If they don’t cough, they risk losing their home.
Carnegie House at 100 W. 57th St. at the corner of Sixth Avenue is a 21-story gray brick structure that resembles many other middle-class Manhattan apartment buildings of the early 1960s.

But Apple’s Siri, Google AssistantSamsung Bixby and business aren’t the only tools using machine learning to make life easier — other common programs also use the technology.  Here’s a quick look at some common AI-powered apps and how you can manage them.
Device Security
When setting up a new device, you are usually prompted to “enroll” in its facial recognition security program, which captures your image and analyzes it so the program recognizes you in different styles and lighting situations.

                              <span>Since Russian forces attacked a mall on June 27 in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine, false information has been circulating on social networks. Russia&#x27;s defence ministry claims it did not target the shopping centre, but rather a nearby ammunition stockpile, and alleges that the centre simply caught fire. The ministry also maintains that the mall was no longer functional. However, open-source evidence contradicts these claims.</span>

                              <span>ANU’s Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies Professor Hugh White says China is an “exceptionally powerful and exceptionally determined” country as the nation looks to lead Eastern Asia and the Western Pacific. 

Mr White said pushing China would have a high chance of conflict. 

“I don’t think the United States can defeat China in a naval war over an issue like Taiwan for example,” he told Sky News Australia.

“China is going to be a very important part of the strategic order in Asia.”</span>

Norwegian media outlets had previously cited the authorities as confirming that the Russians on Svalbard were denied an exemption from sanctions that were imposed on Moscow over its conflict with Ukraine.

WNU Editor: Svalbard is a group of islands located midway between Norway’s north coast and the North Pole. It is a part of Norway, but Russia has the right to exploit the archipelago’s natural resources under a treaty signed in 1920.  A number of the settlements on the archipelago are populated mainly by Russians.

                              <span>Forbes: ‘Has Ukraine Not Paid Enough?’: Zelensky Urges NATO For Security Guarantees As Sweden And Finland Invited To Join Alliance 
In what appears to be a shift in diplomatic strategy, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked NATO on Wednesday whether Ukraine has “not paid enough” to join the alliance—one day after Finland and Sweden reached a deal with Turkey that paves the way for the Scandinavian countries to join NATO. 
* Speaking at NATO’s summit in Madrid Wednesday morning, Zelensky said Ukraine needs “security guarantees” and that NATO needs “to find a place for Ukraine in the common security space.” 
* Zelensky’s comments are a shift from a statement he made in March that he had “cooled down” on talks to join the alliance. 
* The Ukrainian president’s statement follows an agreement between Finland, Sweden and Turkey on Tuesday to allow the two Scandinavian countries into NATO, in return for their cooperation on counter-terrorism initatives in Turkey.

Arriving at the meeting in Madrid, the US president announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain.

* President Biden arrived at the NATO summit in Madrid on Wednesday morning 
* He said the U.S. was changing its &#x27;force posture in Europe&#x27;

Turkey will renew requests for Sweden and Finland to extradite individuals it considers &quot;terrorists&quot; after the countries reached a deal over the Nordic nations&#x27; NATO membership bids, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on Wednesday.
Turkey had opposed their bids over what it called support for Kurdish militants and others it views as terrorists, as well as over arms embargoes and unfulfilled extradition requests. 
On Tuesday, the three nations signed a deal for Ankara to remove its block, while the candidates pledged not to support the Kurdish militant PKK and YPG groups.

                              <span>OilPrice.com: Oil Markets Could Face A Doomsday Scenario This Week 
* Expect lots of oil price volatility in the coming months as markets finally discover just how much spare capacity OPEC members really have. 
* Oil production outages in Libya and the continued impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are going to push oil prices higher if new supply isn’t found. 
* While some analysts are predicting oil demand destruction in the near future, there is little evidence to back up those claims. 
Global oil markets are going to be very volatile in the coming months if news emerging from OPEC’s main producers about production capacity constraints turns out to be true. OPEC will be meeting again in the coming days to discuss its export agreements, while today the oil group is presenting its Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) 2022. While the media is likely to be focused on rumors in the next 24 hours of a possible change in the export strategy of OPEC+, the real focus should be on whether or not the oil cartel is even capable of substantially increasing its production.  For years, OPEC producers have been the main swing producers in oil markets. With a presumed spare capacity of more than 3-4 million bpd, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have always been seen as a point of last resort in case of a major crisis in oil and gas markets.

   WNU Editor: I am always watching how leaders interact among themselves at these summits. This always tells me who do they want to meet and be with, and more importantly who is drawing in everyone&#x27;s attention. That is why watching President Biden at the G7 summit was painful to watch. He was either being ignored and/or lectured. And now at the NATO summit, aside from the customary handshakes, hellos, and introductions, the US President is now being ignored in the social settings where a lot of business is always taking place..</span>

Reuters: Russia publishes Pentagon coordinates, says Western satellites &#x27;work for our enemy&#x27; 
LONDON (Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s space agency published the coordinates of Western defence headquarters including the U.S. Pentagon and the venue of NATO&#x27;s summit on Tuesday, saying Western satellite operators were working for Russia&#x27;s enemy - Ukraine. 
Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos, told the Russian RIA Novosti news agency: &quot;The entire conglomerate of private and state orbital groupings is now working exclusively for our enemy.&quot; 
Members of the U.S.-led NATO alliance make no secret of the fact that they are sending weapons to help Ukraine resist Russia&#x27;s invasion. 
The U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar, whose clients include the U.S. Defense Department, has several times published pictures it has taken over Ukraine and Russia since before the invasion began in February.

                              <span>Axios: Ecuador government and Indigenous group end talks after disruptive protests 
Ecuador&#x27;s government has stopped negotiations with an Indigenous coalition that has been carrying out nationwide protests that have paralyzed parts of the country, shutting down roads and causing delays in the country&#x27;s oil production. 
Driving the news: President Guillermo Lasso said Tuesday that discussions won&#x27;t continue because the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) is fostering groups that carry out violence like the attack that left one military officer dead and over 10 wounded early today in an Amazon region.

RFE: Bulgaria Expels 70 Russian Embassy Staff Accused Of Working Against Sofia&#x27;s Interests  
Bulgaria has ordered 70 Russian diplomatic staff out of the country, claiming that they have been working against Sofia&#x27;s interests. 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Irena Dimitrova summoned Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova on June 28 to inform her of the expulsions, a Foreign Ministry statement said. 
The statement said the first reason for the expulsions was &quot;reciprocity” and the second was because Bulgarian authorities have determined that the Russian officials&#x27; &quot;activity” is incompatible with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

Space.com: US military&#x27;s mysterious X-37B space plane zooms toward orbital record 
The X-37B is just a week away from setting a new mission-duration mark. 
The U.S. military&#x27;s X-37B robotic space plane is closing in on a mission-duration record. 
The X-37B launched to Earth orbit on May 17, 2020 on the sixth mission for the program, a flight known as Orbital Test Vehicle-6 (OTV-6). 
The Space Force minishuttle has now been aloft for 773 days. That&#x27;s just a week shy of the X-37B record of 780 days, which was set on OTV-5. (That program record doesn&#x27;t come close to the overall mark for an orbital stay; for example, the Landsat-5 satellite observed Earth from orbit for 29 years.)

Reuters: From war to wild weather, global crop problems point to years of high food prices 
(Reuters) - Eric Broten had planned to sow about 5,000 acres of corn this year on his farm in North Dakota, but persistent springtime rains limited him to just 3,500 in a state where a quarter or more of the planned corn could remain unsown this year. 
The difficulty planting corn, the single largest grain crop in the world, in the northern United States adds to a string of troubled crop harvests worldwide that point to multiple years of tight supplies and high food costs. 
Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, a major agricultural exporter, sent prices of wheat, soy and corn to near records earlier this year. 
Poor weather has also reduced grain harvests in China, India, South America and parts of Europe. Fertilizer shortages meanwhile are cutting yields of many crops around the globe.

Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky remarked that he would like to end the hostilities before the cold comes 
MOSCOW, June 28. /TASS/. Hostilities in Ukraine may end &quot;before the end of today,&quot; if Kiev orders the nationalists to lay down their weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. 
&quot;The Ukrainian side can end all this before the end of this day; an order is necessary for the nationalist units to lay down their weapons, an order is necessary for the Ukrainian military to lay down their weapons; and they must fulfill all Russia’s demands. 
Then everything will be over before the day ends,&quot; the spokesman said, commenting on Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s remark that he would like to end the hostilities before the cold comes.

“Faced with the worst hunger crisis in a generation, the G7 have simply failed to take the action that is needed. Many millions will face terrible hunger and starvation as a result.” 
“Instead of doing what is needed, the G7 are leaving millions to starve and cooking the planet.”

Inflation, food shortages and high prices, energy shortages and high prices, the general cost of living, unsustainable debt levels, and the breakdown of supply chains. The G7 was completely AWOL. To say that this two-day summit was a disappointment is an understatement.</span>

                              <span>Serena Williams has fallen at the first hurdle in her long-awaited comeback to tennis - crashing out of Wimbledon in the first round. 

In her first singles match since tearing her hamstring on Centre Court last year - the now 411th ranked player in the world returned to the same venue to play France&#x27;s Harmony Tan. 

The 24-year-old Tan had lost seven of her eight tour-level matches but started the stronger of the two - taking the first set 7-5. 

Ms Williams recovered quickly to take the second set 6-1 in dominant fashion before falling in the deciding third set match tie-break.</span>

                              <span>Zero Hedge: White House Desperate To Make New Oil Deals As Gas Prices Crush Biden 
There are two schools of thought when it comes to the stagflation crisis:  Those that think inflation in necessities is part of a deliberate agenda of national sabotage, and those that think the whole disaster is a product of pure stupidity.  There is certainly enough evidence to suggest that the establishment benefits to a degree from prices skyrocketing, but they also face massive risks if the crisis unfolds too quickly. 
A stagflation event is like an avalanche, it&#x27;s going to come rushing down the mountain and there&#x27;s no slowing it once it gets moving.  Such a crisis can be deliberately created through central bank fiat money printing and hiking interest rates into economic weakness, but are the banks and politicians so foolish as to believe they can control its path of destruction once it starts?

Ankara had previously blocked the Nordic countries from joining the alliance over concerns about arms exports and terrorism 
A last minute agreement has been reached between Turkey, Finland and Sweden to allow the two Nordic countries to become Nato members on the eve of the military alliance’s summit in Madrid. 
Nato said a trilateral deal had been reached at a meeting between Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in the Spanish capital. 
After a period of intensive negotiations, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said on Tuesday evening: “I am pleased to announce that we now have an agreement that paves the way for Finland and Sweden to join Nato.”

CNN: Biden officials privately doubt that Ukraine can win back all of its territory 
White House officials are losing confidence that Ukraine will ever be able to take back all of the land it has lost to Russia over the past four months of war, US officials told CNN, even with the heavier and more sophisticated weaponry the US and its allies plan to send. 
Advisers to President Joe Biden have begun debating internally how and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should shift his definition of a Ukrainian “victory” – adjusting for the possibility that his country has shrunk irreversibly. 
US officials emphasized to CNN that this more pessimistic assessment does not mean the US plans to pressure Ukraine into making any formal territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war. There is also hope that Ukrainian forces will be able to take back significant chunks of territory in a likely counteroffensive later this year.

WNU Editor: CNN has a lot of close ties to the Biden administration and the US intelligence community, and reporter Natasha Bertrand covers intelligence and national security stories. I would not be surprised if she has a few good sources in the White House, Pentagon, and the intelligence community, and they use her to pass-on administration thinking and analysis to the public. 
So what are they telling her now? 
They are telling her that the situation in Ukraine is becoming grim, and Ukraine is currently not in a position to launch a counter-offensive against Russia.</span>

António Guterres says the world must turn the tide of rising sea levels, ocean heating, acidification and plastics pollution 
The UN secretary general has declared that the world is in the middle of an “ocean emergency”, and urged governments to do more to restore ocean health.
Speaking at the opening of the UN ocean conference in Lisbon, Portugal, attended by global leaders and heads of state from 20 countries, António Guterres said: “Sadly, we have taken the ocean for granted and today we face what I would call an ocean emergency. 
We must turn the tide.”  Guterres said the “egoism” of some nations was hampering efforts to agree a long-awaited treaty to protect the world’s oceans.

Near his face, a basketball sinks into the net;  under his feet, a white line divides the image, like the fold of a pocket mirror.

Just grabbing his stick was a chore, but he did it well enough to score one of the defining goals of a formidable series, the overtime winner in Game 4.

Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson is optimistic that Turkish opposition to Finland and her country&#x27;s entry to NATO can be resolved in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan ahead of the NATO summit in Madrid this week.
Speaking on Monday alongside NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Andersson said it is her &quot;strong hope&quot; that talks between Sweden, Finland and Turkey can &quot;be successfully concluded in the near future, ideally before the summit,&quot; referring to the NATO leaders summit that begins on Tuesday.
Andersson stressed Sweden&#x27;s commitment to combatting terrorism, a major reason for Turkey&#x27;s oppos…</span>

                              <span>A 31-year-old man has been detained in south-western Germany, accused of stabbing several people in a shelter for asylum seekers.
One man was killed and at least five people were injured in the knife attack late on Sunday, police said on Monday.
The Nigerian man, also a resident at the accommodation in the small town of Kressbronn on Lake Constance, allegedly knocked on the doors of the rooms on Sunday evening and stabbed whomever opened the doors.
A 38-year-old Syrian man died on the spot. Those injured included a 37-year-old man and four women aged between 28 and 34.
One man who was seriously injured was flown to hospital by helicopter. The four others were taken to hospital by ambulance.
The officers arrested the suspect in front of the building. His motive and further background of the crime were initially unclear.
The man is known to have threatened several people with a knife or a similar object in the shelter in May, a police spokesperson confirmed on Monday evening.
He was then transferred to a psychiatric clinic, but the spokesperson was unable to say when he had returned to the accommodation.
Forensics work at the crime scene after a knife attack at an asylum-seeker shelter. A 31-year-old man allegedly stabbed several people, killing one man. At least five other people were injured, some seriously, in the knife attack, police said Monday. Davor Knappmeyer/Tnn/dpa</span>

In a 2014 referendum, 55 percent of voters in Scotland chose to stay in the UK – and much to the chagrin of Unionists, the Scottish government plans to hold another next October. But from Brexit to a scandal-plagued prime minister occupying Downing Street, a lot has changed since the last vote.
&quot;After everything that has happened – Brexit, Covid, Boris Johnson – it is time to set out a different and better vision,&quot; Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared in a June 14 speech in Edinburgh outlining a “refreshed case for independence&quot;.
It’s no surprise that Sturgeon puts Brexit at the top of her list. Six years after the fateful referendum on Britain&#x27;s EU membership, Sco…</span>

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg painted the planned move, which alliance leaders are set to adopt during a summit in Madrid this week, as part of the 30-member organization&#x27;s efforts to bolster its defense of the Baltic nations, which have been clamoring for a &quot;credible military construct... that will deter&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin.

                              <span>Iran and the United States plan to resume indirect talks this week in a Gulf country, in a fresh bid to revive the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, both sides said Monday.
They did not name a country, but Iranian state media said the negotiations would be held in Qatar.
The talks will be separate from broader EU-mediated negotiations in Vienna between Iran and major powers, the bloc&#x27;s top diplomat Josep Borrell said Saturday in Tehran.
The nuclear deal has been hanging by a thread since 2018, when then US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it and began reimposing harsh economic sanctions on America&#x27;s arch enemy.
US President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration has sought to return to the agreement, saying it would be the best path ahead with the Islamic republic, although it has voiced gr…</span>

                              <span>US basketball star Brittney Griner, who is in detention in Russia on drug charges, will go on trial in Russia on July 1, a court said on Monday.
Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist and WNBA champion, was detained at Moscow airport in February after she was found carrying vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her luggage.
She was charged with drug smuggling, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison in Russia.
Griner&#x27;s detention came days before Russian President Vladimir Putin defied US warnings and sent troops into Ukraine, prompting Western powers to impose sweeping sanctions and send military aid to Kyiv.
A court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow said on Monday that Griner&#x27;s trial will begin on July 1.
Griner&#x27;s lawyer said on Monday the court had extended her detention for the duration of the trial.
&quot;This was absolutely expected,&quot; he said.
He said his client, who was seen by journalists being escorted in handcuffs, was &quot;worried&quot;.
Washington says that Russia has &quot;wrongfully detained&quot; the six-foot-nine (2.06-meter) basketball star, 31, and turned her case over to the US special envoy in charge of hostages.
The WNBA has also said it is working to bring Griner home.
She is considered among the greatest female basketball players and is a high points scorer.
She was playing club basketball in Russia before the resumption of the US season, a common practice for American stars seeking additional income.

                              <span>The United States, Israel and four Arab countries agreed to closer cooperation and annual foreign ministers&#x27; meetings on Monday, two weeks before President Joe Biden&#x27;s first visit to the Middle East.
Bahrain, host of the six-way talks, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco all opened ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, while Egypt made peace with the Jewish state in 1979.
Monday&#x27;s meeting follows a foreign ministers&#x27; summit in the Negev desert in March, and comes ahead of Biden&#x27;s visit to Israel, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia from July 13 to 16.
&quot;We&#x27;re trying to build a new regional framework... and tangible initiatives that can put flesh on the bones of the Negev forum,&quot; said Yael Lempert, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.
Working groups will investigate cooperation on six areas including security, clean energy and food and water security. A joint statement also gave support for a negotiated settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
&quot;It&#x27;s a very holistic approach, towards trying to advance this goal of building a new architecture that really has meaningful results,&quot; Lempert told reporters.
The six countries&#x27; foreign ministers are expected to meet annually and the next ministerial talks should take place later this year, the statement said.
The Manama meeting is part of a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region ahead of Biden&#x27;s visit, which Washington has played up as a boost for regional ties.
The US president has drawn heavy criticism over the trip, which contradicts his description of Saudi Arabia as a &quot;pariah&quot; over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.
His visit to the world&#x27;s top oil exporter follows a sharp rise in crude prices since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, causing pain for US voters and economies around the world.

GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany (Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies on Monday pledged to stand with Ukraine &quot;for as long as it takes&quot; by cranking up sanctions on Russia and backing security commitments for Kyiv in a post-war settlement.
Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and the global economic fallout such as soaring energy and food prices has dominated this year&#x27;s summit of the leaders of Germany, the United States, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Britain.
&quot;We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,&quot; said the statement.
The statement was issued on the second day of the summit taking place at a castle in the Bavarian Alps, shortly after Ukra…</span>

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia defaulted on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century, the White House said, as sweeping sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system, rendering its assets untouchable.
The Kremlin, which has the money to make payments thanks to oil and gas revenues, swiftly rejected the claims, and has accused the West of driving it into an artificial default.
Earlier, some bondholders said they had not received overdue interest on Monday following the expiry of a key payment deadline on Sunday.
Russia has struggled to keep up payments on $40 billion of outstanding bonds since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

                              <span>A trial began Sunday for an Egyptian man accused of stabbing a woman to death in a public street after she rejected his advances -- a case that has sparked widespread outrage.
A video went viral last week appearing to show the victim, identified as student Nayera Ashraf, being stabbed by a young man outside her university.
The crime has triggered widespread anger both in Egypt and beyond, having been followed a few days later by a similar incident in which Jordanian student Iman Irshaid was shot dead on a university campus.
Social media users immediately drew comparisons between the two murders, decrying cases of femicide in the Arab world.
At the Mansoura Criminal Court, 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Cairo, Mohamed Adel was accused of &quot;premeditated murder&quot;, after confessing to intentionally killing the victim, an AFP correspondent said.
Ashraf had previously reported the alleged perpetrator to the authorities, fearing that he would attack her, according to her father and witnesses.
The maximum penalty for murder is death in Egypt, which carried out the third highest number of executions in the world in 2021, according to Amnesty International.
&quot;He stabbed her several times,&quot; said the prosecution, which found &quot;messages threatening to cut her throat&quot; on the victim&#x27;s phone.
The next hearing is set for Tuesday, the defendant&#x27;s lawyer, Ahmed Hamad, told AFP.
In a rare occurrence among cases involving violence against women, authorities allowed television cameras to film the hearing on Sunday.
On social media, many Jordanian and Egyptian users called for the perpetrator to be sentenced to death, while others said men must &quot;learn to take no for an answer&quot;.
Egyptian preacher Mabrouk Attia sparked outrage last week after suggesting that the victim would not have met the same fate had she been veiled.
Nearly eight million Egyptian women were victims of violence committed by their partners or relatives, or by strangers in public spaces, according to a United Nations survey conducted in 2015.

                              <span>Part of the wooden stands collapsed during a bullfight in central Colombia Sunday, sending spectators plunging to the ground and killing at least four people and injuring hundreds, authorities said.
The disaster took place in a stadium in the city of El Espinal in Tolima state during a traditional event called “corraleja” in which members of the public enter the ring to engage the bulls.
Videos taken during the bullfight show a multi-story section of the stands collapsing as people screamed.
“We have activated the hospital network in Tolima,” Tolima Gov. José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”
Mayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.
Late Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.
Besides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.
Orozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.
President-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.
“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.
Current President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.
“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja. We will call for an investigation.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Google was hit with an antitrust complaint on Monday after Danish online job-search rival Jobindex took its grievance to European Union regulators, alleging the Alphabet-owned business had unfairly favoured its own job search service.
The complaint could reinvigorate EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager&#x27;s scrutiny of the service, Google for Jobs. Vestager said three years ago she was looking into the issue, but has yet to take any action.
The European Commission said it would assess the complaint according to the standard procedures. Jobindex&#x27;s action comes four years after German media group Axel Springer&#x27;s jobs portal Stepstone filed a similar complaint against Google.

QUITO (Reuters) -Ecuadorean President Guillermo Lasso said on Sunday he would cut prices for gasoline and diesel by 10 cents a gallon, the latest concession to try to end nearly two weeks of anti-government protests in which at least six people have died.
The sometimes-violent demonstrations by largely indigenous protesters demanding lower fuel and food prices, among other things, began on June 13 and have slashed Ecuador&#x27;s oil production.
Lasso, whose adversarial relationship with the national assembly has worsened during the protests, had already withdrawn security measures and announced subsidized fertilizers and debt forgiveness, and his government met this weekend with indigenous groups.

KYIV/POKROVSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russian forces were fighting to achieve one of their strategic objectives in Ukraine on Monday as Moscow-backed separatists said they were pushing into Lysychansk, the last major city still held by Ukrainian troops in eastern Luhansk province.
Lysychansk is the new focus of the war after its twin city of Sievierodonetsk fell on Saturday, in a victory for Moscow&#x27;s campaign to seize the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk on behalf of pro-Russian separatists.
Tass news agency on Sunday quoted a separatist official as saying Moscow&#x27;s forces had entered Lysychansk from five directions and were isolating Ukrainian defenders. Reuters could not confirm the report.

SCHLOSS ELMAU, Germany (Reuters) - Panned by critics for dragging his feet on Ukraine, called a &quot;sulky liver sausage&quot; by the Ukrainian ambassador, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday won public praise from a man he has long privately admired: U.S. President Joe Biden.
Reaching over to touch Scholz&#x27;s arm as they sat at the start of a G7 meeting in the Bavarian Alps, Biden said it was &quot;in no small part because of you&quot; that the West had stuck together against Russia four months after the invasion of Ukraine.
The two men, who are from different political generations but both took office last year, have made common cause over Ukraine as they sought to heal ties that were sorely strained under Biden&#x27;s predecessor Donald Trump.

The death toll in an attempt by hundreds of migrants to break through a border fence between Morocco and a Spanish exclave earlier this week has risen to 23, Moroccan state television reported on Sunday.
On Friday, Rabat said 18 migrants had died, while others and security forces were injured, during a mass attempt to storm the border to the Spanish exclave of Melilla.
Five further migrants have since died, raising the toll to 23, state television reported late on Saturday, citing unnamed local sources.
The 18 injured migrants and one member of security forces are still under medical observation, the broadcaster added without elaborating.
The independent Moroccan Association of Human Rights accused the security forces of using &quot;unjustified&quot; violence against the migrants and mistreating them.
Amin Abidar, the group’s head in the city of Nador near the border with Melilla, told dpa that migrants had been left trapped on the ground for hours without medical assistance.
For its part, Morocco&#x27;s Interior Ministry accused the migrants of using violence.
Morocco became independent from France and Spain in 1956. Nevertheless, Spain still holds two autonomous cities there: Melilla and Ceuta, 250 kilometres further west on the Strait of Gibraltar. Both are claimed by Rabat.
Near the two cities, tens of thousands of people, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, often wait for a chance to enter the EU.
Usually, several hundred people at a time try to surprise the border officials and get across the border en masse.

&quot;We are gathered here in grief, desperation and helplessness,&quot; said deacon Anne-May Grasass during the Mass, the Verdens Gang newspaper reported.
The attack, in which an assailant fired a weapon at multiple locations including a popular gay bar on Saturday morning, left two people dead and over 20 others injured. Norway&#x27;s PST intelligence service has deemed the shooting an Islamist terrorist attack.

KYIV/POKROVSK (Reuters) - Ukraine special forces remained in Sievierodonetsk directing artillery fire against Russian-backed troops, said an adviser to Ukraine&#x27;s president, after the city fell in a major setback for Kyiv as it struggles to keep control of the country&#x27;s east.
Ukrainian shelling on Saturday forced Russian troops to suspend the evacuation of people from a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, just hours after Moscow&#x27;s forces took the city, Tass news agency quoted local police as saying.

US President Joe Biden has arrived in Germany ahead of the G7 summit in Bavaria&#x27;s Schloss Elmau, on what is his first visit to the country since taking office.
Air Force One landed in Munich late on Saturday night, from where Biden continued to Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps, where the G7 summit begins on Sunday.
Biden is also due to meet for bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is hosting the event. The G7 summit, which lasts until Tuesday, will focus on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its global consequences.
Only last Thursday, the US pledged further arms deliveries to Ukraine worth $450 million, taking the total value of weaponry and other military equipment committed by Washington to Kiev to around $6.1 billion.
