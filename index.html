“And I think that they will probably need to use this sort of parting of ways to have a bit of a reassessment of where they go next in this audio space,” Mr Myers told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

Michael Rubin, AEI/19fortyfive.com: Can Biden Deter a Russia Nuclear Attack on Ukraine? Yes, if He Gives Ukraine Tactical Nukes 
Fear of nuclear exchange has long colored White House thinking on Ukraine. 
As Russian troops invaded Ukraine sixteen months ago, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan offered to evacuate Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian president rebuffed the offer. “I need ammunition, not a ride,” he responded. 
Even as Ukrainian forces defied the U.S. intelligence estimate, first blunting and then rolling back the Russian Army, fear of how Russian President Vladimir Putin might react led Washington to restrict assistance that could enable Ukraine to quicken its counterassault and save tens of thousands of lives.

WNU Editor: Michael Rubin is insane. Giving U.S. nuclear weapons to a regime that Moscow regards is run by Neo-Nazis will result in World War 3. 
But here is the scary part. Michael Rubin is not alone. He is saying out loud what many American think-tanks and foreign policy institutions now feel is a war that must be won regardless of the cost. Even if it may bring us to the brink of nuclear war.</span>

VOA/Reuters: Russian Attack Cannot Be Ruled Out, Says Swedish Parliamentary Report – SVT 
Stockholm — A Swedish parliament defense committee report said a Russian military attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out, Swedish public service broadcaster SVT said on Sunday, citing sources. 
Sweden has been scrambling to bolster its defenses and applied to join NATO last year following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Sweden was invited to apply but Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify the application. 
The parliamentary report, due to be published on Monday, said that although Russian ground forces were tied up in Ukraine, other types of military attacks against Sweden could not be ruled out, SVT said, citing sources who worked on the report.

The Cradle: Taliban, China discuss banking cooperation

 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021 
The Taliban’s governor of the Afghan central bank Hidayatullah Badri met with Chinese envoy Wang Yu this week to discuss banking ties and business, the bank’s spokesperson informed Reuters on 16 June. 
“In this meeting, economy, banking relations, business and some related topics were discussed,” said Badri. 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021. 
Following the withdrawal, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Italian news outlet La Repubblica that China would be its principal partner in rebuilding Afghanistan after a 20-year US occupation.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held &quot;candid&quot; talks with his Chinese counterpart at the start of two days of meetings with officials in China, the US state department says. 
Mr Blinken emphasised the need for diplomacy and keeping &quot;open channels of communication&quot;, a statement added. 
His trip is the first by a top US diplomat to China in almost five years.

A planned Blinken visit in February was called off after a suspected Chinese spy balloon flew in US airspace. 
US officials say the main goal of the Beijing talks is to stabilise a relationship that has become extremely tense.

                              <span>First Post: Afghanistan declares Aug 31 as national holiday to commemorate US troop withdrawal 
Afghanistan has announced that the country will observe August 31, the day US soldier departed from the country as a National Holiday. 
As stated on the Taliban government’s website, the withdrawal of foreign troops will be celebrated annually on August 31. 
The inaugural festivities were organized last year, with the authorities and supporters of the Taliban marking the first anniversary of the withdrawal. Taliban fighters held a rally on Massoud Square in Kabul, located outside the former US embassy.
On August 31, 2021, just before the withdrawal deadline expired, the final American soldier, US Army Major General Chris Donahue, boarded a military transport plane. This marked the conclusion of a challenging 20-year military campaign that incurred significant costs and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives.

RT: IEA warns of possible oil shortage

 
Global demand will rise by 6% between 2022 and 2028, according to the energy watchdog  
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has raised its outlook for world oil demand to a record high of 102.3 million barrels a day this year, saying it will be powered by faster-growing economies in the developing world. 
In its latest medium-term market report released this week, the IEA projects global oil demand to grow 6% between 2022 and 2028 to reach 105.7 million barrels per day (bpd), up 5.9 million bpd compared to 2022 levels. 
That growth will be supported by strong demand from the petrochemical and aviation sectors, it said.

New York Times/DNYUZ: U.S. National Debt Tops $32 Trillion for First Time 
The gross national debt exceeded $32 trillion for the first time on Friday, underscoring the country’s unsettling fiscal trajectory as Washington gears up for another fight over government spending. 
A Treasury Department report noted the milestone weeks after Congress agreed to suspend the nation’s statutory debt limit, ending a monthslong standoff. 
The $32 trillion mark arrived nine years sooner than prepandemic forecasts had projected, reflecting the trillions of dollars of emergency spending to address Covid-19’s impact along with a run of sluggish economic growth.

The Intercept:  Pentagon’s Secret Service Trawls Social Media for Mean Tweets About Generals

 
A document shows the Protective Services Battalion uses sophisticated surveillance tools that can pinpoint anyone’s location.  
When the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley enters into his scheduled retirement later this year, one of the perks will include a personal security detail to protect him from threats — including “embarrassment.” 
The U.S. Army Protective Services Battalion, the Pentagon’s little-known Secret Service equivalent, is tasked with safeguarding top military brass. The unit protects current as well as former high-ranking military officers from “assassination, kidnapping, injury or embarrassment,” according to Army records. 
Protective Services’s mandate has expanded to include monitoring social media for “direct, indirect, and veiled” threats and identifying “negative sentiment” regarding its wards, according to an Army procurement document dated September 1, 2022, and reviewed by The Intercept. The expansion of the Protective Services Battalion’s purview has not been previously reported.

The Telegraph: Prepare for Ukraine&#x27;s counter-offensive to falter 
Nato needs to brace itself for the prospect of Ukraine’s counteroffensive failing to achieve major success. Indeed, so far, Kyiv has attained only limited gains. But those who expected a lightning breakthrough were always going to be disappointed. This is not German panzers against Polish horse cavalry, nor is it American shock and awe against demoralised Iraqi forces in antiquated tanks with no air cover. 
Instead, we are seeing something closer to an attritional style of warfare, with attacking forces battering against heavily fortified defences. Current operations are at the stage of reconnaissance-in-force along four separate axes of advance, with Ukrainian units probing Russian positions to identify weak spots that can then be softened up with artillery and exploited by armoured reserve forces. Commandos and partisans are said to be working behind enemy lines to create confusion and disrupt command and control centres. Long range strikes are being used to hit headquarters.

Live Mint/Wall Street Journal: Kyiv Runs Into Russian Air Superiority 
Ukraine said its forces were advancing on several axes in their counteroffensive but were struggling to counter Russian air and artillery superiority hobbling its assaults in the east and south.

Now into its second week, Ukraine’s ambitious attempt to take back Russian-occupied land is proving to be a hard slog against dense minefields and well-prepared defenses. 
After Ukraine’s first probing attacks yielded mixed results, its forces have mostly paused their advances in recent days as commanders take stock of the past two weeks and analyze ways to punch through Russian lines without taking huge losses. 
Russia has taken advantage of its superior air power and Kyiv’s limited air defenses to strike Ukrainian armored columns and stop several attacks, destroying some of the sophisticated Western weaponry Ukraine is fielding.

WNU Editor: According to the sources that I trust there was heavy fighting along the entire front today. Apparently the Ukraine Army made the decision to throw everything into the assault, and while some gains were made, the consensus that I am reading is that the casualties that Ukraine experienced today makes it the bloodiest day for the Ukraine military since the start of the war. 
Apparently what worked against the Ukraine army in today&#x27;s assault was that the skies were clear, perfect conditions for Russian drones and attack helicopters to go into action. 
I hope all of these reports are false. And this is nothing but &quot;fog of war&quot;. But if this disaster did happen today, expect a lot of videos being posted by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the next day or two.</span>

                              <span>Washington Post: Blinken arrives in Beijing amid deep fissures in U.S.-China relations 
BEIJING — Antony Blinken became the first secretary of state to visit China in five years on Sunday as he arrived in the country for two days of high-stakes meetings aimed at stabilizing a relationship under historic stress. 
His hosts previewed the tense visit with multiple rebukes of the United States, accusing Washington of engaging in “irresponsible bullying” and living under the “illusion” it could deal with China from a “position of strength.” 
China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Blinken that he should “show respect” during a pre-trip phone call, and made clear his view that Washington alone was responsible for the abysmal state of relations.

                              <span>CNN: ISIS-linked rebel group attacks Ugandan school, killing dozens 
Kampala, Uganda CNN  — Armed rebels attacked a school in western Uganda, killing at least 41 people, mostly students, and abducting six others, Ugandan officials have said. 
Some were hacked to death with machetes while others died when their dormitories were set on fire, military spokesman Felix Kulayigye told CNN. 
About 20 members of the ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group attacked the Lhubirira secondary school late on Friday, according to Uganda’s military. 
The school is situated along Uganda’s border with Congo in the town of Kasese, and educates children between the ages of 13 and 18. Of the dead, 39 were students and two were from the local community, local officials said.

A high-ranking Space Force officer has spoken out slamming a slew of recent anti-LGBTQ state laws, saying they have a negative impact on military families and force readiness. 
Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt made the remarks in a fiery speech at the 12th Annual DoD LGBTQ+ Pride Event in Washington DC, saying that the laws sometimes forced her to choose &#x27;less qualified&#x27; candidates for postings in those states. 
&#x27;Since January of this year, more than 400 anti-LGBTQ+ laws have been introduced at the state level,&#x27; said Burt, the Space Force&#x27;s deputy chief of space operations.

Kyiv Independent: FT: US senators to propose bill to seize and transfer Russian assets to Ukraine 
U.S. senators with bipartisan backing are reportedly planning to propose a bill that would allow President Joe Biden to seize and transfer Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on June 15. 
Western countries have frozen around $300 billion of Russia&#x27;s Central Bank assets since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The bill&#x27;s proponents argue that since Russia bears the blame for the destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, it should also bear the financial costs of reparations. 
They also likely aim to alleviate the burden of Ukraine&#x27;s support from U.S. taxpayers and allies.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Saturday that the U.S. does not support a fast-tracked process for Ukraine to join NATO at the conclusion of the war. 
Ukraine would need to meet certain criteria for NATO membership, Biden said, raising concerns about corruption in the country. 
&quot;I think it will. I think it can, but it&#x27;s not automatic,&quot; Biden told reporters as he prepared to leave for Philadelphia. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants NATO member nations to commit to accepting Ukraine into the alliance when there is a resolution to the current conflict.

                              <span>Reuters: African leaders arrive for Ukraine talks with Russia&#x27;s Putin 
(Reuters) - African leaders hoping to mediate in the Ukraine conflict were welcomed to a government palace near St Petersburg on Saturday by Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said after meeting the leaders in Kyiv on Friday that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdrew its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. 
He added that he could not understand what could be gained from the delegation meeting Putin.
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Kyiv that the leaders had come &quot;to share the African perspective&quot; and saw talks with Russia as part of the mission. 
The leaders from Senegal, Egypt, Zambia, Uganda, Congo Republic and the Comoro islands as well as South Africa were meeting Putin at the government&#x27;s 18th-century Konstantinovsky Palace, on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.

WNU Editor: Sorry that the audio is out of sync in the above video, but it gives a good summary on what transpired. 
I have visited the Konstantinovsky Palace where these talks are being held. It is an incredibly beautiful place. Check out this aerial picture of the palace and the properties around it (link here). 
Update: When these African leaders met Ukraine President Zelensky the meeting was short, formal, and businesslike (link here). Check out the difference in body language when these same leaders met President Putin the next day (see tweet below).

RT:  ‘The world will be different’ when the Ukraine conflict ends – Lavrov to RT 
Russia will trust nobody else to guarantee its security once the goals of the special military operation have been achieved, the foreign minister said 
By the time the conflict in Ukraine is resolved, Kiev will have accepted the loss of its former territories, and Western-led globalization will be dead, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RT Arabic on Friday. 
Speaking on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Lavrov described the West’s proxy war with Russia as “a geopolitical conflict,” in which the US was attempting to eliminate a powerful competitor and “preserve its hegemonic position by all means.”

Putin warns interference would lead to &#x27;such consequences that you have never encountered in your history&#x27; 
Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s implied warning that he could launch nuclear weapons against any country that interferes with his military campaign in Ukraine raises questions about just how seriously the West should take such threats.

 Poland says racism was not a factor in its decision to refuse entry to South African presidential guards and media for more than 24 hours. 
The stand-off happened at Warsaw&#x27;s Chopin airport. The aircraft will now be held there until Sunday, an airport spokesman told the BBC. 
About 120 people were stuck on the plane, who were all on their way to a peace summit in Ukraine. 
Some of the passengers are now disembarking and going to a hotel. 
Poland&#x27;s actions have left President Cyril Ramaphosa, who travelled separately to Ukraine, without some of his security detail. 
This prompted a furious reaction from Mr Ramaphosa&#x27;s head of security, Maj Gen Wally Rhoode.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Helped by buoyant oil prices and a period of political calm at home and in the region, Iraq appears more stable than any time since the U.S.-led invasion, although the government&#x27;s bid to cement gains with a budget splurge may prove a shaky foundation.
In office since October, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has launched a programme to rebuild infrastructure and attract foreign investors, but analysts say the plans are at risk from an uncertain oil price outlook and face the challenge of maintaining delicate diplomacy in a volatile region.
&quot;We are positive in the short-term outlook but medium to longer-term there are major challenges,&quot; said one Western diplomat.

In Finland&#x27;s eastern Karelia region, home to boreal forests and wetlands, climate change is pushing local farmers into conflict with wildlife.
&quot;Many farmers in this region have completely lost faith in the fairness of society,&quot; Pekonen says.
Two decades ago, few Barnacle geese stopped in Finland to feed during their migration north across the Arctic, where they nest, from their wintering areas in the Netherlands, Germany and beyond.
But now they number hundreds of thousands in Finland.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Flags flew lowered in the Canadian province of Manitoba on Friday following a deadly crash between a bus carrying mostly elderly passengers and a truck, as investigators identified the injured and reviewed video footage from a camera mounted on the truck.
Fifteen people were killed and another 11 people were injured in the fiery collision on Thursday between a bus headed to a casino and a tractor-trailer truck at a highway junction near the town of Carberry, 170 km (105 miles) west of Winnipeg.
It was one of Canada&#x27;s worst recent road crashes.
Crash investigators determined from video footage of the wreck that the bus entered the roadway where the tractor-trailer rig had the right of way, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendent Rob Lasson to…</span>

BRASILIA (Reuters) -One of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s closest aides sought legal advice for a military intervention that would have prevented the handover of power following last October&#x27;s election, federal police said on Friday.
Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid was one of Bolsonaro&#x27;s personal assistants who stayed on as an aide after he stepped down. He is under arrest over allegations that he faked Bolsonaro&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination card.
According to an analysis of Cid&#x27;s seized cell phone, a federal police report said he had &quot;gathered documents with the aim of obtaining &#x27;legal and judicial&#x27; support for the execution of a coup d&#x27;état.&quot;
Cid&#x27;s lawyer Bernardo Fenelon said in a statement that his client would only defend himself to investigators.

Monday&#x27;s announcement that the elder Soros will hand over control of his philanthropic empire to 37-year-old Alexander, who goes by the name of Alex, prompted an object lesson in the workings of media loyal to nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The 92-year-old Soros has become a bête noire of the international far right because of the activities of his Open Society Foundations (OSF).
In Hungary, the government accuses him of wanting to &quot;flood Europe&quot; with migrants because of the OSF&#x27;s support for refugee rights advocates.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court on Friday upheld an asylum-seeker pact between Canada and the United States.
Under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement, which came into effect in 2004, asylum seekers who cross the land border between the two countries are turned around and sent back on the grounds that they should apply for asylum in the first &quot;safe&quot; country they arrived in.
Built-in safety valves mean the agreement does not violate asylum seekers&#x27; right to life, liberty and security of the person, the Supreme Court ruled. But it sent the case back to federal court for a ruling on whether the agreement breaches asylum seekers&#x27; right to equal treatment under the law.
The two countries amended the agreement earlier this year, making it apply to the l…</span>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that a loss to Russia could ultimately force the U.S. to choose between the “collapse of NATO” or going to war. 
“If Ukraine would lose, if Russia would occupy Ukraine, Russia will continue going towards Baltic countries, Poland, etcetera,” Zelensky said in an interview with NBC News. 
“And they will start war with one of the NATO countries, and at this moment, the U.S. would have to choose the collapse of NATO or go to war.”

Warzone/The Drive: Israel’s Merkava Tank Has Possible Export Customer In Europe

 
Israel is negotiating sales of Merkavas with two countries, including one in Europe, prompting speculation about a possible deal for Ukraine.  
The Israeli government says that it is in very active talks with two countries about what could be the first confirmed international sales of variants of the country&#x27;s unique Merkava main battle tank. The identities of those nations have not been disclosed, but one of them is in Europe, which has already led to speculation that Merkavas may eventually be bound for Ukraine. 
Yair Kulas, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense&#x27;s International Defense Cooperation Directorate, also known by its Hebrew acronym SIBAT, disclosed the potential foreign Merkava sales in a recent interview with the Calcalist newspaper. SIBAT work includes negotiating the sale of weapon systems and other materiel from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inventory.

Rightwing members of the Swiss parliament boycotted an address by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that called for war materiel export restrictions to be eased. 
Members of the Swiss People’s Party were absent from the parliamentary chamber in protest against perceived interference of Swiss affairs. 
Zelensky has in the past urged Switzerland to beef up sanctions against Russian oligarchs and now wants Swiss-manufactured weapons to be sent to Ukraine.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Kissinger Sees War Over Taiwan Likely Unless US, China Back Down 
 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he believes military conflict between China and Taiwan is likely if tensions continue on their current course, though he still holds out for dialogue that will lead to deescalation — as he’s been urging. 
“On the current trajectory of relations, I think some military conflict is probable,” Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, when asked about the possibility that China would invade Taiwan. “But I also think the current trajectory of relations must be altered.” 
The remarks, delivered as Kissinger looked back on his life and career soon after his 100th birthday, were some of his most downbeat about the state of relations between China and the US, which has vowed to back Taiwan in the event China attacks. Kissinger said it was up to both Washington and Beijing to step back from their standoff, which he said was at “the top of a precipice.”

BBC: Valery Zaluzhny, the man behind Ukraine&#x27;s counter-offensive 
Ukraine&#x27;s long-awaited attempt to take back the territories in the east and south of the country, occupied by Russia for the past 18 months, is now in full swing. 
A key figure in planning and executing this operation is Gen Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#x27;s 49-year-old commander-in-chief. 
Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Gen Zaluzhny, or &quot;our Valera&quot; as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021. 
Those who know him well say the appointment, pushed through personally by President Zelensky, ca…</span>

MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have agreed that the Russian leader will visit Turkey &quot;soon&quot;, Interfax cited a Kremlin aide as saying on Friday. 
The visit would be Putin&#x27;s first to a NATO country since he ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has only rarely traveled outside Russia since the beginning of full-scale hostilities. 
 &quot;There is an invitation from the president of Turkey. Putin and Erdogan agreed that the visit will be in the near future, but we have not yet talked about a specific day, specific dates,&quot; Interfax cited Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov as saying.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.
