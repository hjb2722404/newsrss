                              <span>Energy politics in anyway is in breach of Norway’s international agreements and obligations, says State Secretary in Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy Amund Vik.  

Norway is reporting record profits as the Nordic nation increases exports of oil and gas to countries cut-off from Russian supplies.

Mr Vik said changing the demand is needed before taking action on supply. 

“You can’t just politically decide that the market is ready to turn off oil and gas,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

Mr Marles said the AUKUS alliance is “completely central” to Australia’s national security and relationship with the United States.

“So, this is a really important opportunity to make that clear,” he told Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen.

“AUKUS looms large in the agenda we’ve got with the United States and particularly the process that’s underway right now around narrowing down what submarine we actually do run with,” he said.</span>

Toy designer Mattel announced the design this week in honour of World Chimpanzee Day.

She is the only plaintiff to file a lawsuit against the Texans, but in a statement, Buzbee said the settlements affect “all women who have made or intend to make claims against the Houston Texans organization.” .

                              <span>Financial Post/Reuters: Ukraine default fears grow as Naftogaz asks for debt freeze 
LONDON — Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz has asked its international creditors to defer payments on its debt for two years, fanning expectations that the government may soon do the same. 
Naftogaz which has a $335 million bond maturing as well as two interest payments due on July 19, said Russia’s invasion had left it short of cash as many of its customers were now unable to pay their bills. 
In its request for the payment freeze, Naftogaz said the five-month old war had resulted in a “significant economic and business decline in Ukraine” and that the missed bill payments had “negatively affected its liquidity position.”

Biden, who came to office vowing to turn the world’s biggest oil exporter into a “pariah” over the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, said he decided to make the trip to advance US interests and try and curb soaring gasoline prices, which have hurt him politically ahead of mid-term elections. 
Biden heads to Saudi Arabia from Israel later on Friday, where he’ll meet with King Salman bin Abdulaziz and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the nation’s de-facto ruler. He will meet other leaders from the oil-exporting Persian Gulf on Saturday.

Newsweek: Ukraine Building &#x27;Army of Drones&#x27; Though Donations to Monitor Front Line  
Ukraine is building an &quot;Army of Drones&quot; to monitor the front lines of its ongoing war against Russia. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s global donation initiative United24 announced the &quot;Army of Drones&quot; project last week alongside the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the country&#x27;s Ministry of Digital Transformation. 
The project calls for international donors to provide funds that the Ukrainian military will use to purchase drones, as well as direct &quot;dronations&quot; of unmanned aerial vehicles.

The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act is $37 billion above the president&#x27;s request. 
The House approved sweeping defense policy legislation on Thursday that marks the second straight year Democrats and Republicans endorsed significant increases to President Joe Biden’s Pentagon spending plan. 
The $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act, approved in a 329-101 vote, is $37 billion more than the administration sought in military spending. 
On top of the budget, the bill also rebukes several of Biden’s national security plans. 
Members maintained a nuclear cruise missile the administration planned to scrap, hampered F-16 sales to Turkey and limited the number of aircraft and ships the Pentagon can retire.

Reuters: German firm calls for energy price cap to avoid social unrest 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Household energy costs could triple in Germany as Russian gas supplies dwindle, officials in the sector said, and one company representative raised the possibility of social unrest unless there was a cap on prices. 
In an interview with the RND newspaper group published on Thursday, Klaus Mueller, head of the Federal Network Agency regulator urged consumers to reduce consumption and set aside money. 
And in an interview with Reuters, the head of the municipal works of Chemnitz, one of the 900 city-owned public companies that are a major part of Germany&#x27;s energy landscape, went further.

Al Jazeera: Before Mali withdrawal, France prepares future Sahel strategy 
France is stationing more forces in Niger and Chad to fight ‘terrorist groups’ amid 2,400 troops exiting from Mali. 
French officials are heading to Niger to redefine the country’s strategy to fight armed groups in the Sahel as its troops complete a withdrawal from Mali and concerns mount over the growing threat to coastal West African states. 
Coups in Mali, Chad and Burkina Faso against pro-Parisian leaders have weakened France’s alliances in its former colonies. 
This has also emboldened armed groups who control large swathes of desert and scrubland and opened the door to greater Russian influence.

VOA: Mali Suspends Rotation of UN Forces  
Bamako, Mali — Mali&#x27;s military government has suspended the rotation of U.N. military and police forces following the renewal late last month of the mandate of the U.N. mission there. 
The government announced in a written statement that, for “national security” reasons, “all rotations of the military contingent and police contingent of MINUSMA” were suspended as of Thursday. 
The suspension comes after Mali arrested 49 soldiers from Ivory Coast on Sunday.

                              <span>The Independent: France to turn off lights as Macron warns of energy problems ahead 
President Emmanuel Macron has warned people in France to prepare for having public lights switched off at night and to get ready for a time of nationwide energy “sobriety”. 
In a grim warning for millions of ordinary French people, Mr Macron said because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions by Western states, energy and the prices of other goods had increased. 
With no end in sight for the Ukraine war, Mr Macron said, the French should brace themselves for costs to remain high. 
“This war will continue,” he said in a televised interview marking France’s national holiday, Bastille Day on Thursday. 
“The summer, early autumn will be very hard.”  “Russia is using energy, like it is using food, as a weapon of war,” Mr Macron said. 
“We should prepare ourselves for the scenario where we have to go without all Russian gas.” 
He said the government would prepare a “sobriety plan” to conserve energy, which would start with turning off public lights at night when they are not useful.

WNU Editor: French President Macron clearly believes that Russia is going to cut-off natural gas supplies soon. He also strongly believes that the Russia - Ukraine war is going to continue for a long time.

                              <span>Real Clear Politics: Republicans Are Favored to Win the Senate 
Recently there has been a spate of stories about Republicans’ difficulties in taking over the Senate. These analyses typically focus on candidates’ poor polling numbers in key states and the weakness of the Republican recruiting class. 
These aren’t absurd analyses; I’ve referred to the battle between the overall electoral environment and Republican candidate quality as “the irresistible force versus the immovable object” in previous columns. Had the Republican Party fielded its A-team in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, we probably would not be talking about Democrats even having a shot at retaining the Senate.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I agree with the above conclusions. There is going to be a lot of protest votes against President Biden, and a large number of soft-Democrat no-shows at the ballot box. 
There are not many vulnerable Democrats running for re-election this year, but all the Republicans need is a pick-up of one US Senate seat to gain control.   
Update: There is a definite shift in demographics on who supports the Republican and Democrat parties .... The Democratic electorate&#x27;s seismic shift (Axios).</span>

While it might almost seem like a question for a video game, U.S. Air Force planners are getting ready for a time when U.S. stealth fighters like the F-22 and F-35 could have to battle against China’s J-20 stealth fighter. Who would come out on top? An American veteran F-22 pilot took on a virtual representation of China’s Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter from the seat of a very real aircraft in flight back in 2020. The Chinese fighter was projected on the pilot’s augmented reality helmet-mounted display, giving a real pilot in a real aircraft the opportunity to train against a seemingly real foreign opponent. According to the two firms responsible for the test, this marks the first time such an engagement with a virtual adversary has ever been achieved.

Euronews: Estonian PM Kallas resigns to form new government 
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas resigned on Thursday in order to form a new government coalition in the Baltic country.  She will convene an extraordinary sitting of the parliament tomorrow to ask for a &quot;mandate for the new government coalition&quot; with the small conservative Fatherland &quot;Isamaa&quot; party and the opposition Social Democratic Party.  Kallas said in a statement that in order to form a new government, the current executive needed to resign. The three parties together will have a 55-seat majority in the 101-seat Riigikogu legislature.

Moscow Times: Russian Lawmakers Hold Snap Summer Session as War, Economic Issues Loom 
Russia’s lower house of parliament will gather for an “extraordinary” meeting Friday amid speculation that deputies could sign off on a major policy announcement or government reshuffle. 
The meeting comes as Russia faces mounting domestic and foreign policy problems, from the dragging war in Ukraine to the economic fallout of sanctions. 
But the suddenness of the decision to recall parliament less than a week after the State Duma’s spring session ended indicates that an urgent matter is at hand, analysts and lawmakers told The Moscow Times.

WNU Editor: There is a lot of speculation on Russian social media that in this emergency session the Duma (Russia&#x27;s parliament) will give President Putin the authority to call for a wartime mobilization. I am doubtful that this will be the case, but we are going to know the answer later today.</span>

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in a &quot;world war&quot; with the West as he continues his invasion of Ukraine, an ally said Wednesday.  In an interview with independent Serbian TV Channel Pink, Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic, who has yet to condemn Putin for invading Ukraine, accused the West of sparking a &quot;war&quot; against Russia through the Ukrainian people.   &quot;We should understand that amid the world war, all the talks that it’s a regional or a local war must be dropped. The entire Western world is fighting against Russia via Ukrainians. It is [a] global conflict,&quot; Vucic said, according to Russia’s state-run news agency TASS.

   Financial Times: Nato and EU sound alarm over risk of Ukraine weapons smuggling 
Countries call for greater tracking of arms to stop sales to Europe’s black market 
Nato and EU states are pushing for better tracking of weapons supplied to Ukraine in response to fears that criminal groups are smuggling them out of the country and on to Europe’s black market. 
Since Russia launched its war against Ukraine, western states have pledged more than $10bn in military support, from portable rocket launchers and armoured vehicles to rifles and vast amounts of ammunition. 
A number of Nato member states are discussing with Kyiv some form of tracking system or detailed inventory lists for weapons supplied to Ukraine, two western officials briefed on the talks told the Financial Times. 
 Ukraine’s government is setting up a more extensive weapons monitoring and tracing system with the help of western countries, a third person familiar with the situation said. 
“All these weapons land in southern Poland, get shipped to the border and then are just divided up into vehicles to cross: trucks, vans, sometimes private cars,” said one of the western officials. “And from that moment we go blank on their location and we have no idea where they go, where they are used or even if they stay in the country.”

The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine calls on all citizens of the United States to immediately leave the territory of Ukraine. This is caused by the cynical rocket fire of the Russian occupation forces of the cities of Ukraine. 
The corresponding statement is published on the official website of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. 
The Embassy notes that the security situation throughout Ukraine continues to be violent and unpredictable due to ongoing military attacks by Russia, with active fighting in country and uncertain safety conditions.

   Bloomberg: EU Set to Boost Ukraine Weapons Financing to 2.5 Billion Euros 
(Bloomberg) -- European Union member states are set to agree on 500 million euros ($500 million) more in military aid to Ukraine when the bloc’s foreign ministers meet Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. 
That would bring the total arms financing to 2.5 billion euros. The bloc in recent months has agreed to several rounds of arms financing for Ukraine under the so-called European Peace Facility, which reimburses governments for military deliveries to Ukraine.

Middle East Monitor: BRICS expects Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to join group soon  
The president of the BRICS International Forum expects Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to join the group &quot;very soon&quot;. In an interview with Russia&#x27;s Izvestia, Purnima Anand said that China, Russia and India discussed this issue during the 14th BRICS Summit, which was held online last month. 
&quot;All these countries have shown an interest in joining and are preparing to apply for membership. I think this is a good step, because expansion is always perceived positively; this will clearly increase the influence of BRICS in the world,&quot; explained Anand. &quot;I hope that the accession of countries to BRICS will happen very quickly, because now all representatives of the core of the association are interested in expanding the organisation, so it will be very soon.&quot; 
She stressed that the accession of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey may not take place at the same time.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: With Few Able and Fewer Willing, U.S. Military Can’t Find Recruits 
FOUNTAIN, Colo. — The local Army recruiting station was empty. The normally reliable recruiting grounds at the nearby Walmart were a bust. With the Army still thousands of soldiers short of its recruiting goal, the station commander, Sgt. First Class James Pulliam, dressed head to toe in camouflage, scanned a strip-mall parking lot for targets. 
He spotted a young woman getting out of a car, and put on his best salesman smile. 
“Hey, how’d you know I was going to be here today!” the sergeant said with an affable Carolina drawl, as if greeting an old friend. “I’m going to help put you in the Army!” 
These are tough times for military recruiting. Almost across the board, the armed forces are experiencing large shortfalls in enlistments this year — a deficit of thousands of entry-level troops that is on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War. It threatens to throw a wrench into the military’s machinery, leaving critical jobs unfilled and some platoons with too few people to function.

Daily Mail: Could SWITZERLAND end long-term neutrality and join NATO? Study shows unprecedented number of Swiss want to &#x27;move closer to the alliance&#x27; since Ukraine invasion 
* Majority of Swiss now favour closer relations with NATO, new poll has shown 
* Record numbers also want increase in defence spending &amp; &#x27;fully equipped&#x27; army 
* Comes after Russia&#x27;s attack on Ukraine cause radical rethink of Europe&#x27;s security 
* Finland and Sweden have already broken with neutrality to join NATO alliance 
A majority of Swiss people now favour &#x27;drawing closer&#x27; to NATO in one of the clearest signs yet of the seismic impact that Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has had on Europe. 
Switzerland has effectively been neutral for more than 500 years, but a new poll shows citizens increasingly believe that is not the best way to protect their country. 
Record-high numbers of Swiss now say the government should increase defence spending, maintain a fully-equipped army, and build tighter relations with NATO.

Cheers rumbled from the stands, and not just those along No 18, as fiercely as they did when Woods tipped his cap on the Swilcan Bridge minutes after 3 p.m.  He had rubbed his eyes on the promenade, had tilted his cap a little more, and then, finally, the spectators and even the seagulls fell silent.

                              <span>2022-07-15. As the media world changes rapidly, journalism schools find it difficult to keep up.

This case study is drawn from a collection of inspiring initiatives on ensuring media viability, written by Larry Kilman for UNESCO.

                              <span>US President Joe Biden is being mocked online after seemingly attempting to shake hands with nobody during his two-day trip to Israel.

President Biden received the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor at a ceremony in Jerusalem with Israel&#x27;s President Isaac Herzog on Thursday.

Unfortunately, at the end of the ceremony, it seemed President Biden was momentarily disorientated.

The incident was widely mocked by conservatives online, who claimed the incident demonstrated President Biden’s cognitive decline.</span>

                              <span>Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham says China’s “inaction” to condemn Russia&#x27;s aggression has provided a certain “tacit acknowledgement pathway” for Moscow. 

“It would have been far preferable for China to strongly condemn and join the rest of the world in strongly condemning Russia’s actions,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“The fact that China also does appear to have filled a void, created by some of the economic sanctions that much of the rest of the world have imposed upon Russia, by picking up demand for Russian wheat and the like has not only been a failure to participate in those sanctions but has been an undermining of elements of those sanctions.”</span>

                              <span>Former prime minister Scott Morrison has implored Indo-Pacific nations to stand their ground against an increasingly “autocratic” China. 

During an address to the Asian Leadership Conference in Seoul, South Korea, Mr Morrison said the world had failed to act as the superpower sought to take over disputed territories in the South China Sea.  

He has also accused China of spurring on Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.</span>

                              <span>Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood says China’s economy in the June quarter is expected to have fallen by two per cent amid recent lockdowns in the country.  

“The central government there is hoping and expecting that the economy will grow by four per cent for the year,” Mr Greenwood said. 

“But the real problem is now that China is struggling, the United States is struggling. 

“That leads really, if you like, to some of this conversation about having to really at some point down the track cut interest rates to support these economies that really right now look as though they’re teetering on the edge of recession.”</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden has signed a joint declaration with Israel’s Yair Lapid to never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.

The pledge comes during Mr Biden’s first visit to the Middle East as president.

“The United States and Israel reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our two countries,” the statement said.

“The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel’s capability to deter its enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination of threats.

“The United States stresses that integral to this pledge is the commitment never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that it is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome.”

The statement went on to reaffirm the US’ commitment to work with other partners to “confront” Iran’s aggression and “destabilising activates”.

“The United States and Israel affirm that they will continue to work together to combat all efforts to boycott or de-legitimise Israel, to deny its right to self-defence, or to unfairly single it out in any forum, including at the United Nations or the International Criminal Court,” the declaration said. 

President Biden also spoke about his trip as an opportunity to reassert America’s influence in the Middle East.</span>

VILNIUS — Lithuania will keep restrictions on Kaliningrad trade in place while it works out rules on how to resume the trade, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said on Thursday. 
The European Commission said on Wednesday that sanctioned Russian goods could transit through the bloc&#x27;s territory by rail to the enclave, after tensions between Moscow, Brussels and Lithuania escalated. 
&quot;Controls will need to be in place for certain sanctioned freight... Lithuania will have to set rules for the controls, and until that time the current procedures will remain in place&quot;, Simonyte told a press conference. 
She gave no timeline for creating the new rules.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do &quot;whatever is necessary to restore order&quot; after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. 
Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. 
But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go.  Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. 
Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem.

                              <span>Daily Mail: Italian Prime Minister QUITS after coalition government collapses but President REFUSES his resignation plunging country into political crisis 
* Draghi, who was appointed in 2021, won a confidence vote today in the Senate 
* However, the Prime Minister&#x27;s coalition government was thrown into crisis when the populist 5-Star Movement boycotted the vote 
* Draghi later met with President Sergio Mattarella to decide on the next steps 
* His resignation was then announced, and it will be up to the President to accept or reject Draghi&#x27;s resignation - which could lead to an election in September 
Italy&#x27;s President today refused Prime Minister Mario Draghi&#x27;s resignation, who announced he would quit after a party in his coalition government did not participate in a confidence vote - plu…</span>

* Covid death and case figures are starting to sharply rise once again as the BA.5 variant takes hold in the United States 
* America is averaging 649 deaths from the virus every day, a 97% increase over the past week that broke over a month of stagnant figures 
* Cases are creeping upwards as well, jumping 24% over the past week to 136,000 per day after weeks of sitting in the low 100,000s 
* On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci warned of an upcoming surge and recommended that Americans start masking-up in indoor public places 
Daily Covid infections and deaths are beginning to surge in the U.S. after over a month of little movement - signaling that a summer surge fueled by the BA.5 variant could now be under way. 
America is averaging 649 daily deaths from Covid, a 97 percent increase over the past week. It is the largest seven day increase in deaths since early December. 
Recorded infections have made a leap as well, to 136,903 per day. It is a 24 percent increase over seven days and the largest daily case average since February - when America was coming down off of the largest Covid surge of the pandemic.

MSF says corpses line only road into isolated area of Cite-Soleil, Haiti, which rival gangs have turned into a ‘battlefield’. 
Thousands of people are trapped without access to food, drinking water and medical care in an isolated part of the Haitian capital, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) has said, as clashes between rival gangs in Port-au-Prince’s Cite-Soleil neighbourhood escalate. 
In a statement, the humanitarian aid group said residents have been unable to leave an area in Cite-Soleil known as Brooklyn, while trucks that bring drinking water into the neighbourhood have been unable to enter.

                              <span>The Guardian/Reuters: Turkey announces deal with Ukraine, Russia and UN aimed at resuming grain exports  
UN hails ‘critical step forward’ after meetings in Istanbul as Turkey says deal will be signed next week 
Turkey has announced a deal with Ukraine, Russia and the UN aimed at resuming Ukrainian grain exports blocked by Russia, raising prospects for an end to a standoff that has exposed millions to the risk of starvation. 
Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said on Wednesday that the deal would be signed when the parties meet again next week and would include joint controls for checking grains in ports and Turkey ensuring the safety of Black Sea export routes for Ukrainian grain.

WNU Editor: The deal is suppose to be signed next week. A lot can happen between now and then. 
And as for solving the global food crisis. Even if Ukraine resumes grain exports via through the Black Sea the food crisis will continue. One of the biggest obstacles to alleviating the global food crisis are current Western sanctions on Belarus and Russian fertilizer exports. Sanctions that the West have said repeatedly will not be lifted.

Biden’s meeting with Israel’s Yair Lapid illuminated their countries’ twinned democratic crises — and their shared solutions.
 JERUSALEM — After President Joe Biden stepped off the plane at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid greeted him with a memory from eight years ago.
“You told me [then] that if you had my hair, you would be president of the United States,” Lapid recalled. “I said to you that, if I had your height, I would be Israel’s prime minister.”
During the tarmac welcoming ceremony, Lapid described Biden as “a great Zionist and one of the best friends Israel has ever known.” At a Thursday press conference, …</span>

As Biden visits Jerusalem, two states are more elusive than ever. 
 When President Joe Biden discusses Israel, he sounds like he is trapped in the 1990s, when the US had just begun shepherding negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians and two states for two peoples seemed within reach. “Greater peace. Greater stability. Greater connection,” Biden said upon arriving in Israel on Wednesday. “A two-state solution. That remains, in my view, the best way to ensure the future of equal measure of freedom, prosperity, and democracy for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”

Two weeks ago, Dr. Caitlin Bernard Told Shari Rudavsky and Rachel Fradette of The Indianapolis Star that a 10-year-old pregnant girl – referred by a doctor specializing in child abuse – was among a group of patients seeking abortions in states that banned the procedure following the 5- 4 of the Supreme Court in Dobbs vs. Jackson women’s health organizationwho actually knocked down Roe vs. Wade.

A neighborhood jerk we’ll call Payphone had Ray backed out for something way beyond my age.  It was 1984, when drugs were plentiful and Washington, D.C. had no drug task force, and fresh money meant urban opulence like Jettas with BBS rims, phones cinder-block size wearables and FILA tracksuits in soft fabric. 

Ray was a local boxer who did more training than actual boxing.  He wore gray tracksuits whenever he ran around the neighborhood.  He shadowboxed the air.  He jumped rope outside the corner store on First and Bryant, where I was the day I saw the gun.

                              <span>Former DFAT Australia China Council scholar Andrew Phelan says China is attempting a “divide and conquer” strategy as it increases its presence in the Pacific region. 

Mr Phelan said China is “not going away” as it signs a security agreement with the Solomon Islands and strengthens its relationship with Kiribati. 

“They’re going to have some success, and they’re going to have some failures, but it&#x27;s game on,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

Mr Marles was invited for high-level meetings at the Pentagon in Washington DC, as US and Australian officials continue work on the AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement. 

The Defence Minister is asking US officials for greater information sharing between the United States and Australia as the two countries work to counter the rise of China in the Indo-Pacific.</span>

“Which is the lowest it’s ever been since that metric was created back in 2006,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“You are now seeing what the biggest theoretical problem with inflation is – which is the erosion of purchasing power in the US, that is clear front and centre, the biggest take-away.”</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden made an &quot;embarrassing&quot; gaffe during his speech at an arrival ceremony in Israel today as he mistakenly said we must keep alive the &quot;honour of the Holocaust&quot;.

The president made the blunder just after landing outside Tel Aviv to kick start a three-day visit to Israel and the West Bank before travelling to Saudi Arabia.

The 79-year-old&#x27;s critics have been slamming the &quot;embarrassing&quot; moment.

&quot;Biden leaves crowd in stunned silence during official Israel visit after telling them to “keep alive the honor of the Holocaust” after his brain breaks,&quot; said Benny Johnson.

&quot;This administration can&#x27;t go a single day without embarrassing itself,&quot; the Daily Caller said.</span>

Financial Times: Allies sound alarm over plight of Ukraine’s public finances  
Budget crisis now acute because of falling revenues and hold-ups in financial support from Kyiv’s partners 
Ukraine’s international partners are sounding the alarm about the mounting pressure on Kyiv’s public finances as Russia’s invasion drives down tax revenue and its allies struggle to provide rapid financial support. 
The US Treasury warned that emergency measures such as money-printing being used by Kyiv to prop up its public finances risked damaging its ability to provide critical public services over time, underscoring the need for allies to meet commitmen…</span>

   DW: Gazprom will not guarantee functioning of Nord Stream pipeline 
The Russian energy giant said it did not know if a turbine engine would be returned from Canada. Moscow announced earlier that the pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, was shut down for repairs. 
Gazprom, Russia&#x27;s energy giant, said Wednesday that the functioning of Nord Stream could not be guaranteed even when a &quot;critical&quot; turbine for the pipeline returns from Canada where it is being repaired. 
In a statement, the Russian state energy company said, &quot;Gazprom does not have a single document to allow Siemens to take out of Canada the gas turbine engine currently being repaired there.&quot;

Bloomberg: Russia Earns More Despite Lower Oil Exports in June, IEA Says 
(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s oil exports rose back above $20 billion in June despite lower shipments abroad because of a rally in energy prices, according to the International Energy Agency. 
That was an increase by $700 million from a month earlier, even as Russia’s daily exports of crude-oil and products fell by 250,000 barrels to 7.4 million barrels, the lowest since August, the IEA estimated in its monthly report published on Wednesday. 
Benchmark Brent averaged more than $117 a barrel last month as the global oil market remained tight. High international prices helped to partially offset the discount for Urals crude, which deepened amid the European Union’s preparations to gradually phase out seaborne oil imports from Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Oil prices could jump about 40% to $140 a barrel if Russian crude doesn&#x27;t get hit with a proposed price cap, a senior US Treasury official said Tuesday, according to a Reuters report. 
On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks over the price cap proposal with Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki. 
Japanese officials have shown hesitance to adopt a price cap set too low, but have not yet rejected the idea.

WNU Editor: This US push to put a cap on Russian oil does not make sense. If Russia does not get the price that it wants for its oil, it will simply not produce it. And if that happens you do not get $140 per barrel oil, you will get $200 per barrel (or more).

Reuters: Hungary Orders Export Ban on Fuels, Curbs Utility Price Caps 
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x27;s government has ordered an export ban on fuels like gas and scrapped a years-long cap on utility prices for higher-usage households, a senior aide said on Wednesday. 
The measures, which also include a plan to boost domestic gas output to 2 billion cubic metres from 1.5 billion, will take effect from August to ensure the continued supply of energy in winter, Orban&#x27;s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said. 
Gas supplies to Europe have tightened and fuel costs have soared since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February and subsequent sanctions, leaving countries scrambling to refill storage and diversify supply channels.

A U.S. guided-missile destroyer passed near a South China Sea island chain claimed by China as part of a Freedom of Navigation operation and drew complaints from Beijing. 
USS Benfold (DDG-65) sailed near the Paracel Islands early Wednesday local time in a FONOP and was monitored by the People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate Xianning (500), according to the Chinese Ministry of Defense.

                              <span>&quot;This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,&quot; he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv&#x27;s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy&#x27;s predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an &quot;offended liver sausage&quot; when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine&#x27;s ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia&#x27;s attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of &quot;distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.&quot;
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. &quot;Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,&quot; Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations &quot;absurd.&quot;
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.</span>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms.

Tetsuya Yamagami, an unemployed 41-year-old, identified as the suspect on suspicion of murder on Friday after a man was seen in videos repeatedly shown on Japanese television calmly approaching Japan&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister from behind and firing.

                              <span>Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister is not just a portentous political event. His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.
Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…</span>

                              <span>Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the &quot;match of the century&quot;.
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess&#x27;s enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America&#x27;s greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

Huge crowds had surrounded the leader&#x27;s home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President&#x27;s Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.

From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham&#x27;s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God&#x27;s order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president&#x27;s offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president&#x27;s office said.

Officers raced to the more than 100-year-old Ruijin Hospital on Saturday morning after receiving calls about an attack, police said.

Japan&#x27;s longest serving modern leader was gunned down while making a campaign speech on Friday morning by a 41-year-old man, in a deed decried by the political establishment as an attack on democracy itself. &quot;I&#x27;m just shocked that this kind of thing happened in Nara,&quot; Natsumi Niwa, a 50-year-old housewife, said after offering f...</span>

Signalling that the Kremlin was in no mood for compromise, President Vladimir Putin said continued use of sanctions against Russia for the invasion it launched in February risked causing &quot;catastrophic&quot; energy price rises.

                              <span>Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s lawsuit blaming China for COVID-19 was dismissed Friday when a federal judge ruled his court has no jurisdiction over foreign governments.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in a 38-page ruling, wrote that a federal law setting rules for when a sovereign foreign entity could be sued in U.S. courts doesn’t allow any part of the lawsuit filed by Schmitt in April 2020 to continue.

“All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh wrote.

Schmitt’s office filed a notice of appeal immediately after Limbaugh made his ruling.

When Schmitt filed the lawsuit, he claimed China was responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to cause a global pandemic by covering up the initial infection…</span>

The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,&quot; Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…</span>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
&quot;Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world&quot;, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France&#x27;s condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called &quot;absolutely unforgivable&quot;.
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …</span>

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
&quot;We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this,&quot; he said.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia&#x27;s largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney&#x27;s west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia&#x27;s east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
&quot;The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,&quot; state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia&#x27;s most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
&quot;We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,&quot; Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia&#x27;s annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia&#x27;s east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum.
Shouts of &quot;When will you stop the war&quot; and &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop the war&quot; were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

                              <span>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com &quot;Love Actually,&quot; asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist&#x27;s ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 &quot;Morning @snb19692,&quot; tweeted Grant. &quot;Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?&quot;
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
&quot;Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being &#x27;lynched,&#x27; as they put it, by the January 6 Committee,&quot; reported Julia Davis. &quot;Appearing on Tuesday’s…</span>
