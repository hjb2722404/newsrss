                              <span>The UK government has revealed 80 prison officers did not attend their expected shift the day a terror suspect escaped.

Former soldier Daniel Abed escaped from a London prison strapped under a food delivery truck last Wednesday.

The government says despite the absent officers, overall staffing levels were still above the minimum requirement.

They maintain the numbers were not behind the security breach.

The absentee officers make up 40 per cent of the staff meant to be on shift.</span>

Two dams above Derna burst early Monday under the pressure from rain dropped by a storm. The pent-up water swept blocks of low-lying downtown Derna out to the Mediterranean Sea.

Images made about 400 miles above the earth’s surface show that the storm left a brown layer of mud and dirt across the city.

Bloomberg: Kim Jong Un Tours Russia Jet Plant as Kremlin Denies Arms Deals 
North Korean leader toured a Russian factory that makes fighter jets, as the US warned he is on a visit that could support the Kremlin’s assault on Ukraine. 
Kim arrived in the eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur on Friday to see a facility that makes high-tech fighter jets and other aircraft. 
He was shown planes including the Su-35 as well as the Su-57 stealth combat fighter, according to a Russian government Telegram channel. 
Kim’s limousine was later shown on social media being loaded onto the personal armored train that took him to Russia.

The sanctions are being enacted under China&#x27;s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular press briefing. 
&quot;We urge the U.S. side to effectively abide by the one-China principle... cease U.S.-Taiwan military liaison and stop arming Taiwan, or else it will be subject to a resolute and forceful retaliation by the Chinese side,&quot; she said.

Washington Post: U.S. cuts military aid to Egypt, sends money instead to Taiwan 
The Biden administration this week told Congress that it intends to withhold $85 million designated for U.S. security assistance to Egypt this year, and instead provide the bulk of the money to Taiwan. 
The decision brought immediate criticism from lawmakers that the reprogrammed amount either wasn’t enough to punish Egypt for ongoing detentions of political prisoners and other human rights abuses, or that it was a paltry offering to Taiwan given the urgency of China’s aggressive behavior.

CNBC: Air Force chief sounds off on Musk’s Ukraine decision, tensions with China and the future of war 
* Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said that last year Elon Musk’s SpaceX was making “unilateral decisions” about its Starlink service in Ukraine. 
* The Air Force chief said the growing importance of space has increased collaboration between the military and the private sector. 
* He said the Air Force, like many parts of the government and private sector, is looking for ways to use AI. 
U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall does not shy away from commenting on controversy — even as it relates to the world’s richest person and a key Department of Defense contractor. 
Kendall weighed in Tuesday after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk acknowledged withholding Starlink satellite service to Ukraine as it planned a surprise attack on Russian forces last year. 
The disclosure sparked criticism of Musk, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for a probe into SpaceX.
The Air Force works with the company on a variety of missions, such as national security launches, but did not play a role in the use of Starlink in Ukraine when Musk made the decision last September.

The Senate Armed Services Committee is looking into national security issues raised by ’s decision not to extend the private Starlink satellite network to aid a Ukrainian attack on Russian warships near the Crimean coast. 
Chairman Jack Reed said in a statement that the reports on the use of Starlink exposed “serious national-security liability issues and the committee is engaged on this issue.”

“The committee is aggressively probing this issue from every angle,” he said Thursday.

                              <span>Axios: Favorite Biden columnist: He &quot;should not run again in 2024&quot; 
President Biden, befitting his generation, loves newspapers and the classic columnists. David Ignatius, Tom Friedman and David Brooks top his list.

 
Driving the news: Ignatius, 73, a well-wired Washington Post foreign-affairs columnist who writes spy novels on the side, is out with a column (page A23 Wednesday) with the blunt headline: &quot;President Biden should not run again in 2024.&quot;

 
Why it matters: Biden, 80, still sees himself as a young go-getter. Here&#x27;s a respected voice he has known for 40+ years telling him that by plunging ahead, he &quot;risks undoing his greatest achievement — which was stopping Trump.&quot;

WNU Editor: When you are a Democrat President and you lose David Ignatius. Yup .... you are in trouble.
Update #3: The poll numbers are certainly troubling (see below).

Just 28% of Americans think Biden inspires confidence, down 24% from two years ago or 7% from five months ago.

Zero Hedge: Zelensky Issues Veiled Threat To Destabilize Europe If Weapons Flow Curtailed 
As predicted by a number of independent geopolitical commentators, including ourselves, the emerging official narrative on why Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive ended in failure will be to falsely claim the West didn&#x27;t provide &quot;enough&quot; weapons in a timely fashion. Despite the literally tens of billions of US taxpayer dollars sunk into Kiev&#x27;s war effort at record-breaking pace and scale, it will be the &quot;fault&quot; of the United States and its allies—or at least this will be solidified as the Ukrainian government&#x27;s perspective and narrative (and then will be parroted among Zelensky&#x27;s most diehard hawkish supporters).

Al Jazeera: China unveils ‘special’ measures to boost Taiwan’s access to coastal Fujian

 
Beijing has proposed transforming Fujian province into a zone for integrated development with Taiwan. 
China will take a number of “special” policy measures to improve access for Taiwanese enterprises to Fujian province across the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese state planner has announced, under a long-term cross-strait integrated development plan. 
China will deepen the integrated development of the Chinese city of Xiamen and Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands, including the acceleration of gas, electricity and transportation links between the two, said Cong Liang, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, on Thursday.

Taiwan&#x27;s Defense Ministry on Thursday said that it has detected 68 Chinese warplanes and 10 navy vessels around its shores in 24 hours. 
Earlier this week, Taiwan had cautioned that China was stepping up &quot;gray zone&quot; activities around the island.

Zero Hedge: Watch: White House Asked Why Biden Made Up 9/11 Ground Zero Narrative 
The White House press pool is beginning to ask the right questions, and we can expect that these obvious inconsistencies will continue to dog the Biden campaign into the 2024 election. 
First, on Wednesday the White House&#x27;s national security council spokesman John Kirby was at the podium and was appropriately grilled about why &quot;the president lied about being at Ground Zero the day after the 9/11 attacks&quot; among other falsehoods. &quot;What is going on with the president? Is he just believing things that didn&#x27;t happen did happen, or is he just randomly making stuff up?&quot;

WNU Editor: The smirk on John Kirby&#x27;s face when he is asked the question on President Biden&#x27;s false narratives tells me that he really does not care what the media or public are concerned about when it comes to the President&#x27;s lies. That in the end it will not make a difference. President Biden will still be re-elected in 2024.</span>

Vladimir Putin&#x27;s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jon Un shows Russia is planning to &quot;hunker down&quot; for a long war in Ukraine, a former MI6 spy has told LBC. 
Speaking after Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia ahead of a meeting with Mr Putin, the former head of MI6&#x27;s Russia desk told LBC&#x27;s Andrew Marr there is &quot;serious intent&quot; behind the meeting.
&quot;The Russians are now indicating they expect this war [in Ukraine] to go on for a long time and in fact, that may well be what lies behind their meeting with Kim Jong Un today,&quot; Christopher Steele told LBC.

                              <span>Prague Monitor: Czechia Will Not Deport Ukrainian Deserters to Kiev 
Ukraine’s attempt to extradite refugees who sought shelter in the Czech Republic to avoid conscription is expected to face significant hurdles through official channels. Such a request would likely contravene Czech law, making it impossible for Justice Minister Pavel Blažek (ODS) to approve it, as confirmed by the Justice Ministry to Echo24.
The Ukrainian military is currently launching a counter-offensive to regain territories occupied by Russian forces, requiring a substantial manpower. However, even amidst pervasive corruption, there remains a shortage of recruits. Some Ukrainian men have managed to evade military service by leaving the country with the assistance of bribes, potentially numbering in the tens of thousands.

                              <span>At least 56 people, including children, have died in an apartment building fire in Vietnam&#x27;s capital Hanoi.

Rescue efforts have been hampered due to the building not having emergency exits and being positioned at the end of a narrow alley.

At least 70 people were rescued and nearly 40 people were injured when they jumped onto neighbouring roofs to escape the inferno.

Firefighters extinguished the fire in about an hour, as footage shows the intense blaze shooting out from every floor of the building.

Vietnam&#x27;s Prime Minister visited the site to extend his condolences and police have detained the building&#x27;s owner ahead of further investigation.</span>

                              <span>Former ADF personnel could face up to 20 years behind bars if they work for foreign military bodies without approval.

New legislation is set to be introduced by Defence Minister Richard Marles which will prevent sensitive defence information from being accessed by foreign militaries.

It follows revelations Beijing was seeking to poach former Australian pilots to train its military last year.

The Chinese recruitment scheme reportedly extended to using third parties for headhunting Western military leaders.  

Those working within the Five Eyes countries, the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada, will be exempt from the tough new rules.</span>

Zero Hedge: Trans Spox Says Ukraine Will Hunt Down &quot;Russian Propagandists&quot; Around The World 
Sarah Ashton-Cirillo, the transgender ex-journalist from the US who is now a spokesperson for Ukraine&#x27;s Territorial Defense Forces, has issued yet another bizarre and unhinged statement on behalf of the Ukrainian military. 
The military spokesperson is vowing that Russia&#x27;s &quot;propagandists&quot; will be &quot;hunted down&quot; in a message which was published days ago, but which is now going viral and being mocked. 
Ashton-Cirillo said in the clip, &quot;Next week, the teeth of the Russian devils will gnash ever harder, and their rabid mouths will foam an uncontrollable frenzy as the world will see a favorite Kremlin propagandist pay for their crimes.&quot;

WNU Editor: It is bad enough that everyone who is still in Ukraine must keep their negative opinions on the Zelensky regime to themselves or they may face certain consequences. But Kyiv&#x27;s threats to now strike against those who voice a different opinion in another country is raising the conflict to another level. But what is even more disturbing is the &quot;sound of silence&quot; from Western governments and the Western media on these threats from the Zelensky government to attack citizens in another country.</span>

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: Russia Overcomes Sanctions to Expand Missile Production, Officials Say 
Russia has managed to overcome sanctions and export controls imposed by the West to expand its missile production beyond prewar levels, according to U.S., European and Ukrainian officials, leaving Ukraine especially vulnerable to intensified attacks in the coming months. 
In addition to spending more than $40 billion providing weapons for Ukraine, the United States has made curbing Russia’s military supply a key part of its strategy to support Kyiv. 
As a result of the sanctions, American officials estimate that Russia was forced to dramatically slow its production of missiles and other weaponry at the start of the war in February 2022 for at least six months. But by the end of 2022, Moscow’s military industrial manufacturing began to pick up speed again, American officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the sensitive assessment now concede.

WNU Editor: So much for the Western political and media narrative that we have been hearing constantly for the past year that Russia was going to run out of missiles. 
On a side note. 
The above New York Times post reveals something that should give everyone pause .... 
 .... it costs a Western country $5,000 to $6,000 to make a 155-millimeter artillery round, whereas it costs Russia about $600 to produce a comparable 152-millimeter artillery shell. 
 You cannot win a war if the economies of production favors your opponent.</span>

                              <span>Politico.eu: Shock and recriminations as Chinese spy scandal rocks UK parliament

 
Rishi Sunak under pressure to toughen stance on Beijing. 
 LONDON — Rishi Sunak has spent most of his brief premiership treading a delicate balance on relations with China. So the last thing the British prime minister needed as he enters a careful autumn of diplomacy was a Chinese spy scandal erupting in his midst. 
Westminster is this week reeling from the news that a British citizen working as a parliamentary researcher for MPs is under arrest on suspicion of spying for Beijing. 
Two men, one in his 20s and another in his 30s, were arrested under the Official Secrets Act in March, police confirmed, after the news was reported in the Sunday Times.

Defense News: Poland to buy 486 HIMARS launchers from Lockheed Martin 
WARSAW, Poland — Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak on Monday approved a framework deal to buy 486 launcher-loader module kits for its M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. 
“In line with the adopted schedule, deliveries are expected to begin in 2025,” the Armament Agency, which is the ministry’s unit responsible for purchases of weapons and military gear, said in a statement. 
The acquisition of the Lockheed Martin-made launchers is part of the Polish army’s Homar-A program. The nation’s defense industry will also be involved in the effort by supplying products and components, according to the agency.

Warzone/The Drive: B-21 Raider Seen Like Never Before In New Images

 
We have just been given our first side view of Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider stealth bomber, an aircraft that remains cloaked in secrecy.  
During Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown&#x27;s speech at this year&#x27;s Air &amp; Space Forces Association&#x27;s mega conference outside of Washington, D.C., the soon-to-be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs dropped two new images of the B-21 Raider. While the stealth bomber was rolled out in December of last year, it remains cloaked in secrecy. Brown, the top Air Force uniformed officer, didn&#x27;t specifically reference the images in his presentation. 
Up until today, only one angle of the full aircraft has been seen by the public — head-on — and in a very controlled environment at the bomber&#x27;s unveiling. Aside from a close-up of the cockpit area at an angle, all imagery published since then has been from the same head-on perspective, although it has progressively shown the aircraft in more detail. Now we have our first quartering view of the flying-wing jet, which provides significant details about its design. A new head-on image also gives us a better idea of the bomber&#x27;s actual size. Both images were taken at Northrop Grumman&#x27;s facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California.

Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are engaged in talks over North Korea&#x27;s space program and the political situation in Asia and Europe. The visit is Kim&#x27;s first with a world leader since Pyongyang shut down over COVID-19. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday for a day of talks that began at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia&#x27;s Far East.
The two leaders were at a remote Siberian rocket launch site, and began the day by inspecting a Soyuz-2 space facility.

Later, the two lavished one another with compliments during a state dinner.

Russia says Ukraine has launched 10 missiles and three unmanned boats in an attack on the home of its Black Sea fleet in Crimea. 
The attack caused a large fire at a Sevastopol shipyard which left 24 people injured, Russia said. 
Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhayev claimed most of the weapons were intercepted but that two ships had been damaged. 
Ukraine has strongly implied western-supplied cruise missiles were used.
Unmanned vessels, known by many different names including sea drones and drone boats, operate on or below the water. 
They usually have built-in explosives and cameras that feed directly back to the person controlling them.

                              <span>Slovakia&#x27;s Supreme Court has upheld a ruling dismissing a lawsuit by former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis against allegations of collaboration with the communist-era secret police. Babis had sued Slovakia&#x27;s Institute of the Nation&#x27;s Memory, which holds parts of his secret police files. The institute claims the files contain evidence that Babis was an agent, but he denies this.</span>

                              <span>At least 5,100 people have been killed in the eastern Libyan city of Derna due to massive flooding caused by Mediterranean storm Daniel. The flooding, which was the result of two dams collapsing, has left thousands missing and tens of thousands homeless. Aid workers have struggled to reach the city due to washed-out roads, making it challenging to provide assistance to those affected.</span>

The request aims to corroborate Cid&#x27;s statements regarding his involvement in various criminal probes, including falsified vaccination records and the sale of expensive jewels. Bolsonaro, who denies any wrongdoing, is facing mounting legal troubles after losing his re-election bid.</span>

                              <span>The second-ranking US diplomat met Niger&#x27;s military leaders on Monday to press to reverse a coup but reported no headway a day after an ultimatum from the West African bloc ECOWAS was ignored.
Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland&#x27;s trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The musician&#x27;s funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
