                              <span>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama can enforce a ban on the use of puberty blockers and hormones to treat transgender children. This is the second victory for such gender-affirming care restrictions in Republican-led states. The court vacated a judge&#x27;s temporary injunction against enforcing the law, leaving families of transgender children scrambling for care.</span>

The bright-orange buoys, authorized by Governor Greg Abbott, are intended to prevent migrants from entering the country. The Justice Department sued the state, arguing that the barrier could harm relations with Mexico and pose humanitarian and environmental risks. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday.</span>

It is well known that the Chinese Navy has numerical supremacy over the navies of other countries. However, a recently released report says that after five decades since it inducted its first nuclear-powered conventionally armed submarine (SSN), the People’s Liberation Army – Navy (PLA-N) is on the verge of producing “world-class” nuclear submarines with its propulsion, quieting, sensors and weapons capabilities approaching that of Russian Akula -I class SSN. 
Acoustic stealth is one of the salient attributes of modern submarines. The quietness of the design is seldom revealed, but the assumption can be safely made that Chinese submarines are increasingly becoming stealthier. 
The report released by the US Naval War College assesses that this giant leap in technology will have “profound implications” for US undersea security.

Business Insider: A potential first-of-its-kind fighter-jet purchase could be a sign Saudi Arabia isn&#x27;t happy with what it&#x27;s getting from the US 
* Saudi Arabia is reportedly considering a large number of French-made Dassault Rafale fighter jets. 
* Such a purchase would be a break from Saudi Arabia&#x27;s long history of buying US and British jets. 
* This suggests Riyadh doesn&#x27;t think its traditional partners will be as reliable in the future. 
Saudi Arabia has spent decades building an enormous air force composed exclusively of advanced US and British fighter jets. 
But Riyadh&#x27;s reported interest in potentially purchasing a large number of French jets may be a sign it doesn&#x27;t think its longtime patrons are as reliable as before. 
In December, France&#x27;s La Tribune financial newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported that Saudi Arabia was considering acquiring 100 to 200 Dassault Rafale fighters. The report came amid developments suggesting that the US and other nations might not provide military equipment to Riyadh in the future.

Report by Human Rights Watch details alleged attacks using explosive weapons and small arms on Saudi Arabia-Yemen border 
Saudi border guards have been accused of killing hundreds of Ethiopians using small arms and explosive weapons in a targeted campaign that rights advocates suggest may amount to a crime against humanity. 
The shocking claims are made in a detailed investigation by Human Rights Watch, which interviewed dozens of Ethiopian people who said they were attacked by border guards while they tried to cross into Saudi Arabia from Yemen.

SCMP: Beijing arrests Chinese ministry official it says is CIA spy recruit 
* Both cases announced this month involve allegations of Chinese students overseas recruited by American agency before returning to work for China 
*US embassy worker &#x27;established a close relationship with Hao through dinners, gifts, etc, and asked Hao to help write papers, promising to pay a fee&#x27; 
China&#x27;s top anti-espionage agency, the Ministry of State Security, announced on Monday it arrested an official it says is a spy for the CIA. 
It said a 39-year-old official surnamed Hao had been recruited by the US Central Intelligence Agency to become an American spy while studying in Japan. 
But it did not identify Hao&#x27;s sex or what ministry Hao worked for.

It is rare for China to publicly name other organisations or nations, but this is the second case of alleged espionage this month in which the ministry has directly pointed to the CIA.

DW: Nearly two-thirds of Germans want new government, poll says 
A survey shows nearly two-thirds of voters want to pull the plug on Germany&#x27;s ruling coalition. 
The poll comes immediately after figures that show most Germans are unhappy with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his government. 
As many as 64% of Germans who answered in the survey released on Saturday said a change of government would make the country a better place. 
The poll, for the mass-circulation newspaper Bild, comes the day after a separate survey found that most Germans were dissatisfied with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the coalition.

This makes logistics interdiction is an important, yet understudied, consideration. The good news for Western military planners is that whether the People’s Liberation Army launches a joint firepower strike campaign, a joint blockade campaign, or joint island landing campaign, its logistics capabilities would likely constitute a major weakness. This, at least, is the conclusion we drew from examining Chinese and Western military doctrine, studying similar historical campaigns, and conducting supply chain simulations. Joint Firepower

North Korea announced the launch in advance, prompting the Japanese government to deploy Aegis destroyers in advance. The Aegis destroyer is designed to detect and track ballistic missiles and intercept them if they appear to be threatening or landing on Japanese territory itself. When the Japanese government decided to acquire ballistic missile interceptor capability in 2003, the ballistic missile defense concept assumed that a launch would be reported in advance or that clear signs of a launch would be obtained, as in this case.

“The Chinese property developer Evergrande commenced bankruptcy proceedings in US courts at the end of last week,” Mr Piotrowski told Sky News Australia. 

“Chinese authorities at the weekend were very conspicuous with an announcement directing Chinese financial institutions to liberate credit effectively within the Chinese economy.

“A lot of disquiet around what is taking place – not only from a moderating growth perspective but in relation to what’s happening with the Chinese property sector.

“That is something that will be an ongoing watch as far, as the markets are concerned, in coming weeks.&quot;

(Reuters) - Ukrainians living in the northeastern Kupiansk district close to Russia&#x27;s border on Sunday found themselves torn between the will to stay and protect what they have built and the desire to flee from Russian artillery fire.
&quot;If you said the evacuation is going well,&quot; Dmytro Lozhenko, who runs a volunteer group that helps civilians flee the fighting, said on television, &quot;It would sound like a bit of sarcasm.&quot; 
Regional authorities announced a mandatory evacuation of civilians from near the Kupiansk front earlier this month due to daily Russian shelling.

 Russia&#x27;s defense ministry (MoD) has described a fresh Sunday major drone attack from Ukraine on four separate regions, as Kiev has continued to step up attacks on Russian territory even as its counteroffensive is a widely acknowledged failure. 
The MoD identified that attacks targeted Russia’s Kursk, Rostov and Belgorod regions, all of which border Ukraine, and which caused commercial flights be temporarily halted at the Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports.

The Barents Observer: Russia relocates Tu-22M3 bombers to Kola Peninsula after drone attack

 
During Saturday, at least six Tu-22M3 aircraft have been relocated from the Soltsy-2 air base in Novgorod region to the Olenya air base on the Kola Peninsula.  
The Olenya Air Base south of Murmansk is again seen as a safe location for bombers from airports hit by Ukrainian drones.

Soltsy-2 was in the early morning hit by a drone. Russia’s Defense Ministry confirms the attack and says one aircraft was damaged due to a fire, Interfax reports. 
A Ukrainian war blogger reports on Telegram about two Tu-22M3 being damaged.

Soltsy-2 air base is located some 650 kilometers north of Ukraine and is home to the 840th Heavy Bomber Regiment. Russia has frequently used Tu-22M3 bombers to launch attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine.

* North Korea tested its new Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile last month. 
* The new IBCM uses &quot;solid-fueled&quot; technology, elevating the threat posed by North Korea. 
* Experts say that Russia likely provided the technology to make it happen. 
North Korea&#x27;s intercontinental ballistic missile is its most threatening yet, and it likely has Russia to thank, experts say. 
The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based international affairs thinktank, said in a recent report that North Korea&#x27;s July 12 Hwasong-18 ICBM test launch was &quot;likely the result of technical cooperation sourced to Russia.&quot; 
North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un hosted Russian and Chinese officials in July, showing them its arsenal of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The North Korean Hwasong-18 ICBM was among them. It is a nuclear-capable missile that the country developed in defiance of the UN&#x27;s attempt to regulate North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program.

West Africa&#x27;s main regional bloc on Friday said it had agreed an undisclosed &quot;D-Day&quot; for a possible military intervention to restore democracy in Niger if diplomatic efforts fail, stressing that it would not hold endless dialogue with the defiant junta.  
The comments came at the end of a two-day meeting of West African army chiefs in Ghana&#x27;s capital Accra, where they have been hashing out the logistics and strategy for a possible use of force in Niger. 
The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has said such action would be a last resort.

&quot;We are ready to go anytime the order is given,&quot; Ecowas Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security Abdel-Fatau Musah said during the closing ceremony. 
&quot;The D-Day is also decided, which we are not going to disclose.&quot;

He said a peaceful resolution remained the bloc&#x27;s preferred option.

Roughly 1,100 U.S. troops are deployed to Niger. 
 The U.S. military is making plans to evacuate its drone bases in Niger, but no such order is imminent, said Air Force Gen. James Hecker, commander of US Air Forces Europe/Africa.
“We are doing a lot of prudent planning, but right now we’re not going anywhere, and we don’t plan to go anywhere until we’re told to go anywhere,” Hecker told reporters on Friday. “And right now, there’s not a need to go anywhere, so our civilian leadership is just saying, ‘Hey, hang tight, and continue planning in case something happens.’ And we’ll be ready if something happens, but hopefully this thing gets done politically, diplomatically with no bloodshed.”

Update: US readying plans to evacuate drone bases if necessary under Niger’s new junta, commander says (AP)

 
WNU Editor: I would be surprised if the U.S. abandons Niger right now. They have invested too much in Niger to just walk away. There is also enormous pressure on Washington from France and American allies in Africa to get more actively involved in reversing the coup in Niger. 
Bottom line.
A quick US departure right now would not only galvanize those who support the coup in Niger, but stop any plan by ECOWAS to intervene with military forces and reinstate the previous government.</span>

Washington Post: Ukraine running out of options to retake significant territory 
Ukraine appears to be running out of options in a counteroffensive that officials originally framed as Kyiv’s crucial operation to retake significant territory from occupying Russian forces this year. 
More than two months into the fight, the counteroffensive shows signs of stalling. Kyiv’s advances remain isolated to a handful of villages, Russian troops are pushing forward in the north and a plan to train Ukrainian pilots on U.S.-made F-16s is delayed. 
Ukraine’s inability to demonstrate decisive success on the battlefield is stoking fears that the conflict is becoming a stalemate and international support could erode. A new, classified U.S. i…</span>

                              <span>France 24: Guatemala votes in tense runoff, with fears of meddling

 
Guatemalans streamed to the polls Sunday in a presidential runoff marked by the harassment of a surprise frontrunner, who has fired up voters with his promises to end the rot of corruption. 
Voting stations opened at 7:00 am local (1300 GMT) as Guatemalans picked between reformist outsider Bernardo Arevalo and former first lady Sandra Torres, with recent polls showing Arevalo with a strong lead. 
Both candidates are social democrats, meaning Guatemala will have its first leftist leader in over a decade. 
The Central American nation is dogged by poverty, violence and graft, with thousands of its citizens heading abroad every year in search of a better life, many to the United States.

Ecuadorans head to the polls today in a presidential election tarnished by the murder of a top candidate, which cast a spotlight on the violence ravaging a once-peaceful nation caught up in the global drug trade. 
The eight presidential candidates have prioritised promises to crack down on organised crime, all while campaigning in bulletproof vests.

Voting started at 1pm Irish time and will continue until 11pm. 
The small South American country has in recent years become a playground for foreign drug mafia seeking to export cocaine, stirring up a brutal war between local gangs.

Farage&#x27;s complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.

The number is close to the total documented in 2022 and is close to three times more than what was recorded in 2021.

Ukraine has not taken direct responsibility for the string of attacks, including on the capital Moscow, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that &quot;war&quot; is coming to Russia.
Polls show the former stand-up comedian&#x27;s crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country&#x27;s most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.
Offering a rare glimpse at Ukraine&#x27;s homegrown explosive drones, Prytula recently shared images of himself with a fleet in an undisclosed location.

This year&#x27;s anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
&quot;Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory,&quot; Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …</span>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree &quot;a national disgrace&quot; after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.
Organisers had insisted the event would continue but on Monday the World Organization of the Scout Movement said Seoul had told …</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
