This comes after Apple revealed its new iPhone models in a ‘Far Out’ launch in the US.

“Whether or not an Australian travelling the outskirts of American society, where there’s no cell towers, as they call them, will get that emergency SOS, is yet to be seen,” Mr Long told Sky News Australia. 

“The fact is it’s an amazing feature that a standard phone, a standard smartphone, is able to in some way communicate with space … and make an emergency call.”</span>

Defense One: US Trained Ukrainian Missileers Who Sunk Russian Warship, Pentagon Official Says 
Bill LaPlante also praised the quick “innovation” that delivered truck-mounted Harpoon missiles to Ukraine. 
Ukrainian forces who sank a Russian warship with Harpoon missiles in June were trained by the United States, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said. 
That key detail of the strike and a few others were disclosed Wednesday by Bill LaPlante, defense undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, during a conference panel hosted by Defense News near the Pentagon. 
LaPlante said the U.S. “brought the Ukrainians to train on [the Harpoon] over Memorial Day weekend, in our country, over Memorial Day weekend.”

                              <span>Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - A Second &#x27;Counteroffensive&#x27; Contrary To U.S. Advice - IAEA Report 
The Ukrainian &#x27;counteroffensive&#x27; in the southern Kherson region has made little progress and binds a lot of Ukrainian resources and available units. 
Despite that, and against advice from the U.S. military, Ukraine has now launched a second &#x27;counteroffensive&#x27; in the north-eastern Kharkiv region of Ukraine. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I am skeptical of the above report. The U.S. is the country that is supplying the most weapons, actionable intelligence, and funds to Ukraine. Not the U.K. or anyone else. I am sure the U.S. has a lot of strings to this aid, and taking their advice and recommendations is one of them. 
So is the Pentagon against this second counter-offensive? Maybe. But in this case my gut is telling me that it is the US State Department and the White House that is pushing this new front, and they outrank the Pentagon.</span>

    WNU Editor: The supporters of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and their uni-polar approach to the world will disagree. 
As to what is my take. The US and the West will continue to dominate progress in technology and productivity, the trend supports Putin, and I can easily Asia start to dominate in the 2030s and beyond.</span>

Space News: NASA and China are eyeing the same landing sites near the lunar south pole 
HELSINKI — China and the United States have identified overlapping potential landing sites at the south pole of the moon as both countries ramp up their lunar exploration ambitions. 
The partially intersecting plans for lunar landings highlight the new interest in particular lunar resources and pose questions as to how competing countries implement and coordinate their respective moon exploration plans. 
NASA earlier this month announced the selection of 13 potential locations for the Artemis 3 crewed mission which is currently scheduled to launch in late 2025.

                              <span>The Intercept: As Taiwan Tensions Build, Concerned Okinawans Push for U.S. Military Base Closure 

Bill Clinton promised to close the base in 1996. But plans for more construction and a heightened focus on the Pacific put the islands and their unique biodiversity at risk indefinitely. 
One April afternoon in Tokyo, the U.S. president made a welcome promise to reduce his military’s presence in Okinawa. Three U.S. service members had raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl the previous September, and enraged locals had spent months protesting the Japanese prefecture’s dense network of U.S. bases. 
“When the Prime Minister asked us to consider the concerns of the people of Okinawa and I became acquainted with them, as a result of some of the unfortunate incidents that you know well about,” said President Bill Clinton, standing side by side with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in the April 1996 speech, “it bothered me that these matters had not been resolved before now, before this time.” His administration agreed to close the Futenma Air Station, a major Marine Corps base in the populous Okinawan city of Ginowan, within five to seven years.

A majority of Americans, 56.8% think Biden&#x27;s declaration of war on Trump voters was a &quot;dangerous escalation in rhetoric&quot; which was &quot;designed to incite conflict amongst Americans,&quot; according to a new poll by the Trafalgar group. 
Perhaps even more telling is that 71% of Democrats said Biden&#x27;s speech - in which he said &quot;MAGA forces&quot; pose a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to Democracy - thought it was simply &quot;acceptable campaign messaging that is to be expected in an election year.&quot;

Recruitment numbers for the Army are at historic lows as Americans are either too fat or criminal to join the defend the country, an Army general warned. 
 Lt. Gen Xavier Brunson, the commander of Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, theorized as to why recruitment is so low following a July statement from the Army that announced it wouldn&#x27;t meet its 485,000 recruitment goal for 2022, falling short by a staggering 20,000 recruits. 
Officers across the country are failing to meet recruitment numbers as fewer youth are qualified to serve, which some blame on the COVID-19 pandemic.

Daniel Davis, 19FortyFive: What Is America’s Goal for the Ukraine War? Answer: We Don’t Have One 
Does America Have a Goal or Strategy for Ukraine? On Friday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced the G7 had agreed to impose a price cap regime on Russian oil. As with most other actions by the U.S. and Europe related to Russia’s unjust war against Ukraine, the announcement of the cap was big on rhetorical flourish, but thread-bare on any evidence of a coherent strategic objective. 
The intent of the cap is to set a global price just above Russia’s marginal cost so that Moscow won’t make a profit on the sale of oil but high enough that Russia won’t stop producing altogether. Current global demand can’t be met without the nearly nine million barrels of oil per day provided by Russia, and if Putin were to stop producing suddenly, the resulting supply shock could send the price of oil into the stratosphere.

The U.S. military will test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on September 7, the Pentagon says, adding that Russia has been notified. 
A Pentagon spokesman described the test as routine and said it was meant to demonstrate the readiness of the U.S. military&#x27;s nuclear forces and &quot;provide confidence in the security and effectiveness of the nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrent.&quot; 
It will be the second test launch of the country&#x27;s nuclear defenses in less than a month. The last occurred on August 16 and tested a Minuteman III ICBM that carried a test reentry vehicle, which in a strategic conflict could be armed with a nuclear warhead. The vehicle traveled about 6,760 kilometers to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific.

(Bloomberg) -- Xi Jinping will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in-person for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Tass reported, as the two authoritarian leaders push back against rising geopolitical pressure from the US. 
Xi will sit down with Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit that runs from Sept. 15-16 in Uzbekistan, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrey Denisov said Wednesday, according to the state-run news agency. 
“We are planning a serious, full-fledged meeting of our leaders with a detailed agenda, which we are now, in fact, working on with our Chinese partners,” Denisov told reporters, according to the report.  Xi is also expected to travel to neighboring Kazakhstan on Sept. 14 for a state visit. Beijing has not confirmed either trip.

Independent.ie: Utilities in Europe face €1.5trn rush for funds after Vladimir Putin shuts Nord Stream pipeline to Germany 
Gas prices have soared to five times their level a year ago in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  European energy companies need at least €1.5 trillion to cover the cost of their exposure to soaring gas prices, Norwegian energy giant Equinor has estimated, and that does not include firms in the UK. 
Several countries are providing billions of euros in support to power suppliers caught out by extra collateral payments on their trades - known as margin calls, but Equinor’s estimate suggests such support is a fraction of the overall bill.

Business Insider: Putin says Russia will restart Nord Stream 1 gas flows &#x27;tomorrow&#x27; if it gets turbines, and blames sanctions for the shutdown 
* President Vladimir Putin said Russia could restart gas flows to Europe via Nord Stream 1 &#x27;tomorrow&#x27;, if it gets turbines. 
* Russia indefinitely halted flows through the pipeline last week, intensifying Europe&#x27;s energy crisis. 
* He blamed Germany and Western sanctions for the indefinite halt in operations for the pipeline. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Gazprom could restart gas flows to Europe via the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline tomorrow, if it gets the turbines needed. 
He blamed Germany and Western sanctions for the indefinite halt in operations for the pipeline, according to media reports from his speech at the Eastern Economic Forum. 
At the same time, he said pressure from the US was behind the holdup in launching another pipeline, Nord Stream 2.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the United States had fomented Europe&#x27;s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the &quot;suicidal&quot; step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. 
Europe is facing its worst gas supply crisis ever, with energy prices soaring and German importers even discussing possible rationing in the European Union&#x27;s biggest economy after Russia reduced gas flows westwards. 
When asked what needed to happen for Nord Stream 1 to begin pumping again, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters: &quot;Listen, you are asking me questions that even children know the answer to: those who started this need to finish this.&quot;

European households should brace for an expensive winter owing to the continent’s deepening energy crisis that will likely send electricity and heating bills soaring. 
Energy affordability in Europe is reaching a “tipping point” that could peak next year, with total spending on bills across the continent growing by 2 trillion euros ($2 trillion), a Goldman Sachs research team, led by Alberto Gandolfi and Mafalda Pombeiro, said in a note published Sunday.

Bitcoin price is down for the year, but it’s also important to compare its price action with other assets.  Oil prices are currently down 23.5% since July, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is down 36.4% in 30 days and Moderna (MRNA), a pharmaceutical and biotech company, is down 30.4 % over the same period.

Risky assets have come under selling pressure in recent days as investors fear the Federal Reserve will continue its aggressive tightening policy. 
FedWatch CME Tool shows that the probability of a 75 basis point rate hike at the September meeting has risen to 80% from 69% a week ago.  This prolonged the rise of the US dollar index (DXY), which closed above 110 on September 6. 
US stock markets and cryptocurrency markets attempt a relief rally on September 7, but the recovery is only expected to continue after the DXY shows signs of bottoming out.

It’s not easy to persuade this column to watch tennis, but the task becomes easier when the US Open features classic American history.  As I write, Frances Tiafoe of the United States is about to start her quarter-final match against Russia’s Andrey Rublev.  Whatever the turn of the day, Mr. Tiafoe provided a refreshing example of courage in a country still teeming with opportunity. 

Watching the US Open can be particularly difficult because, no matter what religion one reads the New York Post’s …</span>

In recent Gazette coverage of the annual Town/Robe Breakfast, the Chancellor was quoted, comparing UMass Amherst to other college towns, in terms of the number of students each school provides housing for, for show that UMass has a large percentage of students on campus, and therefore they are not responsible for the imbalances this causes in Amherst, with outside investors buying several houses, which then prevents families from moving here.
Amherst has a population of 40,000, more than half of whom are students.  That means we’re a city of 20,000 year-round residents.
And half of the homes in Amherst are rentals, most of which are student rentals, many of which are overcrowded, overpriced and poorly maintained.  I recently received another call from a telemarketer, hoping to persuade me to sell my house to a certain investment company.
Chancellor compared Amherst to the college towns of Bloomington, Indiana (population 84,691), College Station, Texas (population 115,802) and St Paul/Minneapolis (population 730,413).
    This is clearly a false equivalence.  We are the second smallest city in the nation to house a flagship state university.  That’s great for the city in many ways, but there are other repercussions that UMass shouldn’t sweep under the rug.
I urge the leaders of city and university government to have the robust and urgent conversations needed to resolve the issue fairly and effectively.  It’s one of those “if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem” thing.

A medieval-inspired luxury home in New York’s Tony Hamptons – one that looks like it’s straight out of the HBO animated series”Dragon House— caught the attention of deep-pocketed show fans wanting to make it their own, according to Jam Press.
The outlet notes that they believe they have made offers to buy it, but the owner won’t budge.
That owner is Sir Ivan Wilzig – the music producer, reality TV star, banking heir and philanthropist – who moved into “the Castle” in 1997. (Wilzig and his brother, Alan, created the broadcast after buying 5 acres of land from Water Mill for less than $1 million in 1995.)

Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan hit out at businesses, but last week

      backfired on a abusive lawsuit challenging the agency’s enforcement power.  This one could be fun and legally significant.
Ms Khan said last year she wanted to use her power to shape “the distribution of power” in the economy, and she appears to mean by any means necessary.  The FTC lawsuit against Walmart in June is a good example.

The FTC says Walmart aided and abetted scammers who defrauded its customers.  It’s a heavy charge, but the agency’s evidence is paper thin.  The FTC shows no wrongdoing on Walmart’s part.  Rather, he argues that the company turned a blind eye by dealing with money transfers at the …</span>

This summer has already produced record-high temperatures across the United States that have caused hundreds of heat-related deaths, and the forecast for next week suggests there will be few places to find relief.
The hot weather recently blanketing the Montana area — Billings has already had 12 days above 95 degrees this month — will head east throughout the Northern and Central Plains over the next few days, the National Weather Service said.

“And the question I suppose that’s being asked is was Donald Trump partially responsible for that, and has he decided to sort of dial things back as we go on to the midterms so that if Republicans don’t do well, he doesn’t get blamed.”</span>

                              <span>Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says there’s a “method to the madness” in US President Joe Biden’s decision to go to Pennsylvania. 

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come after Mr Biden made a speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which took aim at MAGA Republicans. 
 
“The kind of speech that ... President Biden gave last week is designed specifically to get the really hardcore left-wing Liberal voters out,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“In that sense, I think it was probably a smart idea politically. 

“From a national standpoint, it’s just making things a lot worse here.”</span>

                              <span>Europe&#x27;s energy crisis is &quot;at the sharp end&quot; due to Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s &quot;egregious actions” against Ukraine, says High Commissioner of the UK to Australia Victoria Treadell.

“That has caused this problem,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“That has disrupted supply chains, but also because we need to diversify away from such dependencies.” 

Ms Treadell said the energy crisis is a top priority for newly sworn-in UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, and in the next day or so, she&#x27;ll outline how her government plan to address an issue every family in the UK is facing.</span>

                              <span>Students in the Uvalde school district in Texas are returning to school three months after a deadly shooting. 

More than 20 people died when a gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary, leaving the local community in shock. 

Some students have opted for online learning since the attack, while others have left the school district completely.  

Despite heightened security, safety precautions and months of preparation, families of the victims worry about sending their other children back to school.</span>

                              <span>Volunteers from multiple countries were elated to find a missing manatee after it was released from a rehabilitation facility on 6 July.

Tico&#x27;s carers grew worried as he ventured into deep waters following the successful release.

In late August, a signal was transmitted to the Aquasis team, who located Tico off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. 

Tico is believed to have travelled a total of 4,000 kilometres since his deep sea voyage.</span>

                              <span>IN THE PRESS – Tuesday, September 6: We look at the front pages of the UK&#x27;s main newspapers as Liz Truss takes over from Boris Johnson as British prime minister. Many of the Conservative-supporting papers focus on Truss&#x27;s message that she will &quot;deliver&quot; as the country reels from a series of crises. One tabloid, the Daily Star, calls this the &quot;end of an error&quot;, referring to Johnson&#x27;s hapless hold on power. Another tabloid, the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror, dismisses Truss&#x27;s leadership victory as just the &quot;same old Tories&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Exclusive-EU, U.S. step up Russian aluminium, nickel imports since Ukraine war 
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and United States have ramped up buying key industrial metals from Russia, data showed, despite logistical problems spurred by the war in Ukraine and tough talk about starving Moscow of foreign exchange revenue. 
The metal shipments highlight the West&#x27;s difficulty in pressuring Russia&#x27;s economy, which has performed better than expected and seen its rouble currency surge as buoyant oil revenue has helped offset the impact of sanctions. 
EU and U.S. imports of Russia&#x27;s main base metal products aluminium and nickel during March-June increased by as much as 70%, official trade data compiled by Reuters from the United Nations Comtrade database show. 
The total value of EU and U.S. imports of the two metals from March to June were $1.98 billion, the data showed. 
The West has imposed repeated waves of sanctions on a wide range of Russian products, people and institutions, but has largely spared the industrial metals sector.

WNU Editor: It is telling that these key industrial metals from Russia are being exempt from Western sanctions. But this massive push to buy Russia&#x27;s industrial metals tells me that some are stocking with the expectation that Russia&#x27;s industrial metals will eventually be sanctioned.</span>

Secretary general says agreement must be secured to commit Russian forces to withdraw and Ukrainian forces not to move in 
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. 
Guterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. 
The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles.

World is ‘in last minute of the 11th hour to save lives’, says aid chief, amid fears that crisis is worse than 2010 famine, when 250,000 died 
Two areas of Somalia are likely to enter a state of famine later this year as the country battles an unrelenting drought and flare-ups of conflict, the UN humanitarian chief has warned. 
Martin Griffiths said the latest UN food insecurity analysis had found “concrete indications” that famine would occur in the Baidoa and Burhakaba districts of south-central Somalia between October and December unless aid efforts were significantly stepped up.

 RFE: U.S. Says Russia Buying North Korean Artillery As Ukraine Weighs On Its Military  
A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment says Russia is acquiring millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea for its six-month-old invasion of Ukraine, in an indication of the effect that Western sanctions are having on the Russian war effort. 
The New York Times first published the findings of the intelligence assessment, but the newspaper said the specifics of the purchases, including their type and timing, were unclear. 
The paper quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying such purchases were expected to continue and perhaps expand beyond short-range rockets and ammunition.

KYIV (Reuters) -An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy&#x27;s chief of staff said he expected Kyiv to announce &quot;great news&quot; about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening, without giving further details.
Kharkiv region, in northeast Ukraine, is on the far end of the front line from the southern Kherson region, which Ukraine last week announced as the focus of a push to retake territory. 
&quot;Tonight there is going to be great news from President Zelenskiy on (the) counteroffensive operation in Kharkiv region,&quot; Serhiy Leshchenko said on Twitter.

                              <span>CNBC: German gas giant Uniper says the worst is still to come after Russia halts flows to Europe 
* “I have said this a number of times now over this year and I’m educating also policymakers. Look, the worst is still to come,” Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told CNBC on Tuesday at Gastech 2022 in Milan. 
* Russia’s state-owned energy giant, Gazprom, on Friday indefinitely halted gas flows to Europe via a major pipeline, stoking fears that parts of the Continent could be forced to ration energy through winter. 
* Uniper, as Germany’s biggest importer of gas, has been hit hard by vastly reduced flows via pipelines from Russia, which have sent prices soaring. 
German energy giant Uniper on Tuesday warned the worst is still to come as concerns over Russian gas supplies to Europe through fall and winter continue to push up prices. 
“I have said this a number of times now over this year and I’m educating also policymakers. Look, the worst is still to come,” Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble at Gastech 2022 in Milan. 
“What we see on the wholesale market is 20 times the price that we have seen two years ago — 20 times. That is why I think we need to have really an open discussion with everyone taking responsibility on how to fix that,” he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin was shown in an awkward encounter with his military chief of staff on Tuesday as he inspected war games in Russia&#x27;s Far East, thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine. 
The Zvezda military news service published video of Putin and chief of staff General Valery Gerasimov entering an observation booth, sitting down with a wide space between them and maintaining an uncomfortable silence while waiting for Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to arrive. 
Gerasimov stroked his hair and shuffled papers and Putin picked up and peered through a pair of binoculars, at one point acknowledging a comment from the general by nodding tersely. 
The awkward body language drew scrutiny from political and military analysts on social media.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will certainly pay a visit to Donbass, but the date for such a trip hasn’t been set yet, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. 
“As for the president&#x27;s trip [to the People’s Republics of Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR)], I have no doubts that when the right time comes such a visit will take place,” Peskov told the newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday. 
He also said that Moscow has “vast plans” in terms of rebuilding Donbass, which has ended up being the main battlefield in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Reuters: Solomon Islands says Australia, NZ exempt from navy ship moratorium 
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Navy vessels from Australia and New Zealand will be exempt from a temporary ban on foreign ships entering the ports of the Solomon Islands, the Pacific island nation&#x27;s prime minister told parliament on Monday. 
Foreign military vessels responding to a request for assistance from the Solomon Islands government would also be exempt, Prime Minister Manesseh Sogavare said. 
The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China in April, which a leaked draft said allows the Chinese navy to replenish in Honiara, prompting concern from the United States, Australia and New Zealand about China&#x27;s growing influence.

JNS: Iran’s regime sought tech for nuclear weapons, say Swedish and German intel reports 
An 80-page Swedish intelligence report reviewed by JNS claims Iran “conducts industrial espionage such as primarily aimed at Swedish high-tech industry and Swedish products that can be used in a nuclear weapons program.” 
The Islamic Republic of Iran’s efforts to secure illicit nuclear technology is detailed in an intelligence report recently released by Sweden’s Security Service. 
According to the Swedish Security Service Yearbook report released in March, which covers the year 2021, “Iran also conducts industrial espionage such as primarily aimed at Swedish high-tech industry and Swedish products that can be used in a nuclear weapons program.” 
It added, “Iranian intelligence officers act, among other things, under diplomatic cover in Sweden.”

RT:  NATO struggling to supply winter uniforms to Ukraine – Der Spiegel 
Kiev has reportedly asked the military bloc to urgently provide it with hundreds of thousands of uniforms and other equipment 
NATO members have been scraping the barrel in their efforts to supply Ukraine with sufficient winter uniforms and field camp equipment, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday. 
Kiev has apparently called on the bloc to urgently provide the necessary equipment before the cold weather sets in. 
According to Der Spiegel, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov wrote a letter to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg back in late July, calling on the military alliance to provide cold-proof field tents along with clothing for as many as 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers. 
The uniforms and equipment should be delivered as quickly as possible, the minister added, according to the magazine.

Reuters: Putin approves new foreign policy doctrine based on &#x27;Russian World&#x27; 
LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a &quot;Russian World&quot;, a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers. 
The 31-page &quot;humanitarian policy&quot;, published more than six months into the war in Ukraine, says Russia should &quot;protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World&quot;. 
While presented as a kind of soft power strategy, it enshrines in official policy ideas around Russian politics and religion that some hardliners have used to justify Moscow&#x27;s occupation of parts of Ukraine and support for breakaway pro-Russian entities in the east of the country.
&quot;The Russian Federation provides support to its compatriots living abroad in the fulfillment of their rights, to ensure the protection of their interests and the preservation of their Russian cultural identity,&quot; the policy said.

The only &#x27;successful&#x27; attack was across the Inhulet river near Andriivka in the direction of the dam and river crossing that closes off the Kakhovka Dnieper reservoir. 
The troops were cut off and mostly destroyed. On the western side of the salient a Russian unit crossed the Inhulet towards north and attacked the Ukrainians on that side. It soon had to pull back and the Ukrainians used the Russian crossing to reconnect with the cut off units in the salient. 
More Ukrainian reinforcements were pushed into the salient where they have little natural protection from Rus…</span>

                              <span>The investigations into former US president Donald Trump could mean he is facing “some grief” if he intends to announce another run for the presidency, Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen says.

“There’s over a dozen different investigations into his conduct in office, in leaving office,” she said. 

However, Mr Trump’s request to have a “special master” appointed to review documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate by the FBI has been approved by a US federal judge in Florida.

This has the potential to “hamper” the Department of Justice’s investigation into the former president, according to Ms Nielsen.</span>

TASS: Gazprom’s production not falling, but rising, Putin says  
The Russian leader pointed out that the replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential 
PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, September 5. /TASS/. Gazprom’s production is not falling, but it is even rising, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. 
&quot;Gazprom’s production is not falling, or you will scare everyone now, but [it is] only rising,&quot; he said at a meeting devoted to Kamchatka’s social and economic development after Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that as a program for Kamchatka’s gasification and field development was adopted 15 years ago Novatek started production, but the resource base was not confirmed, which caused a decline in production over the past years. The replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential, he added.

WNU Editor: Some differ with Putin&#x27;s Gazprom assessment .... Russian state-energy giant Gazprom saw its natural-gas production in July slump to its lowest level since 2008 (Insider). 
As to what is my take. 
Gazprom&#x27;s export of natural gas has declined this summer because of pipeline and turbine issues, and with Nord Stream 1 now shut down indefinitely, its production will fall even more. But I think this is temporary. There is now a push to export natural gas to energy hungry countries in Asia .... Gazprom discussing accelerated redirection of gas supplies eastward — Energy Minister (TASS). Ditto with oil production/exports .... Russia able to adapt to EU oil embargo — Energy Minister (TASS).</span>

The SUN: Welcome to sanction-hit Russia, where prices are DOWN as Brits suffer from soaring inflation 
WELCOME to sanctions-hit Russia – where heating bills and fuel prices are a fraction of those in Britain. 
Food costs are also coming down every month and Vladimir Putin’s people are partying as if there is no war. 
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Boris Johnson vowed that Western sanctions would “hobble the Russian economy”. 
In March, Liz Truss as Foreign Secretary announced 65 sanctions and fiercely declared: “Putin should be under no illusions. We are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up.” 
But six months on, while we are paying the price for the invasion with a crippling cost-of-living crisis, locals in Moscow are upbeat. 
It is not surprising. Despite claims they would face a severe food shortage, shoppers in Pyaterochka, Russia’s answer to Tesco, load their trolleys high with groceries half the price of ours.

RT: Ditching Russian gas no way to reach climate goals – Putin 
EU should have been better prepared for its green energy transition, the Russian president says 
The EU’s decision to slash natural gas imports while trying to reach climate goals was a mistake, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday during an environmental forum in Kamchatka in Russia’s Far East. 
“First, they (EU) jumped ahead, and then, after cutting off Russian gas supplies, returned everything that was reviled,” Putin stated. 
He emphasized that all nations are in favor of reducing emissions into the atmosphere, noting however that everything should be done in a timely manner. “And if you jump ahead, get cheap Russian gas, and then cut off the supply of this gas yourself and immediately switch back to everything that was previously condemned, including coal-fired generation, this, of course, is not the best option for solving global problems,” the Russian president said.

                              <span>Euractiv: Czech PM blames pro-Russian forces for mass demonstration against government 
Pro-Russian forces are to blame for the protest against the Czech government’s foreign and economic policy in which 70,000 people gathered, according to Czech conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala. 
The event was organised by radical political groups, including Communist Party and Freedom and the Direct Democracy Party. 
Organisers criticised the high energy prices and the pro-Western course of the current government. They also demanded short-term contracts for cheap gas and oil supplies or replacement of the management of the public TV and Radio broadcasters. 
The demonstration was called “Czechia First”. Some participants carried anti-EU or anti-NATO banners.
