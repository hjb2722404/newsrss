   CBS DFW: F-35 fighter jet pilot ejected after attempted landing at Fort Worth naval air base 
FORT WORTH, Texas (CBSDFW.COM) — A pilot was ejected during an attempted vertical landing at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth this morning. 
The aircraft, identified to CBS 11 as an F35 B Model used by the Marine Corps, was in the process of a vertical landing when the nose began to lean forward as the back wheels lifted up.  
The front of the plane fell into the pavement, and smoke began pouring out of the nose before the pilot was ejected. His parachute deployed and he landed apparently without injury.

* Russia shared the video following reports that the US will send a Patriot defense system to Ukraine. 
Russia&#x27;s defense ministry shared a video of a intercontinental ballistic missile being loaded into a launch silo, days after reports surfaced that the US is preparing to send an advanced Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. 
The Russian ministry shared the video on Telegram on Thursday, saying that it showed the loading of an &quot;intercontinental ballistic missile into silo launcher&quot; in Kozelsk, a town in western Russia. 
It claimed the missile was a &quot;Yars,&quot; which has a nuclear warhead. Russia previously fired a Yars missile in October, as part of a test conducted by the country&#x27;s nuclear forces.

Al Arabiya: Netanyahu: US needs to reaffirm support for allies, including Saudi Arabia 
The Israeli PM-designate said that part of the Democratic Party had moved “sharply” to the left, “in some cases, to a radical position and often against the wishes of a broad constituency in the public.” 
Incoming Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that he wants US President Joe Biden to reaffirm Washington’s commitment to its “traditional allies” in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. 
“And I view that alliance with the United States as particularly important,” Netanyahu told Al Arabiya English in an interview. 
Consecutive US administrations have voiced their “ironclad” commitment to the security of Israel, but cracks have appeared in recent years as divisions over Iran have led to increased US criticism of Israeli policies towards Palestinians.

Defense News: Congress is building a stronger fleet than the Navy 
Last Thursday, the House voted on a final National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2023 that secures the future of our naval fleet for another year.
Fortunately, Congress improved the Navy’s FY23 inadequate shipbuilding plan in critical ways: We rejected the Navy’s ship construction plans, their decommissioning schedules, force structure proposals and overarching threat assumptions. 
While the ink dries on the FY23 NDAA, it is prudent for the Pentagon and Congress to be clear on the final outcomes of this cycle. 
If the Navy refuses to learn lessons from this year, it will be doomed to repeat them.

Antonio Graceffo, Modern Diplomacy: Analysis of U.S. Ability to Counter the Russian Threat in the Arctic 
From the end of World War II until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States and Russia stood on opposing sides of a potential conflict. Through the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war, mutual destruction was avoided, and the spread of communism was held back. Eventually, economic pressure, partially caused by the arms race and partially deriving from the fallacy of communist economics, destroyed the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, it was replaced with the new Russia, which has similar expansionist goals. 
In Europe, the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war are once again being played out, in Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies, the EU and NATO, are supporting the defense of a sovereign nation which has been invaded by Russia. Meanwhile, Russia has other ambitions which could pose a threat to U.S. ambitions. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: According to the above analysis. Even though Russia borders much of the Arctic, and that they have put the time, resources,  and investment in developing their part of the Arctic for as long as anyone can remember, this should be considered by the US and its allies a threat. 
The conclusions of the above analysis also do not make sense. Its prediction that the Russian economy will collapse if their banks are kicked out of SWIFT have not happened. In fact the opposite has happened, and the Russian ruble is now more stronger than it was before the war.</span>

Russian Armed Forces have deployed its rare arctic version of the Tor surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine.  
The Russian Ministry of Defense’s Zvezda TV channel shared footage showing the Tor-M2DT air defense system.  The missile launcher has the letter “V” written on its side, which is the letter written on Russian military vehicles that invaded Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The Tor-M2DT air defense system has been active in the Ukraine conflict since the summer .... Russian TOR-M2 air defense missile system shows high efficiency against Ukrainian drones (Army Recognition). 
But why deploy even more of these systems when Ukraine does not really have an air force and only a limited number of drones? 
Is it because there is an expectation that NATO will directly enter into the Ukraine war? 
This deployment tells me that the answer is yes.</span>

First lady Jill Biden, despite being so worn out from a recent circuit of White House events that she lost her voice, is now seriously looking ahead to her husband running for reelection in 2024. That’s a tidal shift from her position just three months ago. 
Seven people familiar with Biden’s thinking told CNN that her private conversations about another run now match her publicly enthusiastic persona, as well as the sentiments of President Joe Biden. 
The first lady was still mostly skeptical as of early fall – “not a proponent,” as one person familiar with her thinking told CNN. But in the month since the November midterm elections, in which Democrats defied the fate of most parties of first-term presidents, friends noted a change. 
Jill Biden is now “all in” on the idea, according to a person who works with the East Wing.

The Hill: Putin to choose cyber warfare before nuclear weapons, former NSA chief says 
Retired Gen. Keith Alexander, the former National Security Agency director and head of U.S. Cyber Command, said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to continue using cyberattacks against Ukraine before using nuclear weapons. 
Alexander explained that although Russia hasn’t done significant damage so far on the cyber front, Putin is not prepared to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, as he knows doing so could pull the U.S. and other NATO countries into the war. 
“I think he will use [cyber] clearly before nuclear,” Alexander said.  “If he uses nuclear, he’s dead,” he said, adding that “if [Putin] uses the nuclear option, I believe that will cause NATO to rethink [whether] they’re in or out.”
 “I think [Putin] recognizes that, and I think the administration made that clear,” he continued.

On Wednesday, the 14th of December, NATO member states agreed to considerably increase the alliance’s shared budget due to the emerging security concerns and challenges in eastern Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The alliance’s civil budget for 2023 will be increased by 28% to EUR 370.8 million, whereas the military budget for 2023 is set at EUR 1.96 billion, which is 26% higher when compared with 2022, as announced by NATO. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed this decision, saying this is ‘a concrete expression of a higher level of ambition’ among member states.

A Russian commander suggested that using nuclear weapons may be the only way Russia can be victorious in its war against Ukraine. 
The remarks come more than nine months after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the Ukraine invasion in February, hoping for a quick win against his Eastern European neighbor. 
However, Ukraine&#x27;s spirited defense efforts, bolstered by Western humanitarian and military aid, have blunted Moscow&#x27;s military gains. Putin&#x27;s troops continue to struggle to achieve substantial goals. 
Throughout the tense conflict, concerns have emerged about whether Putin would order the use of nuclear weapons if he feels he has no other way to win the war or if the war grows into a greater conflict with the…</span>

Reuters: Some Russian soldiers in Ukraine unhappy with top brass, Girkin says 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Some Russian officers fighting in Ukraine are unhappy with the military top brass and President Vladimir Putin because of the poor execution of the war, an influential nationalist Russian blogger said after visiting the conflict zone.
Nearly 10 months since Putin ordered troops into Ukraine, there is no end in sight to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. 
In modern Russia, direct public criticism of Putin is rare though nationalist bloggers have been outspoken about the conduct of the war, especially the costly Russian defeats in Ukraine&#x27;s Kharkiv region in September.

The State Department cable surfaces amid growing calls for strict oversight of the money and weapons flowing to Ukraine. 
American officials are turning to everything from blockchain technology to Ukrainian soldiers for help as they struggle to track the billions of dollars in U.S. weapons and other aid flowing into Ukraine, according to a State Department cable obtained by POLITICO. 
The Biden administration also plans to tap a still-unnamed U.S. firm by February to implement a special three-year initiative to help the oversight effort, according to the “sensitive but unclassified” document. 
The Sept. 6 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv is blunt in describing the challenges facing U.S. officials trying to watch every penny as Russian drones and missiles bombard Ukrainian cities. There are, for instance, severe limits on the number of American officials in the field and a number of security constraints on their movements. It’s also hard to find contractors willing to work in high-risk regions or set up in-person meetings with government officials, civil society leaders and others receiving the aid, the document states.

Two U.S. lawmakers heading up an independent U.S. government human rights watchdog have introduced a resolution that calls on President Joe Biden to boot Russia from the United Nations Security Council, just days before the Kremlin’s flagging full-scale invasion of Ukraine is set to hit its 10-month mark.  
The bipartisan Helsinki Commission, which called on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to protest Russia’s standing as a permanent Security Council member in October, wants Congress to argue that Russia’s war has violated the “purposes and principles of the United Nations” and asks U.S. government agencies to take steps to limit Russia’s privileges at the U.N., though it gives the administration some free rein to determine how it might act.

                              <span>FRANCE 24 spoke to Lina Attalah, co-founder and editor of the independent Egyptian media outlet Mada Masr. In late August, the paper published a story about corruption within the ruling Nation&#x27;s Future Party, which backs President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. As a result, Attalah and three of her staffers were charged with criminal offences, including &quot;publishing false news&quot;, before being released on bail. In a country where press freedom is shrinking, independent Egyptian journalists &quot;feel really lonely&quot;, she said.</span>

Locals (who named him Logro) have developed various theories to explain his presence in the area. Some believe his mother died, while others think he&#x27;s one of their ancestors reincarnated. Our Observer believes that Logro spends time with people in the village because he lacks resources in his natural habitat due to deforestation and urbanisation.</span>

Some of the indigenous protesters, who had come from the Peruvian Amazon jungle, were carrying bows and arrows, which police said they confiscated.
They are among the thousands of protesters demanding not only Castillo&#x27;s release but also the resignation of his successor Dina Boluarte, the dissolution of Congress and new elections.
&quot;I came to take part in a protest march. My country is very ill ... we want to bring forward elections and close Congress, which does not represent us,&quot; Sanchez, 57, told AFP.

Ameera, a senior nurse in London, told AFP that &quot;we have not chosen industrial action lightly&quot;. The strike is the first in the Royal College of Nursing union&#x27;s 106-year history.
&quot;We&#x27;re tired. We&#x27;re fed up,&quot; added the nurse, who asked that her last name not be reported. &quot;We need a pay rise now to make a living.&quot;

Satire, parody and jokes packed with absurdity typically draw laughter, but around the world they are too often mistaken as real, prompting fact-checkers to debunk what they call a leading source of misinformation despite pushback from their publishers.
Several satirical outlets mimic legitimate media websites, often sowing confusion among readers with what appear to be typical news articles but are in fact fabricated stories.
Sometimes even with disclaimers clearly marking their articles as satire, many readers take them at face value.

(Reuters) -Tesla boss Elon Musk disclosed another $3.6 billion in stock sales on Wednesday, taking his total near $40 billion this year and frustrating investors as the company&#x27;s shares wallow at two-year lows.
A U.S securities filing showed he unloaded 22 million shares in the world&#x27;s most valuable carmaker over three days from Monday to Wednesday.
The sale is the second big chunk of stock he has cashed out since his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October. It isn&#x27;t clear if the sales are related to the Twitter acquisition, but they are annoying investors who are upset by a perception he is diverting his focus and resources to Twitter ahead of Tesla.
&quot;It doesn&#x27;t put a lot of confidence in the business, or speak volumes for where his attention is at,&quot;…</span>

                              <span>This week, the FBI arrested Alexey Brayman, a resident of Merrimack, New Hampshire who was using his Etsy craft store as a front to run a weapons-smuggling ring to the Kremlin.
Speaking to CNN&#x27;s Erin Burnett on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) emphasized that this operation is a sign of how dire a toll the global sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine is taking on their ability to procure weapons for their military.
&quot;So, congressman, I do want to ask you about ... this Russian smuggling, Russian weapons smuggling ring here in the United States,&quot; said Burnett. &quot;What does this tell you about Putin? I mean, why he would even be doing this, that he&#x27;s going to such lengths to do something like this?&quot;
&quot;First, I would say that this is not unusual,&quot; said Himes. &quot;For decades — for generations — we&#x27;ve been facing Chinese, Russian, other efforts to get our equipment. Your correspondent is exactly right that this is a sign of desperation, this is stuff that could ordinarily be bought on the open market by the Russian government. But it cannot be bought by the Russian government now that, of course, sanctions and prohibitions are in place.&quot;

Additionally, said Himes, &quot;the FBI is exactly right. Obviously a guy with a trunk full of rounds, that&#x27;s a guy who can assist in the creation of an awful lot of mayhem.&quot;
&quot;But at the end of the day, there is no way in the world that you can restock, rearm, and refurbish the Russian military by guys driving cars across the border of Estonia,&quot; added Himes. &quot;So, we need to continue to take this stuff really, really seriously. But it is a sign of desperation.&quot;

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -A former Twitter Inc manager convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia by sharing user data several years ago and potentially exposing users to persecution was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison on Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors said.
Ahmad Abouammo had been found guilty by a jury in August following a trial in federal court in San Francisco.
Prosecutors had sought a prison term of just over seven years, saying they wanted a &quot;sentence strong enough to deter others in the technology and social media industry from selling out the data of vulnerable users.&quot; Abouammo faced a maximum penalty of decades in prison.
Abouammo&#x27;s attorneys had asked U.S. District Judge Edward Chen for a probationary sentence at his home in Seattle with no prison time. They cited Abou…</span>

A committee led by the Justice Department comprising the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department has already recommended that the FCC deny the application, citing the counterintelligence threat posed by Cuba. If approved, the cable extension would link North Miami Beach and Cojimar, a coastal town ea...</span>

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Many of the hundreds of migrants who crossed the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez into El Paso this week were part of a group kidnapped in Mexico as they made their way to the United States, according to nine migrants interviewed by Reuters.
Testimony from the nine migrants suggests there were multiple kidnappings across several days in the northern state of Durango, with people taken to at least two main locations and held against their will while ransoms were demanded.
The kidnappings are a stark reminder of the dangers faced by migrants as they travel across Mexico, crisscrossing areas rife with drug violence and weak rule of law.
Most of the kidnapped migrants were Nicaraguans, who have been leavi…</span>

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru&#x27;s defense minister announced a nationwide state of emergency on Wednesday, which will take effect in the next few hours and allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public safety after a week of fiery protests and road blockades.
The protests were sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo on Dec. 7 in an impeachment vote. Castillo, a leftist elected in 2021, was arrested after illegally trying to dissolve the Andean nation&#x27;s Congress, the latest in a series of political crises the world&#x27;s second-largest copper producer has faced in recent years.
Prosecutors on Wednesday said they were seeking 18 months of pretrial detention for Castillo, who has been charged with rebellion and conspiracy. Peru&#x27;s Supreme Court met to consider the re…</span>

We are moving toward ending the intellectual orphan status of irregular warfare.
 


There are models for the newly established IWC.   For example and more specifically, in addition to the recommendations below the Army’s Operations Research Offices might serve as one model. Specifically, the Special Operations Research Office (SORO) at American University established in 1957 should be considered. This may be an appropriate model because SORO was focused on gaining a deep understanding of revolutions, resistance, and insurgency, phenomena which persist around the world today that we describe as irregular warfare. SORO provided direct intellectual support to strategy development and campaign execution.  The U.S. Army Special Operations Command has protected the previous work of SORO and in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory National Security Analysis Department has updated this work for the 21st Century in the Assessing Revolutionary and Insurgent Strategies (ARIS) Studies.  The newly established IWC could follow in the footsteps of SORO and partner with a premier academic institution.

* Belarus ordered snap &#x27;combat readiness&#x27; checks on its armed forces this week  
* Armoured vehicles since spotted with &#x27;war markings&#x27; to help drivers distinguish friend from foe in actual combat – similar to Russian &#x27;Z&#x27; symbol  
* Fears are growing Belarus could soon join war in Ukraine to help ally Putin  
Fears that Belarus could soon be forced to join the Ukraine war are growing after military vehicles were seen with &#x27;combat symbols&#x27; painted on them.  
State TV footage of armoured vehicles taking part in snap &#x27;combat readiness&#x27; drills near Ukraine&#x27;s borders showed they have red squares painted on them, which would allow drivers to recognise each-other during actual combat.  
Vladimir Putin also ordered military drills near Ukraine&#x27;s borders with &#x27;Z&#x27; markings appearing on Russian tanks just before he ordered a full-scale invasion in February.

Reuters: No Christmas ceasefire in Ukraine, Russia says, as prisoner swap frees American  
KYIV — Moscow on Wednesday said no “Christmas ceasefire” was on the cards after nearly 10 months of devastating war in Ukraine, even as the release of dozens more prisoners including an American showed that some contacts between the two sides remain. 
Russia and Ukraine are not currently engaged in talks to end the fighting, which is raging in the east and south and reached Kyiv again on Wednesday. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions more displaced and cities reduced to rubble since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.

Ten Shahed-136 drones were shot down by Kyiv&#x27;s air defences early Wednesday, mayor Vitali Klitschko said, after being fired at the central Shevchenkivskyi district.   
Drone fragments struck two administrative buildings in the city centre, emergency services said, while one picture showed a house with the upper floors blown away.

The officials said a directive could be approved as early as this week to transfer the Patriot, the United States’ most advanced ground-based air defense system. 
WASHINGTON — The United States is poised to approve sending its most advanced ground-based air defense system to Ukraine, responding to the country’s urgent request to help defend against an onslaught of Russian missile and drone attacks, two U.S. officials said on Tuesday. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III could approve a directive as early as this week to transfer one Patriot battery already overseas to Ukraine, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Final approval would then rest with President Biden.

Defense News: Congress supersizes munitions production with emergency authorities 
WASHINGTON — Congress is set to allocate more than $8 billion to bolster high-priority munitions production while granting the Pentagon wartime procurement powers to help Ukraine fight Russia and refill U.S. stockpiles. 
The $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2023, which the House passed 350-80 on Thursday and is expected to face a Senate vote this week, authorizes more than $2.7 billion in across-the-board munitions funding. That’s on top of $5.9 billion for the Navy to procure additional munitions and expand U.S. industrial base production capacity. Congress is still negotiating a final appropriations package to fund the munitions authorizations alongside other domestic priorities. 
Furthermore, a series of emergency munitions provisions in the NDAA are intended to speed up the process by waiving multiple restrictions on Pentagon procurement authorities while allowing it to use multi-year contracts typically reserved for large programs, like Navy vessels and major aircraft.

Peru&#x27;s government declared a nationwide state of emergency on Wednesday for 30 days as angry protests rocked different parts of the country after leftist former President Pedro Castillo was removed by the conservative-dominated Congress last week. 
The emergency declaration, announced by the defence minister, will allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public security. 
Earlier on Wednesday, a judge in Peru postponed by 24 hours a hearing to decide whether Castillo will be released from detention on charges of rebellion and conspiracy. 
Castillo&#x27;s arrest last week after he tried to dissolve parliament and rule by decree has sparked days of nationwide protests in which seven people have been killed.

                              <span>Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday Russian athletes should face &quot;complete isolation&quot; and not be welcomed back at the 2024 Olympic Games.
Zelensky told International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach that he strongly opposed moves by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Paris Games provided they do not participate under their countries&#x27; colors or flags.
US officials said Monday there was &quot;unanimous interest&quot; among delegates to an IOC summit to come up with a pathway that would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to competition.
Russia and Belarus have been isolated from international sport ever since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.
However, Zelensky blasted the American moves, claiming that &quot;since February, 184 Ukrainian athletes have died as a result of Russia&#x27;s actions&quot;.
Zelensky told Bach he was disappointed with the presence of the president of the Russian Olympic Committee at the IOC summit on November 9
&quot;One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored,&quot; he said in a statement.
Zelensky added that the only response is &quot;the complete isolation of the terrorist state on the international stage. In particular, this applies to international sports events.&quot;
At this year&#x27;s Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country&#x27;s Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.
However many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.

                              <span>The United Nations on Wednesday voted to remove Iran from a women&#x27;s rights body over Tehran&#x27;s brutal crackdown of women-led protests.
Following a campaign led by the United States, 29 members of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) voted to expel the Islamic republic from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW) for the remainder of its 2022-2026 term.
Eight countries voted against and 16 abstained. A simple majority was needed to adopt the move, which had been proposed by the United States.
The resolution says it strips Iran of its membership of the commission with immediate effect.
The text says the Iranian leadership &quot;continuously undermine and increasingly suppress the human rights of women and girls, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion, …</span>

                              <span>Ukraine has announced that another American has been freed as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that a retired U.S. Air Force veteran Suedi Murekezi was captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine earlier this year, his family said. He has now been freed. 
&quot;Another exchange of prisoners,&quot; tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. &quot;We continue to return ours. 64 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, are going home. It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people - Murekez Suedi. The bodies of the 4 dead were also returned.&quot;
His brother said that Murekezi said in a call that he was being held in the Donetsk People’s Republic with two other American nationals. 
The Post report explained that a prisoner swap in September included two U.S. veterans. The latest swap adds up to 1,456 prisoners that have been released by Russia since the start of their invasion. 
&quot;One prisoner of war told The Post he was beaten so badly that his ribs were broken and his kidneys were badly injured,&quot; the piece said.

                              <span>Disgraced crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried is being held in a jail in the Bahamas that&#x27;s known for its poor conditions -- so poor that a warden described it as “not fit for humanity,&quot; the New York Post reports. 
Bankman-Fried is being held in Fox Hill Prison after failing to get bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. The prison is the only correctional facility in the region. As the Post points out, the prison was the focus of a report last year by the US Department of State which looked into possible human rights violations, including violence and abuse by staff.
“Inmates removed human waste by bucket,” the government report noted. 
“Some inmates developed bedsores from lying on bare ground,” the report said, adding that conditions included “overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care.”
“Sanitation was a general problem, and cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” the report noted. 
Bankman-Fried faces criminal charges in the United States, including securities fraud, campaign finance violations and money laundering, over the collapse of his FTX crypto exchange.

                              <span>A judge in Peru on Wednesday postponed by 24 hours a hearing to decide whether ex-president Pedro Castillo will be released from detention on charges of rebellion and conspiracy.
Castillo&#x27;s arrest last week after he tried to dissolve parliament and rule by decree has sparked days of nationwide protests in which seven people have been killed.
Last week, a judge ordered Castillo to be held for seven days, and he was meant to be released on Wednesday.
However, prosecutors filed a request late Tuesday to hold him in pre-trial detention for 18 months.
Judge Juan Checkley on Wednesday postponed a hearing on the new request until Thursday after defense attorneys argued they had not received all documents from the public prosecutor.
He also ordered Castillo to remain in detention for another 48 hours.
Castillo, a leftist former school teacher, was in power for only 17 months in the South American nation that is prone to political instability and is now on its sixth president in six years.
His short period in office was marked by a power struggle with the opposition-dominated Congress, and six investigations into him and his family, mainly for corruption.
He was facing his third impeachment bid when, last Wednesday, he announced he was dissolving Congress and would rule by decree.
But lawmakers went ahead and voted to sack him and he was quickly arrested while trying to flee to the Mexican embassy and seek asylum.
Castillo&#x27;s vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in as his successor, but has failed to calm tensions that have led to violent clashes between police and protestors in several parts of the country.

The Paris offices of US consulting giant McKinsey were also searched on Tuesday, the National Financial Prosecutors&#x27; Office said, confirming a report in Le Parisien newspaper.
The use of consultants by Macron&#x27;s governments came under the spotlight in March after a French Senate inquiry concluded that public spending on them had more than doubled from 2018 to 2021, during Macron&#x27;s first term.
&quot;It&#x27;s normal for the judiciary to investigate freely and independently to shed all the light on this subject,&quot; a Renaissance spokesman, Loic Signor, told AFP.

Former soccer player-turned-commentator Gary Lineker has been covering the World Cup in Qatar and spoke to the  “News Agents” podcast and discussed why Qatar was allowed to host the World Cup. 
“We pointed facts out at the beginning of the tournament; those facts remain. So, lots of people were killed doing the stadiums. Yes, the stadiums are extraordinary, but at a great price. Homophobia is an issue here, women’s rights are a little bit of an issue here,&quot; he said. 
“For me, it was always really more about the corruption side of it because, as I said previously, I think pretty much every country, including our own, has got issues,” he continued. “And we’re off to America in four years’ time, with Canada and Mexico, but obviously America’s an extraordinarily racist country.”

The writer, a 64-year-old French-Swiss citizen now living in the western Swiss city of Lausanne, was sentenced in April by the regional attorney general to three months behind bars for &quot;defamation, discrimination and incitement to hatred.&quot;
That ruling came after Alain Soral -- a pen name for the controversial writer whose real name is Alain Bonnet -- appeared in an online video attacking Swiss journalist Cathy Macherel of the Tribune de Geneve newspaper, who had written an article about him in 2021.

                              <span>A doctor, rap artists and a footballer are among around two dozen Iranians who risk being hanged as Tehran uses capital punishment as an intimidation tactic to quell protests, rights groups say.
The executions in the past week of Mohsen Shekari and Majidreza Rahnavard, both 23 and the first people put to death over the protests, sparked an outcry, especially as Rahnavard was hanged from a crane in public rather than in prison.
But campaigners warn that more executions will inevitably follow without tougher international action, with a dozen more people already sentenced to death over the protests and a similar number charged with crimes that could see them hanged.
&quot;Unless the political cost of the executions is increased significantly, we will be facing mass executions,&quot; said Mahmood Amiry…</span>

                              <span>As a boy, Samuel Tacchi was crazy about Lego cranes. Now he designs them, under cloak-and-dagger secrecy, at the Danish group&#x27;s headquarters where Santa has filled his sacks for decades.
At its ultra-modern flagship building in Billund, a visit to the offices where the design work is done is out of the question -- the company is fiercely protective of its trade secrets.
But Tacchi, a 34-year-old Frenchman, lifts the veil a smidgen on the creative process, standing at a display featuring some of the brand&#x27;s colourful toy kits.
&quot;I always start with a little sketch on paper about what I have in mind&quot;, says Tacchi, who designs for the Lego Technic series.

                              <span>Hong Kong police&#x27;s decision to ban a Tiananmen vigil last year was unlawful, a court ruled on Wednesday, as it overturned the conviction of jailed democracy activist Chow Hang-tung.
The ruling is a rare rebuke of authorities in a city where the public commemoration of Beijing&#x27;s deadly 1989 crackdown has been virtually wiped out in recent years.
Chow, a 37-year-old lawyer and one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most prominent democracy activists, led a now-disbanded group that used to organize the city&#x27;s annual candlelight vigils to mourn those killed in Tiananmen Square when China sent troops to crush democracy protests.
Police have banned the last three vigils citing the coronavirus and security fears and the courts have already jailed multiple activists who defied those bans, including Chow.

CNN: Taiwan reports record incursion by Chinese bomber aircraft  
Hong Kong CNN  — China has sent a record 18 nuclear-capable H-6 bomber aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense zone, the island’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, as Beijing continues to step-up pressure on the self-ruled island. 
The 18 bombers were part of 21 total Chinese warplanes sent into Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone – a buffer of airspace commonly referred to as an ADIZ – in the 24-hour span between Monday morning and Tuesday morning, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. 
The ministry said it monitored the situation and employed its fighter jets as well as land-based missile systems to track the Chinese planes. 
The flights represent the largest number of H-6 sorties in a 24-hour period since Taipei began releasing daily data on Chinese fighter incursions in 2020.

                              <span>DNYUZ/New York Times: Concern Grows in Israel’s Military as Netanyahu Nears Coalition Deal 
JERUSALEM — When a serving Israeli soldier expressed his approval last month of a far-right politician who is set to become a minister in Benjamin Netanyahu’s likely new coalition government, it set off a national furor. 
The politician, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was deemed too extremist to serve in the army himself. Until 2020, he displayed in his home a portrait of a Jewish gunman who in 1994 shot dead 29 Palestinians inside a mosque. 
The Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, quickly released a rare public letter warning soldiers against getting involved in politics, while the soldier was sent to military jail for several days. 
“Soldiers are prohibited from expressing political views,” General Kochavi wrote. “They are certainly prohibited from behaving and acting out of political inclination,” he added.
