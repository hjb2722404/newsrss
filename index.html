RT: US military could create ‘global biological crisis’ – Russian MOD 
The Pentagon is especially interested in studying infections that could be used as weapons, Moscow has claimed 
The US military is studying pathogens that could be used as biological weapons as the nation prepares for a potential new pandemic, the commander of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, claimed on Wednesday. 
The list of diseases that have attracted the attention of US specialists includes anthrax, tularemia, and various coronaviruses, Kirillov told a media briefing. Some of these pathogens are listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as “high-priority” threats that can be used as “bioterrorism agents.”

The Grey Zone: Zelensky Holds Court With Ukraine&#x27;s Most Notorious Neo-Nazi 
Western media has dismissed evidence of neo-Nazi influence in Ukraine by citing President Zelensky’s Jewish heritage. 
But new footage published by Zelensky shows the leader openly collaborating with a fascist ideologue who once pledged to “lead the white races of the world in a final crusade…against Semite-led Untermenschen.” 
Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky has uploaded a video to his Telegram channel showing him holding court with one of the most notorious neo-Nazis in modern Ukrainian history: Azov Battalion founder Andriy Biletsky.

WNU Editor: Patrick Lancaster has documented some of the war crimes committed by Azov in Mariupol last year (link here).

But here is the shocker. There are some who are even worse than Azov founder Andriy Biletsky. 

I am not surprised about the existence of these extremist groups. I have known about them for a long time, and I have documented some of them in the blog before this war started. 
But what catches my attention about this story is the Western media&#x27;s coverage of these groups. In the case of the New York Times, they call this &quot;complicated&quot; .... Nazi Symbols on Ukraine’s Front Lines Highlight Thorny Issues of History (New York Times). 
Sighhh .... it is not complicated at all.

iNews: Russia puts captured Western tanks, howitzers, missiles, and drones on display at Moscow propaganda show

 
Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine had ‘debunked many myths about the superiority of Western military standards’ 
Russia has placed captured Western and Ukrainian weapons on display at a military expo in the Moscow region, including armoured vehicles, artillery guns, missiles, and drones. 
The annual event showcased more than 800 weapon types captured from the battlefield in Ukraine, Russian state media claimed.

Defence Minsister Sergei Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine had “debunked many myths about the superiority of Western military standards” in a speech at the expo. 
“We have data on… the destruction of German tanks, American armoured vehicles, British missiles and other weapons systems,” he said. “We are ready to share our assessments… with our partners.”

Newsweek: Ukraine Faces Major F-16 Jet Blow 
Ukraine will not receive F-16 fighter jets before next year, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson has said, as Kyiv&#x27;s backers still hesitate to take the plunge on providing Ukraine with advanced Western jets. 
&quot;It is already obvious that we will not be able to protect Ukraine with F-16 jets this autumn and winter,&quot; Ukrainian air force Colonel Yuriy Ihnat said in remarks reported by Ukrainian outlet Ukrinform on Thursday. 
Ukraine has long called on its Western supporters to provide fighter jets to supplement its Soviet-era air force. Although Kyiv has received additional Soviet MiG-29 jets from NATO members, Western jets such as the F-16 would be a marked upgrade for the air force, now 18 months into all-out war with Russia&#x27;s more modern fleet.

                              <span>CNN: Biden turns to Camp David diplomacy for first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea  
President Joe Biden is using the presidential retreat at Camp David to help with a diplomatic mission – hosting the first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea, two countries that are putting aside a fraught history in the face of shared security challenges.
Biden’s summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is meant to serve as a show of force as the countries grapple with persistent provocative behavior from North Korea. It also comes as the president has sought to deepen ties with allies in the Indo-Pacific amid concerns about a rising China.

As to what is my take. 
This is all about optics. American media and the US foreign policy establishment are playing up this summit as a big event for President Biden. But I predict the only substantive thing that will be coming out of this summit will be a hotline .... U.S., Japan, South Korea to work toward security hotline at summit (Nikkei Asia). More here .... Biden to broker crisis hotline with Japan, South Korea (Axios).

Insider: The US Army is rushing to rearm its electronic warriors after watching Russia and Ukraine jam each other&#x27;s drones 
* Electronic warfare has played a prominent role during the war in Ukraine. 
* Ukraine and Russia are both using EW to interfere with each other&#x27;s operations and aid their own.
* That has added urgency to the US Army&#x27;s efforts to update its own EW weaponry. 
After years of neglecting electronic warfare, the US Army is rushing to revitalize its jamming capabilities. 
The catalyst is the Ukraine war, where cheap but plentiful drones are playing a vital — almost decisive — role, doing everything from spotting for artillery to destroying armored vehicles. 
At the same time, jamming has emerged as perhaps the most effective counter-drone weapon: Ukraine may be losing 10,000 drones a month — many to Russian electronic-warfare systems — while it strives to boost its jamming capabilities. Rather than using scarce and expensive antiaircraft missiles and guns to shoot down a drone that may cost only a few hundred dollars, it&#x27;s easier to disrupt the link between the drone and its operator, causing it to crash.

Zero Hedge: Woke Hawaiian Official Stalled Release Of &#x27;Revered Water&#x27; Until It Was Too Late To Save Maui 
How detrimental is it to allow far-left ideologues into bureaucratic public works positions?  The state of Hawaii just found out this week with a blaze that engulfed the Island of Maui and killed at least 110 people.  A series of management blunders are being blamed for the deadly wildfire, but one incident in particular has frightening implications. 
With wildfires ripping across West Maui on Aug. 8, a state water official delayed the release of water that landowners requested to help protect their property from damage and stop the spread. The water standoff played out over much of the day and the water didn’t come until too late.  The dispute involved the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ water resource management division and West Maui Land Co., which manages agricultural and residential subdivisions in West Maui.

                              <span>Defense One: The Pentagon just launched a generative AI task force

 
A conversation with the leader of Task Force Lima reveals its objectives—and the main questions it&#x27;s trying to answer.  
Generative AI programs like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard have captivated public attention and lawmaker scrutiny, though so far the Pentagon has been reluctant to adopt them. 
But Thursday, the Defense Department announced a task force to understand how it might use such tools safely, reveal situations where it’s unsafe for the department to use them, and explore how countries like China might use generative AI to harm the United States. 
The task force, dubbed Task Force Lima, “will assess, synchronize, and employ generative artificial intelligence (AI) across the Department,” according to a draft press statement viewed by Defense One.

Pledge was deleted at short notice from a new draft law, according to media reports. 
BERLIN — So much for Olaf Scholz’s Zeitenwende. 

The German government on Wednesday stepped back at the last minute from making a legal commitment to meeting NATO’s target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense on an annual basis, according to Reuters and German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. 
A government official told the news agency that a clause pledging to meet the target was deleted at short notice from Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s draft of a new budget financing law, just before the Cabinet passed it to the parliament.

ACCRA/NIAMEY (Reuters) -The West African bloc ECOWAS stands ready to intervene militarily in Niger should diplomatic efforts to reverse a coup there fail, a senior official told army chiefs who were meeting in Ghana on Thursday to discuss the details of a standby force. 
Niger military officers deposed President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26 and have defied calls from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him, prompting West African heads of state to order the standby force to be assembled. 
&quot;Let no one be in doubt that if everything else fails, the valiant forces of West Africa...are ready to answer to the call of duty,&quot; ECOWAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security Abdel-Fatau Musah said.

WNU Editor: ECOWAS is an economic institution. Not a military alliance. 

Such an intervention can only occur if the US and France provide the logistical support to transport these Western African bloc forces into Niger. But many are already warning that such an intervention will only destabilize the entire region .... Russia warns of “protracted confrontation” if Ecowas invades Niger (Military Africa). 
As to what is my take. 
An intervention of this magnitude will only lay the groundwork for another failed state to develop in Africa. One only has to look across the Niger border to Libya to see what Western intervention in African affairs usually ends up as.,</span>

                              <span>CNN: Sudan civil war ‘spiraling out of control,’ UN says, as more than 1 million flee 
More than one million people have fled Sudan to neighboring countries since April, according to the United Nations, as fighting between two warring factions plunges the country into civil war.
The conflict in Sudan has displaced more than 3.4 million people inside the country, a report released on Tuesday by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. 
Those who escaped Sudan have arrived in other countries in the region including Egypt, Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia. 
Heavy fighting broke out between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in mid-April, triggering a mass exodus of refugees from the East African country, where allied militias have been accused of killing civilians, ransacking houses and ethnic cleansing, leading to accusations of crimes against humanity.

                              <span>Reuters: Nagorno-Karabakh residents say &#x27;disastrous&#x27; blockade choking supplies 
TBILISI (Reuters) -Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month. 
The U.N. Security Council discussed the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a &quot;genocide&quot; of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan&#x27;s lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate. 
Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave&#x27;s one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Fighting between rival groups began on Monday night in Tripoli, and ended after the release of a commander on Tuesday. 
Tripoli’s worst armed clashes in a year have killed 55 people and wounded 146, Libyan media outlets have reported, as a truce took hold. 
Fighting erupted on Monday night and raged through Tuesday between the influential 444 Brigade and the Special Deterrence Force, two of the many armed groups that have vied for power since the overthrow of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The Guardian: Nato official apologises over suggestion Ukraine could give up land for membership

 
Secretary general’s chief of staff says statement was ‘mistake’ and part of wider discussion – but does not completely rule out idea 
A senior Nato official has apologised and clarified his comments a day after he said publicly that Ukraine could give up territory to Russia in exchange for Nato membership and an end to the war. 
Stian Jenssen, the chief of staff to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told a Norwegian newspaper that he should not have spoken as simplistically as he did, after his initial comments prompted an angry reaction from Kyiv. 
At a panel event in Norway on Tuesday, Jenssen had said that while any peace deal reached would have to be acceptable to Ukraine, alliance members were discussing how the 18-month war might be brought to an end.

Lithuania is to close two of its six border crossings with Belarus. 
The two rural crossing points, which are not used by commercial vehicles, will be closed from Friday. 
The government said the decision was in response to changes in the geopolitical situation and threats to national security, as well as smuggling. 
Belarus&#x27;s western neighbours have increased security since Minsk granted shelter to fighters from Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary group. 
This came as part of a deal to end a brief mutiny in Russia by Wagner in June.

                              <span>Townhall: RFK Jr. Has a Bombshell Explanation About Those Bio-Labs in Ukraine 
Tucker Carlson posted his latest episode on Monday, a roughly hour and a half sit-down with Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in which the two discussed a wide range of topics including Ukraine, bio-labs, and who is responsible for his uncle’s assassination. 
On the subject of bio-labs, the former Fox News host brought up how Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland acknowledged that Ukraine “has biological research facilities.” 
Carlson asked Kennedy why the U.S. would provide funds for such labs, prompting a lengthy explanation from the Democrat. 
“Because we’re developing bioweapons,” RFK Jr. claimed, before getting into the history of the move.

As Ecowas chiefs prepare to meet to discuss possible action against junta, civic group says ‘we need to be ready’

Supporters of the Nigerien junta are calling for the mass mobilisation of citizens against the threat of military action by a west African regional bloc that is calling for the restoration of the country’s deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum. 
With a delayed meeting of military chiefs of staff of the Ecowas bloc scheduled to take place later this week, regional tensions over the July coup against Bazoum appeared to be deepening, despite the junta’s efforts to suggest they were open to talks.

Moscow has claimed that two F-35 jets from the pro-American coalition came dangerously close to two Su-35 belonging to Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria on August 14, marking the latest episode in a series of confrontations between the US and Russian military aircraft. 
Deputy head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of the Warring Parties (CPVS) in Syria, Rear Admiral Vadim Kulit, alleged on August 15 that the incident occurred in the Al-Tanf area. 

Kulit highlighted that the Russian Su-35 fighter jets were conducting a prearranged flight along the southern border of Syria. 
“On August 14, from 12:35 to 12:50, in the Al-Tanf area at an altitude of about 9,100 meters, there was a dangerous rapprochement between two coalition F-35 fighters and two Su-35 aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces, which were making a planned flight along the southern border of Syria. Russian pilots, demonstrating high professionalism, took the necessary measures promptly to prevent a collision with coalition fighters,” he said.

Poland is holding its largest military parade in decades on Tuesday, in a flex of defensive muscle that comes as tensions rise on the border between the NATO nation and key Russian ally Belarus. 
Poland’s Defense Ministry said the celebration of Polish Army Day on Tuesday would be marked by a showcase that includes 200 units of Polish and foreign military equipment, 92 aircraft and 2,000 service members. 
The parade includes some of the latest technology Poland has in its arsenal, including US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, South Korean K2 tanks and K9 self-propelled howitzers, HIMARS rocket launchers, Krab self-propelled howitzers, as well as US-made Patriot missile batteries systems, which are part of the Polish “WISŁA” air defense system.

Ukrainian security services have released to CNN exclusive footage showing the moment in July when they used an experimental sea drone to attack Russia’s bridge to annexed Crimea, providing new details on the attack and warning more such assaults will follow. 
It’s the first time the SBU have openly claimed responsibility for the operation. 
The attack on July 17 caused damage to the road lanes of the bridge, and, according to Russian officials, killed two civilians. It was the second attack on the vital crossing, and showed how hard it is to defend the only independent Russian link to the peninsula.

The world is just a step away from nuclear conflict, North Korean Defense Minister General Kang Sun-namewarned in a statement made public on Tuesday and presented at the Moscow International Security Conference. 
The official blamed Washington’s desire for regime change in Pyongyang for ratcheting up tensions. He also accused the US of increasing its military presence in the region by deploying nuclear-capable aircraft and a submarine to the area.

The tragic disaster that we just witnessed in Hawaii should break all of our hearts. 

The death count just keeps going up, and it is being reported that these were the deadliest fires in the United States in more than 100 years. 
 In addition, Hawaii Governor Josh Green is telling us that this was actually “the largest natural disaster” that his state has ever experienced. 
More than 2,700 structures have been burned down in Lahaina alone, and it is being estimated that the value of the property that has been destroyed is over 5 billion dollars.

WNU Editor: I visited Maui in 2005. Even stayed at Lahaina for a day. When you have 2,700 structures destroyed in two days you are experiencing an incredible disaster. The lack of response from local, state, and federal offices does not surprise me. I am also not surprised that a lot of stories are not making the evening news. The optics of the government not responding adequately is something that the elites who govern us never want to be publicized.</span>

                              <span>Business Insider: Russia is quickly depleting its fleet of warplanes through overuse, and Ukraine deploying F-16s could worsen the situation: expert 
* An engineering expert says the Russian air force is being depleted through overuse in Ukraine. 
* The arrival of Ukraine&#x27;s F-16s could worsen the problem, wrote Rand&#x27;s Michael Bohnert. 
* Ukraine says it urgently needs F-16s to reduce Russia&#x27;s air dominance. 
Russia&#x27;s fighter planes are malfunctioning because of overuse, handing Ukraine a potential advantage in its air battles against the Russian air force, an engineering expert said. 
In an article for Defense News, Michael Bohnert, an engineer at the Rand Corporation think tank, said that Russia&#x27;s warplanes were running out of &quot;aircraft life&quot;. 
&quot;Overuse of these aircraft is also costing Russia as the war drags on,&quot; he wrote, adding that by his calculations as many as 57 Russian planes, many repurposed Soviet-era machines, might have been lost because they broke down since the start of the war.

Washington has chosen its own interests over its allies, a French diplomat has told the newspaper, following Victoria Nuland’s visit to Niger. 
The presence of the ‘Maidan midwife,’ US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, in post-coup Niger has enraged Washington’s NATO ally, France, Le Figaro reported over the weekend, citing a source within the French Foreign Ministry. 
The US “did the exact opposite of what we thought they would do,” a French diplomatic source told the paper, adding that “with allies like these, we do not need enemies.” 
Paris has been insisting on the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Bazoum ever since a new military government came to power in Niger in a coup in late July.

                              <span>CNN: Niger junta says ‘high treason’ evidence gathered to prosecute ousted president Bazoum 
Niger’s junta claimed Sunday it had gathered evidence to prosecute the country’s ousted President Mohamed Bazoum for “high treason,” upping the stakes in their brinkmanship against key neighbors in West Africa who have vowed to restore constitutional order in the coup-hit country. 
“The Nigerien government has to date, gathered the necessary evidence to prosecute the deposed president and his local and foreign accomplices before the competent national and international authorities for high treason and undermining internal and external security of Niger,” said a statement by the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) of Niger, the military council that toppled the government in July.

TASS: Kiev’s military resources almost exhausted, Shoigu states at security conference

 
According to the defense minister, Ukraine&#x27;s defeat will become &quot;a factor in combating modern neocolonialism&quot; 
PATRIOT PARK /Moscow Region/, August 15. /TASS/. Ukraine’s military resources are &quot;almost exhausted,&quot; while Moscow’s special military operation has made it clear that there is nothing on the battlefield that is invulnerable to Russian weapons, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said in an address to the 11th Moscow Conference on International Security. 
According to him, history has once again chosen Russia to be &quot;a driving force promoting the interests of the majority of independent states,&quot; while Kiev’s defeat will become &quot;a factor in combating modern neocolonialism.&quot;

WNU Editor: I disagree with the Russian Defense Minister. As long as the US continues to supply weapons and arms to Ukraine, Ukraine&#x27;s military resources will not be exhausted. And with a few million men of military age available to be conscripted and sent to the front, more than enough manpower to throw into this meat-grinder.</span>

                              <span>CNBC: Fitch warns it may be forced to downgrade dozens of banks, including JPMorgan Chase 
* Fitch Ratings cut its assessment of the banking industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
* But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score from AA- to A+ would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC. 
* “If we were to move it to A+, then that would recalibrate all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions,” Wolfe said.
A Fitch Ratings analyst warned that the U.S. banking industry has inched closer to another source of turbulence — the risk of sweeping rating downgrades on dozens of U.S. banks that could even include the likes of JPMorgan Chase. 
The ratings agency cut its assessment of the industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score, to A+ from AA-, would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in an exclusive interview at the firm’s New York headquarters.

Reuters: US, South Korea, Japan to launch new defence steps at Camp David: Officials 
WASHINGTON – The United States, Japan and South Korea will launch a series of joint initiatives on technology, education and defence when the countries’ leaders gather at Camp David on Friday, according to senior US administration officials, amid mounting shared concerns about China. 
While the summit is unlikely to produce a formal security arrangement that commits the nations to each others’ defence, they will agree to mutual understanding about regional responsibilities and set up a three-way hotline to communicate in times of crisis, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
US President Joe Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol to the storied presidential retreat in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains as the Asian nations work to mend their tattered diplomatic relations in the face of greater regional threats posed both by China’s rise and North Korea.

&quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters,&quot; Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage&#x27;s exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage&#x27;s complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…</span>

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland&#x27;s trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The musician&#x27;s funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

                              <span>Local, national, and global leaders warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons as they commemorated the 78th anniversary of the dropping of an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima Sunday.
This year&#x27;s anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
&quot;Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory,&quot; Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …</span>

                              <span>Organisers of the World Scout Jamboree asked host South Korea Monday to &quot;urgently&quot; evacuate tens of thousands of children from their campsite ahead of a typhoon, just days after a heatwave caused mass scout illnesses.
Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree &quot;a national disgrace&quot; after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

The US sailors and Marines entered the Red Sea on Sunday after transiting through the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the US Navy&#x27;s Fifth Fleet said in a statement.
They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing &quot;greater flexibility and maritime capability&quot; to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.
The US military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
