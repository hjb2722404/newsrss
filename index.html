                              <span>Russia’s lack of success in their invasion of Ukraine is giving China “some pause for thought” about their own invasion plans for Taiwan following the CIA&#x27;s latest reports, says former Liberal MP Dave Sharma.

Mr Sharma&#x27;s comments come after the CIA revealed Beijing may be reconsidering its plans to invade Taiwan in the predicted year of 2027. 

“China is seeing up hand and close the failures of the Russian military operation in Ukraine,” he told Sky News Australia.

“Which on paper is a much easier military operation than an … invasion of Taiwan.

“It’s doubtless giving them some pause for thought about their own military preparedness and readiness.”</span>

                              <span>Former Liberal MP Dave Sharma has taken aim at China&#x27;s &quot;lack of transparency&quot; following the release of a US intelligence report which suggests an accidental lab leak may have been responsible for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This speaks to a lack of transparency from China throughout this,” Mr Sharma told Sky News Australia.

“But even most recently when China was going through a very dramatic wave none of that detail was being disclosed or shared with the World Health Organisation.

“And again, there was a risk during that outbreak that a new variant would emerge which would overwhelm the rest of the world again.

“This is not how a responsible nation behaves.”</span>

Former President Donald Trump maintains a double-digit lead in a hypothetical 2024 Republican primary field, a recent McLaughlin &amp; Associates survey revealed. 
The survey asked Republican primary voters, “Thinking ahead to the 2024 Republican primary election for President, if that election were held today among the following candidates, for whom would you vote?” 
Several potential candidates were listed, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Vice President Mike Pence, and more. 
According to the survey, a plurality, 42 percent, support Trump in the hypothetical 2024 primary. No other potential candidate comes close. DeSantis falls 16 percent behind with 26 percent support from GOP primary voters.

This is an example of how not to win over the American people: shame and berate them while claiming Washington&#x27;s &#x27;global leadership&#x27; is in peril. 
&quot;If they do not change their opinion…they will lose NATO, they will lose the clout of the United States, they will lose the leadership position they are enjoying in the world,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference late last week, in reference to the US public... As if the average American struggling to get by amid soaring food and cost-of-living prices stays awake at night worrying about US global &quot;clout&quot;:

Reuters: French Defence Group Thales to Recruit 12,000 Staff as Orders Boom 
PARIS (Reuters) - French defence and technology group Thales plans to hire 12,000 new staff this year as there is strong demand across its product range, CEO Patrice Caine said in an interview with French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche. 
He said that over the past eight years Thales, which has total staff of 80,000 of which 40,000 in France, had recruited 5,000 to 8,000 people per year and that last year already it had hired 11,500 new staff. 
Caine said that all the firm&#x27;s activities - defence and security, aeronautics and space, identity and digital security, were growing strongly. 
&quot;The company is a reflection of its markets, which are all seeing dynamic growth, with needs growing in all our fields of activity,&quot; he said. 
 Caine, who recently met with Ukraine&#x27;s defence minister, said that France would deliver its Ground Master 200 radar air defence system to Ukraine in May.

SCMP: China aims to launch nearly 13,000 satellites to ‘suppress’ Elon Musk’s Starlink, researchers say 
* The satellite constellation is likely to be launched quickly to prevent SpaceX from hogging &#x27;low-orbit resources&#x27;, according to PLA space scientists 
* The project, code-named &#x27;GW&#x27;, would provide internet services and could be used to spy on rival networks and carry out anti-Starlink missions, paper says 
Researchers say China plans to build a huge satellite network in near-Earth orbit to provide internet services to users around the world - and to stifle Elon Musk&#x27;s Starlink. 
The project has the code name &quot;GW&quot;, according to a team led by associate professor Xu Can with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s (PLA) Space Engineering University in Beijing. But what these letters stand for is unclear. 
The GW constellation will include 12,992 satellites owned by the newly established China Satellite Network Group Co, Xu and his colleagues said in a paper about anti-Starlink measures published in the Chinese journal Command Control and Simulation on February 15.

WNU Editor: For the past few years China has made public their concerns that Starlink could be a strategic and military threat. It now looks like they are developing plans to counter it. 
Bottom line. 
Earth&#x27;s low orbit is about to get crowded with a lot of satellites in the next few years.

                              <span>Roll Call: Federal workers oppose proposed Pentagon civilian workforce cut  
Republican proposal would trim defense workforce through attrition 
The federal workers union came out swinging Thursday against a Republican proposal to reduce the size of the Pentagon’s civilian workforce. 
The American Federation of Government Employees, in a letter to congressional and administration leaders, criticized a plan to purportedly save $25 billion in each of the next five years by not filling a portion of the civilian positions at the Defense Department that are vacated each year. 
“The problem with this approach is that actual waste is not being cut while cutting the civilian workforce will hollow out the Department’s capabilities, repeating mistakes from the past,” wrote Julie N. Tippens, director of the union’s legislative department, in the letter to defense appropriators and authorizers, congressional leadership, top officials at the Pentagon and the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

The Defense Department’s U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has confirmed that it is investigating how one of its servers leaked sensitive data for two weeks. 
The Pentagon said it is evaluating the scope and impact of the potential data exposure, as well as looking to “understand the root cause of the exposure and why [the] problem was not detected sooner.” The agency also confirmed that it was able to secure the server on Monday and will be notifying any staff members affected by the leak.
“DoD takes this matter very seriously and will incorporate all lessons learned from this event to strengthen its cybersecurity posture,” U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jessica McNulty, a Department of Defense spokesperson, told The Hill.

EurAsian Times: US Nuclear Submarine, USS Springfield, Makes Port Call In South Korea Amid Flaring Tensions With North 
On Saturday, the US 7th Fleet announced the arrival of its fast-attack submarine USS Springfield at the naval base in the South Korean port city of Busan in an apparent show of force aimed at the North. 
“The Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Springfield (SSN 761) pulled into port in Busan, February 23,” the fleet said on social media. 
Los Angeles-class submarines make routine port calls in South Korea as part of the US navy’s forward-deployed submarine force in the Indo-Pacific. 
The length of the submarine’s stay was not revealed.  USS Springfield is billed as one of the most capable ships in the entire US navy. Its home port is in Guam, in the western Pacific.

As officials in Ukraine anxiously watch evolving diplomatic overtures between Moscow and Beijing, China’s top leader will host the president of Belarus — a staunch Kremlin ally — with the pomp of a state visit next week. 
On Saturday, China announced the visit, to take place over three days starting on Tuesday, for President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, who a year ago allowed Russian forces to use his country as a staging ground for their full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The presence in Beijing of such a close partner of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is likely to increase international attention, and pressure, over China’s straddling position on the war.

The finance ministers of the Group of 20 countries wrapped up a two-day meeting Saturday in India without issuing a joint statement after China and Russia objected to references that other members wanted to make on Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine. 
With no consensus, India, which holds the G-20 presidency this year, said in what is called a “chair’s summary” that &quot;most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy.&quot; 
Stating that it is essential to uphold international law, the summary said that “the use of or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue are vital. Today’s era must not be of war.”

Boeing  Warzone/The Drive: Boeing To End F/A-18 Super Hornet Production In Two Years  
Boeing says a potential foreign contract could prolong Super Hornet production for two years, but the writing is on the wall for the line.
 Boeing says that it expects to end production of new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets in 2025. It has left open the possibility that it could still be building Super Hornets two years after that for an unspecified &quot;international customer,&quot; which is very likely a reference to a potential Indian Navy contract. No matter what, by all indications, the company is expecting to stop making new F/A-18E/F before the end of the decade. 
The company announced its timeline for shuttering the F/A-18E/F production line, which is located within its facility in St. Louis, in a press release today. As it stands now, the only orders for Super Hornets that Boeing has left to fulfill are for the U.S. Navy. These jets, as well as examples of the EA-18G Growler electronic warfare derivative, are only currently in service with the Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.

                              <span>Matt Margolis: Is Joe Biden Getting Us Into a Nuclear World War III? 
On March 11, 2022, Joe Biden said that sending tanks to Ukraine would start World War III. “The idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews — just understand, don’t kid yourself, no matter what y’all say, that’s called World War III.” 
Curiously, at the end of January, in the midst of the classified documents scandal, Joe Biden flip-flopped and decided to send 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks, eight M88 recovery vehicles, and more than 500 armored vehicles to Ukraine. 
So, World War III it is, I guess. Thanks, Joe. 
At the time of the announcement, Biden claimed that it was Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who recommended the move. However, just a week prior, both Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley expressed opposition to sending tanks to Ukraine because it would take too long to train the Ukraine military how to use them, and they had plenty of tanks already at their disposal, including captured Russian tanks. So, naturally, I have my doubts.

   CBS News: CIA confirms possibility of Chinese lethal aid to Russia 
In an exclusive interview with CBS News, CIA Director Bill Burns confirmed the possibility that China may send lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine. 
&quot;We&#x27;re confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment,&quot; Burns told &quot;Face the Nation&quot; moderator Margaret Brennan on Friday. 
The revelation that China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping is mulling this escalation is a dramatic change from past Biden administration assessments. Earlier this month, Burns told students at Georgetown University that Xi had been &quot;very reluctant to provide the kind of lethal weapons to Russia to use in Ukraine that the Russians are very much interested in.&quot; 
Burns emphasized that China has not yet made the decision to transfer lethal aid to Russia, and shed light on the logic behind the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to make this intelligence public.

WNU Editor: CIA Director William Burns says China has not yet made the decision to transfer lethal aid to Russia. But even though the above twitter video is a short clip, listening to him my gut tells me that the CIA Director already knows Beijing will soon start shipping lethal weaponry and ammunition to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine. 
It is only a question of when the logistics are in place to make it happen, and if China&#x27;s roadmap to end the Russia - Ukraine war is ignored. Since the US and its European allies have already rejected China&#x27;s &quot;peace plan&quot; to end the war (link here), it looks like that decision may come sooner rather than later.</span>

VOA: US Army Officials Confident in Competition with China  
WASHINGTON — Not all branches of the U.S. military are equally worried about keeping pace with China’s military expansion. 
While U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro warned earlier this week that he needed more ships to meet the threat posed by China’s rapidly expanding naval forces, top Army officials believe U.S. ground forces still hold a critical edge over their Chinese counterparts. 
“The human dimension of the United States Army, I think, is a comparative advantage,” U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth cautioned during a breakfast in Washington on Thursday with the Defense Writers Group. “The quality of how our soldiers are trained, the kind of leaders that they have, the kind of combat experience that the force has.” 
Army Chief of Staff General James McConville added that the quality of leadership, especially that rising from the ranks of the Army’s enlisted soldiers, cannot be understated.

Washington Post: China considers sending Russia artillery shells, U.S. officials say 
China is considering sending Russia lethal military aid in the form of artillery shells as President Vladimir Putin’s army rapidly depletes its supply of ammunition a year into his invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials said, a prospect that has alarmed those in the Biden administration who believe Beijing has the ability to transform the war’s trajectory. 
There is no evidence that any weapons transfers have occurred, these officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. government’s assessment. But if China does move ahead, it would mark the first time Beijing has provide…</span>

                              <span>CNN: Chinese fighter jet confronts US Navy plane with CNN crew aboard as tensions simmer in the South China Sea 
Kadena Air Base, Japan CNN  — The US Navy reconnaissance jet flies at 21,500 feet over the South China Sea, 30 miles from the contested Paracel Islands, a group of about 130 small atolls, the biggest of which are home to Chinese military bases. 
A voice, saying it’s coming from a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) airport, crackles over the radio of the US Navy P-8 Poseidon as a CNN crew, given rare access aboard the US flight, listens in. 
“American aircraft. Chinese airspace is 12 nautical miles. Not approaching any more or you bear all responsibility,” it says. 
In a few minutes, a Chinese fighter jet armed with air-to-air missiles intercepts the US plane, nestling in just 500 feet off its port side. 
The Chinese fighter jet was so close, the CNN crew could see the pilots turning their heads to look at them – and could make out the red star on the tail fins and the missiles it was armed with.

   WNU Editor: This story is making the rounds in both Russian and Ukrainian social media .... The Kremlin&#x27;s chief propagandist Solovyov exposed Zelensky&#x27;s &quot;double&quot; - bodyguard Maksym (TSN.ua). 
The use of &quot;doppelgangers&quot; by leaders during wartime is nothing new. So the possibility that one of President Zelensky&#x27;s personal bodyguards looks like him should surprise no one. 
As for Putin. Western media has been speculating for years that Putin uses &quot;doppelgangers&quot; .... Putin has &#x27;doppelgänger on standby&#x27; in case he&#x27;s &#x27;unable to fulfil engagements&#x27; (Metro).</span>

Best Film went to &quot;The Night of the 12th&quot;, a thriller based on the true story of a young woman&#x27;s murder. 
There was a spot of Hollywood glitz thanks to a surprise cameo by Brad Pitt, presenting David Fincher (who directed him in &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot;) with a lifetime achievement award.

It was the first commemoration of the uprising since Marcos Jr took office in June 2022. He has praised his father&#x27;s 20-year regime, which critics describe as a dark period of human rights abuses and corruption that left the country impoverished.
As leftist rock music blared over a loudspeaker, hundreds of protesters, including survivors of the elder Marcos&#x27;s martial law crackdown that led to the killing, torture and imprisonment of thousands of political foes and critics, marched on the &quot;People Power&quot; monument in Manila in memory of the brutal era.

                              <span>US First Lady Jill Biden arrived in Kenya on Friday, kicking off a visit aimed at focusing attention on the worst drought to hit the Horn of Africa in decades.
Five straight seasons of poor rainfall have killed millions of livestock, destroyed crops and left some 22 million people at risk of hunger in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, with a sixth season also forecast to fail.
Biden travelled to Kenya from Namibia, part of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent, which has become a renewed diplomatic battleground following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine last year.
The first senior White House official to travel to the region since her husband President Joe Biden came to power, the 71-year-old community college professor&#x27;s visit will also focus on the empowerment of women and youth.

The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Biden said his country was &quot;all in&quot; on the hotly courted continent.
During her visit to Namibia, Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies.
&quot;We&#x27;re committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners,&quot; Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek on Thursday.
This is Biden&#x27;s first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Friday to do everything to defeat Russia this year, as the first Leopard tanks arrived in Ukraine on the anniversary of the start of Europe&#x27;s largest conflict since World War II.
Street protests against the Russian invasion were held in many European capitals to mark the anniversary, and fresh Western sanctions targeted Russia&#x27;s banks, military industry and semiconductor access.
Meanwhile, the Group of Seven industrialised nations threatened embargo busters with &quot;severe costs&quot;.
Poland sent the German-made Leopard tanks to help Ukraine repel Russian troops and deliver a &quot;clear and measurable signal of further support&quot;, said Pr…</span>

                              <span>Taiwan&#x27;s military said it alerted aviation authorities after spotting a balloon floating in its airspace Friday, one week after the self-ruled island found remnants of what was believed to be a crashed Chinese meteorological instrument.
According to its initial analysis, the air force said the object in &quot;northern airspace&quot; on Friday afternoon was for meteorological and scientific research purposes.
&quot;As it could affect aviation safety, we have notified the aviation control units to remind air planes to beware,&quot; the air force statement said.
&quot;We will continue to monitor until the target disappears.&quot;
The statement did not say where the balloon came from or provide a more detailed location.
The sighting comes after an order by President Joe Biden to shoot down what the United States has since called a &quot;sophisticated high-altitude spying vehicle&quot; that sparked the latest row between Washington and Beijing.
US officials said it was part of a fleet allegedly floating around the globe, while China has said the balloon was an errant weather observation aircraft with no military purpose. Both sides have since accused each other of espionage.
Taiwan, a self-governed democracy claimed by China, said last week that it had found the remains of a suspected Chinese meteorological balloon and would increase patrols at military facilities.
Taiwan&#x27;s defence ministry revealed on February 14 that Chinese balloons have previously flown over the island, without providing details on the number or frequency.
At that time, the ministry said it would shoot down any targets that pose a &quot;high level of threat&quot;, but added that it had not encountered any such threats.
Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure in recent years on Taiwan, which China has vowed to seize one day, by force if necessary.</span>

Yahoo News: Zelensky plans to meet with China&#x27;s Xi on proposed peace plan  
On Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry announced a 12-point proposal that called for a resumption of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. 
LONDON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said he planned to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping about China&#x27;s proposed peace plan, released on the first anniversary of the war. 
“China started talking about Ukraine, and I think this is a good thing,” Zelensky said at a news conference one year after Russia’s invasion. “But it actually begs the question, what will these words be followed with? The steps next are important.”

Politico: Russia ‘mapping’ critical energy infrastructure, say Dutch intelligence agencies 
The report warns that “vital marine infrastructure” could be vulnerable to sabotage. 
Russia is “covertly mapping” critical infrastructure in the North Sea, including gas pipelines and wind farms, in preparation for potential acts of sabotage, according to a report by Dutch intelligence agencies. 
The joint report by the Dutch intelligence services AIVD and MIVD warns that “vital marine infrastructure” could be vulnerable to sabotage and that Russia is undertaking “activities that indicate espionage and acts to prepare for disruption and sabotage.” 
Russia was “very interested in how they could sabotage the energy infrastructure” MIVD director Jan Swillens told a news conference on Monday, adding that a Russian ship had been detected at an offshore wind farm.

   Market Watch/WSJ: NATO would envelop Ukraine in defense pact under new plan pitched by big European members of Western alliance  
Germany, France and Britain seeking to encourage Ukrainian peace talks with Russia on anniversary of Putin’s unprovoked invasion 
BERLIN — Germany, France and Britain see stronger ties between NATO and Ukraine as a way to encourage Kyiv to start peace talks with Russia even if Moscow continues to occupy Ukrainian territory, officials from the three governments said. 
U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last week laid out a blueprint for an agreement to give Ukraine much broader access to advanced military equipment, weapons and ammunition to defend itself once the war ends. 
He said the plan should be on the agenda for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s annual meeting in July.

Six graphics illustrate the extraordinary level of support the United States has provided Ukraine this past year in its war against Russian invaders.  
Every year, the United States sends billions of dollars in aid—and much more than any other country—to beneficiaries around the world in pursuit of its security, economic, and humanitarian interests. 
Heading into 2022, U.S. foreign assistance was driven by various priorities of the Biden administration, including combating climate change, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and countering authoritarianism. But since Russia’s invasion in February of that year, Ukraine has become far and away the top recipient of U.S. foreign aid. It’s the first time that a European country has held the top spot since the Harry S. Truman administration directed vast sums into rebuilding the continent through the Marshall Plan after World War II.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States marked the first anniversary of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine on Friday with new sanctions, export controls and tariffs against Russia and its allies aimed at undermining Moscow&#x27;s ability to wage war. 
Washington also said it would provide another $2 billion in weaponry for Kyiv as it prepares for a spring offensive. The aid did not include F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested. 
President Joe Biden consulted leaders of the G7 bloc of wealthy nations and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy to discuss more aid. 
The United States joined with G7 allies with plans to impose sanctions that will target 200 individuals and entities and a dozen Russian financial institutions.

WNU Editor: Countries and middlemen are making a fortune by evading/ignoring Russian sanctions to sell their resources to nations that need it. They are not going to stop, and these sanctions are not going to impact the bottom line of the Russian economy. 
The only way these sanctions can work ifs if you blockade Russian ports and seize ships that are carrying Russian resources. But such actions will not only mean a direct war against Russia, but also a breakdown in relations with countries that are dependent on Russian resources (China and India to name a few).

Our reporter Gwendoline Debono went to meet resistants in the southern Kherson region, which was retaken from Russian forces last November. The clandestine actions of these ordinary citizens played a key role in the liberation of Kherson. Driven only by their conscience, these Ukrainian men and women managed to thwart the Kremlin&#x27;s plans to annex their region to Russia. Behind Russian lines, Gwendoline Debono was also able to gain access to a Ukrainian military unit responsible for conducting military operations in enemy territory.</span>

All too often, when people think about sexual violence, they assume the acts are committed against women. But men – both soldiers and civilians – are also victims. Our reporters Luke Shrago and Mélina Huet followed prosecutors on the ground in Ukraine as they went about their harrowing work, building cases to be prosecuted, with the hope of one day seeing an international trial take place.</span>

                              <span>Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#x27;s presidential term, provisional data showed Friday.
Surveillance satellites had detected 209 square kilometers (80.6 square miles) of forest destroyed,, according to the INPE space research institute&#x27;s DETER monitoring system.
This is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.
The INPE report included data only up to February 17, but was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.
Last month, Amazon deforestation was down 61 percent from a year earlier, according to the same source.
But experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a &quot;reversal&quot; of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.
The February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.
Over Bolsonaro&#x27;s presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade.
Bolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.
Having previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula took office on January 1 this year with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro.
He has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.
In order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors.

                              <span>Villagers in Cramant in France&#x27;s Champagne are being treated to a rare sight: little pigs grubbing around the vines that produce the region&#x27;s famed bubbly, an alternative to chemical or mechanical means of fighting weeds and pests.
Originally from New Zealand, the &quot;kunekune&quot; pigs -- a Maori word meaning &quot;round and fat&quot; -- snuffle through the earth supporting neatly planted rows of grapevines.
Their &quot;thorough&quot; and &quot;precise&quot; work can fight weeds as well as mildew and other fungi and aerate the soil, says wine industry consultant Olivier Zebic.
First tested last year in the Bordeaux wine-growing region, the pigs may be a better choice than the other eco-friendly solution, sheep -- who &quot;just trim&quot; unwanted plants, Zebic adds.
By contrast, the kunekune turn over &quot;every clod of grass and even ea…</span>

Here, they call it &quot;yage&quot; and consume it for health and wisdom.
&quot;God once lived here on this planet&quot;, recounts Isidro Lucitante, the patriarch and shaman of nine Indigenous Cofan Avie families spread over 55,000 hectares of river and jungle along the border with Colombia.
This god &quot;pulled out one of his hairs and planted it on the Earth. Thus was born the yage, source of knowledge and wisdom,&quot; the 63-year-old, his face painted in striking animal motifs, told AFP.
Extracted from the &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; vine that has grown in the Amazon for thousands of years, ayahuasca has also gained a reputation in the outside world.

The celebrated director&#x27;s first foray into opera started out as a look back at a painful chapter in her country&#x27;s history through Khaled Hosseini&#x27;s story of two women whose lives are marked by the Taliban&#x27;s brutal and repressive rule in the 1990s.
But the surge back to power of the hardline Islamists in August 2021 brought the story roaring back to the present for Afghan women.
And it added new weight to the production, as the Taliban again placed an ever-tightening vice on women&#x27;s liberties, despite vowing a departure from their infamous first reign.

Critics said the award showed Macron really was &quot;the president of the rich&quot; as he is regularly labelled by members of the opposition.
Macron&#x27;s office on Friday confirmed a press report from a day earlier, saying Bezos had been given the Legion d&#x27;Honneur (Legion of Honour), the French republic&#x27;s highest award, in a small ceremony.
The event&#x27;s took place on February 16, the same day hundreds of thousands of people joined strikes and protests against Macron&#x27;s plan to reform the French pension system.

Three candidates, two women and a Muslim man, are vying for the position following the shock resignation of Sturgeon, the long-serving Scottish National Party (SNP) chief.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, a 32-year-old rising star in the SNP, caused controversy this week after revealing that she would have voted against same-sex marriage, had she been a member of the Scottish Parliament when the reform passed in 2014.
While she defended the stance as a matter of personal conscience, it puts Forbes strongly out of line with the SNP&#x27;s centre-left base, and four high-profile supporters immediately wit…</span>

&quot;But we are fighting, we believe in ourselves and in our country. That is why we will overcome everything and win,&quot; he wrote on his Telegram channel on Friday, alongside a video message.
While many Ukrainians had not believed there would be a &quot;barbaric war&quot; by Russia, the capital had been preparing for a possible attack, he said.
&quot;Volunteers who joined the territorial defence and our military helped to protect and hold the capital.&quot;
Russian troops advanced into the suburbs of Kiev after the war began on February 24, but did not get far.
&quot;Kiev is the heart of Ukraine, Kiev was and remains a target of Russia, of the Russians and of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,&quot; Klitschko told dpa in an interview on Wednesday.
At the same time, he said he did not believe Russia could succeed in a new attack on the capital. &quot;I don&#x27;t think Russia will win.&quot;</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - The United States has transferred two brothers from the Guantanamo Bay U.S. detention facility in Cuba to Pakistan, bringing the total number of people held at Guantanamo down to 32, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
The Guantanamo camp was established by Republican President George W. Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.
It came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. &quot;war on terror&quot; because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.
There were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.
On Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.
Both were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon&#x27;s website.
&quot;The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,&quot; the Pentagon said in a statement.
A total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.

                              <span>News Corporation is cutting its staff by 5% globally, including in Australia, after its news media division recorded a second-quarter earnings decline of 47%. The decision inevitably reopens questions about the future of the company’s newspapers, particularly once Rupert Murdoch is gone.

The company’s chief executive officer, Robert Thomson, said  a surge in interest rates and inflation caused the earnings decline, and that these effects were “more ephemeral than eternal”.
However, structural complications in the corporation suggest these “ephemeral” factors are only part of the problem.
“Eternal” factors – such an interesting word where Murdoch is concerned – include the performance of the tabloid newspapers that have played a pivotal role in the development of the organisation. It casts…</span>

                              <span>French police on Thursday detained for questioning the husband of a woman whose dismembered body was found in plastic bags at different locations in a popular Paris park, a source close to the investigation told AFP.
The body parts of the woman had been discovered in the Buttes-Chaumont park in the north of the French capital earlier this month.
Prosecutors told AFP that an individual had been detained in the case but warned that no further information would be made public for now.
The discovery shocked residents of the capital where the park is hugely popular with joggers and families due to its unusually hilly landscaping.
The woman, 46, had been reported missing by her husband on February 6. The pair lived in the Seine-Saint-Denis department northeast of Paris, prosecutors said.
The Le Parisien daily, which first reported his detention, said that the couple had three children and the husband had only reported her disappearance a week after she vanished.
Police investigating the disappearance had not turned up any leads until now.
Park workers found the lower torso of a woman in a plastic bag hidden under leaves and further remains, including the head, were found during a thorough search of the park by police a day later.
French channel BFMTV had reported last week that the husband had come under suspicion in the investigation after giving contradictory evidence.
Prosecutors then launched another investigation into how this information had been leaked to the channel.
Built during the major relandscaping of the French capital under Napoleon III in the 19th century, the park most recently starred as the setting for a romantic picnic in the third series of &quot;Emily in Paris&quot;.
It has also been a popular setting for classic French films ranging from Eric Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&#x27;s Wife&quot; to Gaspar Noe&#x27;s more recent film &quot;Love.&quot;

                              <span>First Lady Jill Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies, as she visited Namibia on Thursday.
Biden arrived in the southern African country on Wednesday in the first stop of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent.
&quot;We&#x27;re committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners,&quot; Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek.
In the capital the 71-year-old community college professor met with President Hage Geingob and First Lady Monica Geingos. 
Africa has become a renewed diplomatic battleground, with countries aggressively courted by Russia, China and the West. 
Biden&#x27;s trip is to focus on hunger in the Horn of Africa and the empowerment of women and youth.
On Friday, she will head to Kenya where she is to draw attention to the Horn of Africa&#x27;s worst drought in decades, which has left more than 20 million people with acute food shortages.
The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Joe Biden said his country was &quot;all in&quot; on the hotly courted continent. 
This is Biden&#x27;s first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

The legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year&#x27;s ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.
The 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.
A hyper-realistic replica of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;corpse,&quot; wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.
Spanish artist Eugenio Merino&#x27;s sensational sculpture, entitled &quot;Aquí murió Picasso&quot; (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso&#x27;s native city of Málaga.
Long queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.
Many visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.
Alongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.
There is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is &quot;The Mediterranean: A Round Sea.&quot;
A total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.</span>

                              <span>The European Commission on Thursday banned TikTok on official devices used by staff amid concerns over data protection as the EU seeks to bolster its cybersecurity.
TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is Chinese, has faced increasing Western scrutiny in recent months over fears about how much access Beijing has to user data.
The new ban also means European Commission staff cannot use the video-sharing app on personal devices including phones that have official EU communication apps installed.
Employees must remove the app as soon as possible and should do so by March 15.
EU spokeswoman Sonya Gospodinova said the corporate management board of the European Commission, the EU&#x27;s executive arm, had made the decision for security reasons.

                              <span>A six-decade archive charting pop icon David Bowie&#x27;s career will open in London in 2025, providing a &quot;new source book for the Bowies of tomorrow&quot;, a museum director said Wednesday.
Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Tristram Hunt said the &quot;incredible&quot; collection had more than 80,000 items of Bowie memorabilia.
They range from hand-written lyrics and letters to sheet music, original costumes, photography and album artwork.
A number of instruments owned by Bowie as well as music videos, set designs and awards are also due to go on display.
Bowie, originally from south London, died in 2016 at the age of 69.
The collection will be housed at the Bowie Centre for the Study of Performing Arts, a new outpost of London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum.
The museum was delighted to be become &quot;custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public&quot;, said Hunt.
&quot;Bowie&#x27;s radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style -– from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monae to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons,&quot; he added.
Bowie enjoyed an extraordinary career generating around 140 million record sales and taking in styles from glam rock to jazz, as well as stage personas such as Ziggy Stardust.
The new centre will be located at the V&amp;A East Storehouse venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.
The museum said this had been made possible through a £10 million (around $12 million) joint donation by the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.
Bowie&#x27;s estate sold the publishing rights to his &quot;entire body of work&quot; to Warner last year.
The centre meant his life&#x27;s work was now taking its &quot;rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses&quot;, said a spokesperson from the David Bowie Estate.
The behind-the-scenes access the new venue offers &quot;will mean David&#x27;s work can be shared with the public in ways that haven&#x27;t been possible before&quot;.

Iran has been rocked by citizen outrage since the September 16 death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini following her arrest for an alleged breach of dress rules for women.
&quot;Instagram has been widely used by Iranians to shed light on the protests and the brutal response to them,&quot; Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg said during a briefing.
&quot;People have also shared Instagram footage of the protests with international media outlets, many of whom can&#x27;t report directly from Iran.&quot;
Protests triggered by Amini&#x27;s death resulted in authorities clamping down on speech and freedom of assembly, and limiting the use of the internet and…</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.
