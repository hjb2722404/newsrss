“Mike Pence could attack Donald Trump if he likes but he’s just too nice of a person.

“So they’re all trying to find out who they want to be, and in the meantime Trump and DeSantis are slugging it out as the two frontrunners that they are.”</span>

                              <span>A city in Peru is debating the reactivation of its foundry. With a population of 33,000 and an altitude of 3,750 metres, La Oroya is South America&#x27;s former smelting capital. It was also formerly one of the most polluted cities in the world. Closed in 2009, the metallurgic complex found new owners last year, when 1,270 former workers became shareholders. The new owners intend to reactivate the site in coming months. La Oroya’s residents are now divided between dreams of renewed prosperity and fears of a return to life in a massively polluted environment. Report by Juliette Chaignon and Guillaume Gosalbes.</span>

                              <span>Two Indian sisters who are professional wrestlers were arrested on May 28 during a protest against the wrestling federation chief, who is accused of sexual harassment. The wrestling chief, however, is also a prominent member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, India’s ruling party. In the wake of the arrest, BJP supporters criticized the women for staging their arrest, circulating, as proof, a photo of the two women smiling in a police van. However, it turns out that this photo was digitally altered using a mobile application.</span>

                              <span>Reuters: Shelling, looting in Sudan&#x27;s capital as military factions battle for eighth week 
DUBAI (Reuters) - Shelling hit western areas of Sudan&#x27;s capital on Monday morning after rival military factions fought through the night, residents said, with reports of deepening lawlessness in Khartoum and in the western region of Darfur. 
Fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who have been battling each other for more than seven weeks, intensified after the expiry late on Saturday of a ceasefire deal brokered by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. 
The conflict has uprooted more than 1.2 million people within Sudan and sent about 400,000 fleeing into neighbouring countries, inflicting heavy damage on the capital where remaining residents are at the mercy of battles, air strikes and lawlessness.

War On The Rocks: What the Ukrainian Armed Forces Need to Do to Win  
Our instructors were training a Ukrainian national guard unit near the Moldovan border. When we arrived at the range, a Ukrainian unit was already on the range throwing hand grenades in an open field less than 200 meters from us, then just dropping to the ground and watching them explode without any cover. These soldiers then proceeded to conduct machine gun training, shooting from positions from the left range berm across the range (not against the backstop).  Our instructors were conducting round-robin training about 150 meters behind the range, and the rounds were whistling over our heads. When we approached the person in charge, he said not to worry; he was a Ukrainian marine who had survived Mariupol, and the range was to NATO standards. The bravery and elan of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are not in question, but this example is a small indicator of the issues plaguing the training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces — the lack of an ingrained understanding on how to conduct uniform, consistent training.

                              <span>CNN: Exclusive: Ukraine has cultivated sabotage agents inside Russia and is giving them drones to stage attacks, sources say  
Ukraine has cultivated a network of agents and sympathizers inside Russia working to carry out acts of sabotage against Russian targets and has begun providing them with drones to stage attacks, multiple people familiar with US intelligence on the matter told CNN. 
US officials believe these pro-Ukrainian agents inside Russia carried out a drone attack that targeted the Kremlin in early May by launching drones from within Russia rather than flying them from Ukraine into Moscow. 
It is not clear whether other drone attacks carried out in recent days – including one targeting a residential neighborhood near Moscow and another strike on oil refineries in southern Russia – were also launched from inside Russia or conducted by this network of pro-Ukrainian operatives.

                              <span>Reuters: Russia says it thwarts big attack in Ukraine but Russian mercenary leader says some ground lost 
KYIV (Reuters) - Moscow said on Monday it had thwarted a major Ukrainian offensive in the south of Ukraine&#x27;s Donetsk region but Russia&#x27;s main mercenary leader said Russian forces had lost ground around Bakhmut further north. 
Asked whether the attacks represented the start of Ukraine&#x27;s long-heralded counter-offensive against Russia&#x27;s invasion, Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine&#x27;s Security and Defence Council, told Reuters: &quot;The war continues. Until complete victory.&quot; 
Russia&#x27;s defence ministry said Ukraine had attacked on Sunday morning with six mechanised and two tank battalions in southern Donetsk, where Moscow has long suspected Ukraine would seek to drive a wedge through Russian…</span>

                              <span>FOX News: US military releases video of Chinese warship cutting across American destroyer in Taiwan Strait

 
The move comes nearly a week after a Chinese fighter jet flew directly in front of the nose of a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft 
The U.S. military released video on Monday of a close encounter between a Chinese navy ship and an American destroyer in the Taiwan Strait over the weekend. 
The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) reported China&#x27;s &quot;unsafe maneuver&quot; on Saturday, but did not release the video footage until early Monday morning, in which a Chinese navy ship can be seen cutting sharply across the path of USS Chung-Hoon. 
The destroyer had to slow down to 10 knots to avoid a collision.

USS Chung-Hoon and Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal were conducting a &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; transit of the strait between Taiwan and China&#x27;s mainland – waters that are considered international to the U.S. and its allies, but an &quot;exclusive economic zone&quot; to China.

The Telegraph: Putin’s exploits as KGB spy likely to have been exaggerated, investigation finds 
Vladimir Putin was not a Soviet super spy in East Germany in the 1980s but a plodding pen-pusher eager to please his superiors, an investigation has found.

Germany’s Spiegel magazine investigated Mr Putin’s murky past on the suspicion that stories of his exploits as a KGB agent were exaggerated. 
Instead of conducting vital missions to hold back the forces of democracy, Spiegel said that Mr Putin was focused on “banal” administrative work during his KGB posting to Dresden, “endlessly sorting through travel applications for West German relatives or searching for potential informants among foreign students”.
Mr Putin was a 32-year-old officer when he was sent to Dresden in 1985, a tense time with the Kremlin’s grip over its vassal states fracturing.

Speaking in Singapore at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual intergovernmental security conference, Anand announced Saturday that Canada will significantly enhance its military presence in the Indo-Pacific through Operation Horizon. 
Anand said the new operation will replace the Indo-Pacific portion of Canada&#x27;s existing Operation Projection.

                              <span>Reuters: Saudi pledges big oil cuts in July as OPEC+ extends deal into 2024 
VIENNA (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia will make a deep cut to its output in July on top of a broader OPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024 as the group seeks to boost flagging oil prices. 
Saudi&#x27;s energy ministry said the country&#x27;s output would drop to 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from around 10 million bpd in May, the biggest reduction in years. 
&quot;This is a Saudi lollipop,&quot; Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference. &quot;We wanted to ice the cake. We always want to add suspense. We don&#x27;t want people to try to predict what we do... This market needs stabilisation&quot;. 
OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, pumps around 40% of the world&#x27;s crude, meaning its policy decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States scrambled F-16 fighter jets in a supersonic chase of a light aircraft with an unresponsive pilot that violated airspace in the Washington D.C. area and later crashed into the mountains of Virginia, officials said. 
The jet fighters prompted a sonic boom over the U.S. capital in an attempt to pursue with the errant Cessna Citation, officials said, causing consternation among people in the Washington area.
Four people were on board the Cessna, a source familiar with the matter said. A Cessna Citation can carry seven to 12 passengers.

                              <span>Reuters: Blinken Warns Against Peace Efforts That Would Reward Russian Aggression 
HELSINKI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday warned against any peace initiatives that could help legitimize Russia&#x27;s seizure of Ukrainian territory, saying a &quot;just and durable&quot; peace effort should address accountability and reconstruction. 
Delivering what U.S. officials described as a highlight speech that lays out Washington&#x27;s view of 16 months of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Blinken said over the coming weeks and months some countries were likely to call for a ceasefire. 
But for any peace effort to be lasting, he laid out, it requires Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;full participation and assent&quot; and should support Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction and recovery, with Moscow paying its share, Blinken said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China&#x27;s military rebuked the United States and Canada for &quot;deliberately provoking risk&quot; after the countries&#x27; navies staged a rare joint sailing through the sensitive Taiwan Strait. 
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s 7th Fleet said the guided-missile destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and Canada&#x27;s HMCS Montreal conducted a &quot;routine&quot; transit of the strait on Saturday &quot;through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law&quot;. 
&quot;Chung-Hoon and Montreal&#x27;s bilateral transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the commitment of the United States and our allies and partners to a free and open Indo-Pacific,&quot; it said in a statement. 
The Eastern Theatre Command of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army said its forces monitored the ships throughout and &quot;handled&quot; the situation in accordance with the law and regulations.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Shelling by Ukrainian forces on Russia&#x27;s Belgorod region continued overnight on Sunday after two people were killed the previous night and hundreds of children were evacuated away from the border, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Sunday. 
 &quot;Overnight, it was quite restless,&quot; Gladkov said on the Telegram channel, adding that the Shebekino and Volokonovsky districts suffered &quot;lots&quot; of damage from shelling during the night. 
More than 4,000 people were relocated to temporary accommodation in the region, which borders Ukraine to its south and west, Gladkov said.

China&#x27;s defence minister said on Sunday that conflict with the United States would be an &quot;unbearable disaster&quot; and his country seeks dialogue over confrontation, despite refusing American demands for military-to-military talks. 
 Speaking at Asia&#x27;s top security summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue, dressed in the uniform of a general in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, General Li Shangfu said the world was big enough for China and the US to grow together. 
&quot;China and the US have different systems and are different in many other ways,&quot; he said in a speech that marked his first significant international address since he was named China&#x27;s Minister of National Defence in March.

CNN: These may be the world’s best warships. And they’re not American 
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — It’s a growing problem that has United States naval commanders scratching their heads: How to keep up with China’s ever-expanding fleet of warships. 
Not only is China’s navy already the world’s largest, its numerical lead over the US is getting wider, with the head of the US Navy warning recently that American shipyards simply can’t keep up. Some experts estimate China can build three warships in the time it takes the US to build one. 
It is just one of the concerns, alongside Beijing’s increasing aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, that’s likely to be weighing on the mind of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as he joins top military figures from across the region at this weekend’s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.

Washington Post: Use of NATO arms for attack in Russia raises doubts about Kyiv’s controls 
The Russian fighters aligned against Moscow who launched a cross-border raid from Ukraine into the Belgorod region of Russia last week used at least four tactical vehicles originally given to Ukraine by the United States and Poland, U.S. officials said, raising questions about the unintended use of NATO-provided equipment and Kyiv’s commitments to secure materiel supplied by its supporters.
Three of the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, also known as MRAPs, taken into Russia by the fighters were provided by the United States and the fourth was from Poland, according to people familiar with the U.S. intelligence finding, which has not previously been reported. Those people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.

WNU Editor: So much for Ukraine President Zelensky&#x27;s public promise to US President Biden that the weapons that have been given to them will not be used to launch attacks Russia itself. No one believed this promise then, and no one should be surprised now. 
The simple fact is that Ukraine is now awash with Western weapons. They have no control on what many of their armed groups and militias are doing right now, and in fact they do not care as long as they are used against Russia. 
The US and other Western governments also do not care. Their focus and priority in this war is to defeat Russia, even if it means their weapons are being used to launch attacks against the territory of Russia.</span>

Politico: Ukraine won’t attend NATO summit without ‘signal’ on accession: Zelenskyy

 
‘How many lives is one sentence at the Vilnius summit worth?’ Ukraine president asks in Wall Street Journal interview. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doubled down on Kyiv’s push to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ahead of NATO’s next summit in Vilnius this summer. 
“If we are not acknowledged and given a signal in Vilnius, I believe there is no point for Ukraine to be at this summit,” the Ukrainian president told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Saturday. 
“We understand that we will not be in NATO or in any powerful security alliance during this war. But tell me, how many [Ukrainian] lives is one sentence at the Vilnius summit worth?” Zelenskyy said, adding he “honestly [did] not know” if he would receive such a signal.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says his country is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive to liberate territory occupied by Russian forces while warning that it could take some time and be costly. 
 &quot;We strongly believe that we will succeed,” Zelenskiy said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on June 3. 
&quot;I don’t know how long it will take. To be honest, it can go a variety of ways, completely different. But we are going to do it, and we are ready,” he added.

Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian Army had not received &quot;all the weapons it hoped for, but we can&#x27;t wait any longer.&quot;

DW: Germany&#x27;s far-right AfD sees poll numbers surging 
Polls see Germany&#x27;s center-left coalition government in free fall while the far-right populist AfD is reaping the benefits. It currently polls on par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x27;s Social Democrats. 
Never before have voters in Germany been this unhappy with the current coalition government: Only one in five says they are doing a good job. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are plummeting in the polls, after only one and a half years in office. 
This is according to pollster infratest-dimap who surveyed 1300 eligible voters on May 30 and 31, 2023, and published the results in its monthly &quot;Deutschlandtrend.&quot; 
The far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the main beneficiary. Its approval ratings have gone up by another 2% since May and, if elections were held now, would win 18% nationwide putting them on a par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x27;s SPD. In several eastern states, the AfD has long been the strongest party.

Update #2: German far right surges in polls, alarming mainstream parties (Euronews)

 
WNU Editor: In my lifetime I have never seen a German government this incompetent AND dangerous. 
After only one and a half years in office, Germany has lost its source of stable and cheap energy. Its economy, once the envy of the world, is now in a recession. There is no leadership or direction from the Chancellor&#x27;s office. And to top it all off, the country is now involved in a war against Russia.
The AfD may be a far-right populist party. But they, and other opposition parties, in the eys of many Germans are looking very good right now.</span>

                              <span>Defence Minister Richard Marles claims Australia’s defence relationship with China is being “stabilised” amid increased dialogue between the two nations.

Mr Marles said Australia’s communication with China proves it is possible to “walk and chew gum at the same time”.

Reuters: Berlin calls on China to stop enlisting former German military pilots 
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius on Saturday called on China to stop enlisting former German military pilots for the training of its own forces. 
&quot;I have made it clear that I expect this policy to be stopped immediately,&quot; German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters after meeting his Chinese counterpart at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Asia&#x27;s most important security conference. 
He added the Chinese defence minister had not denied the practice of hiring former German military pilots, but played down its significance. 
Pistorius did not give any further details in a recording of his comments that was distributed by the defence ministry in Berlin.

A People’s Liberation Army Navy warship cut across the bow of a U.S. guided-missile destroyer on Saturday while it was transiting the Taiwan Strait, according to a report from embarked journalists. 
USS Chung-Hoon (DDG-93) and HMCS Montreal (FFH-336) were transiting the strait when a PLAN warship cut across the bow of Chung-Hoon, according to a report from Canadian outlet Global News. 
According to their report, a Chinese warship made a course to cut across the bow of the American destroyer and were advised over radio by the U.S. crew to alter course to avoid a collision. Montreal’s commander, Capt. Paul Mountford, called the move unprofessional. The Chinese warship came within a 150 yards of the U.S. ship. 
Mountford told Global News the incident was ”clearly instigated by the Chinese.”

                              <span>Incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has won Turkey&#x27;s run-off presidential vote for another five-year term, Supreme Election Board (YSK) head Ahmet Yener said on Sunday.
Erdoğan received 52.14% of the votes, Yener said.
His rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%, according to the preliminary results, Yener added.
Erdoğan can now remain in his seat for another five years and for a third time. The 69-year-old became prime minister in 2003. The parliament voted him as president in 2014.

Erdogan, 69, defied opinion polls and came out comfortably ahead with an almost five-point lead over his rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the first round on May 14. But he fell just short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff, in a race with profound consequences for Turkey itself and global geopolitics.
His unexpectedly strong showing amid a deep cost of living crisis, and a win in parliamentary elections for a coalition of his conservative Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), the nationalist MHP and others, buoyed the vetera…</span>

&quot;Don Goyo&#x27;s angry because they didn&#x27;t put out his offering,&quot; said Jose Luis, a 55-year-old charcoal seller in Xalitzintla, the community closest to Popocatepetl.
Some residents even report having seen the mountain incarnate appear before them.
Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco.
&quot;We asked him &#x27;who are you?&#x27; He said: &#x27;Don&#x27;t you know me? I&#x27;m Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl. I&#x27;m the volcano,&#x27;&quot; the 77-year-old farmer said.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday blamed Kosovo, the United States and European Union for escalating tensions in the Balkans and said it was watching with concern after violent clashes between Kosovan police and protesters opposed to ethnic Albanian mayors.
The United States and allies on Friday rebuked Kosovo, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas undermined efforts to improve troubled relations with neighbouring Serbia. NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.
The clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.
&quot;We decisively condemn Pristina&#x27;s provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,&quot; Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
&quot;The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,&quot; she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by &quot;Western mediators&quot; had come too late.
Serbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, and Moscow has blocked the country&#x27;s bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.

                              <span>As financial belt tightening and layoffs rippled throughout the tech industry in recent months, fact checkers and researchers who were tasked with keeping disinformation and extremism off of social media platforms are becoming scarce, CNBC reported. 
&quot;The cuts come at a time of increased cyberbullying, which has been linked to higher rates of adolescent self-harm, and as the spread of misinformation and violent content collides with the exploding use of artificial intelligence,&quot; the report stated. 
In a mass effort to boost productivity with less overhead, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have all slashed thousands of jobs.
In an example of just how far tech companies are willing to go to cut costs, departments tasked with trust and safety and AI ethics have been slashed as well.

&quot;Twitter effectively disbanded its ethical AI team in November and laid off all but one of its members, along with 15% of its trust and safety department, according to reports. In February, Google cut about one-third of a unit that aims to protect society from misinformation, radicalization, toxicity and censorship,&quot; says CNBC. &quot;Meta reportedly ended the contracts of about 200 content moderators in early January. It also laid off at least 16 members of Instagram’s well-being group and more than 100 positions related to trust, integrity and responsibility, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.&quot;

It was unclear who the pope had been expected to meet with, as his agenda was not made public on Friday, as is customary.
Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin blamed the pontiff&#x27;s busy schedule, saying he was tired.
&quot;The pope was tired, yesterday he had a very busy day, he saw a lot of people .. he wanted to say hello to them all,&quot; said Parolin, according to Italian news agencies.
&quot;And probably at a certain point the resistence breaks down.&quot;
Francis had eight meetings Thursday, according to his published schedule.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
