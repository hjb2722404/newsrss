Zero Hedge: Putin Reassures Allies In Phone Calls, Erdogan Expresses &#x27;Full Support&#x27; Against Coup 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to reassure regional allies that he will crush the Wagner uprising now threatening the military and government, and will maintain a stable Russia. 
In what&#x27;s being described as his first international phone call since the Wagner mutiny began, which is grabbing the attention of Western governments, Putin spoke to his Belarus ally, President Alexander Lukashenko. &quot;The president of Russia called the president of Belarus this morning, there was a phone conversation,&quot; Belarusian state media confirmed. &quot;Vladimir Putin informed his Belarusian colleague about the situation in Russia.&quot;

WNU Editor: It must have been a tough day for Putin to call his foreign allies and tell them that he is control when tens of thousands of Russian troops had to be deployed onto the streets of Moscow to counter a convoy of Wagner forces. 
Fortunately for Putin, some of his allies like the Turkish and Egyptian Presidents, know what it is like to experience a coup.
 But the country that really counts is China, and so far they have said nothing. But Chinese state media have reported extensively  on this crisis, and they have expressed complete confidence that Putin will not only survive this insurrection, but come out stronger .... Putin vows to take ‘decisive actions’ against rebellious Wagner (Global Times). 
As to what is my take. 
This is a huge win for the West, because it gives substance to the Western media narrative that Putin is weak and Russia is not stable. Bottom line. The job of the US State Department and EU Foreign ministries to convince governments on the fence to edge away from Russia just got a little bit easier.

Update: The Duran predicted this months ago. Their analysis on this crisis (video below) was made before Prigozhin agreed to disengage his forces, but it is still a must see.</span>

                              <span>NewsRescue: Zelensky prepares ground to delay presidential election 
Ukraine will be unable to hold elections as long as martial law is in place, President Vladimir Zelensky told British national television BCC on Friday. 
His original five-year tenure will end in May 2024.

“According to the law, elections must take place during a period of peace, when there is no fighting,” Zelensky told the BBC when asked if a presidential election will take place next year.

Ukrainian legislation requires a parliamentary election by October 29 of this year. 
According to Rodion Miroshnik, former ambassador of the Lugansk People’s Republic in Moscow, in order for the 60-day campaign to begin on August 28, Kiev would need to lift martial law. Miroshnik told TASS that presidential elections will have to take place by March 2024.

WNU Editor: I do not think Prigozhin&#x27;s exile to Belarus is going to last long. But he had no choice. I know that outside of Moscow there is a huge military base with tens of thousands of soldiers present with heavy armor, and this morning they were all ordered out of their base and deployed to destroy Prigozhin&#x27;s approaching convoy at all costs. And in Rostov where Prigozhin was holed up, a massive Chechen force with Russian special forces were approaching the city to attack and evict him out of the military base that he was in. 
Bottom line. Receiving little if any public support and no support from any Russian military unit Prigozhin had to cut a deal. 
So what is next? 
Prigozhin will be exiled to Belarus, but he will be closely watched and his movements and communications will be severely restricted. 
The Wagner fighters who initially refused to participate in Prigozhin&#x27;s &quot;march&quot; will sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. 
There will be no changes in the Russian Ministry of Defense as demanded by Prigozhin. 
Belarus President Lukashenko is the big winner in this crisis. 
This is a big wake-up call for Putin. 
The vast majority of Russians understand why this war is being fought, and they support it. But they are not supporting the strategy on how to fight it. My fear is that Putin, in order to placate the growing impatience with the pace of the war, is going to significantly escalate the war that will include the use of strategic bombers as well as expanding what targets the Russian military will be permitted to destroy.</span>

Kyiv’s Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, unleashed a fiery political statement on June 21, decrying the mounting external pressure on him and the city&#x27;s administration. He specifically complained about, what he called, disruptive anti-corruption and law enforcement searches impeding the organization’s work.

Evgeny Prigozhin agreed to halt his march on Moscow and avert “a bloodbath,&quot; the Belarusian president said 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced on Saturday that he had arranged a deal whereby Wagner Group leader Evgeny Prigozhin will abandon his mutiny in exchange for “security guarantees” for his fighters. 
“Evgeny Prigozhin accepted the proposal of President Alexander Lukashenko to stop the movement of armed men of Wagner in Russia and take further steps to de-escalate tension,” read a statement from Lukashenko&#x27;s office.

WNU Editor: It looks like it has ended. Prigozhyn will go and stay in Belarus (maybe), and Wager fighters will get some more money and recognition for their military achievements.

WNU Editor: Busy since early this morning talking to friends, family, and contacts in Russia.

The sentiment has been this (quoting one commentator) .... One thing is certain, everybody understands that it’s an internal power struggle no one is afraid of soldiers from either side … formally the same side. 
Russian military blogs that I follow are saying this .... Prigozhin outlawed himself and PMCs Wagner. It&#x27;s a pity, they are patriots and good soldiers. 
The latest news that I have heard (which was 10 minutes ago) is that the Wagner convoy that was on its way to Moscow has stopped and they have not moved in the past few hours. Apparently a deal is being brokered.

FSB opens criminal case after Yevgeny Prigozhin accuses Russia’s military of rocket attack and says ‘evil’ leadership must be stopped 
Russia’s FSB security service has opened a criminal case for armed mutiny against Wagner’s Yevgeny Prigozhin after the mercenary chief accused the Russian military of targeting his forces and vowed to “destroy” his rivals. 
In an extraordinary series of audio clips released late on Friday, Prigozhin claimed that a Russian rocket attack had killed scores of his fighters, vowing to take “revenge” and “stop the evil brought by the military leadership of the country”.

It seems they don&#x27;t want to be found. There is even a Japanese word for the phenomenon: &quot;johatsu&quot;, or evaporation. Many make meticulous plans for their disappearance and cut all ties with their families to build new lives elsewhere. But why do they do it? And where do they end up? Our reporters spoke to investigators, experts and left-behind families to try to shed light on Japan&#x27;s &quot;evaporated&quot; people.</span>

Reuters: Putin Says Russia&#x27;s New Sarmat Nuclear Missiles Soon Ready for Deployment 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia&#x27;s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, would soon be deployed for combat duty.

In a speech to new graduates of military academies, Putin stressed the importance of Russia&#x27;s &quot;triad&quot; of nuclear forces that can be launched from land, sea or air.

&quot;The most important task here is the development of the nuclear triad, which is a key guarantee of Russia&#x27;s military security and global stability,&quot; he said.

RT:  Russian Army getting enough recruits to form new regiment per day – Shoigu

 
The defense minister’s statement comes as Ukraine ramps up its conscription effort  
The Russian Army is recruiting enough new personnel to complete the formation of its reserve force, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Thursday. Enough applicants are signing formal contracts with the ministry to form a new regiment every day, he added. 
A total of 114,000 people have joined the Russian Armed Forces as contract servicemen to date, Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin at a Russian National Security Council session. An additional 52,000 people have joined the military ranks as volunteers, he said.

This is the opposite on what is happening in Ukraine. In 2022 tens of thousands volunteered. No more now. Conscription is the rule now, and draft dodgers are being hunted down .... Ukrainian youth speak on war, social catastrophe: “The military is grabbing draft evaders everywhere” (WSWS).</span>

RT:  Macron is ‘inappropriate’ for BRICS – Moscow

 
There should be no place for the French president at the bloc’s upcoming summit, a senior diplomat has argued  
French President Emmanuel Macron’s attendance at a meeting of BRICS leaders would be “inappropriate,” considering his government’s stance against Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said. 
Paris confirmed this week that Macron is seeking an invitation to the bloc’s summit in South Africa in August. 
Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Ryabkov explained that Russia’s opposition to Macron’s potential appearance was based on France’s efforts to isolate Moscow and its support for NATO’s goal of inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia in the Ukraine conflict. 
“We are not hiding this position and have informed our South African colleagues about it,” Ryabkov said, as cited by Interfax. “We expect our point of view to be fully taken into account.”

Zero Hedge: Biden Dispatches Sullivan, Nuland To Convince War Skeptics From BRICS To Turn Against Russia 
At a moment President Zelensky has confessed that Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive which was launched this month has been &quot;slower than desired&quot;, President Biden&#x27;s national security advisor Jake Sullivan is mounting a big push to convince &quot;skeptics&quot; from developing nations to become more firmly supportive of Kiev&#x27;s war effort. 
&quot;Joe Biden’s top national security aide will fly to Denmark this weekend at the behest of Kyiv’s government for an unannounced meeting with representatives of several developing countries that have not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,&quot; Financial Times has reported. 
A planned Copenhagen meeting is expected to include large but &#x27;neutral&#x27; countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa - the latter which has of late been accused of actively supporting Moscow.

Defense Post: US B-1B Bombers Land in Sweden for Exercises for First Time 
US bomber jets have landed in Sweden for the first time in modern history for training exercises with the NATO invitee, the military said Wednesday. 
Sweden, which abandoned two centuries of military non-alignment to seek NATO membership last year, announced earlier this month that it was ready to host NATO troops and materiel on its soil even before it becomes a member of the alliance. 
Two American B-1B Lancers landed at Lulea-Kallax airport in northern Sweden on Monday June 19, the military said.

Chonhar Bridge is one of a handful of infrastructures linking Crimea with the mainland

Russian-backed officials in southern Ukraine have accused Kyiv of using British-supplied long-range missiles to strike a bridge connecting Kherson province with the Crimean peninsula. 
The strike on the Chonhar Bridge, one of the few links between mainland Ukraine and Crimea, came two days after Moscow threatened to attack Kyiv’s “decision-making centres” if western-supplied missiles were used against Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
A series of photos and videos circulating on Telegram on Thursday showed a large crater on the bridge, with debris littering the roads. There were no casualties reported.

Ukrainian troops—if sufficiently supported with expanded Western military aid—can break through Russian lines and reach the occupied Crimean Peninsula by the end of the summer, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe Ben Hodges has told Newsweek. 
Amid concerns about the slow pace and mounting losses of Ukraine&#x27;s nascent counteroffensive in the south and east of the country launched early in June, Hodges called on President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration to underscore its commitment to Ukrainian victory by providing advanced weapons like the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System—colloquially known as the ATACMS—so far denied Kyiv for fear of provoking Russian retaliation.

Update: A retired US general says Ukraine could recapture Crimea before the summer&#x27;s out, but only if the US gives it the ammunition it needs (Insider)

 
WNU Editor: The Russians in Crimea, who make up 80% of the population (if not more), will see the Ukrainian army not as liberators, but as invaders. It will be a carnage for both sides. 
There is history that can be looked at to predict what will happen. It took the German 11th Army 8 months of heavy fighting to finally capture Crimea in 1942 (link here). The casualty numbers and destruction of that campaign was astronomical. and I predict the same will happen if Ukraine&#x27;s military forces enter Crimea in the coming months.</span>

                              <span>Five Michigan Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday voted against a child marriage ban. 
Michigan in among 42 states in which child marriage is currently legal, of which 20 states don’t have a minimum age for marriage, The Detroit Free Press reports, citing data from the human rights group Equality Now.
Children who are 16 or 17 years of age can enter marriages with the written consent of a parent or guardian under current Michigan law. House Bill 4293 would ban such marriages. 
The Michigan state House passed the measure resoundingly, but GOP Reps. Steve Carra, Neil Friske, Matt Maddock, Angela Rigas and Josh Schriver all voted against the measure, Heartland Signal reports on its Twitter feed.
So far this century, 5,400 children (under the age of 18) were married in Michigan, but the numbers have declined steadily in recent years, the report said, noting 468 girls married in Michigan in 2000 compared to just 32 in 2021.
Democratic Rep. Kara Hope, one of the bill’s sponsors, said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that this practice is still legal in Michigan in the year 2023,&quot; according to the report. 
&quot;Victims of child marriage have less stability in their financial situations, more unwanted pregnancies and worse health outcomes,&quot; it says.
A United Nations initiative aims to end child marriage by 2030.</span>

The Titan, a vessel owned by the deep sea exploration company OceanGate Expeditions in Washington State, lost contact with the ship that deployed it less than two hours after embarking on what should have been a two-and-a-half-hour journey to the Titanic in the north Atlantic Ocean.

It felt like it was a bomb, an attack,&quot; said Oliur, 27, still shaken by the explosion that he said miraculously left him unscathed. &quot;If I had been closer to the window, I would not have made it.&quot; He said one of his neighbours wasn&#x27;t so lucky.

“Donald Trump’s no fan of mine, he primaried me last year,” Mace earlier told Fox News. “So, I’m not a shill, but I see this, and I see how unfair it’s been.”
Speaking to Politico, Mace said that she has &quot;no ill will&quot; towards Trump, adding that the country &quot;can’t afford four more years of Joe Biden.&quot;
“I’m willing to bury the hatchet to save the country, and I know President Trump is too,&quot; Mace said. 
According to a source speaking to Politico, Trump, who formerly called Mace a &quot;grandstanding loser,&quot; sent her a text the day after his indictment thanking her for defending him.

The blast was followed by a major fire which caused one building, housing a fashion school, to collapse, as well as an adjacent building, emergency services said.
Some 70 fire trucks and 230 firefighters were battling the blaze which was contained by the early evening. Nine doctors were also at the scene.
The fire service said there had been &quot;an explosion&quot; which had &quot;caused the collapse of two buildings&quot;.
Several witnesses told AFP at the scene they had heard &quot;a giant explosion&quot;.

&quot;Here the water is still dirty... but by the end, it will be crystal clear and bacteria-free,&quot; said Carlos Lardin, operations manager at Esamur, the public body overseeing wastewater management in the Murcia region.
At his feet, brownish water bubbled in a de-silting tank, the first step before being sifted, filtered and then biologically treated to give it &quot;a second life&quot;, explained the 45-year-old engineer.

                              <span>The black fedora worn by pop superstar Michael Jackson just before he dazzled the world with his moonwalk dance for the first time will be up for grabs in September during a Paris auction of music memorabilia.
The King of Pop whipped off the hat while breaking into his hit &quot;Billie Jean&quot; during a televised Motown concert in 1983.
A few minutes later Jackson, at the height of his fame, showed off what would become his trademark move -- a seemingly effortless glide backwards while appearing to move forward.
The hat, with an estimated value of 60,000 to 100,000 euros ($65,000-$110,000), will be the star attraction at an auction of rock-and-roll items by Drouot on September 26.
Other items include a guitar owned by the legendary bluesman T-Bone Walker that could fetch up to 150,000 euros; a suit worn by Depeche Mode&#x27;s Martin Gore; and one of Madonna&#x27;s gold records.
The sale is being organised by Artpeges and Lemon Auction, which last year made a splash with the 385,500-euros sale of the infamous guitar that broke up Oasis, the British band formed by the brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher.
A full list of the roughly 200 items will be published online by Hotel Drouot on July 4.</span>

                              <span>An extensive search and rescue operation is underway to locate a commercial submersible that went missing during a dive to the Titanic shipwreck.
According to the US Coast Guard, contact with the submersible was lost about one hour and 45 minutes into the dive, with five people onboard. The vessel was reported overdue at 9.13pm local time on Sunday (12.13pm AEST, Monday).
The expedition was being run by US company OceanGate as part of an eight-day trip with guests paying US$250,000 per head to visit the wreck site. As of Monday afternoon (Tuesday morning in Australia), US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger said the watercraft likely had somewhere between 70 and the full 96 hours of oxygen available to the passengers.

                              <span>Government ethics experts are already raising alarms about former President Donald Trump&#x27;s business dealings with Oman, and New York Times reporter Eric Lipton said on Tuesday that the arrangement Trump has forged is truly without precedent.
Writing on Twitter, Lipton broke down what makes this particular Trump deal particularly troublesome.
&quot;As a NYT reporter, I&#x27;ve been investigating Trump family international deals since 2016. India, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Panama,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I have never seen anything like the Oman deal, [regarding] the potential for a conflict of interest.&quot;
What makes the deal such a giant red flag, argues Lipton, is that the land being used to build the Trump real estate project in the country is actually owned by the government of Oman.

Added to this, notes Lipton, &quot;the developer, Dar al Arkan, is a Saudi real-estate company with close ties to the Saudi royal family,&quot; which has also put large investments into Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner&#x27;s private equity firm.
&quot;Oman is enormously important player in the Middle East,&quot; Lipton adds. &quot;Close ties with Saudi Arabia and Iran. US has sold F-16s/other military equipment. It is now involved in negotiations between US and Iran. [Imagine] adding a multi-billion real-estate deal to that mix as a president decides policy.&quot;

                              <span>Online influencer Andrew Tate, his brother and two women were indicted in Romania on human trafficking and rape charges, prosecutors said Tuesday, six months after they were detained.
Police arrested Tate, 36, and his brother Tristan, 34, and the two Romanian women late last year. Under preventive detention at first, they were placed under house arrest at the end of March.
The anti-organized crime prosecution&#x27;s unit (DIICOT) &quot;ordered the indictment&quot; of the four defendants for offenses including &quot;setting up an organised criminal group... trafficking in persons... rape&quot;, they said.
The brothers deny all the accusations. If found guilty, they would face years in prison.

Raids were carried out at the headquarters of the committee, which is known as Cojo, and at the offices of Solideo, the body in charge of the Olympic construction sites, a source close to the investigation told AFP.
The reason for the raid was not immediately clear but Cojo said they were &quot;cooperating fully with the investigators in order to facilitate their investigation.&quot;
This is the first such raid on the organizing committee headquarters.
The searches of their premises were conducted by anti-corruption and financial crime investigators and the BRDE, the financial brigade of the Parisian police, another source close to the probe said…</span>

                              <span>Search and rescue teams are racing to find a deep-sea vessel that went missing with five people on board during a dive to explore the wreck of the Titanic ocean liner. 
The US Coast Guard is leading the search for the small craft, named Titan, in the North Atlantic Ocean. The remote area is where the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew.
The Titan&#x27;s dive on Sunday is one of many that have been made to the wreck by OceanGate Expeditions since 2021. The sunken ship is about 2.4 miles (3.8 kilometers) below the surface.
The undersea exploration company has been chronicling the ship&#x27;s decay as well as the underwater ecosystem that has sprung up around it over the last century.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
