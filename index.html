                              <span>More than two million baby swings and swings were recalled on Monday for posing a strangulation hazard after one baby died and another was rescued from entanglement.
Restraint straps on MamaRoo swings and RockaRoo rockers hang below the seat when not in use, creating the possibility that crawling babies can get caught in them, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has declared.
The company behind the two models, 4moms, “has received two reports of entanglement incidents involving infants becoming entangled in the strap under the unoccupied MamaRoo infant swing after crawling under the seat, including a 10-month-old baby who died of asphyxiation, and a 10-month-old baby who suffered bruising to his neck before being rescued by a caregiver,” a safety commission statement said.

Workers are paid as W-2 employees, not independent contractors, which means they are still protected by federal labor laws and elements of the social safety net, including the workers’ compensation for injury.
Snagajob, an hourly work platform, says these shifts have tripled from 2020 to 2021, and are likely to quintuple in 2022 – mostly as a side income because people’s regular jobs weren’t enough.
“I think if they got the ultimate flexibility and all the compensation they wanted from their full-time employer, there would probably be less need for shifts,” said Snagajob chief executive Mathieu Stevenson.  “But the reality is, in the overwhe…</span>

                              <span>When oil prices fall, many costs for industry and agriculture, including chemicals and fertilizers, usually follow.  And shipping becomes more economical.  But when they rise sharply, as they did in 2008 and the 1970s, they tend to raise other prices and drag down the overall economy.  And political fallout often ensues.
Predicting energy prices has always been a fool’s game because there are so many factors, including the expectations of traders who buy and sell fuel, the political fortunes of unstable producing countries like Venezuela, Nigeria and Libya, and the investment decisions of public and private oil companies.  business leaders.
Today, these complexities are particularly difficult to assess.

Hearing no response, she poured her energy into volunteer work, and in March she began helping family friend Rachel Brooks, who ran an after-school English program for local students, and also started helping out at an abbey in Cavagnolo that was hosting Ukrainian refugees.

                              <span>TikTok’s design makes it a breeding ground for misinformation, the researchers found.  They wrote that the videos could easily be manipulated and reposted on the platform and featured alongside stolen or original content.  Pseudonyms are common;  parody and comedy videos are easily misinterpreted as fact;  popularity affects the visibility of comments;  and the data about posting time and other details are not clearly displayed on the mobile app.
(Shorenstein Center researchers noted, however, that TikTok is less vulnerable to so-called brigadier, in which groups coordinate to spread a message widely, than platforms like Twitter or Facebook.)
In the first quarter of 2022, more than 60% of videos containing harmful misinformation were viewed by users before being deleted, TikTok said.  Last year, a group of behavioral scientists who had worked with TikTok said an effort to attach warnings to posts with unsubstantiated content reduced sharing by 24% but limited views by just 5%.
The researchers said misinformation will continue to thrive on TikTok as long as the platform refuses to disclose data about the origins of its videos or share information about its algorithms.  Last month, TikTok said it would offer access to a version of its application programming interface, or API, this year, but it didn’t say whether it would do so until the midterms.
Filippo Menczer, professor of computer science and computer science and director of the Indiana University Social Media Observatory, said he had offered research collaborations to TikTok and had been told ” Absolutely not”.
“At least with Facebook and Twitter, there is some level of transparency, but, in the case of TikTok, we have no idea,” he said.  “Without resources, without being able to access the data, we don’t know who is suspended, what content is removed, if it acts on reports or what the criteria are.  It’s completely opaque and we can’t independently assess anything.

                              <span>Despite these adaptations and dietary shifts in apex predators, invasive species still win out.  In Australia in 2015, for example, the country’s then-endangered species commissioner told the national channel that “Australia has lost 29 mammals since European settlement, and wild predators are implicated in 28 of those extinctions”.
Florida faces similar invasion problems as it is home to an ideal combination of a subtropical climate, a thriving pet trade, and multiple ports of entry.  The result, said Ian Bartoszek, a wildlife biologist with the Southwest Florida Conservatory, is that the state has “more established non-native animal species than any country in the world”.  Or, as Dr. Mazzotti said of the Everglades, “I’m preparing to call it Everglades Invasive Reptile National Park.”

“I remember sitting at this same desk when I was applying to universities,” said Ms Lai, 36.
Now she was recalibrating her life.  Feelings of burnout had left her crying on a street in downtown Austin, Texas three months earlier.  It was more than a year into the pandemic, on her day off, which she had spent with her mother and sister.  She was eventually overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Ms. Lai worked 50 hours a week as a pediatric nurse practitioner at a community health clinic in Southeast Austin.  Some of her patients at the clinic, which Ms. Lai said served a mostly Latin American population, did not have access to clean water. …</span>

For all its glamorous shops, restaurants and performing arts programs, Hudson Yards is first and foremost an office complex, with four huge towers comprising 8.6 million square feet.  Although the private company Related, led by Chairman Stephen M. Ross, is reluctant to share data, several brokers have helped us estimate that all expensive office space is about 95% leased or sold.
In the newest tower, 50 Hudson Yards, which will open later this year, a slew of big deals recently closed that totaled 285,000 square feet in a lackluster market.

Goel spoke candidly with Cointelegraph in Seoul last week about Polygon (MATIC) are pushing to help NFT games proliferate and why game publishers in South Korea like Neowiz and Nexon are diving headfirst into space.
One of the main arguments made by Goel is that the traditional business model that NFT games compete against may be inherently weaker.  In traditional games, users typically purchase in-game items with real money, but they cannot sell those items to recoup a dollar value.

John Fetterman having a lot of fun on Twitter at the expense of dr. Mehmet Ozhis Republican rival for the Pennsylvania Senate seat, and Oz can’t seem to help stepping on rakes in his attempts to fight back.
Fetterman, who is currently lieutenant governor of Keystone State, made Oz’s longtime residence in neighboring New Jersey a central part of his campaign message, poking fun at Oz as an out-of-touch millionaire celebrity of Pennsylvania blue-collar voters.
One of Fetterman’s most memorable Twitter zingers was responding to an Oz campaign video to point out that it was filmed at his New Jersey mansion which was profiled in People.

Thanks to journalist Brian Steele and the Gazette for the extensive July 30 article on the big changes in central Florence.  No, this story was not about the well-planned central Florence redesign project underway at that time, but about the ongoing gentrification.
Case in point: Residents of Florence/Northampton have expressed concern over new building owners’ plans to evict – via an unaffordable rent increase – the Pizza Factory and replace it with a cannabis retail store called Euphoria.
This article was probably the first time most readers had heard of this project.  As proposed, Euphorium would be owned by father and son Marco and Richard Aranzullo of Connecticut.

It was hard to blame him for crying.  “Kat’a” is a heart-pounding tragedy about a small-town woman trapped in a loveless marriage and driven to suicide after having a brief affair.  Janacek’s music crushes her ethereal fantasies with the brutal fist of reality.
At Barrie Kosky’s the staging was the culmination of a week in Salzburg, classical music’s preeminent annual event, which runs until August 31.  Kosky has reduced this stripped-down work even further, to its core of trembling human beings.

                              <span>A subset of the seemingly endless crop of TV reboots adapts well-known properties from yesteryear, but with more considered or in-depth approaches to race or gender, or both.  The 1960s are different when “The good years” centered on a black family.  There’s more to chat about “Gossip Girl” without the rigid do-si-do of a gender binary.
Likewise, a new version of “A League of Their Own” oscillates around ideas about queer identity and spaces, race, and blackness in particular.  But he can’t move his bat fast enough to connect.
This “League,” available now on Amazon, has the same setting as Penny Marshall’s near-perfect 1992 film: It’s 1943, and the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League makes its debut as World War II erupts. continues and Major League Baseball’s labor pool contin…</span>

The hope of SK, Ford, many energy policymakers and pragmatic environmentalists is that most Georgians stalking for holiday fireworks in years to come will instead be hanging from F-150 sets. Lightnings.
Even with logistics and production volume straightened out, the lingering question for Jackson County residents and Americans alike is whether batteries made on the road in SK will power vehicles ultimately as accessible as Ford’s Model T.  Henry Ford called it a vehicle “for the great multitude,” and it fueled America’s original automobile revolution.
As usual, silver bullets are rare.  And like most major challenges, it helps if a solution is to create something cool.
Maddison Dean, a Jackson County native, was hired earlier this year by SK for a community relations role.  In April, she gave a presentation on the company to over a hundred juniors and seniors at Commerce High School, her alma mater.  In the auditorium, she provided insight into electric vehicles, the rapidly changing future of automakers, and how SK operations work.
“I told them, feel free to interrupt me anytime, just raise your hand,” she said.  At first, she didn’t have many takers.  “You know, especially talking to high school kids, they’re just sort of transparent, they’re like, ‘Yeah, whatever, that’s an excuse for us to be out of class, but we don’t lend it don’t pay attention.  “”

And I found, to my surprise, that learning about baby equipment forced me to learn more about babies themselves – what they like, what they don’t like, to how old they grow and come out of certain behaviors.  As my due date approached, I felt more prepared and less unhappy than many other future dads I met in our birthing classes, many of whom had outsourced equipment decisions to their wives.
And when my wife finally gave birth three weeks early, I was ready.  I drove her to the hospital with confidence, full bags in tow, not once worrying about whether the car seat was properly installed.

They have overcome boardroom clashes, investor power struggles and regulatory landmines.
But this summer, some of them encountered their most threatening adversary yet: multi-family townhouses.
Their battle took place in one of the most exclusive and affluent cities in Silicon Valley: Atherton, California., a 4.9 square mile enclave just north of Stanford University with a population of 7,500.  There, tech CEOs and venture capitalists coalesced on the spectrum that more than one home might exist on a single acre of land in general proximity to their estates.

Iran and Russia have expanded the level of their strategic cooperation in various fields. Most recently in space, when a Russian rocket launched an Iranian satellite into orbit from a Russian spaceport in Kazakhstan, writes analyst and Middle East expert Elijah J. Magnier. 
Russia signed a contract with Iran to buy 1,000 drones after Iran supplied several aircraft and a simulator on which Russian officers trained: they successfully used the first drones in Ukraine. The move is considered unprecedented for a superpower that buys drones from Iran. Tehran considers it recognition of its advanced and efficient military industry, achieved despite 43 years of US sanctions against the Islamic Republic.

A pall of smoke from burning cities would engulf Earth, causing worldwide crop failures, models show.
Even a small conflict in which two nations unleash nuclear weapons on each other could lead to worldwide famine, new research suggests.
Soot from burning cities would encircle the planet and cool it by reflecting sunlight back into space. 
This in turn would cause global crop failures that — in a worst-case scenario — could put 5 billion people on the brink of death.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from Europe’s largest nuclear power station, amid warnings that the Kremlin may falsely claim Kyiv has directly struck the critical site. 
Zelenskiy said anyone giving orders for attacks on the site or nearby towns and cities should face trial by an international court, as concern about the safety of the nuclear site remained high.

The SUN: PANIC STATIONS Putin’s officials in ‘secret talks with the West to end Ukraine war’ as ‘panicked’ Moscow elite go ‘behind tyrant’s back 
VLADIMIR Putin&#x27;s panicked cronies are secretly reaching out to the West to try and bring Russia&#x27;s disastrous war in Ukraine to an end, intelligence chiefs have alleged. 
Russia&#x27;s elite are increasingly despairing about the sanctions imposed on the country in the wake of Vlad&#x27;s bloody invasion and are trying to negotiate for peace, a senior Kremlin official is reported to have claimed. 
A document believed to have been circulated around Western intelligence agencies and supposedly seen by The Mirror said: &quot;A representative of Putin&#x27;s inner circle sent a signal about the desire to negotiate. 
&quot;The mood of the Kremlin elite is panic.&quot; 
Putin&#x27;s backstabbing official isn&#x27;t named in the document but has been described as a &quot;pillar of the regime&quot; in Russia. 
Ukraine believes high-ranking Kremlin officials are attempting to reach out to Western intelligence agencies behind Putin&#x27;s back, a Kyiv diplomatic source told The Mirror.

                              <span>Bloomberg: What would happen if the US goes to war with China over Taiwan? 
As China waged extensive military exercises off of Taiwan last week, a group of American defense experts in Washington was focused on their own simulation of an eventual — but for now entirely hypothetical — US-China war over the island. 
The unofficial what-if game is being conducted on the fifth floor of an office building not far from the White House, and it posits a US military response to a Chinese invasion in 2026. 
Even though the participants bring an American perspective, they are finding that a US-Taiwan victory, if there is one, could come at a huge cost.

U.S. warships will continue to make Taiwan Strait transits and perform freedom of navigation operations in the Indo-Pacific despite the recent Chinese live fire drills, the undersecretary of defense for policy told reporters Monday. 
The U.S. Navy is expected to conduct some freedom of navigation operations in the region in the coming days, Colin Kahl, undersecretary of defense for policy, said during a press briefing. It is important for Beijing to understand that the United States will continue to sail in international waters where it is allowed.

Daily Mail: Democrat Senator Ed Markey leads congressional delegation to Taiwan less than two weeks after Pelosi&#x27;s controversial trip there amid rising tensions with China 
* A group of five U.S. lawmakers made a surprise stop in Taiwan on Sunday during a swing through Asia 
* Delegation led by Dem Sen Ed Markey and includes Dem Reps. Alan Lowenthal, John Garamendi, Don Beyer and American Samoa GOP Delegate Aumua Amata 
* Comes 12 days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s controversial trip to Taiwan 
Another group of U.S. lawmakers are visiting Taiwan over the weekend after China issued a stark warning and began military drills near the island following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit less than two weeks prior. 
A five-member delegation, led by Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, are in Taiwan on Sunday and Monday as part of a larger trip through Asia, according to the American Institute in Taiwan. 
Pelosi&#x27;s trip to Taiwan just 12 days before this new trip angered China, leading to Beijing sending missiles, warships and warplanes into the seas and air around Taiwan.

UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced &#x27;a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War&#x27; and was just &#x27;one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.&#x27; 
&#x27;We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,&#x27; Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
&#x27;Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,&#x27; he said, calling on nations to &#x27;put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.&#x27;

A huge nuclear power plant occupied by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine is &quot;completely out of control&quot;, the head of the UN&#x27;s nuclear agency says.  Rafael Grossi was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying the Zaporizhzhia plant needed an inspection and repairs.
&quot;You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,&quot; he said. 
Europe&#x27;s biggest nuclear plant is dangerously close to the fighting. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia earlier this week of using the plant, which it overran in March, as a military base to launch attacks on Ukrainian forces.

Daily Mail: America is &#x27;on edge of war with Russia and China&#x27;, says former US secretary of State Henry Kissinger - and blames US leaders having &#x27;trouble defining a direction&#x27; 
* Henry Kissinger served as Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon 
* He suggested to the Wall Street Journal over the weekend that leaders in today&#x27;s US political climate have trouble separating personal values from negotiations 
* &#x27;All you can do is not to accelerate the tensions and to create options, and for that you have to have some purpose,&#x27; he said of issues with China and Russia 
* It comes as another Congressional delegation is en route to Taiwan 
* House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit was seen by some as exacerbating tensions 
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned on Friday that the United States could be &#x27;on the edge of war&#x27; with Russia and China, as the Biden administration grapples with its historically low relations with the two autocratic regimes. 
Without naming names, the 99-year-old statesman suggested that American leaders have &#x27;trouble defining a direction&#x27; in today&#x27;s political climate, which he believes has contributed to rising global tensions. 
 &#x27;We are at the edge of war with Russia and China on issues which we partly created,&#x27; Kissinger told the Wall Street Journal.

The Guardian: Russia claims US ‘directly involved’ in Ukraine war 
Kremlin says White House supplying information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes  The role of American intelligence in the war in Ukraine has been put under scrutiny after Russia accused the White House of supplying targeting information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes. 
Russia’s defence ministry claimed Washington was “directly involved” in the war, and had passed on intelligence that had led to the “mass deaths of civilians”. The US was responsible for rocket attacks by Kyiv on populated areas in the eastern Donbas and in other regions, it said.

WNU Editor: The above Kremlin claims on US involvement in the Ukraine war was first reported two weeks ago. There has been nothing but silence from the Kremlin since then. But on Russian media there has been nothing but discussions and reporting on US involvement in the Ukraine war, and it has been effective. This Russian media/propaganda campaign has pushed anti-US sentiment in Russia to levels that I have never seen in my lifetime.</span>

MENAFN: For Europe to back Ukraine, it must be willing to &quot;pay&quot; 
(MENAFN) According to the head of EU foreign policy, EU citizens should be prepared to pay the cost associated with aiding Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.

Operator Dean’s Poll closes restaurant in Central Park October 16.  The Big Apple landmark will close due to soaring costs, according to Poll. 
Whichever way you slap it, this is bad news for the city.  A dark boathouse would leave a heartbreaking hole in the park at a time when New York’s green lung needs all the healthy, law-abiding human traffic it can handle. 
Last rebuilt in the 1950s, where Calvert Vaux’s original 1870s Boathouse once stood, magically located on the east shore of scenic Central Park Lakeis ignored by some New Yorkers who foolishly take it for a tourist trap.

The fire was quickly extinguished.  And although a Russian shell hit Reactor No. 1, its thick walls protected it from damage, the Ukrainian government said at the time.
Now, five months later, repeated bombings inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant complex over the past seven days have raised renewed concerns, with Ukrainian and Western officials warning that the attacks increase the risk of nuclear accident.

                              <span>It was a long-term gamble on liquid natural gas, but it paid off and turned the United States into a major exporter of fossil fuels.
Journalist Jake Bittle delves into the career of Charif Souki, the Lebanese-American entrepreneur whose appetite for risk changed the course of America’s energy sector.
The article describes how Mr. Souki went from restaurant owner in Los Angeles to co-founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy, an oil and gas company specializing in liquefied natural gas, and provides insight into his process of reflection: “According to Souki,” writes Mr. Bittle, “the need to provide energy to the world in the short term outweighs the long-term demand to act on carbon emissions”.


At a time of acute climate anxiety, Mr. Souki’s rationale might seem outdated, even brazen.  The world may be facing energy and climate crises, Mr Souki told The New York Times, “but one is going to happen this month, and the other is 40 years from now.”


“If you tell someone, ‘You’re going to run out of power this month,’ and then you tell the same person about what’s going to happen 40 years from now,” he said, “they say, ‘What do you care about in 40 years?’  »

The school she attended was for children of Hawaiian descent, but instead of encouraging students to embrace that heritage, she tried to erase it.

As Watson took the field, greeted by boos from the sparse crowd at TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, a league adviser continued to weigh his eligibility for the upcoming regular season.


The day before the match and an apology from Watson, The Associated Press reported that Watson would be willing to accept an eight-game suspension and a $5 million fine, after his representatives initially argued over not running out of time.

When the San Diego Padres signed Tatis to a 14 years, $340 million contract in February 2021, he matched the boldness of their investment with an equally bold statement: “I want the statue.”  Then Tatis led the National League in home runs and nearly won the Most Valuable Player award, all before his 23rd birthday.

                              <span>CNN Brianna Keilar wondered aloud on Wednesday whether calling Republicans “extremists” was enough for Democrats — and whether they were “doing more than that.”
In an exchange with the Democratic strategist and former Pete Buttigieg advise Lily Smithwho just wrote the book Any Tuesday: A Political Love Storya bleak picture was painted in the scenario that Republicans would take more control in the midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election.
“Democrats call Republicans extremists because Republicans have become a party of extremists, crazies have taken over the asylum. People who are in the mainstream of the Republican Party today, there’s 10 years, would have been avoided by the party leadership,” Smith said.

    The City of Amherst government is again trying to take over the parking lot from the citizens of Amherst.  Now they also want to remove parking on Sunset Avenue and Elm Street. 
The Amherst City Council should allow as much unpaid daytime parking as possible for visitors, workers and students.  I know the owners of Lincoln Avenue have been reciting horror stories about parking on this street, but that’s not what I see on a daily basis.  I see a manageable traffic pattern under control with frequent speed bumps. 
I also see hard-working members of the community: workers, students and visitors, who use a public resource – free public parking – in a careful and efficient way.  Those people parking on Lincoln Avenue are doing …</span>

The written statement came after a June 3 visit to Mar-a-Lago by Jay I. Bratt, the top counterintelligence official in the Justice Department’s National Security Division.

In 2018, she promised that 2022 would be her last year as House Democratic leader, access a term limit to quell an uprising and secure a second term as president.  In January, she announced she was running for another two-year term in the House.
With the House passing the sweeping measure to tackle climate change and prescription drug prices on Friday — “a glorious day for us,” Ms Pelosi rejoiced — and her China-defying trip to Taiwan serving cornerstone of her diplomatic career, the question of what comes next for Ms Pelosi is only intensifying.

Nearly six million people depend on the cocoa industry in the West African nation of Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest cocoa producer.  But most of them are not involved in processing the crispy, sour beans that are turned into a sweet treat.
Instead, they focus on growing, harvesting and selling raw cocoa beans to Europe and are mostly excluded from the financial benefits produced by the lucrative chocolate industry.  Foreign-made chocola…</span>

While the pandemic is ongoing, I have resumed eating carefully in restaurants.  And, in particular, I started looking again for restaurants that are as much local institutions as places to grab a bite to eat.


Most of them, perhaps all of them, will never attract the attention of Michelin Guide critics.  Their decor is generally modest, as are their prices.  But all found a magical combination of distinctive food, great service and a friendly atmosphere that gave them longevity in a business notorious for its short lifespan.

                              <span>Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles says Australia’s relationship with the United States is as good as it has ever been.

But in recent weeks, Ukraine has changed its strategy with new weaponry and has succeeded, at least for now, in slowing Russia’s advances.
Comes with a growing arsenal of western long-range weapons and aided by local fighters known as Partisans, Ukraine was able to strike Russian forces deep behind enemy lines, disrupting critical supply lines and, increasingly, hitting critical targets of combat potential. from Moscow.

The flowers that a family had brought were beginning to wilt.  The babies were crying.  The crowd was huddled in the shade, greetings and laughter alternating with silence, their excitement cut by the tension.
By the clock, the prison authorities were running late.  But Khaled Dawoud, a former detainee, was used to their ways.  By Egyptian standards, he joked, a three-hour delay to see his former cellmate and five other political prisoners released was nothing.

The translator, Hitoshi Igarashi, was stabbed to death aged 44 in July at the University of Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo, where he had been teaching comparative Islamic culture for five years.  No arrests were ever made and the crime remains unsolved.
Mr. Igarashi had translated “The Satanic Verses” for a Japanese edition which was published after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinithen supreme leader of Iran, had ordered Muslims to kill the British writer of Indian origin because of the book’s description of the Prophet Muhammad.
