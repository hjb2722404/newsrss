                              <span>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle “overestimated” the power of their brand when they left the Royal Family, writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue says.

Ms Krakue said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have “shot themselves in the foot” by cheapening their brand. 

“They were only in the Royal Family for a couple of years, they didn’t engage in that many public engagements, they didn’t really have an opportunity to be embedded in the public psyche,” she told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo. 

“I don’t think they really understood the kind of mammoth task they had to try and up their PR game and really ingratiate themselves in the public as a credible team of do-gooders.”</span>

Newsweek: Ukraine Encircling Russians in Bakhmut Day After Wagner ‘Victory’: Reports 
Ukrainian troops were able to semi-encircle the city of Bakhmut and fight Russian forces in the area, according to Hanna Maliar, the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, on Sunday. 
“The enemy failed to surround Bakhmut and they lost part of the dominant heights around the city. This means that the advance of our troops in the suburbs along the flanks, which is still ongoing, makes it very difficult for the enemy to stay in Bakhmut. Our troops took the city in a semi-encirclement, which gives us the opportunity to destroy the enemy. Therefore, the enemy [Russia] has to defend itself in the part of the city it controls,” Maliar wrote on Telegram.

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Ukraine Expands Weapons Training For Children As Bakhmut Reportedly Falls 
Only two months ago the mainstream media widely circulated a video which they said showcased &quot;shocking footage&quot; of Russian school children training with military weapons in programs designed to prepare them for the military.  The programs were widely criticized as &quot;indoctrination.&quot; 
Of course, Ukraine has also been involved in weapons training for children and these efforts have only increased in recent months as the city of Bakhmut, an epicenter of the fighting for many months, has reportedly fallen to Russia&#x27;s Wagner Group.  CNBC has briefly reported on the “Defense of Ukraine” program at the military-patriotic center for schoolchildren in Lviv.  The center was opened this month with plans to open dozens of other training facilities for children across the country in the near future.

Federal News Agency: Navy ready to start implementing fixes to notoriously slow computers 
The Navy thinks it has some answers to the “fix our computers” problem, and those answers can’t come soon enough. Officials estimate the service is losing about one man-year of productivity every single day by virtue of how long it takes employees to log into their desktops and laptops — and that figure only accounts for the service’s workforce within the five walls of the Pentagon. 
The Navy’s latest attempt to improve user experience will also start inside the Pentagon, where all of its users could start seeing major improvements by next month. That choice was made partly because, for even the most senior leaders there, the experience is far from good.

Defense News: US Navy may accelerate investments to extend some Ohio subs’ lives 
STEWART AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE, N.Y. — The U.S. Navy may begin investing in life extensions for some Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines earlier than expected, with the service secretary telling a crowd that spending could begin in fiscal 2025. 
The Navy requires at least 10 of these submarines are available for operations at any given time. These ballistic missile submarines lurk in waters around the globe with nuclear missiles onboard, their sole mission being to remain hidden and ready if called upon in a doomsday scenario. 
As a hedge against shortfalls in the 2030s as the Ohio class reaches the end of its life and the Columbia class enters service, the Navy has considered extending select Ohio boats by a few years. In November, submarine community leaders said a decision would be made by FY26 so work could start in FY29.

Defense Post: US Air Force Shoots Down Drone Swarm With THOR Microwave Weapon 
The US Air Force’s Tactical High-Power Operational Responder (THOR) microwave weapon has neutralized a swarm of drones in a recent trial. 
Conducted at the Chestnut Test Site in New Mexico, the activity simulated a real-world swarm attack on military assets. 
THOR engaged the targets and knocked them out of the sky using its non-kinetic, speed-of-light microwave pulses. 
According to THOR program manager Adrian Lucero, the weapon proved effective in neutralizing multiple targets even though it had never before been tested against the types of drones used in the trial.

Defense One: USAF Opens Bidding to Build Its 1st New Fighter in Decades 
An engineering and manufacturing development contract is to be awarded in 2024 for the secretive Next Generation Air Dominance aircraft. 
The U.S. Air Force has formally launched a competition to build its new fighter jet, the Pentagon’s first in two decades, with the winner to be selected next year.
The acquisition strategy for the Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, aircraft “incorporates lessons learned from recent Air Force acquisition programs and will leverage open architecture standards,” the Air Force said in a statement released Thursday. “This approach will enable the government to maximize competition throughout the life cycle, provide a larger, more responsive industry base, and drastically reduce maintenance and sustainment costs.”

Air Force Times: B-2 stealth bombers to return to flight after 5-month delay 
The Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bombers will resume flying May 22, following five months of safety inspections after one caught fire last December, the service confirmed Friday. 
Gen. Thomas Bussiere, the head of Air Force Global Strike Command, approved the nuclear-capable fleet’s return to normal operations on May 18, command spokesperson Brus Vidal said. 
“We successfully accomplished all necessary actions to safely return to full flight operations,” Vidal said. “Our ability to deliver nuclear deterrence and provide long-range strike was never in doubt.”

But markups at Doug Lamborn’s HASC strategic forces panel are on hold amid threats to force a U.S. default. 
Hypersonic missiles and nuclear weapons will get top priority when the House Armed Services committee’s strategic forces panel finally gets to mark up the 2024 defense-policy bill, according to the subcommittee’s chairman. 
HASC markups are on hold while GOP lawmakers seek federal budget cuts by threatening to force the U.S. renege on its debts. 
Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Republican whose district is based in Colorado Springs, said his biggest concern ahead of the markup, which was supposed to kick off on Thursday, is the top-line number. 
Lamborn said he’s “disappointed” the defense policy bill is delayed but “understands” why Congress needs to concentrate on the debt ceiling first.

Asean Briefing: ASEAN to Increase Local Currency Trade, Reducing Reliance on the US Dollar 
ASEAN members have agreed to increase the use of local currency transactions and push for a better regional payment connectivity, in a move that could be seen as a continuing shift in de-dollarization in the region. 
At the 42nd ASEAN Summit, held in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia, ASEAN members signed an agreement to push for better regional payment connectivity and the use of local currency transactions (LCT). The move is seen as the bloc’s strategy to transition away from established currencies used for trade, such as the US dollar. 
The US dollar has been king for global trade for decades. This is not only because the US is the world’s largest economy, but also because oil and most commodities are priced in US dollars. However, since the Federal Reserve embarked on its aggressive interest rate hike strategy, central banks of developing countries have been forced to raise their own interest rates to stem the sharp depreciation in their currencies.

Sixty-one percent of potential GOP primary voters in a new poll back former President Trump as he runs for the White House again in 2024, putting him more than 40 points above Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a rumored contender who hasn’t announced an official bid. 
The survey from Morning Consult found Trump leading DeSantis by 43 points, with the governor securing support from 18 percent of respondents. Trump is up 1 percentage point and DeSantis is down 1 percentage point from earlier this month, according to the tracker.

VOA/Reuters: Pope Asks Italian Cardinal to Carry Out Ukraine Peace Mission 
VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has asked Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, head of the Italian bishops&#x27; conference, to carry out a peace mission to try to help end the war in Ukraine, the Vatican said on Saturday. 
Francis first spoke cryptically of his intention to launch a mission when he was returning from a trip to Hungary last month but gave no details. 
A Vatican diplomatic source said Zuppi would try to meet separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Greece will go to the polls this Sunday with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his center-right New Democracy party fighting to hold the center of Greek and European politics as tensions flare ahead of the vote. 
&quot;Prime Minister Mitsotakis is a unique figure in world politics. He embodies a center right that seems to have faded away in Western democracy,&quot; Endy Zemenides, Executive Director of the Hellenic American Leadership Council, told Fox News Digital. &quot;His free enterprise and national security credentials wouldn’t surprise anyone, but his stances on climate change, abortion, LGBTQ rights are certainly not mirrored by the political right in other countries. Both in tone and substance he has avoided the populism that the hard right around the world uses.&quot;

Evening Standard: G7 issues condemnation of China as it intensifies response to Beijing 
The G7 issued its strongest condemnation yet of China on Saturday, criticising the country’s “economic coercion” and urged a “peaceful solution” to tensions across the Taiwan Strait. 
In a joint statement, the G7 countries said they were concerned about China’s actions in the South China Sea and that they “strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.” 
The communique, released at the start of the three-day summit in Japan, added that they were prepared to build “constructive and stable&quot; relations with Beijing while reducing their dependence on trade with the world’s second largest economy. 
The joint statement drew a quick reaction from Beijing, which complained to Japan as the summit organiser.

“Rebuilding Ukraine’s air force is going to be absolutely vital to help Ukrainians reduce the number of casualties that they take.

“And increase the amount of territory that they can take without the need to destroy the cities that they’re attacking … it’s going to be a pretty significant increase in Ukrainian military capabilities.”</span>

DW: Taiwan&#x27;s President Tsai says &#x27;war not an option&#x27; 
On the seventh anniversary of her presidential term, President Tsai Ing-wen said she would maintain peace amid rising tensions with China. Taiwan is headed for a presidential election next year.
President Tsai Ing-wen made a firm commitment Saturday to uphold the current state of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, amid rising tensions with China. 
&quot;In the face of China&#x27;s civil attacks and military threats, the people of Taiwan are calm and not aggressive, rational and not provocative,&quot; she said during a speech in the presidential office in Taipei, commemorating her seventh year in office. 
&quot;War is not an option, and neither party can unilaterally change the status quo in a non-peaceful manner,&quot; she added.

SCMP: Taiwan may pay an ‘unthinkable’ price for accepting free US weapons, says former defence minister 
Former Taiwanese defence minister Feng Shih-kuan has warned that the island will pay a price for accepting free weapons provided by the United States. 
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed recently that the Pentagon would send “additional security assistance” free of charge to the island amid escalating tensions with mainland China. 
“If you suddenly receive such free aid, you need to pay a certain unthinkable price,” Feng told reporters on Thursday when asked to comment on the plan. 
Feng, who now heads Taiwan’s Veterans Affairs Council, declined to say what that price would be.

Warning comes after Joe Biden said US would back joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots to fly fighter jets 
Providing Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be a “colossal risk” for western nations, a senior Russian minister has warned, as Washington and London reasserted their commitment to equipping the embattled nation with the military hardware it needs. 
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been pushing western allies to supply the jets for months, with Downing Street saying on Saturday that the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, had again discussed the matter with him at the G7 summit in Japan.

The sight of a tired-looking top White House domestic policy adviser in a Hiroshima hotel said it all: President Joe Biden may be on the other side of the world but his political fight back home over the debt ceiling has followed him. 
Bruce Reed, spotted in a tracksuit having a late breakfast at the luxury hotel where Biden was staying during the G7 summit, is the White House deputy chief of staff with a focus on issues inside the United States. 
Instead, for the last two days he has trailed the 80-year-old Democratic president around this southern Japanese city, &quot;updating POTUS on the status of the talks&quot;, as a senior official put it.

                              <span>Reuters: Air strikes hit Khartoum&#x27;s outskirts as Sudan&#x27;s war enters sixth week 
CAIRO/DUBAI (Reuters) -Air strikes hit outer areas of the Sudanese capital Khartoum overnight and on Saturday morning, as fighting that has trapped civilians in a humanitarian crisis and displaced more than a million entered its sixth week. 
The fighting between Sudan&#x27;s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has led to a collapse in law and order with looting that both sides blame the other for. Stocks of food, cash, and essentials are rapidly dwindling.
Air strikes were reported by eyewitnesses in southern Omdurman and northern Bahri, the two cities that lie across the Nile from Khartoum, forming Sudan&#x27;s &quot;triple capital&quot;. 
Some of the strikes took place near the state broadcaster in Omdurman, the eyewitnesses said.

El Pais: Kyiv, EU fear that US support for Ukraine will wane if counteroffensive is unsuccessful 
The Ukraine war is entering a phase that is expected to be decisive. The eyes of the world are on the imminent counteroffensive from Kyiv, which has been stockpiling NATO-supplied armaments, and Ukraine’s present and future of Ukraine will depend on what gains the armed forces are able to make in the big push. Both the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and its western allies are fully aware of this, as is the Kremlin. With the stakes so high, the European Union is concerned that if the counteroffensive fails the support of the United States — which is mired in a period of high tension in domestic politics and with the 2024 presidential elections on the horizon — will begin to wane.

WNU Editor: There has recently been a lot of specualtion on why Ukraine has not launched its much publicized spring offensive. Here are some reasons why .... Why Ukraine’s spring offensive still hasn’t begun — with summer just weeks away (AP). 
It is true that the weather has not been favourable. It is also true that about 50,000 Ukrainian soldiers are only completing their training now, and that ammo and weapons have been slow to arrive. 
But I think a lot of important points have been ignored by the West, and my list and explanations are below.

The head of Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, on Saturday claimed full control of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the focus of the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. 
Reuters could not independently confirm the claim, made by Prigozhin in a video in which he appeared in combat fatigues in front of a line of fighters holding Russian flags and Wagner banners.
&quot;Today, at 12 noon, Bakhmut was completely taken,&quot; Prigozhin said. &quot;We completely took the whole city, from house to house.&quot; 
He said that his forces would withdraw from Bakhmut from May 25 for rest and retraining, handing over control to the regular Russian army.

Reuters: Putin ally accuses U.S. of involvement in deadly attacks inside Russia 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A powerful ally of President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that the United States coordinated with Ukraine to kill two pro-war nationalists in Russia and to carry out attacks on critical national infrastructure in an effort to undermine stability. 
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year in what it called &quot;a special military operation,&quot; the Kremlin accused the West of unleashing a proxy war against it. 
Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, was killed in a car bomb in August; pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb last month; and nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bomb earlier this month. 
Russia also accused Ukraine of attacking the Crimean Bridge last October and accused the West of being behind blasts on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September.

WNU Editor: Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev is, IMHO, the second most powerful leader in Russia after Putin. 
He has just publicly accused the U.S. of waging war inside Russia.

                              <span>RT:  ‘Radioactive cloud’ threatening western Europe – Russian security chief

 
The hazard was produced by depleted uranium munitions destroyed in Ukraine, Nikolay Patrushev has claimed  
The destruction of depleted uranium shells in Ukraine has produced a radioactive cloud which has been blown toward Western Europe, the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, has claimed. 
The UK has supplied this type of munition to Ukraine to be fired from British-made Challenger tanks.

The senior official revealed the purported threat during a government meeting on Friday, in which he accused the US of manipulating its allies to provide “help” to other nations that results in harm being done to the recipients. 
“They ‘helped’ Ukraine this way too, applied pressure to its satellites to supply depleted uranium munitions. Their destruction resulted in a radioactive cloud moving towards Western Europe. They have detected an increase in radiation in Poland,” Patrushev stated.

WNU Editor: You would think that after Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolay Patrushev issued this nuclear warning there will be an official and public reaction to it. 
But as of this posting there has been no comment from any Western official. Zero coverage from the Western media. And no comment from the Ukraine government. 
But on Ukraine social media it is a different story. 
Many are worried and are pressing the Kyiv government to provide more information and assurances that there is no need for concern.</span>

Reuters: Putin: West trying to break Russia up 
Putin said the more sanctions the West hits Russia with, the greater the level of cohesion within Russian society. 
The Russian president was speaking via video link at a meeting or Russia&#x27;s Council on Interethnic relations. 
 Putin&#x27;s remarks came on the day that leaders of the world&#x27;s richest democracies agreed to stiffen sanctions against Russia.

CNN: Biden tells G7 allies the US will support joint F-16 training effort for Ukrainians 
President Joe Biden informed G7 leaders on Friday that the US will support a joint effort with allies and partners to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16s, a senior administration official tells CNN.
The training is not expected to happen in the US, the official said, and will likely happen entirely in Europe. But US personnel will participate in the training alongside allies and partners in Europe, the official said. It is expected to take several months to complete and the official said the hope is it will begin “in the coming weeks.” 
The decision marks a stark turnaround for Biden, who said earlier this year that he did not believe that Ukraine needed the F-16s. The decision to support the training initiative came together very quickly, officials said, and was made by Biden following meetings with G7 leaders in Hiroshima, Japan, where the topic of F-16s to Ukraine was a key point of discussion.

It is now poised to spread its influence beyond the sparsely populated region near Madrid, with the party set to make gains in regional and local elections on May 28.
Surveys suggest the main opposition conservative Popular Party (PP) could need the support of Vox to govern in half of the 12 regions casting ballots, just as it did in Castilla y Leon last year.
Polls also indicate the PP is on track to win a year-end general election but will need Vox to form a working majority and oust Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez&#x27;s coalition government from office.

Majid Kazemi, Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaghoubi were found guilty of &quot;moharebeh&quot; -- or waging &quot;war against God&quot; -- for shooting dead three members of the security forces at a demonstration in the central city of Isfahan on November 16, the judiciary&#x27;s Mizan Online news website said.
Iran witnessed waves of nationwide protests following the September 16 death of 22-year-old Amini, an Iranian Kurd who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the Islamic republic&#x27;s strict dress rules for women.

Rourke died &quot;after a lengthy illness with pancreatic cancer&quot;, the Smiths lead guitarist and co-founder said.
&quot;Andy will always be remembered as a kind and beautiful soul by everyone who knew him, and as a supremely gifted musician by people who love music,&quot; Marr wrote on Instagram.
Along with drummer Mike Joyce, Rourke provided a whip-tight rhythm section underlying Marr&#x27;s pioneering chords and co-founder Morrissey&#x27;s mordant lyrics as the Smiths became one of Britain&#x27;s best-loved bands in the 1980s.

Mocha brought lashing rain and winds of 195 kilometers per hour (120 miles per hour) to Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh on Sunday, collapsing buildings and turning streets into rivers.
The storm churned up villages, uprooted trees and knocked out communications across much of Myanmar&#x27;s Rakhine State.

HIROSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) -Group of Seven (G7) leaders laid wreaths in the Japanese city of Hiroshima on Friday, almost 78 years after it was attacked with a nuclear bomb, in a sombre start of a summit expected to put more sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Hiroshima&#x27;s legacy as the first place ever to be attacked with a nuclear weapon has taken on a more urgency following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s talk of his readiness to use nuclear arms.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will travel to Japan to join the leaders of the world&#x27;s advanced democracies at their Hiroshima summit, a European Union source said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea accused the U.S. and South Korea of ramping up &quot;nuclear blackmail&quot; with joint military drills, pledging to take corresponding action against what it called &quot;warmongers&#x27; madness,&quot; state media KCNA said on Friday.
U.S. and South Korean forces have been staging an intensified series of annual springtime exercises since March, including air and sea drills involving a U.S. aircraft carrier and heavy bombers.
North Korea has reacted angrily to the exercises, calling them a rehearsal for invasion.
&quot;Their plot to crush us militarily is another clear indication that the enemy warmongers&#x27; madness has reached a point where it cannot be overlooked,&quot; KCNA said. &quot;The frantic nuclear war fuss among U.S. and puppet warlike bellwethers is bound to trigger corresponding responses&quot;.
Pyongyang would continue to develop its weapons programmes, KCNA said, calling it a &quot;legitimate right of a sovereign state to have more powerful means of self-defence&quot; to fend off &quot;serious situations and prospective threats&quot;.
North Korea has been stepping up military activity in recent months, unveiling designs for new, smaller nuclear warheads, firing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. and testing what it called a nuclear-capable underwater attack drone.
This week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a military satellite station, saying successfully launching a spy satellite is an &quot;urgent requirement of the prevailing security environment&quot;.
Kim has said he prioritised a spy satellite programme as part of efforts to advance surveillance technology to improve the country&#x27;s ability to strike targets in a crisis.
The reclusive country in December conducted what it called an important &quot;final phase&quot; test for a spy satellite and said it would complete preparations for the launch by April.

                              <span>Roger Ailes before his death told his wife that Rupert Murdoch’s two sons sought his ouster and wanted to turn Fox News into a centrist or even liberal outlet, Elizabeth Ailes said Thursday during an appearance on Newsmax.
“Roger made running Fox News look easy, and as you know, it was anything but,” she told Newsmax host Eric Bolling.
“Rupert has the checkbook, he has money, but he couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to Roger in terms of genius, and the ideas that Roger put forth back in &#x27;96,” she said, noting that it was her late husband who developed the the right-wing network’s “fair and balanced” and “we report, you decide” slogans.
“That was a challenge to the establishment mainstream media who thought that just because they said they were objective people we would take them at their word, and we all know that they were very liberal all that time.” 
The former Fox News CEO’s wife claims that Murdoch’s sons, Lachlan and James, played a role in Ailes’ ouster from the company.
Roger Ailes left Fox News in July 2016 amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations by subordinates including Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. 
“My thought is that I go back to July 2016 when events unfolded, and after 20 years of running the channel and turning it into a $20 billion asset, throwing off $2 billion in profits, the sons Lachlan and James had decided that they wanted Roger gone,” she said.
“Roger said to me, these useless kids tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber are going to ruin the channel and turn it into CNN and that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening,&quot; she added.

The parade is the main celebration on Jerusalem Day, when Israel marks its capture of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The event has become a show of force for Jewish nationalists and, for Palestinians, a blatant provocation meant to undermine their ties to the city.

                              <span>By Gloria Dickie LONDON (Reuters) - More than half of the world&#x27;s large lakes and reservoirs have shrunk since the early 1990s, chiefly because of climate change, intensifying concerns about water for agriculture, hydropower and human consumption, a study published on Thursday found. A team of international researchers reported that some of the world&#x27;s most important freshwater sources - from the Caspian Sea between Europe and Asia to South America&#x27;s Lake Titicaca - lost water at a cumulative rate of around 22 gigatonnes per year for nearly three decades.

                              <span>Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Thursday retracted his claim that four Indigenous children missing for more than two weeks after an airplane crash in the Amazon had been found alive.
Writing on Twitter, Petro said he had deleted his tweet from Wednesday night in which he had announced the rescue of the four children, including an 11-month-old baby.
&quot;I am sorry for what happened. The military forces and Indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for,&quot; he said in his retraction.
More than 100 soldiers have been deployed with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, leaving three adults including the pilot and the children&#x27;s mother dead.
Rescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old include a 13, nine and four-year-old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.
&quot;At this time there is no other priority other than progressing with the search until finding them,&quot; added Petro. &quot;The children&#x27;s lives are the most important thing.&quot;
Petro&#x27;s stunning announcement on Wednesday had been met with uncertainty as he gave no details about where or how the children had been rescued, nor how they had survived alone in the jungle.
Amid widespread confusion, the military has not confirmed any rescue.
Avianline Charters, owner of the crashed aircraft, had previously said that one of its pilots in the search area was told the children had been found and that they &quot;were being transported by boat downriver and that they were all alive.&quot;
But the company also said that &quot;there has been no official confirmation&quot; that the children were out of danger, and thunderstorms posed a risk to them reaching safety.
Petro said on Thursday that the news of the supposed rescue had been provided by the government&#x27;s Institute of Family Welfare.

                              <span>British musician Sting warned against songs written by artificial intelligence in an interview with the BBC published Thursday, urging caution about the technology.
The 71-year-old former frontman of The Police said, &quot;The building blocks of music belong to us, to human beings.&quot;
&quot;That&#x27;s going to be a battle we all have to fight in the next couple of years: Defending our human capital against AI,&quot; he said.
The use of AI in music is the subject of debate in the industry, with some denouncing copyright abuses and others praising its prowess.
AI technology was used to imitate Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd in a song released last month called &quot;Heart On My Sleeve&quot;.
The viral track was briefly available on music streaming platforms before it was pulled following a copyright complaint from Universal Music Group, which publishes both artists through a subsidiary.
David Guetta meanwhile recently used AI to add a vocal in the style of rapper Eminem to a song for a live show.
But the French producer said he will not release it commercially.
&quot;The tools are useful, but we have to be driving them,&quot; Sting said.
&quot;I don&#x27;t think we can allow the machines to just take over. We have to be wary,&quot; he added.
Sting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;.
He then forged a solo career with classics such as &quot;Englishman in New York&quot;, &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; and &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot;.

                              <span>Hong Kong must not &quot;recommend books with unhealthy ideas&quot;, the city&#x27;s leader John Lee said on Thursday, following the removal of library books related to the deadly Tiananmen Square crackdown and other political issues.
The finance hub has undergone huge legal and political changes since Beijing imposed a national security law on the territory in 2020, silencing dissent following massive, and at times violent, pro-democracy protests the year before.
The latest measure comes after a prominent political cartoonist -- whose work often satirized Hong Kong&#x27;s relationship with mainland China -- was suspended indefinitely from publishing in a mainstream newspaper, and his books were removed from the city&#x27;s libraries over the past week.
The flash removal prompted Hong Kong journalists to comb the …</span>

However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat&#x27;s determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.
The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.
Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.

                              <span>A Hebrew Bible more than 1,000 years old sold for $38.1 million in New York on Wednesday, setting a record for the most valuable manuscript ever sold at auction.
It was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s following a four-minute bidding battle between two bidders, the auction house said in a statement.
The Bible was bought by former US diplomat Alfred Moses on behalf of an American nonprofit that will gift it to the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel, Sotheby&#x27;s said.
&quot;The Hebrew Bible is the most influential book in history and constitutes the bedrock of Western civilization. I rejoice in knowing that it belongs to the Jewish People,&quot; said Moses, an ambassador under president Bill Clinton.
The sale surpassed the $30.8 million that Microsoft founder Bill Gates paid for Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Co…</span>

The defense ministry said Russian forces had launched 30 cruise missiles from land, sea and air, targeting several regions and killing one person in Odesa.
The military said its air defense units had destroyed 29 of the cruise missiles and shot down four drones.
&quot;A series of air attacks on Kyiv, unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety, is continuing,&quot; said Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv&#x27;s civil and military administration.
The attack follows other recent barrages in which Ukraine claimed to have downed several advanced Russian Kinzhal missiles.

XIAN, China (Reuters) - Central Asian heads of state converged in China&#x27;s historic city of Xian on Thursday for one-on-ones with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seal pledges of &quot;enduring&quot; friendship, and paving the way for a summit expected to result in a regional pact with Beijing.
The bilateral talks will set the stage for a group meeting on Friday, the first in-person gathering of the six leaders, where Xi will deliver an &quot;important&quot; speech and an &quot;important&quot; political document will be signed, China&#x27;s foreign ministry has said.
Across the Silk Road city of Xian, banners, billboards and even taxi signs were set up to promote the summit, with some in both Chinese and Russian.

                              <span>Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso has dissolved the country&#x27;s parliament in the middle of impeachment proceedings against him.
Lasso&#x27;s office said in a statement on Wednesday that the president would rule by decree until new parliamentary elections are held.
A date for new elections would be set within a week, according to the statement.
&quot;It is impossible to solve the challenges with a parliament whose goal is to destabilize the country,&quot; Lasso said in a televised address. &quot;I have to give an answer to the political crisis. Ecuador needs a new political and social pact.&quot;
Lasso is accused of knowing about unfavourable contracts between the state oil transport company Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana and the private shipping company Amazonas Tankers, but doing nothing to modify or terminate the deals after taking office.
The unfavorable contracts are said to have cost the Ecuadorian state several million dollars.
Lasso on Tuesday rejected allegations of embezzlement that have been levelled against him in parliament.

Speaking to reporters a day after the premiere of his new film &quot;Jeanne du Barry&quot; on the festival&#x27;s opening night, he said he did not care about being boycotted by Hollywood.
&quot;Do I feel boycotted now? No &#x27;coz I don&#x27;t think about Hollywood, I don&#x27;t have much need for Hollywood,&quot; said the actor.
&quot;It&#x27;s a very strange, funny time where everyone must fall into line,&quot; he added. &quot;If you want to live that kind of life, I wish you the best. I&#x27;ll be on the other side.&quot;
Depp lost his part in the Harry Potter spin-off &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; films after his ex-wife Amber Heard accused him of domestic abuse.

Launched by the NGO Gromo, which advocates LGBT rights in Abidjan, the magazine promotes gay icons and highlights the community’s culture, history and victories.
The magazine’s publication would represent a step forward for a continent where some 33 countries still have laws on the books criminaliaing same-sex relations.

The incident was reminiscent of the death of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a crash in 1997 as she was chased by photographers in Paris. 
&quot;This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,&quot; Harry’s spokesperson told Sky News.
The chase happened after the couple left an awards ceremony, Sky reported.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
