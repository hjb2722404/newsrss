Niger’s President Mohamed Bazoum has reportedly been seized by members of the presidential guard, leading to a protest in the capital and triggering warnings from regional powers a coup is underway. 
The country’s interior minister, Hamadou Souley, was arrested by the presidential guard on Wednesday morning local time and is being held in the presidential palace in the capital Niamey along with Bazoum, a journalist on the ground, who spoke to the minister, confirmed to CNN. 
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said there had been an “attempt to seize power by force” in the West African country, in a statement on Wednesday.

The top leadership of the US Government is extremely old -- they stay around forever, clinging to power as tightly as they can, petrified to give it up -- and so we have more and more upsetting scenes like this.

                              <span>Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: RFK Jr. Maintains Highest Favorability Rating Among Presidential Candidates In New Poll

 
Days after a House hearing on censorship that saw Democrats attempt to prevent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from testifying, a new Harvard-Harris poll showed that he has a higher favorability rating than any other presidential candidate. 
Mr. Kennedy has a net favorable rating of 47 percent and a net unfavorable mark of 26 percent according to the survey, which was released on July 23 and conducted from July 19 to July 20 among 2,068 registered voters (pdf). 
Poll respondents said that former President Donald Trump has a favorability rating of 45 percent compared to a 49 percent unfavorability number. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has a 40 percent favorable rating and 37 percent unfavorable, and President Joe Biden has 39 percent favorable and 53 percent unfavorable rating, also lagging behind Mr. Kennedy. 
Mr. Trump would win the Republican primary and defeat Mr. Biden in a general election, according to the survey, with a 45 percent to 40 percent margin.

* Hunter&#x27;s court appearance spiraled into chaos after first plea deal fell apart 
* U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned the terms of the agreement 
* New compromise hashed out means Hunter is still on the hook for more crimes 
Hunter Biden has unexpectedly pleaded not guilty to tax and gun crimes after his &#x27;sweetheart&#x27; plea deal collapsed in a sensational court hearing. 
The scandal-hit first son is also still on the hook for any crimes linked to foreign deals with China and Ukraine after the judge dramatically rejected the first agreement that would have shielded him from future charges and seen him avoid jail. 
Hunter had arrived at federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, expecting to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and walk away with a slap on the wrist.

WNU Editor: It looks like Hunter Biden&#x27;s attorneys were hoping to have immunity for their client from future charges on other manners. The judge was not buying that, nor the refusal from prosecutors to answer the judge&#x27;s question on what those other charges are.

                              <span>CNN: Taiwan’s main airport becomes battleground for simulated Chinese invasion 
Taoyuan, Taiwan CNN  — Taiwan’s Taoyuan International Airport became the scene of a simulated Chinese invasion on Wednesday for the first time ever as the island’s military conducted an anti-takeover drill to fend off any possible attack from Beijing. 
The drill was designed to test the Taiwanese military’s cross-branch coordination and emergency response capabilities during a simulated Chinese invasion, the Ministry of National Defense previously said. 
With military helicopters in the sky and soldiers on the tarmac, the drill at Taiwan’s busiest international gateway reflects how Taipei is preparing for multiple scenarios in the face of fears over China’s increased military intimidation – concerns which have amplified since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began last year.

                              <span>Reuters: Blinken criticises China&#x27;s &#x27;problematic behaviour&#x27; during visit to Tonga 
WELLINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State warned of China&#x27;s &quot;problematic behaviour&quot; during a visit to the Pacific island nation of Tonga on Wednesday, citing Beijing&#x27;s militarisation of the South China Sea and what he called economic coercion. 
China’s growing presence in the region, which saw it sign a security pact with the Solomon Islands last year, has fuelled concern in the U.S. and Australia about Beijing’s ambitions, and prompted increased Western aid and engagement. 
Blinken said at a press conference that the U.S. had no objection to China&#x27;s engagement with the region but there were concerns that its investments needed to be transparent and undertaken with sustainable finance.

Swiss Info: Zelensky showing ‘authoritarian traits’, says Swiss intelligence report 
Ukraine is at a “critical point” in its democratic evolution as it heads towards presidential elections in 2024, says a confidential assessment by the Federal Intelligence Service. 
The assessment, written in the wake of the attempted mutiny in Russia by the Wagner mercenary group and seen by the newspaper NZZ am Sonntag, claims that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is attempting to politically eliminate his biggest rival, Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko, ahead of next year’s election. The claim, it added, is based on “credible intelligence.” 
&quot;In his attempt to eliminate Klitschko politically, Zelensky is showing authoritarian traits,” write the report’s authors. &quot;It is very likely that Western states will exert pressure on the president and his entourage in this regard.&quot;

WNU Editor: President Zelensky has banned all major opposition parties and some of its leaders are in jail. There are also media restrictions that can result in journalists and bloggers going to jail (i.e. Gonzala Lira). If that is not an &quot;authoritarian trait&quot;, then I do not know what is.

 
Update: Some Europeans are beginning to point this out (see tweet below).

New York Times: ‘They Shoot Without Stopping:’ Where Russia Is on the Attack in Ukraine 
Three Russian attack helicopters swooped in low over the city of Kreminna, strafing Ukrainian frontline positions just outside the city. Russian drones circled overhead while Moscow’s ground forces fired heavy machine guns to flush out Ukrainians from foxholes hidden in the dappled light of the pine forest. 
As exploding artillery shells shook the ground around him on Saturday morning, Vlad, a 27-year-old Ukrainian drone operator, spotted a Russian armored personnel carrier bringing more troops to the battle. It was a possible prelude, he said, to another assault. 
“They are constantly attacking us,” said Lt. Col. Matviychuk Oleh, a 49-year-old battalion commander with Ukraine’s 100th Territorial Defense Brigade. “They are looking for a weak place and then they storm.”

WNU Editor: This report makes the New York Times the first major Western news outlet yo admit that there is a major Russian counteroffensive in northeast Ukraine. WNU has been reporting on this offensive for the past few days. 
And while the New York Times is saying that Russian advances are minor and being accomplished at great costs, I am reading reports frm sources that I trust that the Ukraine front-lines along this part of the front have collapsed, the Ukraine army is withdrawing, and that in some cases Russian forces have advanced over 10km along a major section of the front. 
This is the first major Russian offensive since the start of the war. It involves over 100,000 soldiers, heavily backed by armor and air superiority. 
Here is an easy prediction. I expect more Western coverage in the coming days.</span>

                              <span>Zero Hedge: In &quot;Victory&quot; For Moscow, Russia Defies Sanctions By Selling Oil Above Western Price Cap 
Two weeks ago we reported that with a barrel of Urals about to rise above $60, the &quot;Russian oil price at key port was about to breach sanctions cap&quot;, which - if the sanctions were strenuously enforced - meant that there would be a sharp drop in supply. 
Fast forward to today when, as the WSJ reported, the price of Russia&#x27;s most coveted crude finally traded above the western price cap imposed to starve Moscow of funds for the war in Ukraine (but not really, because starving the world of Russian oil has long been viewed as a far more dangerous outcome), resulting in a very distinct &quot;victory&quot; for Moscow in the &quot;fight for influence over global oil markets.&quot; 
It is the first time that the price for its flagship Urals grade of oil has breached the $60-a-barrel limit since the U.S. and its allies introduced the novel sanctions policy last December, according to commodities-data firm Argus Media, and - as the WSJ clarifies - it is a sign that the Kremlin has succeeded, at least in part, in adjusting to the restrictions.

WNU Editor: There is an expectation that both China and India will be consuming an extra 2-3 million barrels of oil by the end of this year. That alone is going to raise the price of oil significantly, and it will provide more opportunities for Russia to sell its oil at a price significantly above the price cap of $60/barrel.

Below is my column in the New York Post on the last ditch effort of the members of Congress and the media to get the public to just “move on” from the Biden corruption scandal. 
The message has been clear and amplified, as former U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) insisted on MSNBC, “Everybody needs to back off!” As evidence and public interest increase, it is a bit late for spin or shiny objects. This week, the scandal is likely to be even more serious for the Bidens and the country. The media is increasingly taking on the appearance of Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun yelling that there is “nothing to see here” in front of a virtual apocalyptic scene of fire and destruction.

WNU Editor: Jonathan Turley is always a good read. Especially when it comes to commentary on US law.

My sister-in-law lives in the Bay area, and she and her neighbors are die-hard supporters of President Biden and the Democrat Party. And she and her neighbors put their money where their mouth is. The money that she has given, with my brother&#x27;s support, to Democrats over the years has been eye-watering. 
But when I was talking to her last week, she wanted affirmation from me that Biden&#x27;s scandals are just the Republicans being political, and there is really no substance to them. 
LOL! 
When your die-hard supporters need to call others to be convinced that the person they are supporting is not the person that the critics are saying .... sighhh .... for a politician that is the kiss of death. 
As for my sister-in-law. I told her that what we are seeing and what we know is just the tip of the iceberg.</span>

LONDON — When Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, launched his attempted mutiny on the morning of June 24, Vladimir Putin was paralyzed and unable to act decisively, according to Ukrainian and other security officials in Europe. No orders were issued for most of the day, the officials said. 
The Russian president had been warned by the Russian security services at least two or three days ahead of time that Prigozhin was preparing a possible rebellion, according to intelligence assessments shared with The Washington Post.

Bottom line. 
If Ukraine&#x27;s defenses in the northeast of the country are as week as many Russian and Ukrainian bloggers are claiming, and if the Russian advances in the northeast of the country are accurate, Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive in the southern part of the country will probably come to an end.</span>

The United States on Tuesday announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine featuring ammunition for artillery and air defense systems. 
The announcement on the aid -- which will be drawn from US military stocks -- comes as Ukrainian troops press ahead with a slow-moving counteroffensive against invading Russian forces. 
The package includes munitions for both Patriot and NASAMs air defense systems as well as Stinger missiles, 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, 32 Stryker armored personnel carriers, and more than 28 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades, the Pentagon said in a statement.

                              <span>Reuters: US military aid for Ukraine for first time includes Black Hornet spy drone 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Defense announced $400 million in additional security assistance for Ukraine on Tuesday, including air defense missiles, armored vehicles and small drones, as Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive against Russia grinds on. 
The new aid package, which was first reported by Reuters, will include for the first time U.S. furnished Black Hornet surveillance drones made by Teledyne FLIR Defense, part of Teledyne Technologies. 
The Norwegian-built Hornet is being used in Ukraine through donations by the British and Norwegian governments, the company said. FLIR Unmanned Aerial Systems was awarded a $93 million contract in April to provide the small reconnaissance drones to the U.S. Army.

Nonprofit stepped in to pay $60,000 to move Sgt Nicole Gee&#x27;s remains to Arlington National Cemetery 
A Republican lawmaker is sounding the alarm after being notified that one of the 13 Gold Star families from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was forced to pay to move the body of their loved one. 
Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., who is an Army veteran, told Fox News Digital that during a meeting with the families of the &quot;Fallen 13&quot; last week, he was &quot;enraged to learn that the Department of Defense had placed a heavy financial burden&quot; on the family of Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, who were forced to find funding in the thousands to move her body to its final resting place after her 2021 death in Afghanistan. 
The Gee family secured the funding, which came to &quot;a staggering $60,000,&quot; to move their loved one&#x27;s body after a nonprofit organization stepped in to cover the cost, Mills said.

Messenger: Freed in Russia Prisoner Swap, US Marine Injured Fighting in Ukraine (Exclusive)

 
US officials are frustrated that Trevor Reed went to Ukraine after the efforts made to bring him home from Russia 
A Marine veteran who was freed from Russia in a 2022 prisoner exchange has volunteered to fight for Ukraine and is now asking for U.S. government help after sustaining injuries on the battlefield, The Messenger has learned. 
Trevor Reed was wounded after stepping on a landmine roughly two weeks ago, according to two U.S. military officials who were briefed on the events. Reed had spent more than two years in Russian custody before winning his freedom in April 2022. 
The officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to Defense Department regulations, said they did not know the extent of Reed’s injuries but said he had suffered shrapnel wounds from the explosion. One of the sources said Reed was being treated in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and had requested transfer to an American military facility in either Germany or Poland.

* Qin Gang, 57, made his last public appearance in Beijing on June 25, when he held talks with counterparts from Vietnam, Sri Lanka and key trade partner Russia. 
* He progressively rose up the ranks of Beijing’s diplomatic service, including a two-year stint as ambassador to the United States, before being promoted to lead the foreign ministry in December. 
Xi Jinping’s Beijing administration appointed China’s top diplomat Wang Yi to replace Qin Gang as foreign minister, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported Tuesday, after the latter’s one-month absence. 
 No reason was given for the dismissal.

AFP: UN talks seek to fix &#x27;broken&#x27; global food system 
A three-day United Nations summit opened in Rome on Monday aimed at tackling a &quot;broken&quot; global food system where millions are starving, two billion are overweight or obese and the planet is suffering. 
The food systems summit comes amid growing food insecurity around the world, with UN agencies warning of an increasing number of people suffering from chronic hunger. 
&quot;In a world of plenty, it is outrageous that people continue to suffer and die from hunger,&quot; UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the opening of the meeting. 
&quot;Global food systems are broken -- and billions of people are paying the price.&quot;

ABC News Australia: The behind-the-scenes story of the mysterious &#x27;nuclear football&#x27; that follows the US president everywhere 
The heavy black bag that follows the US president&#x27;s every step, commonly nicknamed the &quot;nuclear football&quot; has been shrouded in secrecy for decades. 
But the most important — and mysterious — &quot;football&quot; in the world isn&#x27;t really a football at all. 
Officially called the &quot;Presidential Emergency Satchel&quot;, the nuclear football is a bulky briefcase that contains atomic war plans and enables the president to transmit nuclear orders to the Pentagon. 
The heavy case is carried by a military officer who is never far behind the president. 
But apart from sightings as the commander-in-chief boards a helicopter or exits meetings with world leaders, many details of the case remain classified.

Business Insider: Air forces are ditching runways to prepare their jets to keep operating when enemies aim for their bases 
* The British air force plans to operate its Typhoon and F-35B jets on highways in the next year. 
* It is meant to be a test of the British air force&#x27;s ability to operate away from its main bases. 
* Many militaries use highways as runways, and it&#x27;s getting new interest as threats to airbases grow. 
The war in Ukraine has reinforced many things that militaries knew about major conflicts. One of the most important is that air power is vital to ensuring ground forces survive and advance. 
But sustaining power in the air requires having places where jets and helicopters can land, refuel, and rearm. On a modern battlefield, where long-range weapons can reach far behind the frontlines and drones constantly roam overhead, protecting aircraft from the enemy is hard. 
So Western air forces are increasingly focused on dispersing their operations. One way to do that is by using highway networks to land, refit, and take off before the enemy catches up.

WNU Editor: In a major conflict all major airfields will be a target. If you want a functional air force you will need to disperse your forces. I suspect this is what Ukraine has done with what remains of its air force.</span>

KYIV (Reuters) -Russia destroyed Ukrainian grain warehouses on the Danube River and wounded seven people in a drone attack on Monday, expanding the target area of an air campaign it launched last week after pulling out of the Black Sea grain deal, Kyiv said. 
The attacks last week mostly targeted the sea ports of Odesa but Monday&#x27;s pre-dawn strikes hit infrastructure along the Danube, an alternative export route that is vital for Kyiv after the demise of the year-old deal allowing safe exports of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea.

                              <span>Wall Street Journal: Chinese Money Flees the Western World 
Just a few years ago, Chinese money was rippling across the rich world. Chinese investors were making blockbuster deals and snapping up trophy assets, from luxury homes and five-star hotels in New York to a Swiss chemical company and a German robotics giant. 
That era is over. 
Chinese investment is retreating from the West as hostility to Chinese capital has grown. Increasingly, Chinese companies are instead spending money on factories in Southeast Asia and mining and energy projects in Asia, the Middle East and South America, as Beijing seeks to cement alliances in those places and secure access to critical resources. 
The biggest recipient of Chinese investment so far this year is nickel-rich Indonesia, according to a preliminary estimate of Chinese investments compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Nickel is a key component in many of the batteries used to power electric vehicles.

Politico: China secretly sends enough gear to Russia to equip an army

 
Shipments of military-capable hardware expose a China-sized loophole in Western sanctions. 
The pictures posted on the Chinese company’s website show a tall, Caucasian man with a crew cut and flattened nose inspecting body armor at its factory.
“This spring, one of our customers came to our company to confirm the style and quantity of bulletproof vests, and carefully tested the quality of our vests,” Shanghai H Win, a manufacturer of military-grade protective gear, proudly reported on its website in March. The customer “immediately directly confirmed the order quantity of bulletproof vests and subsequent purchase intention.” 
The identity of the smiling customer isn’t clear, but there’s a fair chance he was Russian: According to customs records obtained by POLITICO, Russian buyers have declared orders for hundreds of thousands of bulletproof vests and helmets made by Shanghai H Win — the items listed in the documents match those in the company’s online catalog.

(Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Monday that it had found traces of explosives on a ship travelling from Turkey to the port of Rostov-on-Don in Russia to pick up grain. 
The FSB said the ship had been docked in the Ukrainian port of Kiliia in May, and that it may have been used to deliver explosives to Ukraine.
It said the ship had changed its name while in the Turkish port of Tuzla earlier this month and replaced its crew, which had consisted of 12 Ukrainian nationals.

                              <span>CNBC: Goldman Sachs expects ‘all time high’ oil demand to spur large deficits, boosting prices 
* Goldman Sachs forecasts “all-time high” demand in oil markets leading to a “sizeable deficit.” 
* The investment bank projects Brent crude to rise from just above $80 per barrel now to $86 per barrel by year end. 
Goldman Sachs expects record demand in oil markets to drive crude prices higher in the near term. 
“We expect pretty sizable deficits in the second half with deficits of almost 2 million barrels per day in the third quarter as demand reaches an all-time high,” Goldman’s head of oil research Daan Struyven told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Monday. 
He added that the bank forecasts Brent crude to rise from just above $80 per barrel now to $86 per barrel by year-end.

A “conversation has commenced” with North Korea over US Army Pvt. Travis King, who crossed the border between North and South Korea last week in the demilitarized zone separating the two nations, the deputy commander of the United Nations Command (UNC) said Monday.
King, believed to be the first US soldier to cross into North Korea since 1982, had a history of assault, was facing disciplinary action over his conduct and was meant to go back to the US the day before the incident.

Soldiers tell Sky News how they have discovered mines and booby traps hidden in doors and in the magazines of automatic weapons - and even attached to dead bodies. 
For the members of the demining unit in Ukraine&#x27;s 35th marine brigade, every step is fraught with peril - every action is beset with risk - during a period that has been particularly dangerous. 
As the Ukrainians press ahead with their summer offensive, the Russians have countered with Soviet-era tactics. 
They have laid millions and millions of landmines.

Territory and communities along the 1,000km (621 mile) frontier have been saturated with anti-personnel mines, anti-vehicle and anti-tank mines, and remotely-detonated mines.

                              <span>Reuters: Sudan war enters 100th day as mediation attempts fail 
(Reuters) -Clashes flared in parts of Sudan on the 100th day of the war on Sunday as mediation attempts by regional and international powers failed to find a path out of an increasingly intractable conflict. 
The fighting broke out on April 15 as the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) vied for power. 
Since then, more than 3 million people have been uprooted, including more than 700,000 who have fled to neighbouring countries. Some 1,136 people have been killed, according to the health ministry, though officials believe the number is higher. 
Neither the army nor the RSF has been able to claim victory, with the RSF&#x27;s domination on the ground in the capital Khartoum up against the army&#x27;s air and artillery firepower.

No casualties were reported, Russian officials said. 
Several drone attacks struck Crimea and Moscow overnight, causing the evacuation of several villages in the Russian-occupied peninsula and damaging buildings in the vicinity of the defense ministry in the Russian capital, Russian officials said Monday. 
“Drone strikes on two non-residential buildings were recorded at around four o’clock this morning,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in the early hours of Monday, adding there had been “no serious damage or casualties.” 
“Two Ukrainian UAVs were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed” over Moscow, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement, accusing Kyiv of being responsible for the attack.

Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
&quot;We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars,&quot; he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a &quot;wokeness problem,&quot; Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
&quot;What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?&quot;

The fire started early in the morning near the village of Puntagorda in the north-west of the Canary Island. A lasting drought and high winds meant the fire spread quickly, according to the mayor of the village, Vicente Rodríguez, who spoke to state television broadcaster RTVE. 
Firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames as the wind kept changing direction. At least 11 houses burned down and an area of about 140 hectares was destroyed.</span>

South Korea is at the peak of its summer monsoon season and there has been heavy rainfall for the last three days, triggering widespread flooding and landslides, and causing a major dam to overflow.
The interior ministry reported that 22 people had been killed and another 14 were missing in the heavy downpours, mostly buried by landslides or after falling into a flooded reservoir.
The majority of the casualties -- including 16 dead and nine missing -- come from North Gyeongsang province, largely due to massive landslides in the mountainous area that engulfed houses with people inside.

                              <span>The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of &quot;permanent, irreversible harm&quot; to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister&#x27;s granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps&#x27; successor Mark Harper said he was &quot;satisfied&quot; that the project&#x27;s &quot;harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits&quot;.
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
&quot;This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it&#x27;s not over yet,&quot; Gooding said.

The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a &quot;sexual bully&quot; who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men&#x27;s crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…</span>

The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia&#x27;s military campaign in Ukraine.
&quot;I feel total despair,&quot; said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
&quot;If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned,&quot; he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil&#x27;s impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.

                              <span>The Athens Acropolis, Greece&#x27;s top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening &quot;to protect workers and visitors&quot;, Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
&quot;It&#x27;s highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.</span>

                              <span>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
&quot;Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;He needs to lift the holdings,&quot; said Austin. &quot;This is a national security issue, a readiness issue.&quot;
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin&#x27;s call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
&quot;Is that something you&#x27;re willing to deal with, negotiate?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that&#x27;s an important policy,&quot; said Austin. &quot;I think our troops don&#x27;t get to choose where they&#x27;re assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I&#x27;m proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.&quot;
&quot;So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;That&#x27;s our policy,&quot; said Austin.

President Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s greenlight, which ended more than a year of opposition to Sweden&#x27;s membership bid, came as a surprise even to allies at home who had supported him in demanding Stockholm first take steps against groups deemed terrorists by Ankara.

This comes as President Joe Biden, who has already declared his confidence that Ukraine will be triumphant over the Kremlin invasion, proclaimed that they already have at a summit in Helsinki, during celebrations about Finland&#x27;s admission into NATO.
&quot;Put on your CIA director cap for a moment,&quot; said Tapper. &quot;What do you think went through Putin&#x27;s mind today when President Biden declared that Putin has already lost the war?&quot;

                              <span>The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been &quot;eaten alive.&quot;
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates &quot;do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.&quot; 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,&quot; she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson&#x27;s death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a &quot;racial justice issue,&quot; citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was &quot;almost completely detached from the base of his neck.&quot; The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use &quot;new plates and fixations in the damaged area.&quot; 
&quot;Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room,&quot; Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
&quot;The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing,&quot; Einav said.</span>

                              <span>Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denied any &quot;aggressive&quot; behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to &quot;come off the road&quot;.
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said &quot;it didn&#x27;t happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way&quot;.
&quot;It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic,&quot; Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a &quot;big flirt&quot;.
But the alleged victim &quot;made it clear that he did not want to go any further,&quot; the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt &quot;crushed&quot; after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a &quot;stab in the back&quot;.
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as &quot;madness&quot;.
&quot;I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn&#x27;t and never have to anyone in my life,&quot; Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn&#x27;t recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, was artistic director of London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts.
