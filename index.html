He said Kyrgios is a “heavy favourite” against Chilean tennis player Cristian Garin.

“If he’s dialled in, he should be too good,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“He could well be playing in a Wimbledon semi-final against Rafael Nadal.”</span>

He said he thinks that was “part of the plan from the beginning”. 

“It’s not a court hearing, it’s not a legal proceeding, this is a political process,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“The Committee is made up entirely of Democrats then two Republicans who really don’t like the former president.

“It was, in my mind, a foregone conclusion there would be a criminal referral on something.”</span>

The 22-year-old Robert E. Crimo III was detained a short time ago in the state of Illinois. 

Authorities say he was detained without incident after a brief chase. 

There were six people killed and two dozen others wounded during an Independence Day parade.</span>

It was just the latest pro-EU protest in the country in recent weeks and comes as Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine throws a spotlight on the future of former Soviet states in Europe.</span>

Employees were forced to rebuild IT systems from scratch after specialist equipment and software was ransacked by Russian soldiers. Chernobyl remains a highly volatile site, with hundreds of tonnes of radioactive material still sitting under a protective cover.</span>

Since then, the city&#x27;s firefighters have been bringing water to Sloviansk&#x27;s dwindling and beleaguered population, in an already dangerous environment.

 

Sloviank&#x27;s water pumping and filtration plant to the east of the city was cut off in fighting, making repairs impossible. The Sloviank authorities make sure the firefighters know what&#x27;s needed and where. Queues gather every day, but impatience is growing after a month in this situation. &quot;Tell the mayor we need two trucks for each building,&quot; said one resident. &quot;It&#x27;s not enough; I have to come so far every day to get water.&quot;

 

Russian forces may be on their way: After the fall of Lysychansk just over 70km east, Sloviansk lies directly in their path as the Russian offensive in the Donbas grinds on.</span>

                              <span>[Sponsored Article]  Twenty-five years since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, The Hong Kong Jockey Club has remained committed to giving back to society and promoting community development. Not only does the Club support charities, but it also organises a wide range of fun activities for children and the young at heart, the latest of which is the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour.   Inspired by the ancient Chinese mythical animal ‘Dragon Horse’, Drago Cavallo is a contemporary expression of Chinese culture and a symbol of inspiration, which will lead a trail of positivity around Hong Kong. The adorable creature is designed by renowned artist Simon Ma.    On July 3, Club Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, Simon Ma, Po Leung Kuk Chairman Dr Daniel Chan, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Chairman Philip Ma and the talented students whose artwork adorns the special anniversary Drago Cavallo sculptures, took part in the opening ceremony of the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour in Tai Kwun.     The exhibition showcases 43 exhibits from the Drago Cavallo collection until July 10. Visitors can also experience the AR scavenger hunt and other immersive digital experiences on the spot. The roving exhibition will then be held in the East Coast Park Precinct, Sha Tin Town Hall Plaza, the Hong Kong Museum of Art and other surprising locations until November.     “Drago Cavallo is a wonderful initiative for our younger generation, providing them with a platform to express themselves and showcase their creativity. I would like to thank Simon Ma for initiating this meaningful programme and all partners for their collaboration. Creativity is key to innovation, and innovation is vital to maintaining Hong Kong’s competitive edge. This is why continuous development is one of the Club’s core values,” said Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges.   “This art showcase is just one of many programmes the Club is proud to support through its ‘With You. Now. Always.’…</span>

                              <span>Reason.com: The Army Thinks Printers Cost Over $1 Million 
Poor accounting practices mean the Department of Defense can&#x27;t even tell how much money or equipment it has lost. 
The Army failed to properly account for tens of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of equipment, according to the Department of Defense&#x27;s (DOD) internal watchdog. 
A report released last week by the DOD Office of the Inspector General detailed the results of a recent audit of military bases in Kuwait. Specifically, the audit intended &quot;to determine whether the Army effectively accounted for Government-furnished property (GFP).&quot; 
The audit focused on two bases, Camp Arifjan and Camp Buehring. In 2010, a contractor (not named in the report) was awarded a $75 million contract to provide operations and security support to both bases, including &quot;food and housing, payroll support, fire protection, security protection, law enforcement, and transportation.&quot; The contract was extended multiple times, totaling more than $5 billion over more than a decade.

The lack of oversight for billions of dollars in US weapons pumped into Ukraine has concerned the Pentagon. They&#x27;re worried about anti-tank missiles and explosive drones ending up in the &quot;wrong hands.&quot; 
A new investigation allegedly found some of these weapons are being sold on the dark web. 
RT journalists pretended to be weapons buyers and claimed to have come in contact with Ukrainian arms smugglers offering machine guns, body armor, and some of the US/West&#x27;s most advanced weapons, such as Javelin and NLAW anti-tank systems or Phoenix Ghost and Switchblade explosive drones.

Hamburg, the largest non-capital city in the European Union, has warned that it could ration be forced to hot water as the Russian energy crisis causes chaos. 
Jens Kerstan, environment senator for Germany&#x27;s second biggest city, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on Saturday that Hamburg could restrict availability of hot water to certain times of days &quot;in an acute gas shortage.&quot; 
&quot;We are in a much worse crisis than most people realize,&quot; Kerstan said in a separate interview with the Hamburger Abendblatt on Sunday. 
He urged people to take shorter showers, avoid full baths, and install modern thermostats and water-saving shower heads.

   Washington Examiner: White House Report Card: Zogby says Biden ‘in real trouble’ 
This week’s White House Report Card finds President Joe Biden ending another horror week, whipped repeatedly by the Supreme Court and approval polls and facing a growing fall election disaster if he doesn’t pull up soon. 
Democratic pollster and grader John Zogby, who likes the president, gave another subpar grade to Biden and warned of rocky shores ahead. 
“The president is in real trouble,” Zogby said in grading a “D.” And he added that approval polls of Biden and his handling of the economy are “showing real dangers for him among Democratic bastions as well as independents.”

The question now is whether Ukraine can &quot;defend itself from Russia&#x27;s advances&quot; and whether Russia &quot;can maintain this momentum&quot;.

VOA/Reuters: Minister: Sri Lanka Struggling to Pay for Fuel Shipments  
Colombo — Sri Lanka is struggling to raise $587 million to pay for about half a dozen fuel shipments, a top minister said Sunday as the cash-strapped country tries to cope with its worst financial crisis in decades. 
The country of 22 million people is unable to pay for essential imports of food items, fertilizer, medicines and fuel — due to a severe dollar crunch. 
Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said new fuel shipments were being lined up, but the country is struggling to raise enough funds to pay as the central bank can supply only about $125 million. 
Sri Lanka only has 12,774 tons of diesel and 4,061 tons of petrol left in its government reserves, he told reporters in Colombo, the commercial center of the island nation.

                              <span>Business Insider: Ukraine&#x27;s drones are becoming increasingly ineffective as Russia ramps up its electronic warfare and air defenses 
* Drones were hailed as a wonder weapon for Ukrainian forces in the early stages of Russia&#x27;s invasion. 
* But experts told Insider that drones are becoming increasingly ineffective as Russia has improved its defense systems. 
* Russia is jamming and shooting downing Ukrainian drones, while developing its own capabilities. 
In the early days of the war in Ukraine, drones emerged as an unexpected source of victory against Russian forces. 
Stories of the success dominated the news cycle, played out on multiple video clips widely distributed on social media, and showed Ukraine&#x27;s drones decimating the chaotic Russian advances. 
Ukraine&#x27;s ad-hoc drone airforce, from small consumer drones typically used for surveillance to the famed Turkish-designed Bayraktar TB2 drones, were credited with eviscerating Putin&#x27;s tanks and armor. 
But Russia has learned from the humiliation by drones in the first months of the invasion. Experts told Insider that the drone wonder weapons are becoming increasingly ineffective because Russia has improved its defense systems and is downing and jamming many of Ukraine&#x27;s drones.

Daily Mail: Disturbing new footage shows moment US Osprey helicopter crashed into USS Green Bay in 2017, killing three young Marines after suffering fatal technical issue 
* Footage released this weekend showed the horrific August 2017 Osprey smash that killed three Marines 
* It was completing a day of practice missions in Australia when it struck the deck of the USS Green Bay and plunged 30 feet into the Pacific 
* The chopper&#x27;s co-pilot, 1st Lt. Benjamin Cross, died in the subsequent crash, as did Pfc Ruben Velasco, 19, and Cpl Nathaniel Ordway, 26 
* Another 23 Marines who were on board the chopper at the time of the smash were rescued 
* A subsequent investigation cleared Cross and his unnamed co-pilot of any wrongdoing, and said technical issues had caused the crash 
* Last month, five decorated Marines were killed in an Osprey crash in California, with some branding the accident-plagued choppers flying death-traps 
Newly-unearthed footage shows the moment a MV-22 Osprey helicopter crashed over the side of a US warship in 2017, killing three Marines who were on board. 
The clip, first posted online Saturday, shows the sophisticated helicopter - which can fly like a plane and hover like a chopper -  trying to land on the deck of the US Green Bay of the coast of Queensland, Australia, on August 5, 2017. 
But the chopper - which has been plagued by fatal accidents that have killed 51 service personnel since its first flight in 1989 - suddenly drops unexpectedly.

                              <span>Bloomberg: JPMorgan Sees ‘Stratospheric’ $380 Oil on Worst-Case Russian Cut 
(Bloomberg) -- Global oil prices could reach a “stratospheric” $380 a barrel if US and European penalties prompt Russia to inflict retaliatory crude-output cuts, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts warned. 
The Group of Seven nations are hammering out a complicated mechanism to cap the price fetched by Russian oil in a bid to tighten the screws on Vladimir Putin’s war machine in Ukraine. 
But given Moscow’s robust fiscal position, the nation can afford to slash daily crude production by 5 million barrels without excessively damaging the economy, JPMorgan analysts including Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note to clients. 
 For much of the rest of the world, however, the results could be disastrous. 
A 3 million-barrel cut to daily supplies would push benchmark London crude prices to $190, while the worst-case scenario of 5 million could mean “stratospheric” $380 crude, the analysts wrote.

Russia has denied the accusations but Mr Albanese said he witnessed the aftermath of war crimes.

“The fact that you had such a significant force, you can see the use of tanks, missiles, heavy artillery being used in a civilian area – it’s just devastating,” Mr Albanese said.</span>

                              <span>Amber Heard&#x27;s legal team has requested that the verdict made by jurors in the defamation lawsuit filed by Johnny Depp be dismissed or redone.

Lawyers for the Aquaman star claimed in a 43-page motion that the jury’s verdict should be thrown out on the grounds that it was unsupported by evidence.

A Virginia jury on Wednesday June 1 found the actress liable for defaming her ex-husband in a 2018 Washington Post opinion article in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”.

Ms Heard was ordered to pay Mr Depp more than $US10 million in damages.</span>

Fortune: ‘From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU’: Lavrov says a new Iron Curtain is coming down between Russia and the West 
Back to the Cold War it is, then.  A new Iron Curtain is descending between Russia and the West, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday. 
“From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU,” Lavrov said at a press conference after talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Vladimir Makei. 
“We will do everything necessary not to depend on them in critically important industries.”  Lavrov was concurring with comments made by Makei, regarding the appearance of a new Iron Curtain that was “being erected by Westerners themselves.” In echoing the Belarusian diplomat, Lavrov warned Western countries to “behave carefully.”

The measure was being taken to &quot;ensure the safety of citizens, protect their rights and freedoms (and) restore law and order&quot; in the territory, the statement added.

Russia has taken control of Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine that was still under Ukrainian control. 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the military had taken over Lysychansk and a number of nearby settlements on Sunday, according to the country’s Ministry of Defense. 
Ukraine’s military announced Sunday that it had been “forced to withdraw” from the critical city.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has accused Ukraine of firing missiles at military facilities on his country’s territory. 
He said the missiles were intercepted by Belarusian air defense systems earlier this week. 
Without providing any evidence of the alleged attack, Lukashenko – a close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin – called the act a “provocation”. 
“Thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Lukashenko said in comments that appeared on his presidential website on Saturday and were also published by state-run news agency Belta. 
He added that there were no soldiers from Belarus currently fighting in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Lukashenko’s claims.

                              <span>The SUN: RED DAWN How US could lose war with China in a WEEK as every ‘simulation’ shows it being crushed over Taiwan 
AMERICA faces defeat by China in a war over Taiwan in just a week and needs to “urgently” up its preparations, a leading expert has said. 
The chilling warning from Oriana Skylar Mastro, an authority on China’s military and US Air Force strategist, comes after years of simulations showing crushing defeats for America. 
China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed unification with the mainland, by force if necessary, while Joe Biden recently promised the US will defend the island. 
Taiwan is effectively an independent country, though not recognised by the internationally, but any moves towards full independence will almost certainly lead to war.

WNU Editor: This is one of many war simulations over Taiwan. But what I find striking about these war scenarios on Taiwan is that most (if not all of them) end with a Chinese victory, including the one above.</span>

A Chinese attack on Taiwan is not imminent, the top US general says, but the US is watching &quot;very closely&quot;.
China is clearly developing the capability to attack at some point, but deciding to do so would be a political choice, Gen Mark Milley told the BBC. 
China says Taiwan is a breakaway province that must be re-unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. 
It has accused the US of supporting Taiwan&#x27;s independence, and vowed to &quot;resolutely crush&quot; any such attempt. 
There has been a marked escalation recently between China and the US - Taiwan&#x27;s most powerful ally.

“What do you think of that?”  asks comedian Vadym Dziunko.
Dziunko is on stage with two other actors and a well-known singer.  All are seated and holding microphones, valiantly trying to find humor in a place and time where the tragic outweighs the funny by a dramatic margin.
It’s a recent Saturday night at Cult Comedy Hall, a comedy club in downtown Lviv, near Ukraine’s relatively peaceful western border.  About 100 people spent about $13 each to eat, drink and listen to comics telling whatever came to mind, which is often the lat…</span>

                              <span>The auto industry is facing troubling signs across the horizon, including rising interest rates and fears of a recession.
But the biggest problem still seems to be making enough cars.
General Motors said Friday its second-quarter U.S. new-vehicle shipments were down 15% from a year earlier, while Toyota Motor reported a 23% drop in U.S. sales.  The obstacle continues to be the inability to obtain enough computer chips to complete the vehicles.
For now, at least, consumers are still eager to buy.  Manufacturers are selling virtually every car or truck they make and have seen no signs of inventory building up at dealerships, even as new vehicle prices hit record highs.


“It tells me that vehicles are always on the move, and that’s probably the number 1 thing I look at,” Paul Jacobson, Gener…</span>

                              <span>Travelers across the country faced the prospect of canceled or delayed flights on Saturday as airlines and airports dealt with a combination of high demand, bad weather and staff shortages.
As of Saturday evening, nearly 650 flights in the United States had been canceled and more than 5,200 flights within, to or from the country had been delayed, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.
While the number of problem flights was higher than on a typical travel day, travel demand was also higher. According to the Transportation Security Administration, the number of travelers over the July 4 holiday weekend had reached pre-pandemic levels.  Demand for travel over the same holiday weekend last year had recovered significantly from pandemic lows, but was still below this year’s levels.

Walmart, Darden Restaurants, McDonald’s, Home Depot, Hilton, Dollar General and FedEx, which together employ millions of people across the country, did not say whether they would cover travel for abortions outside of the country. State.  A spokeswoman for Walmart, which has 1.7 million employees in the United States, said the company regularly reviews its benefits based on employee demand, and that the company is “now reviewing the evolution federal and state landscape” when considering its offerings.  The rest of the companies listed did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“We are working thoughtfully and diligently to find the best path forward, guided by our desire to support our associates, all of our associates,” Doug McMillon, Walmart chief executive, wrote in a memo to staff Friday.
Amazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer after Walmart, said it would cover out-of-state abortion travel for its employees, most of whom are hourly workers.  But that perk applies to employees of its healthcare plan, not the contractors who make up a substantial part of its workforce, like its vast network of delivery drivers.
As the list of companies covering abortion-related travel grows, some workers wonder why their employers won’t do the same.  Isabela Burrows, 19, who works at a PetSmart in Howell, Michigan, learned that Roe v.  Wade had been knocked down by a client last week and was frustrated that her company had said nothing.  Michigan has an abortion ban that has been blocked in court and which Democratic leaders have said they will not enforce.

By law, the Department of the Interior is required to publish a plan for new oil and gas leases in federal waters every five years.  This new one, which establishes where the government can sell oil and gas leases from 2022 to 2027, comes at a difficult time for President Biden.
He wants to cut drilling to fight climate change as gas prices rise, allowing his Republican critics to blame his climate policies for the pain at the pump.  In fact, according to most energy experts, the spike in oil price…</span>

The panel’s vote clears the way for the FDA to push manufacturers to make reformulated boosters in time for the Biden administration to offer them later this year, ahead of an expected winter surge of the virus.
The decision came after a day of thinking about where the virus is heading and how best to tackle it.  A senior FDA official called it “science at its toughest.”  One committee member described the data as “uncomfortably sparse”.

&quot;They forgot to give him his notes,&quot; Mr Dean said.

“Australia is all in on the NATO project,” he told Sky News Australia.

“The significance there is NATO is expanding its focus to our part of the world, (and) extremely concerned about the new relationship with no limits that’s been formed between Russia and China.”

Mr Lloyd said Australia is “fully engaged” and recognises the impact of the Ukraine conflict on Europe and Africa.

“We’ve agreed to do what we can to help supply agricultural products and energy into markets that desperately need it,” he said.</span>

                              <span>Halifax Bank is an example of “corporate virtue-signalling gone wrong” after telling customers to close their accounts if they disagree with the company’s values, says Sky News host Rita Panahi. 

The company posted a photo on Twitter of one of its badges including an employee’s pronouns. 

The bank stated if people disagree with the company’s values they are “welcome” to close their accounts. 

“That&#x27;s a brave new way of doing business – telling your customers to take a hike if they don&#x27;t embrace your divisive politicking,” Ms Panahi said.</span>

Ms Panahi said the United States has &quot;completely lost control&quot; of its southern border under Biden&#x27;s administration while &quot;border czar&quot; Kamala Harris has done nothing to stem the tide.

&quot;Record numbers are crossing illegally and tragically many people are being brutalised, raped and even killed due to the evil people smuggling trade,&quot; Ms Panahi said.

&quot;The cost of gross incompetence, the cost of losing control of your borders and allowing the most evil trade to prosper. That is the legacy that Kamala Harris shares with Joe Biden.&quot;</span>

&quot;This week 51 people were found dead inside an abandoned truck in Texas, another dozen were hospitalised. In the end the migrant death toll was 53,&quot; Ms Panahi said.

&quot;Federal authorities announced on Wednesday that they had charged four men with human smuggling in the deaths of 53 migrants from Mexico and Central America.

                              <span>US President Joe Biden’s climate change ambitions have been set back after the Supreme Court said the use of the EPA to “restrict emissions from the power sector is overstepping the authority,” says The Australian’s Environment Editor Graham Lloyd.

“Obama and then Biden had both talked a very big game on climate action, but neither had the support of Congress to actually get meaningful reforms through,” he told Sky News Australia.

“These sort of things with such sweeping impacts need to be decided by Congress and Biden is just unable to deliver that.

“In the bigger world of climate politics, really this is history repeating itself and Biden’s agenda is pretty much a lame duck.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Q: I’m a retiree with no income but ample cash, and wondering how someone without a traditional source of income can qualify for an apartment when landlords generally require tenants to prove they earn 40 times the rent monthly.  I have to believe that mine is not an uncommon situation.  What other ways can I prove to a future landlord that I can pay the rent?
A: Landlords have enormous discretion when choosing tenants, as long as they don’t discriminate.  In a competitive rental market like this, tenants with non-traditional assets — including retirees, recent graduates, students, and the self-employed — are at a disadvantage simply because the vetting process is more competitive.
The open days are full and bidding wars are rampant.  Some would-be tenants are even bribing brokers and land…</span>

                              <span>Tesla said on Saturday April-June vehicle deliveries fell 18% from the first quarter of the year, a rare slowdown for the company caused by production issues in China.
Tesla sells more electric cars than any other company and until recently was growing rapidly in China, Europe and the United States as rising gas prices increased battery appeal.  The company continues to weather supply chain turmoil better than competitors like General Motors and Toyotaboth of which reported a sharp drop in sales on Friday.
Demand for cars, especially electric cars, is plentiful, but shortages of semiconductors and other key components are forcing buyers to wait several months for deliveries.

He was scratching a frozen wall of earth.  Suddenly a big chunk came out.  With him was the body of a baby woolly mammoth, frozen and preserved with its hair and skin.
“I thought it was a baby buffalo at first,” said Mudry, 31, from Alberta.  “And then I came out, and I was inspecting it, and there was a trunk, so I had no words.”


The mammoth was dark and shiny, Mr. Mudry said, with short legs and deep, pronounced eye sockets.  It had a lean, wrinkled trunk and a stub of tail.  He quickly waved to a colleague and called his boss, Brian McCaughan, the co-founder of a family-owned gold mining business called T…</span>

Astronomers hope the James Webb Space Telescope will reveal whether any of these planets harbor atmospheres that could support life.
Identifying an atmosphere in another solar system would be quite remarkable.  But there’s even a chance, albeit a tiny one, that one of these atmospheres offers what’s called a biosignature: a signal from life itself.
“I think we can find planets that we think are interesting – you know, good possibilities for life,” said Megan Mansfield, an astronomer at the University of Arizona.  “But we won’t necessarily be able to identify life immediately.”

The storm, something of a surprise, formed hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall in Nicaragua.
Hake was expected moving slowly through the Carolinas over the weekend and dissipating early Monday.


On Saturday morning, heavy rain and high winds continued along the coast.  Maximum sustained winds remained near 40 miles per hour.


Forecasters warned that tropical storm conditions were expected in North Carolina from Saturday morning through Sunday.  Heavy rain was expected, with some areas expected to receive up to four inches.

Military says one UAV downed by F16 fighter jet, the other two by missiles launched from ship; terror group has warned it will attack site; Lebanon claims field is disputed  The Israel Defenses Forces said Saturday it successfully intercepted three drones flown by the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group that were heading for the Karish gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast.  Tensions have risen over the site in recent weeks, after a gas production vessel arrived in Israel to launch extraction operations in the offshore field, drawing condemnation from Lebanon, which had laid claim to parts of it.

Protesters stormed Libya&#x27;s parliament building in the eastern city of Tobruk on Friday, demonstrating against deteriorating living conditions and political deadlock, Libyan media reported. 
Several television channels said that protesters had managed to penetrate the building and committed acts of vandalism, while media outlets showed images of thick columns of black smoke coming from its perimeter as angry young protesters burned tyres. 
Other media reports said part of the building had been burned.  The parliament building was empty as Friday falls on the weekend in Libya.

&quot;Greater ambition is required at all levels to address the dire state of the ocean,&quot; the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon said in its final declaration.
The meeting in the Portuguese capital -- attended by government officials, experts and advocates from 140 countries -- is not a negotiating forum.
But it sets the agenda for final international negotiations in August on a treaty to protect the high seas -- those international waters beyond national jurisdiction.

                              <span>A series of strong earthquakes rocked southern Iran on Saturday, killing at least five people and causing damage to dozens of buildings, state media reported.
The quakes, including two of magnitude 6.0, struck west of the major port city of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan province, the US Geological Survey said.
The first rattled an area north of the town of Dezhgan shortly after 2:00 am (2130 GMT), before a 5.7 tremor hit two hours later followed quickly by the second 6.0 magnitude quake, said the USGS.
Hormozgan governor Mehdi Dousti said five people were killed, as cited by the official news agency IRNA.
Dousti said most of the damage occurred in the village of Sayeh Khosh, close to the epicenter.

                              <span>Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon reached a record level during the first half of 2022, the INPE national space agency said Friday.
The world&#x27;s largest tropical rainforest lost 3,750 square kilometers (1,450 square miles) of jungle since the beginning of the year, the worst numbers for that period since record-keeping began in 2016.
The previous worst figure of 3,605 square kilometers was set last year.
The new figure does not even include the final six days of June.
This year has seen the worst June in 15 years for forest fires.
Monthly records were also beaten in January and February, when deforestation is usually lower, and in April.
INPE satellites identified more than 2,500 fires in the Amazon last month, the largest number since more than 3,500 were recorded in June 2007, and an 11 percent increase over June 2021.
More than 7,500 fires have been recorded since the start of the year, another 17 percent increase on 2021 and the worst numbers since 2010.
&quot;The dry season has barely begun in the Amazon and already we&#x27;re beating environmental destruction records,&quot; said Cristiane Mazzetti, from Greenpeace Brazil.
Environmentalists and opposition figures accuse the government of President Jair Bolsonaro of implementing policies that encourage big businesses to damage the environment.
&quot;The impact of this negligence will be the increasing loss of the resilience of these surroundings, not to mention the damage done to local communities and health,&quot; said Mariana Napolitano, of the Brazilian World Wildlife Fund.
Bolsonaro has encouraged mining and farming activity in protected areas.
Critics also accuse him of supporting impunity for gold prospectors, farmers and logging traffickers involved in illegal deforestation.
Last year, the main government environmental protection body spent only 41 percent of its surveillance budget, according to the Climate Observatory NGO.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Tropical storm Bonnie made landfall near the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border on Friday evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Heavy rainfall is expected across Nicaragua and Costa Rica
through Saturday, along with life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, the center added.
The storm is likely to weaken as it crosses land, only to re-intensify over the eastern Pacific on Saturday night and Sunday, the center added.
The storm packed maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts before it made landfall, the NHC said.

                              <span>Tuesday&#x27;s breathtaking testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson before the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol is a turning point in how Donald Trump is viewed by Republicans, a former GOP governor explained on CNN.
Wolf Blitzer interviewed former two-term Ohio Gov. John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Kasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.
&quot;Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?&quot; Blitzer asked.
 &quot;Oh yeah. he&#x27;s taking on water,&quot; Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.
&quot;And he&#x27;s shrinking,&quot; he continued. &quot;You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting.&quot;
&quot;And I feel that he&#x27;s melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, &#x27;You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.&#x27; The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman&#x27;s testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath,&quot; he said. &quot;If they don&#x27;t agree with her story, with what she&#x27;s been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath.&quot;
&quot;The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe in our country we would&#x27;ve had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much. I never felt he was fit for the office and it&#x27;s all proven out to be true, unfortunately,&quot; he said.

                              <span>The sovereign citizen movement is expanding rapidly, and can now be found in at least 26 countries.

The movement is anti-government in nature, and its followers believe they’re immune from the laws of their government. They also have a proclivity for violence, as demonstrated by a number of high-profile incidents, including an armed standoff in Massachusetts in July 2021.
As a behavioural scientist and researcher of this movement, I have been monitoring Romana Didulo, a conspiracy influencer based in British Columbia, who has proclaimed herself “Queen of Canada,” “commander-in-chief,” “Head of State and Government” and “president and national Indigenous chief of the Kingdom of Canada.” 
Recently, Didulo has promoted herself to “Queen of the World.”

Located at the confluence of Hellenistic and Indian cultures, Mes Aynak -- believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old -- was once a vast city organised around the extraction and trade of copper.
Archaeologists have uncovered Buddhist monasteries, stupas, fortresses, administrative buildings and dwellings, while hundreds of statues, frescoes, ceramics, coins and manuscripts have also been unearthed.
Despite looting at the beginning of the century, Mes Aynak is &quot;one of the most beautiful archaeological sites&quot; in the world, says Bastien Varoutsikos, an archaeologist for the French company Iconem,…</span>

Among the first to get married were Aline, 46, and Laure, 45, who have been together for 21 years and converted their civil union into marriage at the plush Palais Eynard in Geneva.
Beneath a sparkling chandelier in a mirrored salon, and with a dozen or so close friends and family in attendance, the couple exchanged touching words recalling their years together and love for each other.
&quot;You are a wonderful person,&quot; said Aline, looking into Laure&#x27;s eyes.
&quot;I still want to spend the rest of my life with you.&quot;
Holding hands throughout the ceremony, they signed the official documents, followed by their witnesses.

                              <span>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States, as supporters denounced the British government.
Assange, who turns 51 on Sunday, has been held in a high-security prison since 2019.
On Friday his wife Stella was among dozens of people who demonstrated outside Britain&#x27;s interior ministry to demand his release.
Home Secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition last month, but court officials confirmed to AFP an application to appeal had been received on Friday.
&quot;We&#x27;re not at the end of the road here,&quot; Stella Assange, who married the Australian publisher earlier this year, told reporters when Patel announced her decision.
&quot;We&#x27;re going to fight this. We&#x27;re going to use every appeal avenue.&quot; 
Assange is wanted to face trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010, related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could face decades in jail if found guilty, but supporters portray him as a martyr to press freedom after he was taken into UK custody following a years-long stay in Ecuador&#x27;s embassy.
&quot;He&#x27;s been in prison for telling the truth,&quot; supporter Gloria Wildman, 79, told AFP at Friday&#x27;s protest.
&quot;If Julian Assange is not free, neither are we, none of us is free,&quot; she said.</span>

Ukraine prizes borscht , a nourishing soup with beetroot as its base, as a national dish even though it is also widely enjoyed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland.
The Ukrainian culture of borscht  cooking &quot;was today inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding,&quot; by a UNESCO committee, it said.
The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and the &quot;negative impact on this tradition&quot; caused by the war, the agency said.

Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist and WNBA champion, faces up to 10 years in prison on charges of drug smuggling. 
The trial was partially closed, with a limited media presence, which Vdovtsova said was &quot;on the request of the defence, the request of Griner herself&quot;.
The six-foot-nine star was brought into court in handcuffs. She wore a white T-shirt with US music icon Jimi Hendrix on it.
The 31-year-old came to Russia in February to play there during the US off-season, and was detained at a Moscow airport …</span>

The Chinese Communist Party places great importance on anniversaries, and the trip presented Xi with an opportunity to emphasize China&#x27;s authority over Hong Kong after three years of political upheaval there.
&quot;Xi&#x27;s speech and language reiterated the political message to Hong Kong since the national security law,&quot; political scientist Kenneth Chan from Hong Kong Baptist University told AFP.
