                              <span>With a U.S. soldier crossing the border into North Korea at the border town of Panmunjom and in custody this week, talk turns to the nation itself — a country that is known for its suspicion of outsiders but also rejects frequent descriptions of it as reclusive. 

In some ways, North Korea is a nation like many others; it is also definitively its own thing, sometimes strikingly different from the rest of the world. 

For six years until his death in 2019, longtime Associated Press Asia correspondent Eric Talmadge was the news organization’s Pyongyang bureau chief. In that role, with regular access unusual for a journalist from the West, he wrote many stories that explored the nation’s culture, politics and economics during the rule of third-generation leader Kim Jong Un. 

As the drama around the American soldier plays out, here is a selection of some of Talmadge&#x27;s AP coverage that pulls back the curtain on a society that few around the world see.

DW: Kyiv imposes ban on Russian-language culture 
A Temporary ban has been imposed on Russian art and culture in the Ukrainian capital. Human rights activists say the move is discriminatory and unconstitutional. 
Street musicians singing Russian songs in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv could soon face problems. Likewise, bars and restaurants playing Russian background music may end up getting in trouble. 
The reason is that Kyiv city council has issued a temporary ban on performing or showcasing Russian-language art and culture — such as books, music, plays and concerts — in public. This ban also encompasses cultural and educational programs. The restriction not only applies to works by Russian authors and creators, but to all cultural products publicly presented in or translated into Russian.

Insider: Former Special Forces engineer says Russian minefields are unlike anything he has ever seen and battling these hidden death traps is &#x27;exhausting&#x27; 
* Ryan Hendrickson has been working to clear heavily mined areas in Ukraine. 
* The former US Special Forces engineer says the overwhelming numbers of land mines is wildly different from anything he saw in Afghanistan. 
* &quot;How do you clear all of this out?&quot; Hendrickson asked in an online interview with a Ukrainian YouTube channel. 
A decorated former US Army Special Forces engineer who cleared out improvised explosives in Afghanistan and has since been tackling threats in Ukraine says the monstrous minefields Russia is laying down are unlike anything he has ever seen. 
&quot;The biggest difference is the sheer number of mines,&quot; Ryan Hendrickson, who previously served in Afghanistan with the Green Berets and is now removing deadly mines as a volunteer in Ukraine, told Ukrainian Toronto Television. 
&quot;There are millions and millions of mines in Ukraine,&quot; many put down by the Ukrainians, but significantly more by the Russians.

In one field, for instance, Hendrickson and his team found over 700 anti-tank mines, though they estimated there may have been thousands in total. That was just one field.

OilPrice.com: China Snaps Up Record-High Volumes Of Russian Crude In The First Half Of 2023 
* In the first half of 2023, China imported 2.13 million barrels per day of Russian crude oil, making Russia its single biggest supplier. 
* In June, China once again imported record-breaking levels of Russian crude, a 44% increase compared to the same month in 2022. 
* Total Chinese oil imports are also soaring, with the country importing the second-highest monthly import figure on record in June. 
Despite an apparent weakness in its economy, China is importing record volumes of oil and is buying record amounts of Russian crude to add to stockpiles. 
During the first half of 2023, Chinese imports of Russian crude oil averaged 2.13 million barrels per day (bpd), which helped Russia oust its OPEC+ partner Saudi Arabia from the top spot as the single biggest supplier to the world’s top crude importer so far this year, per Financial Times estimates based on Chinese customs data. Imports from the world’s top crude oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, averaged 1.88 million bpd between January and June, according to FT’s calculations.

                              <span>Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: &quot;No Limit&quot; On Number Of Ukrainian Refugees To Be Allowed Into Canada: Federal Memo 
With 230,000 Ukrainians having already emigrated to Canada to flee the war, a recently disclosed internal memo from the Immigration Department says there is “no limit” on the number of Ukrainian war refugees that can be allowed into Canada. 
The government closed applications on July 15 for Ukrainian refugees looking to obtain temporary emergency visas and free flights to Canada, but about 1.1 million Ukrainians applied for visas prior to the deadline—of which about 800,000 had been approved as of the beginning of July. 
“There is no limit,” said a Department of Immigration memo sent to the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs and obtained by Blacklock’s Reporter.

WNU Editor: Regular readers of this blog know that I have been helping Ukrainian refugees settle in Canada since the start of the war. I have been often asked how many have I helped. To be honest. Aside from helping two cousins and their families as well as a dozen friends, I lost count a long time ago. 
I have also been asked if any of them want to go back to Ukraine when the war is over. That is an easy question to answer. No one wants to give up their Canadian status. In fact. When the war is finally over I predict another massive influx of Ukrainian refugees to Canada, and almost all of them will be military-aged males who will then be permitted to leave the country and reunite with their family members and loved ones in Canada.</span>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has sacked his country&#x27;s ambassador to the UK.

Vadym Prystaiko had recently criticised the president&#x27;s response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. 
He had called Mr Zelensky&#x27;s promise to thank the UK defence minister every morning &quot;unhealthy sarcasm&quot;. 
Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal but confirmed that Mr Prystaiko was no longer ambassador. 
Earlier this month, Ben Wallace said he had warned Ukraine that its allies were &quot;not Amazon&quot;, saying Kyiv needed to show gratitude for weapons it received in order to persuade Western politicians to give more.

The two sides will mainly focus on sea and air escorts, deterrence and repulsion, anchorage defence and other courses to carry out drills, CCTV reported.

&quot;The joint exercises will test the ability of the Chinese and Russian armies to integrate joint operations in distant waters,&quot; it added.

Images show protesters scaling walls of Swedish Embassy in Iraq 
Iraq has severed diplomatic ties with Sweden Thursday after a planned anti-Quran demonstration unfolded in Stockholm, during which an individual stepped on and kicked the Islamic holy book and Iraqi flag. 
The move came after images emerged of protesters storming the Swedish embassy in Baghdad for the second time in less than a month, lighting a small fire and sending plumes of smoke into the air. 
The demonstrator in the Swedish capital Thursday – identified in Swedish media as Salwan Momika, an Iraqi of Christian origin who lives in Sweden as a self-identified atheist – had threatened to burn a copy of the Quran, according to The Associated Press. But he did not do so.

                              <span>A.B. Stoddard, RCW: Doubts and Questions About Biden Will Only Grow 
Wow, big news broke Tuesday – President Biden’s campaign is officially going to be headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware. For months nervous Democrats have wondered why Biden only had four full-time staffers devoted to his reelection effort and why the campaign wasn’t yet located anywhere. 
This development will do absolutely nothing, however, to stop the panic within the party that Biden is too old to run for reelection and could easily lose to former President Donald Trump. Sorry, Team Biden, these fears will not be put to rest; they are going to persist and grow. 
Though the White House and the Democratic National Committee may be trying to ignore it, there is suddenly a constant stream of stories in the media about doubts that Biden can make it across the finish line 16 months from now. Though Frank Bruni noted it’s probably too late, he encouraged Democrats in a New York Times column to talk about Hunter Biden, and suggested Biden should step aside: “It might be best, for him and for continued Democratic control of the White House, if he let Democrats choose a different 2024 nominee.”

DW: What happened to China&#x27;s missing foreign minister?

 
Qin Gang has not been seen at any diplomatic events for over three weeks, just months after taking on the role. His mysterious absence has underlined the secrecy of Beijing’s top-level politics. 
As of Wednesday, China&#x27;s Foreign Minister Qin Gang has been absent from the public eye for 24 days, marking more than three weeks since his last reported diplomatic meetings on June 25. 
At the relatively young age of 57, he became one of the youngest foreign ministers in Chinese history when he assumed office in December. He was, at the time, widely regarded as a trusted confidant of Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
His disappearance has brought up difficult questions for Beijing, both inside and outside of China.

Euronews: EU pitches €20-billion plan in long-term military support for Ukraine  
Josep Borrell, the European Union&#x27;s foreign policy chief, has proposed a new plan to provide &quot;sustainable and predictable&quot; military support to Ukraine. 
Under the blueprint, the bloc will earmark €20 billion for the next four years to partially reimburse the expenses incurred by member states with their supplies to the war-torn nation, which is in the midst of a counteroffensive against the invading Russian troops. 
The money will pay for lethal and non-lethal equipment, in line with the neutrality principle that a few member states maintain, and would constitute one of the security commitments EU leaders agreed to provide Ukraine at a summit last month.

Gordon Hahn, Russian &amp; Eurasian Politics: Biden’s Ukraine Blackmail 
U.S. President Joseph Biden and not surprisingly NATO made it evidently clear that there will be no Ukrainian membership in NATO until after the war. This stipulation and the requirement – objective and subjective – of Ukraine’s victory over Russia in the war constitutes a form of de facto blackmail of Kiev on the part of the West. This dooms Ukraine to fight ‘as long as it takes’ – in the sloganeering vernacular of the White House – to the cliched but very real last Ukrainian in order to gain NATO membership.

Wall Street Journal: Ukraine Adopts Slow Approach to Counteroffensive 
ORIKHIV, Ukraine—Six weeks into Ukraine’s counteroffensive, Capt. Anatoliy Kharchenko and his reconnaissance company were supposed to be wreaking havoc miles behind Russian defensive lines pierced by Western-supplied armored vehicles. 
Instead, after many of the vehicles got bogged down in minefields, Kharchenko and his men are training how to advance methodically on foot, moving from one line of trees to another, faced with the prospect of taking back their country one field at a time. 
“We’ve got nothing to lose,” Kharchenko said. “Victory isn’t just important, but it’s the only option, otherwise we’ll all be dead.” 
Ukraine’s counteroffensive, launched at the start of June, is aimed at retaking some of the nearly 20% of Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow. The West provided dozens of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles and trained thousands of Ukrainian troops for the campaign. 
The swift loss of several tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, many of them immobilized by mines or missiles launched from attack helicopters, jolted Ukraine and its Western backers. Ukraine hasn’t achieved a decisive breakthrough, although it has seized several villages.

The United States has imposed new sanctions targeting 18 individuals and more than 120 entities based in Russia and Kyrgyzstan in a move aimed at inhibiting Moscow’s access to products and technology that support its war efforts. 
The entities include several based in Kyrgyzstan that the U.S. Treasury Department on July 20 said have operated as intermediaries to provide foreign-made electronics and technologies to Russia. 
At least six of these companies were featured in a recent investigation by RFE/RL’s Kyrgyz Service into Kyrgyz and Kazakh companies that revealed how sanctioned Western electronics make their way to Russia via Central Asian firms.

An opposition leader called for three days of protests against a finance bill. 
LONDON -- Kenya was bracing for days of anti-government protests led by the government&#x27;s political opposition over a contentious new finance bill and the rising cost of living. 

At least six people were shot and killed and at least a dozen others were injured on Wednesday, the first day of a planned three-day protest against higher taxes, Mathias Kinyoda, of Amnesty International Kenya, told ABC News. At least 87 demonstrators were arrested nationwide, he said. 
The protests were called by opposition leader Raila Odinga. The unrest was set to take place despite Kenya&#x27;s President William Ruto vowing no protests would take place in the East African Nation.

Newsweek: Putin&#x27;s Bizarre Memory Lapse Sparks &#x27;Dementia&#x27; Rumors 
Vladimir Putin got confused about the age of the child of a deputy mayor during a discussion at the Kremlin, sparking social media comment about the state of the Russian president&#x27;s health. 
Unproven rumors have persisted about Putin&#x27;s condition since the start of his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. These have included that the Russian president has cancer, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and even dementia. 
The Kremlin has insisted Putin is in good health.

However, adding to the speculation was footage from Wednesday&#x27;s meeting of the group &quot;Russia—the Land of Opportunities,&quot; a non-profit set up in 2018 to help citizens develop business ideas.

Newsweek: After NATO Summit, Promised &#x27;Security Commitments&#x27; for Ukraine Remain Vague 
Last week&#x27;s NATO Summit in Vilnius did not offer a clear path to Ukrainian membership in the alliance, let alone a formal invitation to join the collective security bloc. However, this does not mean that the Ukrainian delegation returned from the Lithuanian capital empty-handed. 
On July 12, the final day of the summit, the G7 countries—the United States, Canada, the U.K. France, Germany, Italy, and Japan—issued a formal statement outlining their &quot;unwavering commitment to the strategic objective of a free, independent, democratic, and sovereign Ukraine.&quot; The group also promised to ensure the creation of &quot;a sustainable force capable of defending Ukraine now and deterring Russian aggression in the future.&quot; Ten additional European countries, including new NATO member Finland and soon-to-be NATO member Sweden, signed onto the pledge.

Reuters: Iran warns against unloading Iranian oil from seized tanker 
Iran would retaliate against any oil company unloading Iranian oil from a seized tanker, the Revolutionary Guards’ navy commander Alireza Tangsiri said on Thursday, according to state media.
In April, the US confiscated Iranian oil on a tanker at sea in a sanctions enforcement operation, according to a maritime security firm. 
Tangsiri added that Tehran would hold Washington responsible for allowing the unloading of the tanker’s content.

Politico:  Allies’ ‘main effort’ for Ukraine shifting from donating weapons to fixing them

 
After 17 months of war, Ukraine has amassed a staggering and diverse arsenal of equipment that needs to be maintained. 
The West’s focus on building Ukraine’s war machine has shifted significantly to repairing and sustaining those weapons, a recognition that the war will grind on for months and years to come, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official said. 
Even before Ukraine launched its counteroffensive this summer, allies were becoming increasingly worried that efforts to keep donated equipment up and running were falling behind battlefield needs.

Financial Times: Munitions put into focus as stockpiles dwindle 
War in Ukraine, a fragile industrial base and slow procurement hamper supply.

Just as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has awoken western defence officials to the reality of hot war, so has it also exposed the need to recalibrate weapons procurement priorities — to ensure that their militaries are prepared for combat. 
War games have identified munitions — everything from bombs to bullets — as an area of risk that needs urgent attention. They found, for example, that the US could use some munitions, such as anti-ship missiles, faster than they are produced. And there could be scenarios where it does not have enough of some missiles to sustain a war — for instance, in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Experts have also identified a disconnect between the US and European defence industrial bases, when instead they could be complementing and bolstering each other in times of need.

Global Times: PLA warship activities set new record around island of Taiwan 
The Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) recently ramped up warship activities around the island of Taiwan, breaking the record for the number of vessels deployed in its drills in the region. 
Analysts said Sunday that the recent intensive exercises demonstrate the PLA&#x27;s capabilities in encircling the island, and likely featured amphibious landing training. 
The defense authority on the island of Taiwan said in a press release on Saturday that it detected 15 PLA aircraft and 16 PLA vessels operating around the island of Taiwan on Friday.

“I mean, some of these phenomena we know have already had an impact on our training ranges for, you know, when pilots are out trying to do training in the air and they see these things, they’re not sure what they are and it can have an impact on their ability to perfect their skills.

Defense News: F-35 delivery delays to cost Lockheed hundreds of millions in 2023 
WASHINGTON — Problems with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s newest upgrades will cause the aircraft’s manufacturer to miss its 2023 delivery goal by up to roughly 50 jets, Lockheed Martin officials said Tuesday. 
The delays could bring down Lockheed’s revenue for 2023 by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Lockheed originally planned to deliver between 147 and 153 fighters this year. But software problems with the upgrades known as Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3, are causing significant delays. The Pentagon announced in June that it would not accept newly built F-35s with TR-3 until the upgrades are completely ready.

William Rampe, Reason: Sweden Learns That NATO Has Strings Attached 
Sweden wants to join NATO to protect itself from Russia. Unfortunately, NATO admission will require Sweden—and the U.S.—to make significant concessions to Turkey. 
On July 7, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to &quot;ensure ratification&quot; of Sweden&#x27;s application to join NATO in Turkey&#x27;s parliament, according to NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg. 
This deal comes amid additional reports of acquiescence to Turkish demands, including Swedish support for the country&#x27;s European Union (E.U.) accession process and the U.S. working to provide Turkey with $20 billion worth of F-16s and 79 modernization kits for existing aircraft.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council held its first meeting on artificial intelligence on Tuesday where China said the technology should not become a &quot;runaway horse&quot; and the United States warned against its use to censor or repress people. 
Britain&#x27;s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who chaired the meeting under Britain&#x27;s July presidency of the body, said AI will &quot;fundamentally alter every aspect of human life.&quot; &quot;We urgently need to shape the global governance of transformative technologies because AI knows no borders,&quot; he added after saying that AI could help address climate change and boost economies. 
But he also warned that the technology fuels disinformation and could aid both state and non-state actors in a quest for weapons.

                              <span>Defense News: Saudi Arabia signs major order for Turkish drones 
MILAN — Saudi Arabia is set to give a boost to Turkey’s struggling economy through a major drone contract negotiated with Turkish firm Baykar, one that the company’s CEO is calling the biggest sale between the two countries in Turkish defense history. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan embarked last week on a Gulf tour amid an ongoing financial crisis in Turkey, with the country’s currency plunging in value and inflation skyrocketing. 
The first stop on Erdogan’s agenda was Jeddah, where he attended alongside Saudi’s ruler Mohammed bin Salman the signing of a contract between Baykar and the Saudi Ministry of Defense for the purchase of Akinci combat drones.

Moscow Times: Russia Says Will View Ships En Route to Ukraine as Possible Military Carriers 
Russia said Wednesday that it will now consider all vessels nearing Ukraine’s ports to be potential carriers of military cargo from Thursday. 
The announcement comes days after Moscow pulled out of a deal allowing wartime exports of Ukrainian grain that had eased a global food crisis sparked by Russia&#x27;s invasion. 
 &quot;From 00:00 a.m. Moscow time on July 20, 2023, all vessels on the Black Sea sailing to Ukrainian ports will be regarded as potential carriers of military cargo,&quot; the Defense Ministry said in a statement on its Telegram channel. 
“The flag states of such vessels will be considered involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime,” it added.

WNU Editor: I know there are efforts to resume the Ukraine grain deal, but Id do not see these efforts being successful. And as for this Russian blockade. My prediction is that it is going to be there until the end of the war. This week&#x27;s attack on the Crimea Bridge and today&#x27;s attack on Russia&#x27;s largest arms depot in Crimea has made that a certainty.

North Korea launched two ballistic missiles eastward early on Wednesday, Japan’s and South Korea’s militaries said, just hours after a U.S. ballistic missile submarine arrived in a South Korean port for the first time in four decades. 
Both of the missiles appeared to have fallen outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone, the Japanese Defense Ministry said.

South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, or JCS, called on the North to cease such launches.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will take part in the summit of BRICS leaders in South Africa via video link, spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. 
The host nation announced earlier on Wednesday that the Russian leader will not attend the high-profile event in person.

Putin’s contribution to the gathering next month will be “comprehensive” despite its remote nature, Peskov told the Russian media on Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will travel to Johannesburg in person to serve as Moscow’s representative, he added, confirming a previous statement by the South African government.

Russia will be represented by Foreign Minister Lavrov at the summit.

A U.S. Army private who had just finished a stint in a South Korean detention facility crossed the border into North Korea &quot;without authorization&quot; and is in custody in the secretive country, United Nations and U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
The soldier was identified as 23-year-old Pvt. Travis King, a U.S. official confirmed. He&#x27;s been a cavalry scout in the Army since January 2021 and has no deployments, according to service information provided by Army spokesperson Bryce Dubee.

                              <span>Cohen, who has previously said that former president Donald Trump&#x27;s disrespect for the security of classified information really amounts to a disrespect for the men and women behind that classified information who put their lives on the line for the country, was asked on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta about the &quot;far-right Republicans&quot; who argue that culture war add-ons recently passed in the House as part of a military budget &quot;will help rid the military to what they describe as wokeness.&quot;
Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
&quot;We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars,&quot; he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a &quot;wokeness problem,&quot; Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
&quot;What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?&quot;

                              <span>At least 500 people were evacuated on Saturday and further evacuations were expected after a forest fire broke out on the Spanish island of La Palma. 
The fire started early in the morning near the village of Puntagorda in the north-west of the Canary Island. A lasting drought and high winds meant the fire spread quickly, according to the mayor of the village, Vicente Rodríguez, who spoke to state television broadcaster RTVE. 
Firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames as the wind kept changing direction. At least 11 houses burned down and an area of about 140 hectares was destroyed.</span>

South Korea is at the peak of its summer monsoon season and there has been heavy rainfall for the last three days, triggering widespread flooding and landslides, and causing a major dam to overflow.
The interior ministry reported that 22 people had been killed and another 14 were missing in the heavy downpours, mostly buried by landslides or after falling into a flooded reservoir.
The majority of the casualties -- including 16 dead and nine missing -- come from North Gyeongsang province, largely due to massive landslides in the mountainous area that engulfed houses with people inside.

                              <span>The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of &quot;permanent, irreversible harm&quot; to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister&#x27;s granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps&#x27; successor Mark Harper said he was &quot;satisfied&quot; that the project&#x27;s &quot;harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits&quot;.
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
&quot;This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it&#x27;s not over yet,&quot; Gooding said.

                              <span>Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey on Friday spent a second day in the witness box at a London court, denying sexual assault charges and claiming the prosecution case against him was weak.
The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a &quot;sexual bully&quot; who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men&#x27;s crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…</span>

The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia&#x27;s military campaign in Ukraine.
&quot;I feel total despair,&quot; said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
&quot;If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned,&quot; he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

The country may be synonymous with the beautiful game, but it banned women from the sport for nearly four decades until 1979.
Ahead of the Women&#x27;s World Cup starting next week in Australia and New Zealand, where Brazil will be in action, Mendes recalled the lengths she went to in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a soccer player.
As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil&#x27;s impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.
She used to dig a hole next to the pitch to hide in until the enforcers left, then crawled out again to continue kicking the ball aroun…</span>

                              <span>The Athens Acropolis, Greece&#x27;s top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening &quot;to protect workers and visitors&quot;, Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
&quot;It&#x27;s highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.</span>

                              <span>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
&quot;Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;He needs to lift the holdings,&quot; said Austin. &quot;This is a national security issue, a readiness issue.&quot;
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin&#x27;s call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
&quot;Is that something you&#x27;re willing to deal with, negotiate?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that&#x27;s an important policy,&quot; said Austin. &quot;I think our troops don&#x27;t get to choose where they&#x27;re assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I&#x27;m proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.&quot;
&quot;So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;That&#x27;s our policy,&quot; said Austin.

President Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s greenlight, which ended more than a year of opposition to Sweden&#x27;s membership bid, came as a surprise even to allies at home who had supported him in demanding Stockholm first take steps against groups deemed terrorists by Ankara.

This comes as President Joe Biden, who has already declared his confidence that Ukraine will be triumphant over the Kremlin invasion, proclaimed that they already have at a summit in Helsinki, during celebrations about Finland&#x27;s admission into NATO.

                              <span>The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been &quot;eaten alive.&quot;
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates &quot;do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.&quot; 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,&quot; she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson&#x27;s death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a &quot;racial justice issue,&quot; citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was &quot;almost completely detached from the base of his neck.&quot; The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use &quot;new plates and fixations in the damaged area.&quot; 
&quot;Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room,&quot; Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
&quot;The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing,&quot; Einav said.</span>

Sources at the BBC claim presenter Victoria Derbyshire was investigating accusations about Edwards’ conduct in the days before The Sun made its claims. Last week Derbyshire’s enquiries sparked concern among BBC staff, but it is not clear if senior editors in the news team were aware of the work, according to Deadline. The revelation has raised concerns about whether allegations regarding Edwards were circulating in the newsroom and if senior managers were inf...</span>

                              <span>Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denied any &quot;aggressive&quot; behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to &quot;come off the road&quot;.
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said &quot;it didn&#x27;t happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way&quot;.
&quot;It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic,&quot; Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a &quot;big flirt&quot;.
But the alleged victim &quot;made it clear that he did not want to go any further,&quot; the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt &quot;crushed&quot; after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a &quot;stab in the back&quot;.
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as &quot;madness&quot;.
&quot;I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn&#x27;t and never have to anyone in my life,&quot; Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn&#x27;t recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, was artistic director of London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
