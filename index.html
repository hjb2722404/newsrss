“These documents which he’s being charged under the Espionage Act for, are not as serious as you may think they are,” Mr Siracusa told Sky News Australia.</span>

                              <span>The dramatic reenactment of Prince Harry’s court trial was “fairly accurate” in portraying how the Duke of Sussex tried to “pull at the heartstrings” of the judge, says writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue.

&quot;People online have been saying it’s not Prince Harry but Prince Barry because of the nature of the re-enactment,&quot; Ms Krakue told Sky News host Danica De Giorgio. 

“I think ‘theatre’ is the right way to describe it and I mean, it’s  … fairly accurate in the way that Prince Harry was trying to pull at the heartstrings, or tug at the heartstrings of the judge in this particular case but unfortunately that’s not how a courtroom works.

“A courtroom works based on facts and not your feelings.”</span>

DNYUZ/New York Times: As Ukraine Launches Counteroffensive, Definitions of ‘Success’ Vary 
After months of anticipation, Ukraine’s forces — newly trained on complex warfare tactics and armed with billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weaponry — launched operations on multiple fronts in the past week in an effort to dislodge entrenched Russian military units, a counteroffensive that many officials in the United States and Europe say could be a turning point in the 15-month war.

Highlights: The U.S. military drone RQ-4B Global Hawk was engaged in reconnaissance in the airspace of the Black Sea at the time of the attack. The Ukrainian military tried to attack the ship &quot;Priazovye&quot; with the help of six sea high-speed unmanned boats. The Russian ship carried out security tasks along the routes of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of Black Sea. All of them were destroyed, there were no casualties, the ship was not damaged.

It appears that after a few days of fighting Ukrainian forces have been able to advance along some parts of the front-lines, but the casualty numbers and equipment losses are staggering. Thousands killed and wounded, and hundreds of armored and other military vehicles destroyed. 
But what is shocking is that even with these heavy losses, they still have not reached any of the Russian fortified lines. 
An army that is advancing against fortified and prepared positions will always suffer heavy losses. But unless there is a change in strategy and/or a breakthrough, this counteroffensive will be seen by future historians as a disaster.</span>

                              <span>The Hill: Nearly half in new poll say Trump indictment is politically motivated  
Almost half of Americans in a new poll said that they believe the federal indictment of former President Trump is politically motivated after he was charged with 37 counts in relation to the alleged mishandling of records at his Mar-a-Lago estate. 
Forty-seven percent of respondents in the ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday say the charges against Trump are politically motivated, while 37 percent say they are not. Sixteen percent say they are not sure. 
Most Republicans — 80 percent — say the charges announced last week are politically motivated, with only 16 percent of Democrats aligning with that view. 
By comparison, 71 percent of Democrats say the charges are not rooted in politics. Only nine percent of Republicans say the same.

WNU Editor: Only half?!?!?!? 
The details of the ABC/IPSOS poll are here .... Most Americans view latest Trump charges as serious (IPSOS). 
Update: Lawyer Robert Barnes is right (see tweet below). But that is not the media or political narrative right now.

Any executive branch document created before or during a Presidency is the President&#x27;s to do with as he pleases. That&#x27;s the point of The Presidential Records Act. It has to be that way to keep Constitutional power in the hands of the only elected official of the executive branch.…

                              <span>Reuters: Russia says it hits Leopard tanks, U.S. Bradley vehicles in Ukraine 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia on Sunday said it had destroyed at least seven German-made Leopard tanks and five U.S.-made Bradley vehicles over 48 hours while repelling Ukrainian attacks, though Russian bloggers reported Ukraine had briefly pierced part of the Russian line.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged on Saturday that his military was engaged in &quot;counter-offensive and defensive operations&quot;, a day after President Vladimir Putin said Russia had repelled the first attacks of the offensive. 
Russia&#x27;s defence ministry said it had repelled more than a dozen Ukrainian attacks over the past day in three major directions and had destroyed a column of armoured vehicles of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in the Zaporizhzhia region.

Reuters: Russia says Ukraine tried to attack Russian ship near major gas pipelines in Black Sea 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine had made unsuccessful attempt to attack a Russian naval ship with six high-speed drone boats as the Russian vessel patrolled major natural gas pipelines in the Black Sea. 
The &#x27;Priazovye&#x27; ship was carrying out what Russia&#x27;s defence ministry said was &quot;monitoring of the situation and ensuring security along the routes of the TurkStream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of the Black Sea.&quot; 
Ukraine attacked in the early hours of Sunday about 300 km south-east of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia&#x27;s Black Sea fleet on the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, the defence ministry said.

                              <span>France 24: Fighting resumes in Sudan after 24-hour ceasefire ends

 
Shelling and gunfire resumed Sunday in the Sudanese capital, witnesses said, at the end of a 24-hour ceasefire that had given civilians rare respite from nearly two months of war.  
Deadly fighting has raged in the northeast African country since mid-April, when army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), turned on each other. 
The latest in a series of ceasefire agreements enabled civilians trapped in the capital Khartoum to venture outside and stock up on food and other essential supplies. 
But only 10 minutes after it ended at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday the capital was rocked again by the sound of shelling and clashes, witnesses told AFP.

A crashed UFO recovered by the US military &#x27;distorted space-time&#x27; and was &#x27;bigger on the inside&#x27;, claims a top attorney involved in bringing UFO whistleblowers to Congress. 
Daniel Sheehan says he was told the mind-boggling tale by a whistleblower who allegedly took part in an illegally-undisclosed program retrieving crashed non-human spacecraft – and who has now briefed Senate Intelligence Committee staff. 
The lawyer&#x27;s story is the latest in a series of stunning claims this week of UFOs in the government&#x27;s hands, which began on Monday with an on-camera interview of former senior Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch alleging that the US government possesses multiple crashed &#x27;non-human&#x27; craft.

Pledge Times: American General Milli announced the formation of the three superpowers of the world 
The US, Russia and China are the superpowers in the emerging multipolar world. This was announced on Thursday, June 8, by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, at the graduation ceremony for graduates of the National Defense University. 
“During the Cold War, there were two great powers. After the destruction of the Berlin Wall, there was a period when the United States remained the only superpower. Today it is becoming clear that we are in a multipolar environment with at least three great powers: the US, Russia and China,” he said. 
Milley believes that other states are beginning to take leading positions in their region, openly mentioning ambitions for leadership in the world.

A new poll found a surprising percentage of Gen Z Americans supporting the idea of the government placing cameras in every home in order to prevent crime and abuse. 
The finding was a part of a poll of 2,000 Americans by the Cato Institute. 

The poll asked whether Americans supported &quot;the government installing surveillance cameras in every household to reduce domestic violence, abuse, and other illegal activity.” 
Overall, very few Americans supported the idea, about 14 percent, or one out of every seven respondents. A large majority, 75%, opposed the idea, and only 10% said they weren&#x27;t sure.

But among those aged below 30 years, 29% said they supported the idea, almost a third of respondents in that age group. 
The poll asked whether Americans supported &quot;the government installing surveillance cameras in every household to reduce domestic violence, abuse, and other illegal activity.”

The Guardian: China has used Cuba as spy base for years, US official says 
Chinese intelligence collection from Cuba predates the Biden era, with facilities upgraded in 2019, White House official says 
China has been spying from Cuba for some time and upgraded its intelligence collection facilities there in 2019, a Biden administration official said on Saturday, following a report about a new spying effort underway on the island. 
China had reached a secret deal with Cuba to establish an electronic eavesdropping facility on the island roughly 100 miles (160km) from Florida, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday but the US and Cuban governments cast strong doubt on the report.

BBC: Ukraine counter-offensive actions have begun, Zelensky says 
Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have confirmed that his country&#x27;s long-awaited counter-offensive against Russia has started. 
&quot;Counter-offensive and defensive actions are taking place,&quot; he said.

But he added that he would not talk in detail about which stage or state the counter-offensive was in. 
The comments come after an escalation of fighting in the south and east of Ukraine and speculation about progress of the widely anticipated push. 
Ukrainian troops are reported to have advanced in the east near Bakhmut and in the south near Zaporizhzhia, and have carried out long-range strikes on Russian targets. 
But assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with the two warring sides presenting contrasting narratives: Ukraine claiming progress and Russia that it is fighting off attacks.

                              <span>Simplicius The Thinker: Anatomy of a NATO-Planned, Trained, and Armed Disaster 
As the smoke cleared the battlefield, we were left witness to a disaster of unprecedented proportions. NATO’s most advanced tanks and armor were left as smoking ruins: 
The most shocking development was the closeups revealed that these weren’t just any NATO tanks and IFVs, but were in fact some of the most advanced upgraded variants. Many of the Leopards destroyed were not the older 2A4s but in fact the much newer 2A6s, which are some of the most advanced tanks in the world. 
The losses by some counts are staggering for a single assault:

    
The Ukrainian Telegram channel &quot;Rezident&quot; reports that, according to its sources, in the previous three days the AFU has lost over 150 units of heavy equipment, including 12 German Leopard MBTs and 15 American M2 Bradley IFVs.

Red State: &#x27;Embarrassing&#x27;: Air Force Twitter Account Sparks Outrage After Going Way Too Far in Honor of ‘Pride Month&#x27; 
The recruiting crisis within the U.S. military is a very real thing, and while senior military leaders and “military experts” have been putting the blame squarely on young people, all signs point to the bigger issue boiling down primarily to one thing: the federal government’s dangerous obsession with all things woke. 
And when I say “dangerous,” I’m not engaging in hyperbole. My RedState colleague streiff explained it well in a recent post:

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran&#x27;s supreme leader on Sunday said a deal with the West over Tehran&#x27;s nuclear work was possible if the country&#x27;s nuclear infrastructure remained intact, amid a stalemate between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.
Months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since September, with both sides accusing each other of making unreasonable demands.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#x27;s guarded approval comes days after both Tehran and Washington denied a report that they were nearing an interim deal under which Tehran would curb its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

The police investigation is looking at what happened to more than 600,000 pounds ($750,000) raised by Scottish independence campaigners in 2017, which was supposed to have been ring-fenced but may have been used for other purposes.

COLONELGUNJ, India (Reuters) - The chief of the Wrestling Federation of India, under police investigation for suspected sexual misconduct after accusations by female athletes, held a political rally on Sunday in his first public appearance since the probe was launched in April.
Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, also a federal lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s ruling party, is the subject of a criminal case filed by seven female wrestlers who accused him of groping young athletes at training camps and tournaments.
Singh has denied all the allegations. Delhi police are investigating and will submit their findings before a trial court on Thursday.
&quot;I will not comment on the allegations. I am waiting for the court order on this case,&quot; Singh told reporters at the Sunday ga…</span>

KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - For Kherson resident Iryna Radetska, the catastrophic flooding of her city after the giant Kakhovka dam was destroyed is the latest chapter in more than a year of wartime suffering.
&quot;They say a new love kills the old one. Maybe it&#x27;s the same with tragedy,&quot; said 52-year-old Radetska, who is deputy head of a school in the southern Ukrainian city.
Few places have felt the extent of suffering that Kherson has since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Few people bore the brunt of it harder than Radetska, who said she has survived imprisonment, beatings and rockets.
The city, which had a peacetime population of 280,000, was occupied by Russian forces on March 2, 2022. It was liberated by Ukrainian troops in early November, but since then has b…</span>

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) - Honduras opened an embassy in China on Sunday, Chinese state media reported, after the Central American nation cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan earlier this year.
The embassy in Beijing was opened by foreign ministers from the two countries, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro is in China for a state visit, during which she is to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, state media have reported.
Tegucigalpa in March ended its decades-long relationship with Taipei and established diplomatic ties with Beijing.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

The commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral John Aquilino, highlighted the military’s threatening posture towards China, speaking at the annual meeting of the National Committee on US-China Relations last month. The group is known for encouraging engagement between the world’s two largest economies. 
In yet another confirmation that the White House has overturned the long-standing “strategic ambiguity” policy regarding Taiwan, Aquilino went so far as to say President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin have tasked him to win a war against China if Beijing attacks the island.

                              <span>Politico: The Pentagon Is Freaking Out About a Potential War With China  
The war began in the early morning hours with a massive bombardment — China’s version of “shock and awe.” Chinese planes and rockets swiftly destroyed most of Taiwan’s navy and air force as the People’s Liberation army and navy mounted a massive amphibious assault across the 100-mile Taiwan Strait. Having taken seriously President Joe Biden’s pledge to defend the island, Beijing also struck pre-emptively at U.S. and allied air bases and ships in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. managed to even the odds for a time by deploying more sophisticated submarines as well as B-21 and B-2 stealth bombers to get inside China’s air defense zones, but Washington ran out of key munitions in a matter of days and saw its network access severed. The United States and its main ally, Japan, lost thousands of servicemembers, dozens of ships, and hundreds of aircraft. Taiwan’s economy was devastated. And as a protracted siege ensued, the U.S. was much slower to rebuild, taking years to replace ships as it reckoned with how shriveled its industrial base had become compared to China’s.

CNN: China and Russia plan joint military drills as top generals meet virtually 
China and Russia will again hold joint military drills this year, top generals from each side confirmed in a virtual meet Friday, according to China’s defense ministry. 
The chief of the Joint Staff Department of China’s Central Military Commission held a video meeting with Valery Gerasimov, chief of General Staff of the Russian armed forces. 
The meeting was held to “exchange views on implementing the consensus of the two heads of state and deepening cooperation between the two armies,” China’s defense ministry stated. 
On June 6, China and Russia held joint air force drills over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

Oil prices rose early on Wednesday as Chinese data showed crude imports into the world’s top oil importer jumped in May, recovering from a weak April.

China imported a total of 12.11 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in May, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, as refiners returned from maintenance and moved to stockpile crude.

The Diplomat: India Not Planning to Invite Ukraine to G20 Summit in September

 
Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited to participate in last year’s G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. 
India is not planning to invite Ukraine to the summit of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in September, its external affairs minister said Thursday.
“In our view, G-20 participation is for members and organizations we have invited. That list we declared as soon as we assumed the G-20 presidency” in December, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told reporters. 
Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but Russia is part of the grouping. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the two remain at war. India has avoided condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine and has sought to end it through diplomacy and dialogue.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Iceland&#x27;s foreign ministry will suspend its embassy operations in Moscow from Aug. 1 and has asked Russia to scale back its diplomatic activities in Reykjavik, the ministry said in a statement on Friday.
Iceland&#x27;s embassy operations are being suspended due to an &#x27;all-time low&#x27; level of commercial, cultural and political relations between the two countries, the ministry said.

Politico:  Pressure builds on Biden to send long-range weapons to Ukraine

 
The House members want the administration to greenlight the Army Tactical Missile System for Kyiv. 
U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are making a renewed push for the Biden administration to send Ukraine controversial long-range munitions, as Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive appears to get underway. 
With a range of 190 miles, nearly four times that of Ukraine’s existing rockets, the Army Tactical Missile System has been the subject of intense debate for months. 
Nearly a year ago, national security adviser Jake Sullivan feared that sending ATACMS could make the conflict eventually spiral into World War III, because Ukraine could use the weapon to attack deep inside Russian territory. 
More recently, there are growing concerns inside the Pentagon that the U.S. doesn’t have many to spare anyway.

The United States alone is sending 2,000 US Air National Guard personnel and about 100 aircraft to take part in the June 12 to 23 training manoeuvres.

Update: Not everyone is onboard with this exercise .... Hundreds demonstrate in Germany ahead of Air Defender 2023 exercise (DPA). 
Update #2: Yup! .... Air Defender 23 doesn&#x27;t show NATO&#x27;s strength but rather its US dependency (Washington Examiner).

                              <span>Reuters: Russia Says It Repels Ukraine&#x27;s Offensive in East and South 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Defence Ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine&#x27;s forces have continued &quot;unsuccessful&quot; attempts in the past 24 hours to launch attacks south of Donetsk and in Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in the area of the eastern city of Bakhmut. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Ukrainian forces had certainly begun their expected counteroffensive in intense fighting in Ukraine, but that every attempted advance had failed, at a heavy cost in casualties. 
Reuters was not able to independently verify that assertion or the situation on the battlefield.

                              <span>For 40 days after their plane crashed, four Indigenous children were lost in the Colombian Amazon rainforest.
A major search operation, with rescuers finding a steady string of clues about their whereabouts, came to an end on Friday with the discovery of the children alive.
They were flown to the capital Bogota early Saturday, where ambulances awaited. AFP looks at the timeline of events.
Doomed flight
On the morning of May 1, a Cessna 206 plane run by Avianline Charters left a jungle area known as Araracuara to head for San Jose del Guaviare, one of the main towns in the Colombian Amazon.
On board were the pilot, an Indigenous leader of the Huitoto community, as well as Magdalena Mucutui Valencia and her four children -- aged 13, nine, four and 11 months.

                              <span>In a square in central Warsaw, a couple of people are bent over a huge sculpture of a blue egg, their heads turned and pressed against the shell.
As they listen to the soft sounds of a baby bird hatching, a hooded crow cocks his head and sips from a shallow pool of water installed nearby.
&quot;This chick and the mini-pond next to it speak to a sensitivity to Warsaw&#x27;s non-human residents,&quot; Warsaw deputy mayor Aldona Machnowska-Gora said at the unveiling.
&quot;Don&#x27;t hesitate to walk up to the egg and hug it. It makes for an incredible experience,&quot; she said.
Located at Five Corners Square -- once home to an arena where animals would fight to the death -- the acoustic installation titled The Hatchling is a call for empathy with other lifeforms in the era of climate change.

Sitting at a desk across the room painting religious icons, her husband Giannis nodded silently.
&quot;My husband can&#x27;t do anything without me, not even his tax return,&quot; Pavlidis laughed as she embroidered a traditional dress inside her workshop.
In contrast to most of patriarchal Greece, the women of Olympos play a commanding role in village life.
Isolated from the rest of the Dodecanese island, the spectacular hillside village has safeguarded this centuries-old tradition, which has survived the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and Italian rule in the 20th.
Until the 1980s, there was no asphalt road to Olympos.

                              <span>Four Indigenous children who had been missing for more than a month in the Colombian Amazon rainforest were found alive and flown to the capital Bogota early Saturday.
The children, who survived a small plane crash in the jungle, were transported by army medical plane to a military airport at around 00:30 am Saturday (0530 GMT).
They were taken off the plane on stretchers, wrapped in thermal blankets, with ambulances waiting to bring them to hospital, AFP journalists said.
General Pedro Sanchez, who led the search operation, credited Indigenous people involved in the rescue effort with finding the children.
&quot;We found the children: miracle, miracle, miracle!&quot; was the message he told reporters he received on Friday.

                              <span>Two giant yellow ducks meant to signify good fortune in Hong Kong ran into bad luck of their own after one was deflated Saturday to protect it from the heat.
The art installation by Dutch artist Forentijn Hofman, featuring twin 18-metre (59-feet) inflatable ducks, was unveiled to the public on Friday.
The exhibition came a decade after one of Hofman&#x27;s air-filled avians first visited the Chinese city, with the artist saying the new work would bring &quot;double luck&quot;.
But organisers had to let the air out of one bird due to high summer temperatures, which on Saturday reached highs of 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
The &quot;rubber duck skin had become strained because the hot weather has caused air pressure to rise&quot;, the organizers said in a statement.
The affected creature was drained of air to &quot;avoid risk&quot; and was pending repair, organizers said, leaving just one sitting duck in Hong Kong&#x27;s Victoria Harbour.
Hofman&#x27;s Rubber Duck series has made appearances in major cities since its 2007 debut, and made headlines in Hong Kong when it arrived in 2013.
That exhibit lasted 13 days before it, too, was deflated.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in a jungle in Colombia&#x27;s south following a deadly plane crash arrived in the capital Bogota early on Saturday for medical treatment.
The siblings were found on Friday in Colombia&#x27;s Caqueta province according to the country&#x27;s armed forces and were initially treated by military medics who had been among the search teams searching for them.
The mission to find the four siblings, called Operation Hope, captured the imagination of Colombians as reports of clues to their whereabouts fueled longing they would be found safely despite spending more than a month in the inhospitable jungle.
&quot;We did everything necessary to make the impossible possible, using satellites, using aircraft that launched messages, that launched food, that launched flyers, that launched hope,&quot; General Pedro Sanchez, commander of the military&#x27;s joint command for special operations said at an air base in Bogota.
In photos shared by Colombia&#x27;s military, the four children - three girls and a boy - appeared gaunt as they were being cared for by rescuers.
After the plane carrying the children landed in Bogota, four ambulances were waiting at to collect them and take them to a military hospital for specialist medical care.
They had been missing in the jungle since a Cessna 206 carrying seven people on a route between Araracuara, in Caqueta, and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure in the early hours of May 1.
Three adults, including the pilot and the children&#x27;s mother, died in the crash and their bodies were found inside the plane. The siblings, aged 13, 9, 4, as well as a now 12-month-old baby, survived the impact.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House said on Friday that Russia appeared to be deepening its defense cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it is using to strike Ukraine.
Citing newly declassified information, the White House said the drones, or Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), were built in Iran, shipped across the Caspian Sea and then used by Russian forces against Ukraine.
&quot;Russia has been using Iranian UAVs in recent weeks to strike Kyiv and terrorize the Ukrainian population, and the Russia-Iran military partnership appears to be deepening,&quot; White House spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.
&quot;We are also concerned that Russia is working with Iran to produce Iranian UAVs from inside Russia.&quot;

                              <span>BELGRADE (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Serbians joined an anti-government protest in Belgrade on Friday for the sixth time since May 3, blaming a culture of violence for the deaths of 18 people in two mass shootings and calling on the interior minister to resign.
Chanting &quot;(Serbian President Aleksandar) Vucic out!&quot; and holding a big banner reading &quot;Students against violence,&quot; the protesters gathered in front of the parliament and marched to the government building.
Serbia was rocked last month by two unprecedented shootings that happened on consecutive days. On May 3, a teenager killed ten at an elementary school. On May 4, a 21-year-old man killed eight in a town near Belgrade.

&quot;School strike week 251,&quot; Thunberg tweeted. &quot;Today, I graduate from school, which means I&#x27;ll no longer be able to school strike for the climate.&quot;

Thunberg, who is now 20, first made headlines at the age of 15 when she refused to attend school during the three-week lead-up to September Swedish elections in an effort to persuade politicians to take action on the climate crisis.

Washington Post: Saudi crown prince threatened ‘major’ economic pain on U.S. amid oil feud 
Last fall, President Biden vowed to impose “consequences” on Saudi Arabia for its decision to slash oil production amid high energy prices and fast-approaching elections in the United States. 
In public, the Saudi government defended its actions politely via diplomatic statements. But in private, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman threatened to fundamentally alter the decades-old U.S.-Saudi relationship and impose significant economic costs on the United States if it retaliated against the oil cuts, according to a classified document obtained by The Washington Post.

Politico:  White House anxiously watches Ukraine’s counteroffensive, seeing the war and Biden’s reputation at stake

 
With the debt ceiling done, attention turns to the challenges piling up internationally.  
Senior U.S. officials are convinced that future support for the Ukraine war — and President Joe Biden’s global reputation — hinges on the success of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. 
Succeed and Western military and economic aid will flow. Stumble or fail to meet expectations, and that support will likely dry up, sparking heightened calls for an expedited diplomatic resolution and hampering one of the White House’s signature international achievements.

(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon is set to announce as early as Friday a long-term arms package for Ukraine heavy on air defense munitions valued at more than $2 billion, according to administration officials. 
The money, to be awarded under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, will bankroll the purchase of Hawk missile launchers and missiles and two types of advanced Patriot air defense missiles. 
One is the Patriot Advanced Capability Missile-3, or Pac-3, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp. The other is called the Guidance Enhanced Missile, or GEM-T, made by Raytheon Technologies Corp that it says “provides improved ability to defeat tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or enemy aircraft in complement to the PAC-3 missile.”

 RT: Putin comments on Ukrainian counteroffensive 
Kiev’s long-anticipated push to retake lost territories has started, the Russian president says  
The much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive has started, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. He cited the deployment of Kiev’s strategic reserves as a telltale sign of the operation. 
“We can state with absolute certainty that this Ukrainian counteroffensive has begun, and the use of strategic reserves points to it,” Putin said at a press conference on Friday. 
The president noted that particularly heavy fighting has been ongoing for five days, with Russian troops managing to hold their positions. 
He also claimed that the Ukrainian military has suffered far heavier casualties than the “classic” three-to-one ratio often expected during an offensive.

CBS News: Putin puts a date on his plan to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus
 Russia will start deploying nuclear weapons in Belarus when the necessary facilities there are ready there in early July, President Vladimir Putin told the Belarussian leader at a Friday meeting. 
It was the first time Russia&#x27;s president has suggested a specific timeframe for his plans, announced in March, to deploy &quot;tactical nuclear weapons&quot; to the country just north of Ukraine, which is one of Russia&#x27;s few allies in the region. 
&quot;Everything is going to plan,&quot; Putin said in a televised portion of his meeting with Belarus&#x27; longtime authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi, on Russia&#x27;s Black Sea coast, adding that the two countries were deepening their cooperation on security.

                              <span>Reuters: Russia says it repels heavy Ukrainian attacks in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Friday it had repelled fierce Ukrainian offensives in the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions, killing more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops and destroying dozens of tanks and armoured vehicles. 
Russia&#x27;s top military brass briefed President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that their troops had successfully pushed back a series of attacks which Moscow says are part of a so-far unsuccessful counter-offensive by Ukraine since Sunday. 
&quot;The armed forces of Ukraine continued attempts to conduct offensive operations in the southern Donetsk and Zaporozhzhia directions,&quot; the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. 
It said Ukrainian forces had attacked Russian lines four times with two battalions supported with tanks just south of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk, but were pushed back.

Russian forces had also repelled two attacks just south of city of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
