                              <span>Business Insider: Russia is quickly depleting its fleet of warplanes through overuse, and Ukraine deploying F-16s could worsen the situation: expert 
* An engineering expert says the Russian air force is being depleted through overuse in Ukraine. 
* The arrival of Ukraine&#x27;s F-16s could worsen the problem, wrote Rand&#x27;s Michael Bohnert. 
* Ukraine says it urgently needs F-16s to reduce Russia&#x27;s air dominance. 
Russia&#x27;s fighter planes are malfunctioning because of overuse, handing Ukraine a potential advantage in its air battles against the Russian air force, an engineering expert said. 
In an article for Defense News, Michael Bohnert, an engineer at the Rand Corporation think tank, said that Russia&#x27;s warplanes were running out of &quot;aircraft life&quot;. 
&quot;Overuse of these aircraft is also costing Russia as the war drags on,&quot; he wrote, adding that by his calculations as many as 57 Russian planes, many repurposed Soviet-era machines, might have been lost because they broke down since the start of the war.

Washington has chosen its own interests over its allies, a French diplomat has told the newspaper, following Victoria Nuland’s visit to Niger. 
The presence of the ‘Maidan midwife,’ US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, in post-coup Niger has enraged Washington’s NATO ally, France, Le Figaro reported over the weekend, citing a source within the French Foreign Ministry. 
The US “did the exact opposite of what we thought they would do,” a French diplomatic source told the paper, adding that “with allies like these, we do not need enemies.” 
Paris has been insisting on the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Bazoum ever since a new military government came to power in Niger in a coup in late July.

Niger’s junta claimed Sunday it had gathered evidence to prosecute the country’s ousted President Mohamed Bazoum for “high treason,” upping the stakes in their brinkmanship against key neighbors in West Africa who have vowed to restore constitutional order in the coup-hit country. 
“The Nigerien government has to date, gathered the necessary evidence to prosecute the deposed president and his local and foreign accomplices before the competent national and international authorities for high treason and undermining internal and external security of Niger,” said a statement by the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) of Niger, the military council that toppled the government in July.

According to the defense minister, Ukraine&#x27;s defeat will become &quot;a factor in combating modern neocolonialism&quot; 
PATRIOT PARK /Moscow Region/, August 15. /TASS/. Ukraine’s military resources are &quot;almost exhausted,&quot; while Moscow’s special military operation has made it clear that there is nothing on the battlefield that is invulnerable to Russian weapons, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said in an address to the 11th Moscow Conference on International Security. 
According to him, history has once again chosen Russia to be &quot;a driving force promoting the interests of the majority of independent states,&quot; while Kiev’s defeat will become &quot;a factor in combating modern neocolonialism.&quot;

* Fitch Ratings cut its assessment of the banking industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
* But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score from AA- to A+ would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC. 
* “If we were to move it to A+, then that would recalibrate all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions,” Wolfe said.
A Fitch Ratings analyst warned that the U.S. banking industry has inched closer to another source of turbulence — the risk of sweeping rating downgrades on dozens of U.S. banks that could even include the likes of JPMorgan Chase. 
The ratings agency cut its assessment of the industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score, to A+ from AA-, would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in an exclusive interview at the firm’s New York headquarters.

Reuters: US, South Korea, Japan to launch new defence steps at Camp David: Officials 
WASHINGTON – The United States, Japan and South Korea will launch a series of joint initiatives on technology, education and defence when the countries’ leaders gather at Camp David on Friday, according to senior US administration officials, amid mounting shared concerns about China. 
While the summit is unlikely to produce a formal security arrangement that commits the nations to each others’ defence, they will agree to mutual understanding about regional responsibilities and set up a three-way hotline to communicate in times of crisis, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
US President Joe Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol to the storied presidential retreat in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains as the Asian nations work to mend their tattered diplomatic relations in the face of greater regional threats posed both by China’s rise and North Korea.

August 15 has been declared a national holiday to celebrate the Taliban government, which is still not recognised by any country. 
The Afghan Taliban is marking the second anniversary of its return to power with a public holiday, celebrating the takeover of Kabul and the establishment of what it described as security across the country under an “Islamic system”. 
“On the second anniversary of the conquest of Kabul, we would like to congratulate the mujahid [holy warrior] nation of Afghanistan and ask them to thank Almighty Allah for this great victory,” the spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said in a statement on Tuesday.

* The moves were a bid by the government to calm markets in the wake of the Argentinian congressman’s surprise victory. 
* Argentinian stocks and its sovereign dollar bonds were also lower Monday. 
Argentina’s central bank devalued its currency, the peso, by close to 18% and hiked its benchmark interest rate by a whopping 21 percentage points to 118% on Monday following a shock primary election win by far-right libertarian Javier Milei. 
The moves were a bid by the government to calm markets in the wake of the Argentinian congressman’s surprise victory, which gave him the largest share of votes in the country’s presidential primary election at roughly 30%, far exceeding forecasts. 
Markets had been betting on favorable results for moderate candidates. Argentina’s presidential election will be held in October.

President Vladimir Zelensky has criticized Ukrainian civilians for not showing enough solidarity with the soldiers risking their lives on the frontlines in the conflict with Russia.
“Ukraine is at war. And those who are not fighting on the frontline must help fight. Not in bars, not in clubs, not by street racing or some kind of ostentatious consumption, but by helping the warriors in a very specific way. To say the least of it,” Zelensky said on Monday in his nightly video address.

Reuters: US to send Ukraine new security aid worth $200 million, State Dept says 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States said on Monday it will send Ukraine new security assistance valued at $200 million, including air defense munitions, artillery rounds, and additional mine-clearing equipment. 
The assistance will also include anti-armor capabilities, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. 
Two U.S. officials told Reuters last Monday that Washington would begin to dole out $6.2 billion of funds discovered after a Pentagon accounting error that overvalued billions of dollars of Ukraine aid.

The Telegraph: Germany considers ban on far-Right AfD 
 Germany is debating whether to ban the far-Right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as the party surges to 21 per cent in the polls, amid warnings from intelligence officials that its members are becoming increasingly extreme. 
 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, warned in a speech to the country’s domestic intelligence agency that “we all have it in our hands to put those who despise our democracy in their place”. 
His speech at the castle where the German post-war constitution was created has widely been seen as support for a ban after Thomas Haldenwang, the domestic spy chief, warned about growing Right-wing extremist influence in the party.

At least 96 people reported dead after wildfires tore through Maui

President Biden was sharply criticized on Sunday after telling reporters during a Delaware beach getaway that he had &quot;no comment&quot; on the rising death toll in Hawaii from severe wildfires. 
&quot;After a couple hours on the Rehoboth beach, @potus was asked about the rising death toll in Hawaii,&quot; Bloomberg&#x27;s Justin Sink posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. He said that the president responded with &quot;no comment&quot; before he went home. 
Video later confirmed his account, showing as Biden paused briefly before responding and getting into his transportation.

                              <span>Far-right populist candidate Javier Milei emerged as the biggest vote-getter in Argentina&#x27;s primary elections for presidential candidates. With around 92% votes counted, Milei had around 30% of the total vote, making him an unexpected but real contender for the presidency. Milei, an admirer of Trump, wants to abolish the central bank, legalise the sale of human organs, and make it easier to own handguns.</span>

RAF fighters have been scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers north of Shetland. 
The Typhoon jets launched from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray on Monday morning. 
The Russian Tu-142 Bear-F and Tu-142 Bear-J aircraft were monitored in international airspace as they passed north of the UK. 
 Such incidents - known as quick reaction alerts - are not uncommon and involve RAF crews shadowing Russian military aircraft near UK airspace.

WNU Editor: This trip was decided only in the past few weeks. This is also a six day trip, and that tells me that there is going to be a lot of talks on how China and Russia are going to deepen their military alliance. And while the media focus in Russia and China is on the speech that the Chinese defense minister will be making at an international security forum, his behind closed-door meetings with Russia&#x27;s top military brass is where the real focus should be.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for a &quot;drastic boost&quot; in missile production during visits to key weapons factories, state media said Monday, as South Korea and the United States prepared for joint drills next week. 
The tour of the plants from Friday to Saturday came after Kim called for stepping up war preparations at a key military meeting last week. 
Kim&#x27;s two-day inspections included visits to factories producing tactical missiles, large-calibre control multiple rocket launcher shells, as well as armoured combat vehicles, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. 
During the tactical missile factory visit, Kim &quot;expressed satisfaction&quot; as the plant had &quot;perfected the scientific and technological issues arising in production&quot; and pushed ahead with the modernisation of the weapons.

Ukrainian officials said Monday a Russian aerial attack on the southern port city of Odesa injured at least three people. 
The military said air defenses downed all 15 drones Russia used in the attack, as well as eight sea-based missiles, but that falling debris caused damage on the ground. 
Three people were injured after debris fell on a supermarket, and a student dormitory was also damaged. 
Firefighters battled several fires that broke out as a result of the falling rocket fragments, the regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said on Telegram.

A Russian warship fired warning shots and boarded a cargo ship it claims was headed to Ukraine in the Black Sea on Sunday, according to Russia’s defense ministry.
Russia pulled out of a UN and Turkish-brokered deal in July that allowed Ukraine to move its grain via the Black Sea and warned that any ships headed to Ukraine would be treated as potentially carrying weapons. 
Ukraine made a similar threat to ships traveling to Russian ports.

Russia said the warship fired warning shots when the captain of the Palau-flagged dry cargo ship failed to respond to a request to stop for an inspection.

                              <span>The Dreadnought Class SSBN (ballistic missile submarine) will incorporate advanced features. This includes a new multi-layered sound reducing stealth, with built in outer hull.

 
Insider: The British navy is teaming up with the US to build a new &#x27;Dreadnought&#x27; for a totally different battle at sea 
* The British Royal Navy is building a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines. 
* The British subs will have the same missile compartment as the US Navy&#x27;s new missile subs. 
* The name of the new subs recalls the first Dreadnought, a battleship that redefined naval warfare. 
In 1906 the British Royal Navy commissioned HMS Dreadnought, a battleship that changed how surface warships were designed and sparked a naval arms race. 
Armed with five turrets bearing twin 12-inch guns and featuring new technologies like steam turbines and electronic fire-control equipment, HMS Dreadnought became the standard on which future battleships were based and separated the &quot;pre-dreadnought&quot; and &quot;dreadnought&quot; eras. 
 Long after the battleship&#x27;s reign came to an end, the name Dreadnought is still a defining one. The Royal Navy&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, in service from 1963 to 1980, was also called HMS Dreadnought.

This request will face stiffer political headwinds than previous appeals. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, as Ukraine’s very existence swung in the balance, elected officials in the United States generally welcomed President Joseph Biden’s requests for aid. Fortunately, Kyiv’s fierce resistance foiled Russia’s expansive war aims. However, as the fighting has ground on with no end in sight, supplemental aid to Ukraine has become increasingly politicized. Recent polling suggests Americans are skeptical of additional

                              <span>To compete with Russia and China, Washington needs partners. One key way in which Washington has, can, and will secure these partners is by sending them weapons. This, in turn, requires the United States to produce enough weapons, produce the right weapons, and effectively transfer these weapons.  Unfortunately, America is currently failing on all three fronts.

Prince William’s popularity in the United States has soared after a new Gallop poll found he was more popular with the American public than President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. 

“They have nothing to do with the Democrats or the Republicans, and so you see both of these featuring very highly in those polls,” Ms Hewson told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

                              <span>Prince Harry has been putting on a “brave face” after all lingering HRH title references were wiped from the royal website, according to TalkTV Royal Editor Sarah Hewson. 

Ms Hewson said there was a major “cleanup operation” on the website while Prince Harry embarked on his mini tour of Asia.  

“This happened three years ago but it does just give us this very visual representation of just how much their status has changed,” she told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

DW: Germany&#x27;s Scholz calls for more Ukraine peace talks 
The German chancellor said the Saudi-led peace talks and others will help Russia realize it has &quot;taken the wrong path.&quot; Scholz was, however, non-committal on whether Berlin would supply Kyiv with Taurus cruise missiles. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday called for more diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, following a summit on the issue last weekend in Saudi Arabia. 
&quot;It makes sense for us to continue these talks because they increase the pressure on Russia to realize that it has taken the wrong path and that it must withdraw its troops and make peace possible,&quot; Scholz said in his annual summer interview with German public broadcaster ZDF. 
Scholz said the Jeddah security talks were &quot;very important&quot; but &quot;only the beginning, unfortunately.&quot;

Mint Press: Taliban’s Massively Successful Opium Eradication Raises Questions About What US Was Doing All Along  
The Taliban government in Afghanistan – the nation that until recently produced 90% of the world’s heroin – has drastically reduced opium cultivation across the country. Western sources estimate an up to 99% reduction in some provinces. This raises serious questions about the seriousness of U.S. drug eradication efforts in the country over the past 20 years. And, as global heroin supplies dry up, experts tell MintPress News that they fear this could spark the growing use of fentanyl – a drug dozens of times stronger than heroin that already kills more than 100,000 Americans yearly.
 
 
The Taliban Does What the US Did Not 
It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. 
In April of last year, the ruling Taliban government announced the prohibition of poppy farming, citing both their strong religious beliefs and the extremely harmful social costs that heroin and other opioids – derived from the sap of the poppy plant – have wrought across Afghanistan.

 China on Sunday vowed &quot;resolute and forceful measures&quot; over a weekend trip by Taiwan Vice President William Lai to the United States it said it was closely monitoring.  
Lai – the frontrunner in Taiwan&#x27;s presidential elections next year – is officially making only transit stops in the United States en route to and from Paraguay, where he will attend the inauguration of president-elect Santiago Pena. 
Taiwan is claimed by China, which has vowed to take the island democracy one day – by force, if necessary – and ramped up political and military pressure. 
&quot;China is closely following the development of the situation and will take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; an unnamed spokesperson for the foreign ministry said in a statement published online.

&quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters,&quot; Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage&#x27;s exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage&#x27;s complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…</span>

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland&#x27;s trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The musician&#x27;s funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.

At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
&quot;Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory,&quot; Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …</span>

                              <span>Organisers of the World Scout Jamboree asked host South Korea Monday to &quot;urgently&quot; evacuate tens of thousands of children from their campsite ahead of a typhoon, just days after a heatwave caused mass scout illnesses.
Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree &quot;a national disgrace&quot; after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

The US sailors and Marines entered the Red Sea on Sunday after transiting through the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the US Navy&#x27;s Fifth Fleet said in a statement.
They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing &quot;greater flexibility and maritime capability&quot; to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.
The US military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
