                              <span>MASKWACIS, Alta. — Pope Francis on Monday issued a sweeping apology to Indigenous people in their homeland in Canada, responding to a critical demand from many survivors of church-run residential schools that became horrific centers of abuse, forced assimilation, cultural devastation and death for over a century.
“I humbly ask forgiveness for the wrong done by so many Christians against Indigenous peoples,” Francis told a large crowd of Indigenous people, some wearing traditional clothing and headdresses, in Maskwacis, Alberta,  the site of a former boarding school.   
The pope delivered his apology in a powwow circle, a covered ring surrounding an open space used for traditional dancing and drumming circles.  Around it were teepees, campfires and kiosks labeled “Mental Health and Cultural…</span>

                              <span>SACRAMENTO — On a Saturday evening in December, Governor Gavin Newsom of California was so frustrated by a Supreme Court ruling allowing Texas residents to sue abortion providers that he went straight to social media to call for legislation allowing private citizens to enforce his own state’s gun laws.
It sounded so tit for tat that many Californians wondered if he was just trying to ramp up one of his favorite foils, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas.  Others doubted he was serious because it would have meant adopting a bounty enforcement system he considered legally dubious.
Seven months later, Mr. Newsom not only signed the bill on Friday, he leaned into his anti-Republican rhetoric more than ever.  He ran ads in Florida and Texas attacking Republican state governors Ron DeSantis and Mr. Ab…</span>

                              <span>The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for Memphis on Saturday that will continue through Sunday evening, with temperatures expected to reach near 100 degrees with high humidity.
Sunday morning at the Memphis Pizza Cafe, Jesse Williams, 40, was preparing for a long shift in front of a 600 degree oven.
“It’s about 95 degrees here,” he said of the kitchen.  “If I didn’t have this little shop fan blowing on me, I’d probably have heatstroke.”


Mr Williams said he and other kitchen staff had to find ways to stay cool without overloading the air conditioner.


“We do things in the morning, like instead of turning on both ovens, just turn on one and wait until we’re almost open to turn on the other one,” Williams said.  “Take a break. Go stand in the walk-in for a little while and try to cool off,” he added, referring to the kitchen cooler.
After 10 years working at the cafe, Mr Williams said, he is used to working in the summer heat.
“It makes that late afternoon beer that much cooler,” he said.

                              <span>A number of other organizations on either side of the issue have separately campaigned and raised funds on the amendment.
After the Supreme Court’s decision, many more people suddenly took notice of the amendment, said Melinda Lavon, a midwife who helped organize a campaign to vote against it, including text messaging blitzes and events in rural areas.  “People had a lot of emotions about it and they put it to good use.”
John Markert, who supports the amendment, said he was happy with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision but wasn’t sure it would help his side in the vote.  Along the route where he rides his bike several times a week in Lenexa, another Kansas City suburb, more and more road signs have appeared on either side of the issue.
“It brought everything to the fore,” said Markert, who was retired from the mortgage industry and who said his opposition to abortion in almost all cases was motivated by his Christian faith.  “If Roe vs. Wade wouldn’t have been upset, I think ‘Vote Yes’ would have been ‘more likely to win.  He added: “I don’t know if it’s now.”
As Election Day approached, the rhetoric heated up.  Campaign placards on both sides have been stolen or destroyed, according to police and organizers.  In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, vandals target a Catholic church this month, splashing buildings and a statue of Mary with red paint, an episode that police have linked to the abortion debate.
Twice in the past few weeks someone tore down signs supporting the amendment at Faith Baptist Church in Salina, Kansas, pastor Jesse Rowland said.  A third sign has been placed in the cemetery.
“It’s a bit more of trench warfare – everyone is entrenched on one side or the other,” Mr Rowland said.  “No one is talking, really, from what I’ve observed.”

But after a number of devastating shootings across the United States this year, California is tightening those gun rules even further.
This month alone, Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law more than 10 new gun restrictions.  These include new limits on advertising firearms to minors;  increased dealer inspections;  and a 10-year firearms prohibition for those convicted of child abuse or elder abuse.

While organizers kept the nearly one-mile swim in the Hudson River, the 24.8-mile West Side Highway bike leg was cut to 12.4 miles and the 6.2-mile run in large part in Central Park was reduced to 2.5 miles.
Also, as the water temperature had soared to nearly 80 degrees at the start of the race around dawn, the wetsuits – which many triathletes wear to help with buoyancy and to protect against cold water – have been banned.


Most people finished the race well before the temperatures peaked, but organizers acted with caution to participants, volunteers and rescue workers.  There were no reports of serious illness or injury.

   VICE: Eric Schmidt Thinks AI Is as Powerful as Nukes 
An AI deterrence regime would necessitate an AI Hiroshima. 
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt compared AI to nuclear weapons and called for a deterrence regime similar to the mutually-assured destruction that keeps the world’s most powerful countries from destroying each other. 
Schmidt talked about the dangers of AI at the Aspen Security Forum at a panel on national security and artificial intelligence on July 22. While fielding a question about the value of morality in tech, Schmidt explained that he, himself, had been naive about the power of information in the early days of Google. He then called for tech to be better in line with the ethics and morals of the people it serves and made a bizarre comparison between AI and nuclear weapons.

DW: &#x27;Killer robots&#x27;: Will they be banned? 
A United Nations panel in Geneva remains split on whether to ban autonomous weapons, which don&#x27;t need a human to pull the trigger. The war in Ukraine is complicating the conversation. 
These aren&#x27;t the drones that deliver your online order. Loaded with cameras, sensors, and explosives, their mission is to drive themselves to a target with an algorithm in the driver&#x27;s seat. They destroy themselves along with the target, leaving behind just a pile of electronic detritus. 
Increasingly, these sorts of weapons are the stuff of a manufacturer&#x27;s promotional materials rather than science fiction movies. From today, a United Nations conference of 80 countries gathers in Geneva to debate whether to ban them or at least regulate them more strictly.

The Israeli Navy sank a Palestinian fishing vessel allegedly smuggling &quot;equipment&quot; to Hamas terrorists in Gaza on Sunday. 
The vessel reportedly ignored multiple hails and commands to stop from Israeli vessels. The two Palestinians aboard the boat swam ashore before it sank, according to The Times of Israel. 
&quot;Navy soldiers called via loudspeakers to the vessel, and when it did not respond to the calls, the soldiers fired in accordance with the open-fire policy,&quot; the Israel Defense Forces told the Times.

A spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Sunday that Russian missiles destroyed military infrastructure Saturday in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa, a site that is vital for the exportation of Ukrainian grain. 
Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram account &quot;Kalibr missiles destroyed military infrastructure in the port of Odessa, with a high-precision strike.&quot; 
Russia earlier had denied any involvement in the Saturday strike that came a day after Russia and Ukraine had signed agreements allowing Ukraine to ship millions of tons of grain out of its Black Sea port.

CNN: Russian Navy&#x27;s massive submarine could set the stage for &#x27;a new Cold War&#x27; in the oceans 
Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The Russian Navy has taken delivery of what is the world&#x27;s longest known submarine, one its maker touts as a research vessel -- but what others say is a platform for espionage and possibly nuclear weapons. 
The Belgorod was turned over to the Russian Navy earlier this month in the port of Severodvinsk, according to the country&#x27;s largest shipbuilder, Sevmash Shipyard. 
Experts say its design is a modified version of Russia&#x27;s Oscar II class guided-missile submarines, made longer with the aim to eventually accommodate the world&#x27;s first nuclear-armed stealth torpedoes and equipment for intelligence gathering.

                              <span>Warzone/The Drive: Claims Swirl Around The Fate Of Russia’s Last Huge Typhoon Class Submarine  
The story of Russia’s iconic Typhoon class submarines looks to be getting closer to its conclusion.   
Russian state media reports have offered conflicting details today about the status of the last Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine in active service, the Dmitry Donskoy. Though the fate of this submarine, the largest by displacement of any type in existence, is unclear, by all indications it is moving ever-closer to its retirement. 
RIA Novosti, citing anonymous sources, was the first to report that Dmitry Donskoy, also known by its hull number TK-208, had been formally decommissioned and was headed for the scrap yard. Anonymous sources from within Russia&#x27;s state-run shipbuilding industry and the country&#x27;s security services subsequently told TASS that this news was incorrect and that any final decision about the submarine&#x27;s future would not come until December at the earliest.

                              <span>DW: Russia to cut Nord Stream 1 gas flow to 20% of capacity 
 Russia&#x27;s Gazprom said it would again reduce gas deliveries through Nord Stream 1 for &#x27;repairs,&#x27; cutting the current flow in half. The new blow to supply comes as Europe scrambles to store gas for winter. 
Russian gas giant Gazprom said Monday it was cutting daily gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 33 million cubic metres starting Wednesday. 
That would correspond to 20% of the pipeline&#x27;s capacity. The current flow of gas into Germany is only at 40%. 
Nord Steam 1 begins north of Saint Petersburg in Russia and ends at a station near Greifswald on Germany&#x27;s northern Baltic Sea coast. 
The company said it was halting the operation of another turbine due to the &quot;technical condition of the engine&quot;.

* In recent months, Moscow&#x27;s troops have made gains in East and South Ukraine 
* Analysts believe the Kremlin is trying to create a land bridge to Transnistria 
* The break-away region controls a sliver of land between Moldova and Ukraine 
* Moldova&#x27;s PM Natalia Gavrilita said troops are in Transnistria, and that her country fears Russia could invade her tiny nation of 2.5 million people 
Moldova&#x27;s Prime Minister has said she is very worried Russia will invade her country next, while warning that no country is safe from Vladimir Putin. 
Natalia Gavrilita&#x27;s warning came after Moscow&#x27;s forces made gains in Ukraine&#x27;s south and east, near to the Moldova-Ukraine border, in recent months. 
Meanwhile, Russia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow&#x27;s overarching goal in Ukraine is to topple President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s government, expressing the Kremlin&#x27;s war aims in some of the bluntest terms yet.

Two-thirds of Republicans and independents say the government is “corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me,” according to the poll, compared to 51 percent of liberal voters.

Politico: Inside the Pentagon slugfest over the future of the fleet 
No one can agree on how many ships the Navy needs, and Congress isn&#x27;t pleased. 
The Navy of the future needs 316 ships. Actually, make that 327. No, more like 367. You know what? Let’s make it 373, or maybe even 500. 
At different points this year, the Pentagon and Navy leaders have floated all five numbers as the desired size of the Navy, the result of a high-stakes — and still raging — internal battle among top Navy, Marine Corps and Pentagon leaders. 
And the discord at the top has real-world consequences for America’s sea service, denying lawmakers a number to shoot for as they figure out how many ships to buy in the fiscal year that starts in October, and beyond. 
At issue, according to six people with knowledge of internal discussions, is the desired number of amphibious warships, which carry Marines and can launch warplanes and landing craft.

Myanmar’s junta has executed four prisoners including a former politician and a veteran activist, drawing shock and revulsion at the country’s first use of capital punishment in decades.
Junta-controlled media reported on Monday that four men, including Phyo Zeya Thaw, a rapper and former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, and the prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, known as Jimmy, had been executed. 
They were accused of conspiring to commit terror acts and were sentenced to death in January in closed trials.

WSWS: US considers deploying carriers to support House speaker’s Taiwan trip - Washington Post 
The US military is considering “moving aircraft carriers or sending fighter planes for close air support” as part of a potential trip by US house speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, the Washington Post reported Saturday. 
The discussions about US military actions in support of Pelosi’s trip were first reported in an op-ed by Josh Rogin, who wrote, 
The U.S. military is devising options for protecting Pelosi’s delegation, who—as is normal procedure for congressional delegations to Taiwan—would be flying on a military plane. The measures under consideration include moving aircraft carriers or sending fighter planes for close air support. That, in turn, could be misinterpreted by the Chinese side as an aggressive rather than a defensive measure. 
The discussions took place amid warnings by Chinese officials that the scheduled trip by Pelosi could trigger a military clash between Chinese and US forces.

Reuters: China confirms warnings to U.S. on Pelosi&#x27;s possible Taiwan visit 
BEIJING (Reuters) -China delivered sterner warnings to U.S. officials about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s possible visit to Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday, confirming a report by the Financial Times (FT). 
The FT report, published on Saturday, cited six people familiar with the Chinese warnings as saying they were significantly stronger than the threats that Beijing has made in the past when it was unhappy with U.S. actions or policy on Taiwan, which is claimed by China. 
The private rhetoric suggested a possible military response, the FT cited several people familiar with the situation as saying.

Roads emptied and people were ordered to stay indoors in parts of Taiwan, including its capital Taipei, on Monday for an air-raid exercise as the island steps up preparations in the event of a Chinese attack. 
Sirens sounded at 1:30 p.m. (0530 GMT) for the mandatory street evacuation drills, which effectively shut towns and cities across northern Taiwan for 30 minutes. 
A “missile alert,” asking people to evacuate to safety immediately, was sent via text message. 
“It is necessary to make preparations in the event of a war,” Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je said in a speech after overseeing drills for the exercise named Wan An, which means everlasting peace.

   CNBC: Nearly 70% of Americans are worried about a nuclear attack, according to APA survey. Here’s what could happen 
The world watched uneasily on Feb. 24 when Russian troops, under the orders of President Vladimir Putin, invaded Ukraine. 
“The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said March 14. 
Nearly 70% of Americans surveyed by the American Psychological Association said they “are worried the invasion of Ukraine is going to lead to nuclear war, and that they fear that we are at the beginning stages of World War III.”

 Olga Lautman, SpyTalk: Behind Zelenskyy&#x27;s Security Shakeup  
A deep and continuing rot of treason imperils Ukraine&#x27;s battle against the Russians 
When Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale assault on Ukraine in February, he really did believe that his operation to seize Kyiv would last less than a week. That’s largely because Putin has spent decades cultivating Ukrainian officials, oligarchs and political parties to impede Kyiv’s move toward democracy and independence from Russia. But they failed him. Even before the invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  had been moving to crush Putin&#x27;s agents. And in mid-July, he doubled down on his counter-subversion campaign.

Washington (CNN)On paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.

Bloomberg: China Issues Private Warnings to US on Pelosi’s Taiwan Trip: FT 
(Bloomberg) -- China issued strong private warnings to the US government about a planned trip to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which included a possible military response, the Financial Times reported. 
The warnings were much stronger than those made previously when China wasn’t pleased with US policies and actions related to Taipei, the paper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the issue.  China’s foreign ministry earlier this week officially vowed to take a “resolute and strong” response to any Taiwan visit by Pelosi, which was reported to be next month. 
Her trip would be the first by a House speaker to Taipei since 1997.  Pelosi’s office didn’t respond to a request from the Financial Times for comment about whether she might abandon her trip.

DPA: Lavrov confirms Moscow&#x27;s plans for regime change in Ukraine 
Russia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said, in contrast to earlier statements, that Russia is seeking to overthrow the Ukrainian government. 
 &quot;We will definitely help the Ukrainian people to free themselves from the regime that is absolutely anti-people and anti-history,&quot; Lavrov said in Cairo on Sunday. The Russian and Ukrainian people would live together in the future, he added. 
In recent days, the Russian leadership has publicly toughened its position in the Ukraine war. On Wednesday, Lavrov threatened to occupy further territories outside the eastern Donbass region where most of the fighting is currently concentrated.

The Oak Fire, which ignited and spread rapidly on Friday, has burned a total of 16,800 acres and could still threaten 3,300 homes and businesses.  As of Monday morning, seven structures had been destroyed – an earlier estimate said 10 – and more than 3,000 residents had been ordered to evacuate.
Cal Fire, the state’s lead firefighting agency, said in a statement late Sunday that firefighters had made “good progress” against the blaze and that protective cleanup by fire crews was protecting small communities of Lushmeadows and Mariposa Pines.

On Friday, Mr. Kelley again relied on a part of his biography that many candidates might have shunned: he posted a message on his official Facebook page asking that “all J6 prisoners” be released from federal custody. .
“Every American should be outraged,” wrote Mr. Kelley, who is not in custody awaiting trial.  “Don’t forget you could be next for any reason the ‘big government’ doesn’t approve of.”


In early June, when he was charged with four misdemeanors related to the Capitol riot, Mr. Kelley became the first candidate in a major federal or state election to be charged in the attack.  Prosecutors say he used ‘his hands to support another rioter’ who was tearing down a metal barricade outside the building, and waved ‘at the crowd, consistently indicating’ that they should keep going. head for an entrance.


With polls showing him trailing favorite Tudor Dixona conservative businesswoman and commentator, and other candidates, Mr. Kelley, a real estate broker, is unlikely to win the Republican primary on Aug. 2.  The winner will face the incumbent, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.
No later than Wednesday evening, during a candidate debateMr. Kelley has spoken openly about his Capitol riot charges, treating them as an asset, not a liability.
He claimed, for example, that after his arrest, Airbnb closed his account.
“Look how hard these people try to shut me up,” he said.  “They’re not trying to silence the rest of you.”

                              <span>Thousands of UK Conservative party members have signed a petition calling for a vote on whether outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson should resign.  

Mr Johnson resigned earlier in July after several Conservative members resigned from the party.  

The decision on who will be UK’s next prime minister to replace Mr Johnson will be announced on September 5. 

The candidates for the job are Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former chancellor Rishi Sunak.</span>

He said the global rules-based order is “under pressure” in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific and expressed the need to build Australia’s defence capability. 

“There was a real sense of shared mission with the United States about what we both face and about the need for Australia to develop these capabilities,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“And the role AUKUS can play in building the capabilities of all three countries.”</span>

The Guardian: Half of Russian spies in Europe expelled since Ukraine invasion, says MI6 chief  
Richard Moore says 400 intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover have been expelled 
Half of all the Russian spies operating under diplomatic cover around Europe have been expelled since the start of the war in Ukraine, the chief of MI6 has told a US security conference. 
Richard Moore, who heads British foreign intelligence, said the expulsions of about 400 Russian diplomats from countries in continental Europe, including France and Germany, had dramatically reduced the Kremlin’s espionage capabilities. 
peaking at the Aspen security conference, he said western intelligence agencies had made “pretty concerted” efforts to disrupt Russian spying networks since the invasion.

* The UK&#x27;s spy chief said Russia is likely to &quot;run out of steam&quot; in Ukraine soon. 
* He said this will give Ukraine an opportunity to strike back against invading forces. 
* Other military and Russia experts have offered similar assessments as the conflict morphs into a war of attrition. 
The Russian military offensive in Ukraine will likely lose momentum in the near future, offering Ukrainian forces an opportunity to &quot;strike back,&quot; Richard Moore, chief of Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), said on Thursday at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. 
&quot;I think they&#x27;re about to run out of steam,&quot; Moore said of the Russians. &quot;They will have to pause in some way, and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back.&quot; 
Moore said that it&#x27;s important for Ukrainian morale that they &quot;demonstrate their ability to strike back.&quot;

&quot;At the OECD one of the things we are focused on is to facilitate, through an inclusive forum on carbon mitigation approaches, one; ...comparison between all of the different approaches and comparative effectiveness of the different approaches to carbon mitigation in different parts of the world,&quot; he told Sky News Australia.

&quot;But also to facilitate a dialogue to better coordinate those efforts to make sure that we have a globally more coherent framework in place, that there&#x27;s a better dialogue between advanced, emerging and developing economies.

Mr Cormann discussed the progress of the OECD&#x27;s &#x27;Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy&#x27;.

&quot;Once you&#x27;ve got sizeable jurisdiction, like for example the European Union and a number of others, legislating for a global minimum tax ... it becomes self-defeating and counterproductive for other countries not to follow suit,&quot; Mr Cormann told Sky News Australia.

&quot;I&#x27;m quietly optimistic that when it&#x27;s all said and done, this reform will be implemented.&quot;</span>

Bussiness Insider: Zelenskyy says there&#x27;s no point in negotiating with Russia until it gets &#x27;smashed in the face&#x27; and all Ukrainian territories are liberated 
* Zelenskyy told WSJ that Ukraine can&#x27;t agree to a ceasefire until it takes its territory back from Russia. 
* A ceasefire &quot;means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest,&quot; Zelenskyy said. 
* He said Russia would just resume its offensive later on after regaining strength. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a new interview with The Wall Street Journal that establishing a ceasefire in the war with Russia while allowing it to maintain control of parts of Ukraine would result in a prolonged conflict.
&quot;Freezing the conflict with the Russian Federation means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest,&quot; Zelenskyy said, adding, &quot;They will not use this pause to change their geopolitics or to renounce their claims on the former Soviet republics.&quot; 
Zelenskyy said Russia would use a ceasefire to regain strength and then resume its offensive against Ukraine later on.

   Moon of Alabama: Ukraine Grain Exports - Myths And Reality  
A deal between Ukraine and Russia aims to ease the global food crisis. - New York Times - Jul 23, 2022       
BRUSSELS — Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement in Istanbul on Friday to free more than 20 million metric tons of grain stuck in blockaded Black Sea ports in Ukraine, a deal aimed at bringing down soaring grain prices and alleviating a mounting global hunger crisis. 
The highlighted claims are as false as much of the other NYT reporting on Ukraine.   
Ukraine grain exports reach 47.2 million tonnes so far for 2021-22 - World-Grain.com - Jun 6, 2022   
KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine has exported 148,000 tonnes of grain in the first five days of June, pushing its July to June 2021-22 marketing year total to 47.2 million tonnes, the country’s agriculture ministry said on June 6, Reuters reported. 
The ministry said the total volume included 18.578 million tonnes of wheat, 22.4 million tonnes of corn and 5.7 million tonnes of barley, with corn shipments dominating the June start, Reuters reported.     ...     Ukraine reached 54.9 million tonnes of wheat, corn and barley exports in 2019-2020, but dipped to 44.9 million tonnes in 2020-21, mostly on lower wheat production, according to the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s (USDA) Feb. 1 Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) quarterly report. 
Before Russia&#x27;s invasion, Ukraine had been projected to export 63.7 million tonnes of the grains in 2021-22. 
The above numbers are more than 6 weeks old. Back then the difference between projected exports and exports up to June 5 was 63.7 - 47.2 &#x3D; 16.5 million tons.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that Nisanov, who was hit by sanctions following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, was &quot;one of the richest men in Europe and a close associate of several Russian officials&quot;.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Russian missiles hit Ukraine&#x27;s port of Odessa Saturday, in what Kyiv called a &quot;spit in the face&quot; of a day-old deal between the warring sides to resume cereal exports blocked by the conflict.
The Ukrainian military said its air defences had shot down two cruise missiles but two more hit the port, threatening the landmark agreement hammered out over months of negotiations aimed at relieving a global food crisis.
The Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said the strike was &quot;a spit in the face&quot; by Russian leader Vladimir Putin against the deal brokered by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and United Nations chief Antonio Guterres.

KYIV (Reuters) - The United States promised more military support for Ukraine, including drones, and is doing preliminary work on whether to send fighter aircraft, as fighting raged on in the east of the country five months into Russia&#x27;s invasion.
Moscow and Kyiv signed a landmark deal on Friday to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports. However, representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the agreement ceremony in Istanbul, reflecting wider enmity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Friday&#x27;s agreement as unlocking around $10 billion worth of grain exports, needed to ease a food crisis.
But on the war, he said there could be no ceasefire unless lost territory was retaken.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombian President-elect Gustavo Petro on Friday met with representatives of U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration in Bogota, the Colombian capital, where they discussed topics including drug trafficking, the environment and economic development.
Petro, a 62-year-old economist who will become Colombia&#x27;s first leftist leader next month, has been roundly critical of the U.S.-led war on drugs and was elected on promises to tackle deep inequality and climate change and to seek peace with remaining leftist rebels.
&quot;This is a positive meeting because it shows the interest that exists in the government of the United States in Latin America and in Colombia,&quot; Petro told journalists, as he was accompanied by U.S. principal deputy nationa…</span>

                              <span>The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General&#x27;s office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
&quot;Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense,&quot; said the statement.
&quot;Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime.&quot;
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira&#x27;s heart -- as a motive for the killing.

                              <span>Brazilian part-time beekeeper Luiz Lustosa lifts the lid on a wooden hive. The reaction is instant, and angry, as thousands of bees envelop him in a buzzing cloud.
Lustosa wears no specialized suit or gloves, however, just a light net to cover his face. These bees are stingless.
&quot;What a wonder!&quot; Lustosa marvels at the honey-filled wax craters in the hive as the bees attack him furiously, but impotently -- his childlike amazement not diminished by six years working with the insects.
Long overlooked, Brazil&#x27;s native bees are making a comeback, with people such as Lustosa, a 66-year-old public servant, getting in on the movement to boost their profile.
Of 550 stingless bee species known to exist in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world, some 250 are found in Brazil, according to Cristi…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department issued two general licenses on Friday authorizing certain transactions related to Russia sanctions.
One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury&#x27;s website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

Worst hit is expected to be Milan in the north with temperatures hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), while Bologna to its south and the capital Rome could hit 39 degrees, according to official government estimates.
Other major cities under a cautionary heatwave red alert for Friday and Saturday by Italy&#x27;s health ministry include Florence, Genoa, Turin and Verona.
On Thursday, the city of Pavia, just south of Milan, broke a record with thermometers hitting 39.6 degrees.

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s nuclear regulator on Friday formally approved a plan to release more than a million tonnes of treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean.
The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country&#x27;s Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO&#x27;s plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the &quot;reliability and transparency of its handling&quot;.
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

                              <span>At a sprawling landfill near Madrid, hundreds of white storks dodge garbage trucks as they look for scraps of food among the mountains of multicoloured garbage bags.
The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
&quot;For us they are part of the landscape,&quot; said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones &quot;where there is fresh garbage,&quot; he added.

The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned &quot;Iroojlaplap&quot;, or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a &quot;Kailoojoj&quot; in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.

                              <span>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.
Biden on Thursday insisted he was &quot;doing great&quot;, and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
&quot;I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery,&quot; Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the &quot;next ten days&quot;, weeks after both countries&#x27; top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: &quot;Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese.&quot;</span>

Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.
Its location in Istanbul is both a nod to Turkey&#x27;s central location and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s key role in resolving a dispute which has often seemed to…</span>

She later explained that Harry wanted to stress that the comments did not come from his elderly grandparents.

With his electoral campaign to reconquer Brazil in full swing, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is avidly courting this voting bloc, which is one of Brazilian politics’ biggest prizes and could determine the winner of the next election.

Authorities say police are investigating the killings, the worst of a series of brutal cases of cruelty to dogs.
But they face criticism from animal welfare activists who say laws defending domestic animals like dogs are not being enforced.
The latest killings took place at an industrial compound near the capital Doha on July 10, but the slaughter was only reported days later, activists told AFP.
Four men, two armed with hunting rifles, threatened guards at the factory and then killed 29 dogs and puppies, activists said. At least three others were wounded, including two in the late stages of pregnancy.

                              <span>A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor&#x27;s office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of &quot;I take care of Mexico,&quot; an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the &quot;seriousness of the injuries&quot; in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
&quot;We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women&#x27;s human rights and fight against gender-based violence,&quot; UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor&#x27;s behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son&#x27;s health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
&quot;You&#x27;re going to die,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m going to burn you alive,&quot; the messages read.
&quot;How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family,&quot; she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.</span>
