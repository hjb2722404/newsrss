                              <span>Far-right populist candidate Javier Milei emerged as the biggest vote-getter in Argentina&#x27;s primary elections for presidential candidates. With around 92% votes counted, Milei had around 30% of the total vote, making him an unexpected but real contender for the presidency. Milei, an admirer of Trump, wants to abolish the central bank, legalise the sale of human organs, and make it easier to own handguns.</span>

RAF fighters have been scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers north of Shetland. 
The Typhoon jets launched from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray on Monday morning. 
The Russian Tu-142 Bear-F and Tu-142 Bear-J aircraft were monitored in international airspace as they passed north of the UK. 
 Such incidents - known as quick reaction alerts - are not uncommon and involve RAF crews shadowing Russian military aircraft near UK airspace.

WNU Editor: This trip was decided only in the past few weeks. This is also a six day trip, and that tells me that there is going to be a lot of talks on how China and Russia are going to deepen their military alliance. And while the media focus in Russia and China is on the speech that the Chinese defense minister will be making at an international security forum, his behind closed-door meetings with Russia&#x27;s top military brass is where the real focus should be.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for a &quot;drastic boost&quot; in missile production during visits to key weapons factories, state media said Monday, as South Korea and the United States prepared for joint drills next week. 
The tour of the plants from Friday to Saturday came after Kim called for stepping up war preparations at a key military meeting last week. 
Kim&#x27;s two-day inspections included visits to factories producing tactical missiles, large-calibre control multiple rocket launcher shells, as well as armoured combat vehicles, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. 
During the tactical missile factory visit, Kim &quot;expressed satisfaction&quot; as the plant had &quot;perfected the scientific and technological issues arising in production&quot; and pushed ahead with the modernisation of the weapons.

Ukrainian officials said Monday a Russian aerial attack on the southern port city of Odesa injured at least three people. 
The military said air defenses downed all 15 drones Russia used in the attack, as well as eight sea-based missiles, but that falling debris caused damage on the ground. 
Three people were injured after debris fell on a supermarket, and a student dormitory was also damaged. 
Firefighters battled several fires that broke out as a result of the falling rocket fragments, the regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said on Telegram.

A Russian warship fired warning shots and boarded a cargo ship it claims was headed to Ukraine in the Black Sea on Sunday, according to Russia’s defense ministry.
Russia pulled out of a UN and Turkish-brokered deal in July that allowed Ukraine to move its grain via the Black Sea and warned that any ships headed to Ukraine would be treated as potentially carrying weapons. 
Ukraine made a similar threat to ships traveling to Russian ports.

Russia said the warship fired warning shots when the captain of the Palau-flagged dry cargo ship failed to respond to a request to stop for an inspection.

                              <span>The Dreadnought Class SSBN (ballistic missile submarine) will incorporate advanced features. This includes a new multi-layered sound reducing stealth, with built in outer hull.

 
Insider: The British navy is teaming up with the US to build a new &#x27;Dreadnought&#x27; for a totally different battle at sea 
* The British Royal Navy is building a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines. 
* The British subs will have the same missile compartment as the US Navy&#x27;s new missile subs. 
* The name of the new subs recalls the first Dreadnought, a battleship that redefined naval warfare. 
In 1906 the British Royal Navy commissioned HMS Dreadnought, a battleship that changed how surface warships were designed and sparked a naval arms race. 
Armed with five turrets bearing twin 12-inch guns and featuring new technologies like steam turbines and electronic fire-control equipment, HMS Dreadnought became the standard on which future battleships were based and separated the &quot;pre-dreadnought&quot; and &quot;dreadnought&quot; eras. 
 Long after the battleship&#x27;s reign came to an end, the name Dreadnought is still a defining one. The Royal Navy&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, in service from 1963 to 1980, was also called HMS Dreadnought.

This request will face stiffer political headwinds than previous appeals. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, as Ukraine’s very existence swung in the balance, elected officials in the United States generally welcomed President Joseph Biden’s requests for aid. Fortunately, Kyiv’s fierce resistance foiled Russia’s expansive war aims. However, as the fighting has ground on with no end in sight, supplemental aid to Ukraine has become increasingly politicized. Recent polling suggests Americans are skeptical of additional

                              <span>To compete with Russia and China, Washington needs partners. One key way in which Washington has, can, and will secure these partners is by sending them weapons. This, in turn, requires the United States to produce enough weapons, produce the right weapons, and effectively transfer these weapons.  Unfortunately, America is currently failing on all three fronts.

Prince William’s popularity in the United States has soared after a new Gallop poll found he was more popular with the American public than President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. 

“They have nothing to do with the Democrats or the Republicans, and so you see both of these featuring very highly in those polls,” Ms Hewson told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

                              <span>Prince Harry has been putting on a “brave face” after all lingering HRH title references were wiped from the royal website, according to TalkTV Royal Editor Sarah Hewson. 

Ms Hewson said there was a major “cleanup operation” on the website while Prince Harry embarked on his mini tour of Asia.  

“This happened three years ago but it does just give us this very visual representation of just how much their status has changed,” she told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

DW: Germany&#x27;s Scholz calls for more Ukraine peace talks 
The German chancellor said the Saudi-led peace talks and others will help Russia realize it has &quot;taken the wrong path.&quot; Scholz was, however, non-committal on whether Berlin would supply Kyiv with Taurus cruise missiles. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday called for more diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, following a summit on the issue last weekend in Saudi Arabia. 
&quot;It makes sense for us to continue these talks because they increase the pressure on Russia to realize that it has taken the wrong path and that it must withdraw its troops and make peace possible,&quot; Scholz said in his annual summer interview with German public broadcaster ZDF. 
Scholz said the Jeddah security talks were &quot;very important&quot; but &quot;only the beginning, unfortunately.&quot;

Mint Press: Taliban’s Massively Successful Opium Eradication Raises Questions About What US Was Doing All Along  
The Taliban government in Afghanistan – the nation that until recently produced 90% of the world’s heroin – has drastically reduced opium cultivation across the country. Western sources estimate an up to 99% reduction in some provinces. This raises serious questions about the seriousness of U.S. drug eradication efforts in the country over the past 20 years. And, as global heroin supplies dry up, experts tell MintPress News that they fear this could spark the growing use of fentanyl – a drug dozens of times stronger than heroin that already kills more than 100,000 Americans yearly.
 
 
The Taliban Does What the US Did Not 
It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. 
In April of last year, the ruling Taliban government announced the prohibition of poppy farming, citing both their strong religious beliefs and the extremely harmful social costs that heroin and other opioids – derived from the sap of the poppy plant – have wrought across Afghanistan.

 China on Sunday vowed &quot;resolute and forceful measures&quot; over a weekend trip by Taiwan Vice President William Lai to the United States it said it was closely monitoring.  
Lai – the frontrunner in Taiwan&#x27;s presidential elections next year – is officially making only transit stops in the United States en route to and from Paraguay, where he will attend the inauguration of president-elect Santiago Pena. 
Taiwan is claimed by China, which has vowed to take the island democracy one day – by force, if necessary – and ramped up political and military pressure. 
&quot;China is closely following the development of the situation and will take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; an unnamed spokesperson for the foreign ministry said in a statement published online.

Chinese military scientists have announced a major breakthrough in laser weapon technology, claiming they have developed a new cooling system that allows high-energy lasers to operate &quot;infinitely&quot; without any build-up of waste heat. 
According to scientists at the National University of Defence Technology, in Changsha, Hunan province, the new cooling system completely eliminates the harmful heat that is generated during the operation of high-energy lasers. The issue has been a major technical challenge for laser weapon development.

                              <span>Washington Post: Slow counteroffensive darkens mood in Ukraine 
KYIV, Ukraine — This nation is worn out. 
For nearly 18 months, Ukraine has stood against its Russian invaders — rallying support for its troops by embracing last year’s battlefield victories in the Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson regions. 
Those wins carried beleaguered Ukrainians through a winter of airstrikes on civilian infrastructure and a brutal and symbolic battle for Bakhmut, the eastern city that fell to the Russians in May. 
Throughout, Ukrainian officials and their western partners hyped up a coming counteroffensive — one that, buoyed by a flood of new weapons and training, they hoped would turn the tide of the war. 
But two months after Ukraine went on the attack, with little visible progress on the front and a relentles…</span>

As ECOWAS leaders fail to meet, concerns over the deteriorating health of deposed President Bazoum mount. 
An emergency meeting of West African nations on the coup in Niger has been postponed indefinitely as concerns over the health of detained President Mohammed Bazoum increase. 
Members of the Economic Cooperation of West African Nations (ECOWAS) were due to meet in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, on Saturday to discuss how to tackle the Niger crisis after they approved the deployment of a stand-by force to restore constitutional order.

Newsweek: U.S. Troops Should be Sent to Ukraine, Third of Americans Say 
Almost a third of Americans support U.S. troops being sent to war-torn Ukraine, according to a new poll. 
A total of 31 percent of eligible voters in the U.S. support or strongly support American military forces heading to the battlefields of Ukraine, polling conducted exclusively for Newsweek by Redfield &amp; Wilton Strategies has revealed. 
A quarter of respondents neither supported nor opposed the idea of sending U.S. soldiers to Ukraine, with 34 percent against the suggestion. Just under one in ten respondents did not know.

The Pentagon said it had no comment to make when contacted by Newsweek about the results of the poll.

After months of grueling advances through minefields, small villages and open steppes, Ukrainian forces are making some progress along two major lines of attack, according to analysts, Ukrainian officials and Russian military bloggers. 
The advances, while small in terms of territory taken, are compelling Moscow to redeploy forces, military analysts say. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, called the advances “tactically significant,” adding that the situation would create new challenges for Russian forces spread across the vast front line.

&quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters,&quot; Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage&#x27;s exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage&#x27;s complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland&#x27;s trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.

The musician&#x27;s funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

Naeem Panjutha said the petition challenging the weekend conviction had been filed in Islamabad High Court which will hear the case on Wednesday. Ex-cricketer Khan, 70, was jailed on charges of selling state gifts unlawfully during his tenure as premier from 2018 to 2022.</span>

Polls show the former stand-up comedian&#x27;s crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country&#x27;s most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
