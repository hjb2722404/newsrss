                              <span>Republicans have ramped up calls to impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after an email circulated indicating he was notified that claims of border patrol agents whipping migrants was false.

Last September images from Del Rio circulated showing border patrol agents on horseback rounding up migrants who had illegally crossed the border.

Those images looked as if agents were whipping migrants, however the photographer later confirmed it was misconstrued.

An email obtained from September last year by Fox News’ Bill Melugin revealed Secretary Mayorkas was told this narrative was fake – two and a half hours before he fronted the media where he condemned his own border patrol agents.
Republicans have now called for him to be impeached for failing to defend agents.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said there was a real threat of hunger and widespread social upheavals amid the increased volatility of world energy and prices.
“Our summit and other regional cooperation needs to resolve various problems. In particular, I’m talking about the increased volatility of world energy, food, fertilizer prices, prices for raw materials and other significant goods,” Putin said during his speech at the CICA summit in Astana.

                              <span>Reuters: Putin courts Erdogan with plan to pump more Russian gas via Turkey 
ASTANA (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday that Moscow could export more gas via Turkey and turn it into a new supply &quot;hub&quot;, bidding to preserve Russia&#x27;s energy leverage over Europe. 
At a meeting in Kazakhstan, Putin said Turkey offered the most reliable route to deliver gas to the European Union, and the proposed platform would allow prices to be set without politics. 
Russia is looking to redirect supplies away from the Nord Stream Baltic gas pipelines, damaged in explosions last month that are still under investigation. Russia blamed the West, without providing evidence, and rejected what it called &quot;stupid&quot; assertions that it had sabotaged the pipelines itself.

Iraq&#x27;s Parliament on Thursday elected Abdelatif Rashid, candidate of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, as the country&#x27;s new president after beating his rival, Barham Sali, in a secret ballot held more than a year after the parliamentary elections that took place in October 2021. 
The victory of Rashid, who has garnered more than 162 votes against 99 for Sali, candidate of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and current president of the country, comes after he beat his opponent in a first ballot but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to secure the post, as reported by the state news agency NINA. 
 Iraq&#x27;s Prime Minister Mostafa al-Kazemi congratulated Rashid, who previously served as Minister of Water Resources between 2003 and 2010, on his official Twitter profile.

Washington Post: U.S., Saudi Arabia spar over decision to cut oil production 
Saudi Arabia “coerced” smaller oil-producing members of OPEC to agree to production cuts that the Saudis knew would “increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions” designed to combat Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, the Biden administration said Thursday.

The Saudis rejected the appeal for delay.   The statement upped the ante in an increasingly acrimonious disagreement between the United States and its putative close partner in the Persian Gulf. 
The administration has been pressing Saudi Arabia to produce more oil to compensate for the global shortage and price increases caused by the Ukraine war.

* North Korean jets were seen within 12km of the boundary between the nations 
* South Korean fighter jets were scrambled in response to the unusual incident 
* It comes amid raised tensions on the peninsula after missile tests in the North 
South Korea has scrambled fighter jets after Kim Jong Un&#x27;s warplanes flew towards the border and launched a ballistic missile into the ocean. 
Around 10 North Korean military aircraft were seen flying near the de-facto border overnight, in what it says is a response to &#x27;provocative action&#x27; by its southern neighbour. 
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff says planes were seen flying as close as 12km north of the boundary between the two countries late on Thursday and early on Friday.

                              <span>RT: US-Russia relations &#x27;can’t get any worse’ – Moscow  
FM Sergey Lavrov says Joe Biden’s unwillingness to talk with Vladimir Putin won’t complicate an already dire situation  
US President Joe Biden’s latest remark indicating his unwillingness to negotiate with his Russian counterpart is unlikely to further worsen an already dire global security situation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. The diplomat noted that Moscow is, however, still open to dialogue, but that no “sensible” offers have so far been forthcoming from Washington. 
In an interview with Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel aired on Thursday, Lavrov was asked whether he thought Biden’s reluctance to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin would further complicate tensions in the international arena.

Update: Russia not shying away from contacts with US, but no sane proposals so far, Lavrov says (TASS) 
WNU Editor: I disagree with the Russian Foreign Minister. U.S. - Russian relations can get worse, and will get worse. 
My prediction. 
After the US midterm elections are over the Biden administration is going to significantly escalate the deployment of US personal and equipment to eastern Europe, coupled with a massive increase in economic and military support to Ukraine. The next six months we are probably going to witness the most intense moments between the U.S. and Russia since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.
On a side note. The 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis is only 3 days away .... Cuban Missile Crisis (Wikipedia).</span>

BRUSSELS — NATO will closely monitor Russia’s upcoming nuclear exercise but not be cowed into dropping support for Ukraine by Moscow’s veiled nuclear threats, the alliance’s chief said on Thursday. 
“We will not be intimidated,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after a two-day meeting of the alliance’s defense ministers. 
“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous, reckless, and they know that if they use (a) nuclear weapon against Ukraine, it will have severe consequences.” 
The meeting was the first large NATO gathering since Moscow announced it would annex several Ukrainian territories, began a partial mobilization and issued veiled nuclear threats, moves NATO has classified as a clear escalation of the war that started when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

TASS: Ukraine’s joining NATO can lead to World War III — Russia’s Security Council  
Apparently, that&#x27;s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Alexander Venediktov said 
MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. Accession of Ukraine to NATO can lead to World War III and NATO itself understands it, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Alexander Venediktov said in an interview with TASS. 
According to him, Ukraine&#x27;s application for a fast-track NATO membership is &quot;rather a propaganda move.&quot;  &quot;Kiev is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to World War Three,&quot; Venediktov said. 
&quot;Apparently, that&#x27;s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again,&quot; Venediktov noted.

Politico: NATO sets sights on rebuilding Ukraine’s defense industry 
“It&#x27;s about shifting away from Soviet equipment,&quot; one NATO official said. 
BRUSSELS — NATO is developing a 10-year plan to rebuild the Ukrainian defense industry, with the first meeting between the alliance and Kyiv slated for next week. 
The meeting will be the start of a long process hinted at for weeks by U.S. and NATO officials of a long-term commitment to Ukraine to bring it closer to the alliance in both training and equipment. 
“We will be looking at defense planning requirements to get Ukraine fully interoperable with NATO,” said a senior NATO official who asked not to be named due to ground rules for speaking to reporters during alliance meetings in Brussels this week. “It’s about shifting away from Soviet equipment … to NATO-compatible Western equipment.”

Russian missiles targeted more than 40 Ukrainian cities and towns on October 13, officials said, hitting critical infrastructure in Ukraine&#x27;s capital region, a day after the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling Moscow&#x27;s annexation of Ukrainian territory &quot;illegal&quot; and Ukraine&#x27;s allies committed more military aid. 
Three drones operated by Russian forces attacked the small town of Makariv, west of Kyiv, early on October 13, Andriy Nebytov, head of the Kyiv region police, said on the Telegram messaging app. 
 &quot;There was an overnight drones bombardment by invaders on the Makariv community,&quot; Nebytov said. &quot;According to preliminary information, there were no casualties.&quot;

Arab rioters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks and fired fireworks toward Israeli forces throughout east Jerusalem starting early in the evening. Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion&#x27;s car was also pelted with rocks on his way to a Sukkot event in east Jerusalem.

Fifteen European countries on Thursday announced that they would jointly procure air defence systems to protect the continent under a newly-created European Sky Shield Initiative. 
Germany, which spearheaded the project, will coordinate the joint procurements to urgently plug existing gaps with regard to possible air attacks at close range -- including drones -- as well as medium and long-range, and especially against ballistic missiles and cruise missiles which Russia owns, its defence ministry said.
&quot;It is about being able to set prices accordingly and, of course, it is also about being able to support each other jointly in terms of maintenance. So it&#x27;s a win-win situation for the countries that are part of it,&quot; Minister Christine Lambrecht told reporters on Thursday morning.

The National: France will not trade nuclear strikes with Russia over Ukraine 
France will not respond with nuclear weapons should Russia use them against Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said. 
“Our doctrine rests on the fundamental interests of the nation,&quot; Mr Macron told public broadcaster France 2 on Wednesday.
&quot;They are defined clearly and wouldn’t be directly affected at all if, for example, there was a ballistic nuclear attack in Ukraine, in the region.&quot;

More than 10 percent of those called-up to a recent snap military reservist exercise either did not open the email or did not receive it in the first place, the Estonian Defense Forces said on Monday. 
Estonian Defense Forces (EDF) commander, Lt Gen. Martin Herem, said of the call-up notifications for the &quot;Okas&quot; snap exercise held in late September: &quot;There are people who didn&#x27;t show up for the exercise, who didn&#x27;t made contact, and we can see that they hadn&#x27;t even opened the notification sent to them via the eesti.ee state portal environment.&quot; 
This was not necessarily an honest mistake in every case.

                              <span>Reuters: OPEC+ oil supply cuts could tip world into recession, IEA says 
LONDON (Reuters) - A decision by the OPEC+ oil producer group last week to rein in output has driven up prices and could push the global economy into recession, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. 
&quot;The relentless deterioration of the economy and higher prices sparked by an OPEC+ plan to cut supply are slowing world oil demand,&quot; the Paris-based agency, which includes the United States and other top consumer countries, said. 
&quot;With unrelenting inflationary pressures and interest rate hikes taking their toll, higher oil prices may prove the tipping point for a global economy already on the brink of recession,&quot; it added in its monthly oil report.

Martin Chulov, The Guardian: Saudi Arabia is choosing friends on its own terms and Biden is not one of them  
Reactions in Washington to slashing oil supply have not concerned Mohammed bin Salman; nor have the optics of indirectly boosting Putin’s war 
Mohammed bin Salman had seen it coming. The groundswell of anger in Washington was clear and building since he helped lead an Opec+ decision to cut the world’s oil supply last week. 
But for the first time in the modern era of ties between the US and Saudi Arabia, there was no rush to placate hard feelings, or gloss over a rift. This was the birth of a new realpolitik, where nascent Saudi nationalism paid no heed to a historical ally and instead aligned itself to what Riyadh literally sees as a new world order.

WNU Editor: We are no longer in a uni-polar world where the US was the dominant power. There are new blocs forming, and countries like Saudi Arabia are looking for new partnerships. 
My prediction. 
Russia is the world&#x27;s superpower when it comes to resources, so it is natural that Saudi Arabia wants stable relations with Moscow. China is the manufacturing superpower of the world and a major customer for Saudi oil, so it is only natural that Saudi Arabia wants stable relations with Beijing. 
Both China and Russia also have close ties with Iran, a country that Saudi Arabia needs to be contained. What better way to contain Iran by positioning yourself to be able to provide more to China and Russia than what Iran can do.</span>

* President Biden, as well as other White House officials and Senators, have made it clear in recent days that Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the OPEC+ cut. 
* Saudi Arabia says that it totally rejects these statements that suggest the OPEC+ cut was anything but an economic decision. 
* The Kingdom emphasized that the OPEC+ cut was unanimously decided up by members and was based on purely economic considerations. 
A day after President Biden threatened “there will be consequences” for OPEC+’s decision to reduce its production target by 2 million bpd, Saudi Arabia came out with a statement that expressed “its total rejection” of Biden’s and other statements from Washington with regard to the decision. 
“The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would first like to express its total rejection of these statements that are not based on facts, and which are based on portraying the OPEC+ decision out of its purely economic context. 
This decision was taken unanimously by all member states of the OPEC+ group,” the statement, from the Foreign Ministry, said.

   The Guardian: Saudi Arabia claims US requested one-month delay to oil production cut  
Alleged move by Biden administration came before mid-term elections in which petrol prices are key issue 
Saudi Arabia has claimed it was pressured by the Biden administration to delay by a month a decision to cut oil production, a move that would have reduced the likelihood of an unpopular fuel price rise just before the US mid-term elections.
In its first remarks since the US president warned on Tuesday of consequences over the production cut, the Saudi foreign ministry said it rejected the overture and pressed on with the reduction.  Washington has not confirmed it made any such request.

The western narrative of a &#x27;losing Russia&#x27; has just been decimated by Moscow&#x27;s blitzkrieg against Ukraine and its foreign-backed terror operations. 
The terror attack on Krymskiy Most – the Crimea Bridge – was the proverbial straw that broke the Eurasian camel’s back.  Russian President Vladimir Putin neatly summarized it: “This is a terrorist attack aimed at destroying the critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation.” 
The head of the Russian Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, confirmed face-to-face with Putin that Terror on the Bridge was carried out by the SBU – Ukrainian special services.

WNU Editor: I can only hope Pepe Escobar&#x27;s predictions in the above post on what Russia is going to do next do not come to past. But being someone who is from a Soviet/Russian military family, and who has been a student and observer of the Russian military for most of my life, my gut tells me that Pepe Escobar&#x27;s analysis is correct. If I disagree with him, it is on the timing. Putin has not really unleashed the dogs from hell yet, but this weeks attacks are a signal that he is on the verge of doing just that.</span>

Reuters: Ukraine&#x27;s Zelenskiy appeals for $55 billion to cover budget gap and reconstruction 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday appealed to international donors to increase their financial support, saying more money was needed to rebuild schools and homes destroyed by months of Russian bombardment. 
Zelenskiy, speaking by video link to finance ministers at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings in Washington, said Ukraine needed about $55 billion - $38 billion to cover next year&#x27;s estimated budget deficit, and another $17 billion to start to rebuild critical infrastructure, including schools, housing and energy facilities.
&quot;The more assistance Ukraine gets now, the sooner we&#x27;ll come to an end to the Russian war, and the sooner and more reliably we will guarantee that such a cruel war will not spread into other countries,&quot; Zelenskiy said.

                              <span>RT: Gazprom CEO makes grim predictions for EU  
The region will struggle to survive through the winter and may run out of gas by March, Aleksey Miller claims  
Entire cities in Europe could freeze over during the cold peak of winter, CEO of Russian energy major Gazprom, Aleksey Miller warned, speaking at Russian Energy Week on Wednesday. 
According to his estimates, Europe may lack about 800 million cubic meters of gas per day which represents a third of the EU&#x27;s total consumption. In the worst case scenario set out by Miller, gas storage facilities in the region will only be 5% full by March.

Update #2: Gazprom&#x27;s Miller says Germany&#x27;s gas storage only enough for 2-2.5 months (Reuters)  
Update #3: Gazprom CEO Says Europe Could Freeze Even With Full Gas Storage (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: The Gazprom CEO is saying the same thing that I said last month. Everyone has enough stockpiles to last a normal winter, but it is the spring of 2023 and beyond that we should be more concerned about when it comes to critical energy supplies and shortages.</span>

                              <span>BBC: Gas taps can be still turned on to EU, says Vladimir Putin 
President Vladimir Putin has said the gas taps can be still turned on for Russian supplies to the EU, despite sharp political disagreements. 
Russia has not delivered gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 line since August, and Nord Stream 2 was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
The February invasion led to gas price hikes, and EU customers face record tariffs this winter.  But Germany quickly rejected Mr Putin&#x27;s offer to send gas via Nord Stream 2.

   PJMedia: Trump, Gabbard Warn of Nuclear Armageddon 
Former President Trump and former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are emerging as voices of reason, as the world watches developments in the Ukraine War with increasing concern. Ukraine is awash in cash and weapons sent by the Biden administration to support its war to repel Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is taking full advantage of the situation, refusing to take a breather until his country is restored to its pre-Russian-aggression borders — including the return of Crimea. Globalist powers are aligning to back nuclear-armed Russian President Vladimir Putin into a corner — an extremely volatile situation.

 Around 30% of energy infrastructure in Ukraine has been hit by Russian missiles since Monday, Ukraine&#x27;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said Tuesday. 
The minister told CNN that this was the “first time from the beginning of the war” that Russia has “dramatically targeted” energy infrastructure. 
He said one reason is because Ukrainian electricity exports to Europe “helps European countries to save on Russian gas and coal,” adding that Ukraine is trying “to reconnect quickly from the other sources.”

Reuters: Ukraine gets new air defenses, allies deepen resolve after Russian strikes 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Ukraine&#x27;s allies announced delivery of new air defenses and recommitted to providing it robust, enduring military assistance at a meeting at NATO headquarters on Wednesday, saying Russian missile strikes two days ago only further united them. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, sitting next to his Ukrainian counterpart, opened the gathering of more than 50 countries by condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s deadly missile attacks against &quot;targets with no military purpose&quot; across Ukraine.

iNews: War in Ukraine shakes up weapons industry with new trends and unlikely winners 
The war in Ukraine has supplied a lucrative shop window for arms manufacturers, creating some unlikely winners amid a surge in demand for heavy weaponry. 
Weapons such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, Bayraktar drones, and the Himars rocket launcher have achieved global renown, promoted in memes, songs, and enthusiastic endorsements from Ukrainian officials. 
The major US manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon enjoyed share price surges after the outbreak of war, as did European counterparts BAE Systems and Rheinmetall. But they are very far from the only game in town.

Israeli PM hails groundbreaking agreement that could boost natural gas production in the Mediterranean  Israel and Lebanon have reportedly agreed a deal in a dispute over gas fields and the two countries’ maritime border, a groundbreaking diplomatic achievement that could boost natural gas production in the Mediterranean before the European winter begins. 
Yair Lapid, Israel’s prime minister, said on Tuesday that months of US-brokered negotiations had resulted in a “historic agreement” between the two nations, which have technically been at war since Israel’s creation in 1948. 
The deal would “strengthen Israel’s security, inject billions into Israel’s economy, and ensure the stability of our northern border”, he added.

                              <span>CNBC: Leak detected on another Russian pipeline connecting to Europe, but Poland says it looks accidental 
* Polish pipeline operator PERN said Wednesday that a leak detected on one of its Druzhba pipelines bringing oil from Russia to Europe was likely caused by an accident. 
* Mateusz Berger, Poland’s top official in charge of energy infrastructure, told Reuters via telephone that there were no grounds to believe the leak was caused by sabotage. 
* The Druzhba pipeline leak comes just over two weeks after a series of blasts on two subsea gas pipelines connecting Russia to Germany triggered what might be the single largest release of methane in history. 
Polish pipeline operator PERN said Wednesday that a leak detected on one of its Druzhba pipelines bringing oil from Russia to Europe was likely caused by an accident. 
The leak was detected on Tuesday evening on one of the two lines of the Western section of the pipeline, PERN said in a statement. 
The incident occurred roughly 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock.

                              <span>NBC: Biden warns there will be &#x27;consequences&#x27; for Saudi Arabia after oil production cut 
The president did not specify what action the U.S. might take, but he indicated that Congress would be involved. 
 President Joe Biden warned Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would face &quot;consequences&quot; after OPEC+ last week announced the biggest cut in oil production since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Senior Democrats on Capitol Hill have condemned the decision by Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil-producing alliance, to reduce the global supply of petroleum. 
Higher oil prices are seen as helping Russia, the world&#x27;s second-largest oil exporter, finance its war in Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has met his United Arab Emirates counterpart in St. Petersburg. 
The move comes days after OPEC+ decided to cut global oil production by two million barrels per day, the alliance’s largest cut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
&quot;We are actively working in the framework of OPEC+,” said Putin.   “I know your position. Our decisions, our action, aren&#x27;t directed against anyone. We aren&#x27;t acting to create problems for anyone… Our actions are aimed to ensure stability in global energy markets.&quot;
The decision to cut oil production further strained the United States&#x27; relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key member of the OPEC+ alliance.

President Biden on Tuesday said he has no intention of meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) summit, but that he would consider talking depending on the topic. 
“Look, I have no intention of meeting with him. But for example, if he came to me at the G20 and said I want to talk about the release of Griner, I’d meet with him. I mean, it would depend,” Biden said, referencing WNBA star Brittney Griner, who has been imprisoned in Russia for months.

Reuters: Putin tells IAEA&#x27;s Grossi that situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant &quot;of concern&quot; 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin told International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi on Tuesday that the situation around Ukraine&#x27;s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is &quot;of concern&quot;. 
At a meeting in St Petersburg shown on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, that Russia was open for dialogue and would discuss &quot;all issues&quot; concerning the facility&#x27;s operations. 
Putin also said there had been &quot;excessive, dangerous politicization&quot; of everything to do with nuclear activity.

   RT:  NATO admitted it’s at war with Russia – Medvedev  
The ex-Russian president has claimed that the bloc’s secretary-general confirmed direct participation in the Ukraine conflict  
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg may have inadvertently admitted that the Western military alliance is at war with Moscow, at least in the eyes of former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. 
At issue is Stoltenberg’s statement on Tuesday that a military victory for Russia in Ukraine would be a defeat for NATO.   Medvedev called the comment “an open confirmation of NATO’s participation in the war against our country – an unwise, but pure-hearted remark. The honest Norwegian fellow has finally admitted it.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO told Moscow on Tuesday it would meet attacks on allies&#x27; critical infrastructure with a &quot;united and determined response&quot; and was monitoring Russia&#x27;s nuclear forces closely as the country was &quot;losing on the battlefield&quot; in Ukraine. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said ahead of a two-day meeting of the Western alliance&#x27;s defence ministers in Brussels that it had not seen any changes in Russia&#x27;s nuclear posture, but was &quot;vigilant&quot;. 
Stoltenberg described Russia&#x27;s missile strikes on civilians in Ukraine on Monday as a sign of weakness.

Walker did himself no favors in subsequent media interviews in which he vehemently denied the reports, but added “if this had happened” there is “nothing to be ashamed of” – he comments then denied doing it hours later while talking to reporters.

The bombs killed 202 people in total, including 88 Australians, making it the single largest loss of Australian life due to an act of terror.

Mr Laczynski spoke with Sky News Australia about his experience of the attacks. 

“This never leaves us,” Mr Laczynski said. 

“There is no finish line to these anniversaries for us. 

“We want to make sure that these people are never forgotten – they were all young, they were all in their twenties and thirties, some even in their teens.”</span>

                              <span>Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has labelled the Democratic Party an “elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness” in a video posted to social media announcing she’s officially leaving the party.

“I can no longer remain in today&#x27;s Democratic Party that is now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue &amp; stoke anti-white racism,” Ms Gabbard said in her YouTube video.

&quot;I believe in a government that is of the people, by the people and for the people. Unfortunately, today&#x27;s Democratic Party does not. Instead, it stands for a government that is of, by and for the powerful elite.”

Ms Gabbard has held various roles in the Democratic Party since 2002 including representing Hawaii’s 2nd congressional district from 2013-2021.

She was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 Presidential election before dropping out in March and endorsing Joe Biden.</span>

                              <span>Today marks the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings, as the community of Coogee comes together to commemorate the lives that were lost. 

Ben Roberts was a victim of the bombings and sadly passed away from the terrorist attack.

His mother, Jan Roberts, put together a speech to honour her son’s life.

“Grief comes in waves - it’s like the sea,” she said. 

“Everyone deals with grief in different ways - it left me weak at the knees and needing silence. I existed but was not present for two years.

“I will always be Ben’s mum.”</span>

                              <span>CNBC: IMF cuts global growth forecast for next year, warns ‘the worst is yet to come’ 
* The International Monetary Fund predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% in 2023. 
* “The worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,” the report reads. 
* Its GDP estimate for this year remained steady at 3.2%, which was down from the 6% seen in 2021. 
The International Monetary Fund predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% next year, 0.2 percentage point lower than its July forecast, and anticipates 2023 will feel like a recession for millions around the world. 
Aside from the global financial crisis and the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, this is “the weakest growth profile since 2001,” the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook published Tuesday. 
Its GDP estimate for this year remained steady at 3.2%, which was down from the 6% seen in 2021.

Walker, 23, made a name for himself both thanks to his father ― Herschel Walker, the buffoonish caricature of a man who made her name as one of the best college running backs Georgia has ever seen — and as a bullish miscreant, and he does it all in segmented rants on TikTok. 

As such Walker ― national cheerleading championnot the former running back and Republican Senate candidate ― has become a rising star in conservative country because no one likes a black man telling other black men they aren’t good dads like the Conservatives do.

In one of Walker’s infamous TikTok rants about absentee dads, he loudly exclaims that Nick Cannon (yes, the “Wild N’ Out” host…</span>

                              <span>Angela Lansbury, star of the drama series “Murder, She Wrote”, has died, the family of the British actress confirmed.  She was 96 years old.
She died “peacefully sleeping at home in Los Angeles” on Tuesday morning, Michael A. McConnell of Zero Gravity Management said in a statement on behalf of her three children.  Lansbury would turn 97 in just five days.
Throughout her 80-year career, Lansbury has starred on the big screen, television and on stage.  She has won five Tony Awards, most recently in 2009 for her role in the Broadway revival of “Blithe Spirit”. 

Lansbury starred in Disney’s 1991 animated musical “Beauty and the Beast”, voicing Mrs.  Potts, but is perhaps best known for starring as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher in the CBS hit “Murder, She Wrote,” which ran from 1984 to 1996. 
Before her television career, she was considered one of the last movie stars of Hollywood’s golden age, CBS Los Angeles  reported.  She was a player signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s.

Andre Thomas was charged with capital murder in 2005 after killing his wife, his 4-year-old son, who was biracial, and his wife’s 13-month-old daughter, which his lawyers said occurred during a schizophrenic episode. 
During the murders, Thomas tried to remove the hearts of his three victims, thinking he could “free them from evil”, according to court documents.  He then stabbed himself in the chest and later confessed to the murders to the police.  Thomas pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.  While in prison awaiting hi…</span>

In 2017, Drug Enforcement Administration agents following the money from cocaine deals in Memphis, Tennessee, identified a mysterious figure in Mexico entrusted by drug lords with their millions: a Chinese American gangster named Xizhi Li.
As the agents tracked Li’s activity across the Americas and Asia, they realized he wasn’t just another money launderer. He was a pioneer. Operating with the acumen of a financier and the tradecraft of a spy, he had helped devise an innovative system that revolutionized the drug underworld and fortified the cartels.
Li hit on a better way to address a problem that has long bedeviled the world’s drug lords: ho…</span>

Now, the Biden administration says it will be &quot;re-evaluating&quot; its relationship with the Saudis.

Experts speaking to The Intercept say the Saudis&#x27; move wasn&#x27;t just geopolitical -- it was an effort to influence U.S. politics. 
“The Saudis are working to get Trump re-elected and for the MAGA Republicans to win the midterms,” Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, told The Intercept. “Higher oil prices will undermine the Democrats.”

Charles, 73, will be formally crowned at London&#x27;s Westminster Abbey, following a long tradition dating back more than 900 years.
The monarch&#x27;s wife, Queen Consort Camilla, 75, will also be crowned, the palace confirmed.
May 6 is the fourth birthday of Charles&#x27; grandson Archie, the son of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.
&quot;The coronation will reflect the monarch&#x27;s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry,&quot; royal officials said in a short statement.

                              <span>The Justice Department announced that a British property manager with ties to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska has been charged with violating sanctions. 
Graham Bonham Carter is being charged with &quot;conspiring to violate United States sanctions imposed on Russian oligarch Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska and wire fraud in connection with BONHAM-CARTER’s funding of U.S. properties purchased by Deripaska and efforts to expatriate Deripaska’s artwork in the U.S. through misrepresentations,&quot; wrote the Justice Department in an announcement. 
Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was able to wiggle his way into a lucrative deal with Donald Trump&#x27;s government in 2019.

                              <span>An explosive new report claims that Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin before he floated a &quot;peace plan&quot; for Ukraine that was widely panned by critics as a gift to Russia.
Vice News reports that newsletter from Ian Bremmer, a foreign policy expert and the founder of the Eurasia Group global risk consultancy firm, is claiming that Musk said that Putin is now &quot;prepared to negotiate&quot; a peace settlement but only if Ukraine accepted Russia&#x27;s annexations of its territories in the eastern part of the country.
Putin emphasized to Musk that Russia&#x27;s annexation of this Ukrainian territory, as well as an agreement in which Ukraine would maintain neutrality and not join NATO, would be accomplished &quot;no matter what,&quot; and he even emphasized that his nation was prepared to launch a nuclear strike should Ukrainian forces attempt to retake Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.
Bremmer also claims that Musk personally told him that &quot;everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome,&quot; and that was why he publicly floated his plan.
IN OTHER NEWS: Now Trump is openly challenging the feds to indict him
But Musk&#x27;s plan has not been well received in Kyiv, with many officials saying it would amount to capitulation to Russia.
&quot;The only outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing tesla crap. So good luck to you,&quot; Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk wrote to Musk on Twitter. &quot;F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you.&quot;
Musk has denied Bremmer&#x27;s claims, however, and he wrote on Twitter that &quot;I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space.&quot;

&quot;I think the president&#x27;s been very clear that this is a relationship that we need to continue to re-evaluate, that we need to be willing to revisit,&quot; National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.
&quot;Certainly in light of the OPEC decision, I think that&#x27;s where he is.&quot;
The 13-nation, Saudi-led OPEC cartel and its 10 allies headed by Russia agreed last week to reduce output by two million barrels a day from November -- raising fears that oil prices could soar.
The decision was widely seen as a diplomatic slap in the face, since Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in July and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salma…</span>

Such weapons are less destructive than “strategic” weapons designed to wipe out entire cities. But analysts worry that this talk of tactical weapons risks normalising weapons of mass destruction.
Nuclear-armed authoritarian states are increasingly invoking the specter of using “tactical” nuclear weapons. North Korea said on Monday that it had simulated a “tactical” nuclear attack on South Korea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted at using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine as Moscow suffers heavy losses on the battlefield.

The Russians had a significant numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, much greater firepower, air and naval superiority and seemingly bottomless resources with which to impose its will. It was reasonable to believe that Russia would conquer Ukraine rapidly and then replace the existing government before declaring &quot;victory&quot;. 
Of course, that did not happen.
The Ukrainians had been preparing for this eventuality since at least 2014, when the Russian military and its allied forces invaded eastern Ukraine and illegally occupied and annexed Crimea. With the help of the U.S. and other Western allies, the Ukr…</span>

While observers do not believe the unrest is close to toppling the government, the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, with reports of strikes spreading to the vital energy sector.

Her household is among a handful of families who still inhabit the Kome Caves, a heritage site in the north of the country, first occupied about 200 years ago by local tribes seeking shelter from conflict and cannibalism.
&quot;Life is good, we grow our own vegetables, I can pray anytime I want,&quot; Ntefane, a rosary around her neck, tells AFP.
More than 1,800 meters above sea level, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the capital Maseru, the settlement is surrounded by barren pastures, where shepherds draped in long woolen blankets graze cattle in the morning mist.

The insults are flying between the two candidates before the second round of presidential elections.
Here is a timeline of some of the put-downs:
Bolsonaro on Lula: &#x27;swindler&#x27;
&quot;I talk dirty, but I&#x27;m not a thief,&quot; Bolsonaro said at a September 7 campaign event on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, referring to Lula&#x27;s 2017 conviction on charges of accepting bribes for public contracts while president. A Supreme Court judge annulled the conviction last year.
&quot;Liar, ex-convict, traitor,&quot; Bolsonaro said of Lula in the last televised debate on TV Globo on September 28.

A plane carrying famed Italian football club Grande Torino crashed on its way back from Portugal on May 4, 1949, killing all 31 passengers and crew. A reported one million people poured into the streets of Turin to bid farewell to their heroes. Grande Torino were named Italian champions for the fifth time in a row.

The kingdom has been stunned by the tragedy in northeastern Na Klang province, one of the worst mass killings in its history, with flags at half-mast and King Maha Vajiralongkorn visiting the families of the victims.
At Wat Rat Samakee temple in Na Klang, chanting monks began the ceremony as the exhausted and grieving close-knit rural community prepared to say a final goodbye to 19 of those killed.
&quot;An incident like this shouldn&#x27;t have happened,&quot; said Thanakorn Nueangmatcha, 39, ahead of the funeral at the temple.

Iran&#x27;s clerical authorities have been shaken by over three weeks of protests that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year old Iranian of Kurdish origin, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police.
Despite the use of brutal force by the authorities that activists say has left dozens dead, and led to hundreds of arrests, there is so far no sign of the protest movement coming to an end.
Protests have been especially intense in the city of Sanandaj in the western province of Kurdistan, Amini&#x27;s home region, where rights groups fear heavy casualties and accuse authorities of resort…</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskiy on Monday that the United States will provide Ukraine with advanced air systems after a devastating missile barrage from Russia.
Biden spoke by phone with Zelenskiy to give assurances about continued U.S. support and to condemn the &quot;senseless attacks&quot; from Russia that hit civilian targets.
&quot;President Biden pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems,&quot; a White House statement on the phone call said.
Biden also told Zelenskiy the United States and its allies and partners would continue imposing costs on Russia, &quot;holding Russia accountable for its war crimes and atrocities, and providing Ukraine with security, economic, and humanitarian assistance,&quot; the White House said.
The United States has provided more than $16.8 billion worth of U.S. security assistance since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and imposed a wide-ranging array of economic sanctions on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine.

                              <span>The websites for a number of major US airports were briefly taken offline Monday after a cyberattack promoted by a pro-Russian hacking group.
The distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks hit the airport websites of several major US cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and St Louis.
A DDOS attack involves knocking a website offline by flooding it with traffic.
The airport websites were targeted after the pro-Russian hacking group known as &quot;KillNet&quot; published a list of sites and encouraged its followers to attack them.
The DDOS attacks only affected the public-facing websites of the airports, which supply flight and services information and do not have any impact on operations.
Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport said its website is &quot;up and running after an incident early this morning that made it inaccessible to the public.&quot;
&quot;An investigation into the cause of the incident is underway,&quot; it said. &quot;At no time were operations at the airport impacted.&quot;Most of the airport websites targeted appeared to be functioning normally after being temporarily knocked offline.
KillNet claimed responsibility last week for attacks on a number of US state government websites, and it has taken aim at other countries opposing Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
There was no immediate comment from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).</span>

                              <span>Russia has launched its largest strikes on Ukraine in months, attacking civilian areas in Kyiv and nine other cities just two days after President Vladimir Putin had accused Ukraine of blowing up a key bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. As the war continues to escalate in Ukraine, we feature an interview recorded earlier this month with world-renowned political dissident Noam Chomsky in Brazil and political writer Vijay Prashad. Chomsky discusses why he thinks there is no major U.S. peace movement in response to the Ukraine war, and talks about the dangerous U.S. Senate policy on China and Taiwan, which he says, along with Ukraine, could end in a “terminal war.” Prashad also examines the destruction wrought in the Global South by Western so-called humanitarian invasion in the name of demo…</span>

&quot;Let there be no doubt,&quot; Putin said in televised comments addressed to his security council, &quot;if attempts at terrorist attacks continue, the response from Russia will be severe.&quot;

                              <span>Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently floated a new &quot;compromise&quot; intended to keep peace between Taiwan and China -- and it is being given the same kind of hostile reception that politicians in Ukraine recently gave to his proposed &quot;peace plan&quot; with Russia.
As CNBC reports, Musk told the Financial Times over the weekend that the United States should endorse some kind of plan that gives Beijing some administrative control over Taiwan.
Specifically, Musk said America should &quot;be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy.”
“And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong,&quot; Musk added.
However, Taiwanese diplomat Hsiao Bi-khim immediately shot down Musk&#x27;s proposal, which had received a friendly reception from Qin Gang, China&#x27;s ambassador to the United States.

&quot;Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale,&quot; she said. &quot;Any lasting proposal for our future must be determined peacefully, free from coercion, and respectful of the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan.
Bates Gill of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis similarly told CNBC that there is little desire among people in Taiwan to have any such arrangement, especially after watching how China slowly destroyed freedoms that had existed previously in the city of Hong Kong.
&quot;The world’s wealthiest man obviously feels he has a lot to say on these geopolitical questions,&quot; explained Gill. &quot;I would only suggest that he take a lot harder look at the realities, the historical precedents and geopolitical contestation that surround all of these questions before giving us all a lesson in diplomacy.&quot;</span>

But the real culprit behind the subjugation of non-European peoples across the globe wasn&#x27;t an individual, or even a monarch. It was the Roman Catholic Church. It&#x27;s time the church owned that grievous mistake.
 As early as the 15th century, as European nations were making voyages of discovery, Catholic popes gave them permission to subjugate and steal. The most significant of these papal permission slips was the Doctrine of Discovery. A decree Issued in 1493 by Pope Alexander VI, it essentially told Catholic countries that any lands they &quot;discovered&quot; were …</span>

                              <span>Several cities across Ukraine were rocked with explosions in what some are calling the most extensive attack on the country since Russia launched its invasion in February. 
&quot;This morning, a massive high-precision strike was conducted on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, military command, and communications,&quot; said Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;In case Ukrainian terrorist attacks continue on Russian territory, our response will be tough and proportional.&quot;
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the strikes disproportionately targeted civilian infrastructure in 11 of Ukraine&#x27;s 25 regions. 
&quot;It&#x27;s a tough morning when you&#x27;re dealing with terrorists,&quot; said Zelenskyy in the video. &quot;They&#x27;re choosing targets to harm as many people as possible.&quot;

                              <span>Russia on Monday launched a series of missiles into cities across Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson doesn&#x27;t believe that any new initiative will help the country succeed in its goals of taking and holding Ukrainian territory.
While speaking on CNN, Anderson broke down news that Russian General Sergey Surovikin would be taking over as head of the Kremlin&#x27;s &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine, which in recent weeks has been hit with multiple humiliating setbacks.
While Surovikin has a well earned reputation as a hardliner, Anderson was skeptical he could turn things around given the current state of Russia&#x27;s military.
&quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going to be a new approach because he&#x27;s incapable of doing a new approach as long as the Russian army is what it is, which is a terrible army,&quot; he said.

Later in the segment, Anderson elaborated on why new leadership won&#x27;t be nearly enough to fix what&#x27;s broken in the Russian military.
&quot;It&#x27;s not like the soldiers are going to jump into a phone booth and come out as Superman,&quot; he said. &quot;They have a terrible army. They&#x27;re ten years away from having a good army that can take on the Ukrainians and achieve the military objectives they wanted. They have a low morale... They&#x27;re incapable of executing the military operations that Vladimir Putin wants. George Patton couldn&#x27;t make this a success for Putin.&quot;

In Iran no-one who expresses dissent from the ruling theocratic system, including the famous, is safe from being caught in the dragnet of a crackdown that has seen hundreds arrested in more than three weeks of protests.
Activists say that when the unrest erupted last month over the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police, the authorities initially resorted to lethal force, killing dozens in the space of days.
But, as well as keeping up the threat of force, authorities are increasingly resorting to arrests, with a particular focus on those who promote videos of protests or anti-regime messages on social media.

Kim made acquiring tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021, and this year vowed to develop North Korea&#x27;s nuclear forces at the fastest possible speed.
The country revised its nuclear laws last month to allow pre-emptive strikes, with Kim declaring North Korea an &quot;irreversible&quot; nuclear power -- effectively ending the possibility of negotiations over its arsenal.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan throws open its doors to visitors this week after more than two years of pandemic isolation, hopes for a tourism boom face tough headwinds amid shuttered shops and a shortage of hospitality workers.
From Tuesday, Japan will reinstate visa-free travel to dozens of countries, ending some of world&#x27;s strictest border controls to slow the spread of COVID-19. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen&#x27;s slide to a 24-year low.
Arata Sawa is among those eager for the return of foreign tourists, who previously comprised up to 90% of the guests at his traditional inn.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea&#x27;s recent missile tests were &quot;tactical nuclear&quot; drills personally overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, state media said Monday, adding the launches were a response to US-led joint military exercises in the region.
Kim has long wanted to develop tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021.
The country revised its nuclear laws last month, envisaging a wide array of scenarios in which it could use its nukes, with Kim declaring North Korea an &quot;irreversible&quot; nuclear power -- effectively ending the possibility of denuclearisation talks.
Since then, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington have ramped up combined…</span>

Russian President Vladimir Putin has pointed the finger at Ukraine&#x27;s secret service SBU for what he called an &quot;act of terrorism&quot; on a bridge linking Russia to Crimea.
&quot;There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation,&quot; Putin said on Sunday evening in his first public remarks since an explosion tore through the bridge&#x27;s rail and roadway.
Kiev has so far not admitted involvement in the attack on Saturday, which sent massive plumes of smoke and flames into the air when a blast damaged one of the key supply routes for Moscow&#x27;s faltering military campaign in Ukr…</span>

A projection by pollster SORA for national broadcaster ORF based on a partial vote count put Van der Bellen, a 78-year-old former leader of the Greens, on 54.6% with a margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. His nearest rival was far-right Freedom Party candidate Walter Rosenkranz on 18.9%.

The storm made landfall early on Sunday near Laguna de Perlas, the NHC said. By 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) it was around 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of Bluefields.
The hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it crosses Nicaragua, emerging over the eastern Pacific by Sunday night. It was forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night, the NHC said.
&quot;Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides possible from heavy rains over Central America and Southern Mexico through early next week,&quot; the center said.
