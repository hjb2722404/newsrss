Reuters: South Korea&#x27;s Yoon orders revamp of response to violations of country&#x27;s air space 
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea&#x27;s President Yoon Suk-yeol ordered a revamp of the military&#x27;s response to objects violating its airspace, his office said on Thursday, after an intrusion by North Korean drones exposed its difficulty in shooting down small aircraft. 
Five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea on Monday, prompting South Korea&#x27;s military to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, though it failed to bring down the drones, which flew over South Korea for hours. 
Amid criticism over South Korea&#x27;s air defences at a time of North Korea&#x27;s growing nuclear and missile threats, Yoon visited the state-run Agency for Defence Development to check the country&#x27;s reconnaissance and interception capabilities and called for an overhaul of the response system against &quot;all flying objects&quot;.

VOA: Australia Approves Extradition to US of Ex-Marine Pilot 
Sydney — Australia has approved a request to extradite former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan to the United States where he faces charges of money laundering and breaking U.S. arms control laws, the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department said on Thursday. 
Duggan, who was arrested in Australia in October and remains in custody, is accused of breaking U.S. arms control laws by training Chinese military pilots to land on aircraft carriers, according to a 2017 indictment unsealed by a U.S. court in December.

   Reuters: Russia Says It Shot Down Drone Near Engels Air Base 
(Reuters) - A Russian regional governor said on Thursday that air defences had shot down a drone near the Engels air force base, home to long-range strategic bombers. 
Russia says Ukraine has already tried to attack the base twice this month, killing at least six Russian servicemen, although it said there was only slight damage to two aircraft. 
The base is located near Saratov, 730 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow and hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines in Ukraine.

Reuters: Putin and Xi to speak by video link on Friday 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping via video link on Friday to discuss a host of bilateral and regional issues. 
&quot;First of all, they will talk about bilateral Russian-Chinese relations,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. 
&quot;And, of course, it will be very important to exchange views on more acute regional problems - those that are closer to us, Russia, and those that are closer to China,&quot; Peskov added, without providing specific details.

I am also hearing reports that this is going to be a long meeting, and it will be classified. This tells me that a number of discussions that are going to take place will be of a military nature.

                              <span>Reuters: Chinese jet came within 10 feet of U.S. military aircraft, U.S. says 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 metres) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last week and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace, the U.S. military said on Thursday. 
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft. 
The incident, which involved a Chinese Navy J-11 fighter jet and a U.S. air force RC-135 aircraft, took place on Dec. 21, the U.S. military said in a statement.
&quot;We expect all countries in the Indo-Pacific region to use international airspace safely and in accordance with international law,&quot; it added. 
A U.S. military spokesperson said the Chinese jet came within 10 feet of the plane&#x27;s wing, but 20 feet from its nose, which caused the U.S. aircraft to take evasive maneuvers.

Kiev’s plan for settling the conflict with Moscow is a non-starter, the Russian foreign minister has said 
Russia is not about to engage with Ukraine based on the ‘peace formula’ put forward by President Vladimir Zelensky, as it deems the terms unacceptable, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday. 
He reiterated, however, that Moscow has not refused to engage in talks in general.  Speaking to RIA Novosti, the foreign minister stated that “obviously, Kiev is not ready for dialogue.”

BBC: Ukraine fighting is deadlocked, spy chief Kyrylo Budanov tells BBC 
Fighting in Ukraine is currently at a deadlock as neither Ukraine nor Russia can make significant advances, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence agency has said, while Kyiv waits for more advanced weapons from Western allies. 
&quot;The situation is just stuck,&quot; Kyrylo Budanov told the BBC in an interview. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t move.&quot; 
After Ukrainian troops recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, most of the fiercest battles have been around Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region. Elsewhere, Russian forces appear to be on the defensive while winter has slowed down the pace of Ukraine&#x27;s ground operations across the 1,000km (620-mile) front line.

WNU Editor: If you look at the current state of the war where the territory is not being captured/recaptured on a daily basis, one can say that the war is currently stalemated. But if you look at the war from an attrition point of view, this war is anything but deadlocked. 
I have been reading reports that Ukraine is currently losing up to two battalions of soldiers per day (wounded/killed/missing). And on the Russia side I would not be surprised if the casualties are just as high. Bottom line. It is only a matter of time before one side loses the capability to continue to fight.</span>

Minsk claimed that a Soviet-era air defense missile was fired from Ukraine and landed in Belarus after Ukraine was hit by a barrage of Russian missiles. 
Belarusian and Russian media reported on Thursday that a Ukrainian missile had crossed into Belarus&#x27; territory.  
The reports came shortly after Russia launched one of its largest missile attacks against Ukraine since the war started in February, with Kyiv saying more than 60 missiles had been fired on Ukrainian cities. 
Minsk&#x27;s key ally Moscow is reportedly sending officials to investigate the incident. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.

Russia fired scores of missiles into Ukraine early on Thursday, targeting the capital Kyiv and other cities including Lviv and Odesa in the west, in one of its largest aerial bombardments that sent people rushing to shelters and knocked out power. 
“Senseless barbarism. These are the only words that come to mind seeing Russia launch another missile barrage at peaceful Ukrainian cities ahead of New Year,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.

 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore in Israel’s 37th government on Thursday, promising that his right-religious coalition will deliver political stability after five bumpy back-to-back elections since 2019. 
Confidence in the government was confirmed by 63 of the 64 coalition members, constituting a relatively solid and cohesive majority in the 120-seat Knesset.

 Daily Mail: China&#x27;s &#x27;elite are stockpiling Pfizer&#x27;s Covid drug&#x27; as country battles huge wave of fresh infections that has left hospitals overflowing with patients after abandoning Zero Covid 
* Basic medicines and Paxlovid Covid treatment are extremely difficult to obtain 
* Hospitals in densely populated Chinese city&#x27;s are inundated with Covid patients 
* Rural areas are quickly ramping up medical facilities ahead of New Year holiday 
* Countries around the globe are implementing testing for Chinese travellers 
China&#x27;s abrupt lifting of many of its tough pandemic restrictions earlier this month has allowed the virus to spread rapidly in a country where most people have little access to treatment.  
Spiraling infections have led to shortages of cold medicine, long lines at fever clinics, and at-capacity emergency rooms turning away patients.   
Beijing city authorities plan to distribute the oral Covid drug Paxlovid at local hospitals and community clinics, but the drug - a combination of antivirals nirmatrelvir and ritonavir produced by Pfizer - remains extremely difficult to obtain for ordinary people.

MITROVICA, Kosovo (Reuters) - Kosovo re-opened its biggest border crossing with Serbia on Thursday, hours after protesting Serbs in its north promised to remove roadblocks, easing a surge in tensions that has alarmed world powers. 
Both the European Union and the United States have been pressing Kosovo and Serbia to step back from a mounting confrontation that has seen Serbia put its army on the highest combat alert. 
Serbs in northern Kosovo, who have been erecting roadblocks since Dec. 10 in protest at the arrest of a former Serb policeman - the latest in a long series of flashpoints - agreed to start taking them down after he was moved to house arrest.

                              <span>Business Insider: Taiwan&#x27;s remote islands are on the frontline with China — sometimes only a few hundred yards from Chinese troops 
* Taiwan is roughly 100 miles from mainland China, but some Taiwanese islands are much closer. 
* Amid rising tensions, those islands are increasingly vulnerable to attack from China&#x27;s military. 
* Taiwan&#x27;s outlying islands would stand little chance against China, but they wouldn&#x27;t be easy to take. 
October marked the 73rd anniversary of the Battle of Guningtou, when Chinese Nationalist forces defeated an attempt by Chinese Communist forces to capture Kinmen, an offshore island that was seen as a stepping-stone toward Taiwan. 
While celebrated, this year&#x27;s anniversary was also a reminder of Taiwan&#x27;s islands&#x27; growing vulnerability to Chinese attack. 
In addition to the main island of Taiwan, Taipei controls five islands or island chains: Kinmen, the Mastu Islands, and the Penghu archipelago in the Taiwan Strait, and the Pratas Islands, also known as the Dongsha Islands, and Itu Aba, also known as Taiping Island, both in the South China Sea.

Reuters: U.S. approves potential sale of anti-tank systems to Taiwan for $180 mln 
The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of Volcano anti-tank mine-laying systems to Taiwan for an estimated $180 million, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. 
Northrop Grumman and Oshkosh Corporation are the prime contractors for the potential sale.  U.S. law requires the executive branch to notify Congress of potential arms sales that are over a certain amount. 
But these notifications are usually not made unless lawmakers have given the State Department and Pentagon informal approval to move ahead.

AFP: The end is nigh? Climate, nuclear crises spark fears of worst 
For thousands of years, predictions of apocalypse have come and gone. But with dangers rising from nuclear war and climate change, does the planet need to at least begin contemplating the worst? 
When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia&#x27;s threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine. 
&quot;We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis&quot; in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.

Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s gifts to his allies sparked a barrage of jokes and comparisons to the Lord of the Rings series. 
Putin, who has faced rebuke from the West over his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, gifted rings to the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a coalition of former Soviet republics, in St. Petersburg on Monday, according to a report from The Moscow Times, an independent Russian news outlet. 
During the summit, in which Putin reaffirmed cooperation between the member states despite some tensions, the Russian president gave the leaders a gold ring engraved with New Year&#x27;s greetings, according to the Times.

(Bloomberg) -- Italian health authorities will begin testing all arrivals from China for Covid after almost half of the passengers on two flights to Milan were found to have the virus. 
They are also sequencing the Milan tests to see if there are new variants, the Health Ministry said in a statement. 
If a new strain is found, officials may impose stricter curbs on travel from the country.  China has seen outbreaks of the virus since the government there abandoned its strict zero-Covid policies. Uncertainty over the scale of the spread has prompted countries, including the US, to consider new restrictions on entry.

Benjamin Netanyahu’s incoming hardline government put West Bank settlement expansion at the top of its list of priorities on Wednesday, vowing to legalise dozens of illegally built outposts and annex the occupied territory as part of its coalition deal with its ultranational allies. 
The coalition agreements, released a day before the government is to be sworn into office, also included language endorsing discrimination against LGBTQ+ people on religious grounds, as well as generous stipends for ultra-Orthodox men who prefer to study instead of work.

Global Times: Nearly 80% find current global economic order unfair: GT poll 
The Global Times released the second part of the annual survey that covered participants from 33 countries on Wednesday, which showed that most participants from Western countries are unsatisfied with the current development of their countries while those from China and many non-Western countries or emerging economies are more satisfied and optimistic about their future, and many participants, especially the ones from non-Western world, believe that China could be a role model for development and able to play a leadership role to guide global development.

WNU Editor: This is a Chinese state media poll. But what I found interesting about it is that the countries that were the most satisfied with the current global economic order were from China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.    
Update: Here is another Global Times poll .... GT survey: over 60% participants believe China’s global influence rising; world concern war, energy &amp; foods crises more than pandemic (Global Times).</span>

Jack Murphy: The CIA is using a European NATO ally’s spy service to conduct a covert sabotage campaign inside Russia under the agency’s direction, according to former U.S. intelligence and military officials. 
The campaign involves long standing sleeper cells that the allied spy service has activated to hinder Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine by waging a secret war behind Russian lines. 
 Years in the planning, the campaign is responsible for many of the unexplained explosions and other mishaps that have befallen the Russian military industrial complex since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, according to three former U.S. intelligence officials, two former U.S. military officials and a U.S. person who has been briefed on the campaign. The former officials declined to identify specific targets for the CIA-directed campaign, but railway bridges, fuel depots and power plants in Russia have all been damaged in unexplained incidents since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.

Update: Report: The CIA Is Directing Sabotage Attacks Inside Russia (Antiwar.com)   
WNU Editor: The Nord Stream pipeline attack was the wake-up call for everyone on what was (and is) happening. What concerns me is when is the blow-back going to happen. You can take this to the bank. The Kremlin is going to retailiate.

And as to who is that NATO ally that the CIA is using to conduct this covert sabotage campaign. I agree with Jeffrey Kaye (see tweet below) that it is probably Poland.

SEOUL — When Washington and Seoul warned earlier this year that North Korea was planning its seventh nuclear weapons test, most South Koreans hardly batted an eye.
Many in the South have grown so used to North Korean saber rattling that they often dismiss the country’s frequent military provocations as predictable attempts to garner attention.  But this week, North Korea was able to shake the steely nerves of many South Koreans using a weapon much cheaper and less sophisticated than a nuclear warhead.

The military has been competing with the private sector to recruit and retain a workforce with critical cyber skills -- a decade-long contest where pay, purpose and personnel management have driven the flow of talent, and the services appear to be losing, according to a government watchdog report. 
Troops who receive extensive cyber training, lured by the lucrative private sector, are parting ways with the military services quicker than some branches can offset the cost of that training. 
The Pentagon&#x27;s efforts have been hamstrung by unclear service obligations and mistracked staffing data in some branches, according to a report from Congress&#x27; Government Accountability Office that was released Wednesday.

FOX News: US emergency oil stockpiles drop to lowest level since 1983 as gas prices tick up  
Keeping emergency oil stockpile levels high is important for U.S. &#x27;energy security and national security,&#x27; GOP lawmakers have warned 
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) fell to its lowest level since 1983 last week as U.S. gasoline prices and oil prices ticked up, according to federal data released Wednesday. 
The level of the SPR — an emergency stockpile of crude oil managed by the Department of Energy (DOE) — declined to 375.1 million barrels last week, marking the first time it has fallen below 378 million barrels since December 1983, according to the Energy Information Administration. Prior to last week, the reserve&#x27;s lowest level since 1983 was recorded on Dec. 30, 1983, when it hit 378.3 million barrels.

DW: How Putin&#x27;s war destroyed Russia&#x27;s business model 
As a result of the war in Ukraine, Russia has lost Europe — its largest foreign investor and main buyer of its energy exports. DW unpacks how Moscow&#x27;s economic fortunes unraveled in 2022. 
Russia&#x27;s state-owned energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft had a very promising start to 2022. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x27;s new coalition government announced several new gas-fired power plants to offset the phaseout of nuclear and coal-powered plants. The two largest contributors to the Russian state budget were set to benefit.

* Taiwan will also test arrivals from mainland China starting Jan. 1, the government said in a statement 
The U.S. government is considering imposing new Covid rules for travelers from China, officials said, citing concerns over virus-related data released by the Chinese government.
“There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing COVID-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data, being reported from the PRC,” officials said in a statement late Tuesday. 
“Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread,” the officials said.

RFE: Kosovo Shuts Down Largest Border Crossing After Roadblock Set Up On Serbian Side  
Kosovar authorities have closed down the main border crossing with Serbia at Merdare after protesters set up a roadblock on the Serbian side amid escalating tensions between ethnic Serbs and authorities in Pristina. 
Merdare, on Kosovo&#x27;s eastern border, was blocked by a truck and tractors, media reported. 
Northern Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs are a majority, has been on edge since November, when hundreds of ethnic Serb policemen, judges, and prosecutors walked off the job in protest at a decision by Pristina to ban the Belgrade-issued license plates inside Kosovo.

Newsweek: Russia&#x27;s Only Aircraft Carrier Catches Fire 
A fire broke out on the flagship of the Russian Navy, according to local media reports. 
The blaze started on the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia&#x27;s only aircraft carrier, while it was docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Barents Sea port city of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, news agency Tass said. 
An emergency services source told the agency on Thursday morning that 20 people had been evacuated, the fire was extinguished and that &quot;there were no casualties.&quot; 
Alexei Rakhmanov, head of the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), which is overseeing renovation of the vessel, told RIA Novosti that the incident occurred during repair work. 
The Admiral Kuznetsov has been out of service and in dry dock for repairs since 2018.

Joe and Jill Biden arrived in the U.S. Virgins Islands on Tuesday evening to spend the New Year&#x27;s Eve in the sun as thousands of Americans remain stranded by canceled flights in the wake of winter weather. 
The Bidens, accompanied by grandkids Natalie and Hunter Jr. and daughter Ashley, arrived to 76 degree weather on St. Croix while much of the United States remained under a winter storm warming. 
Traveling on Air Force One presents no travel problems for the president - unlike unlucky passengers on Southwest Airlines where nearly 87 percent of flights across the U.S are canceled.

KYIV (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov gave Ukraine an ultimatum on Monday to fulfil Moscow&#x27;s proposals, including surrendering territory Russia controls, or its army would decide the issue, a day after President Vladimir Putin said he was open to talks. 
Kyiv and its Western allies have dismissed Putin&#x27;s offer to talk, with his forces battering Ukrainian towns with missiles and rockets and Moscow continuing to demand that Kyiv recognise its conquest of a fifth of the country.  Kyiv says it will fight until Russia withdraws.

Many come up with futuristic hypotheses, as if competing to single out the wildest, and even the most absurd ones. 
Here’s our humble contribution.
What can happen in 2023:

   FOX News: Putin&#x27;s chief advisor predicts US civil war resulting in Elon Musk presidency 
A chief advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin made a series of bizarre predictions for 2023 Tuesday in a tweet where he claimed the U.S. would enter into a civil war and Elon Musk would come out on top. 
Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Putin&#x27;s advisory security council, took to Twitter to share his &quot;humble contribution&quot; to what he thinks could unfold in the new year.
&quot;Civil war will break out in the U.S.,&quot; he said in a list of wild predictions. &quot;California and Texas becoming independent states as a result.  &quot;Texas and Mexico will form an allied state,&quot; he continued.
&quot;Elon Musk’ll win the presidential election in a number of states which, after the new Civil War’s end, will have been given to the GOP.&quot;

                              <span>RFE: Putin Signs Decree Banning Russian Oil Exports To Countries That Impose Price Cap  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree banning the supply of crude oil to foreign companies and citizens that abide by a $60-per-barrel price cap set by Western allies as a means to squeeze Russian revenue used to fund the war in Ukraine. 
The restrictions will take effect on February 1 and remain in effect until July 1, according to the decree signed by Putin on December 27.  The decree applies not only to oil but also to oil products; however, the government will separately determine the date from which sales of those products at the established price ceiling will be prohibited.

Russia is prepared to resume gas supplies to Europe via the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, which was previously stopped for political reasons, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Russian state news agency TASS on Sunday. 
“The European market remains relevant, as the gas shortage persists, and we have every opportunity to resume supplies. For example, the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which was stopped for political reasons, remains unused,” Novak said.  There is an increase in demand for gas from Europe, Novak said, according to TASS.

A 97-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has filed an appeal against the guilty verdict she was given for her role in the deaths that took place at her place of work during World War II.
The appeal means that Germany&#x27;s highest criminal court, the Federal Court of Justice, has to examine whether a procedural error was made.
&quot;The verdict is thus not legally binding,&quot; the lower court in Itzehoe in northern Germany said on Wednesday.
Identified only as Irmgard F under German privacy laws, she was found guilty on December 20 of complicity in more than 10,500 cases of murder and given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in northern Germany.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is &quot;very sick&quot;, his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis&#x27; announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden &quot;worsening&quot; of his health.
&quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church,&quot; Francis said in Wednesday&#x27;s surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.

Its promoters reckon it is revolutionizing human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.
Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
The European Union is likely to pass legislation next year -- the AI Act -- aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
Looming large in the debates has been China&#x27;s use of biometric data, facial recognition and other technology to build a powerful system of control.

Uruguay, a country where horses are not considered food but companions, has seen a rise in equine meat exports, prompting efforts to rescue horses destined for slaughter.
In 2020, the small South American nation was the seventh-largest exporter of horse meat, according to the OEC economic data site, with Belgium, Russia, France and Japan among the top importers.
Most of Uruguay&#x27;s tens of thousands of race, sports and work horses end up on someone&#x27;s plate somewhere else in the world after they become injured, old, or their owners simply cannot care for them anymore.

                              <span>Underneath the calm turquoise waters off eastern Thailand, a rapidly spreading disease is killing corals over vast stretches of the sea floor, and scientists fear it may be getting worse because of climate change.
Yellow-band disease -- named for the colour it turns corals before destroying them -- was first spotted decades ago and has caused widespread damage to reefs in the Caribbean. There is no known cure.
But it was detected for the first time off Thailand&#x27;s eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.
&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything like this before,&quot; said marine scientist Lalita Putchim, of Thailand&#x27;s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources.

&quot;I can confirm that in the last few hours there has been a deterioration due to advancing age. The situation at the moment remains under control, monitored continually by doctors,&quot; spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.
This came after Pope Francis said in a surprise announcement in Italian at the end of his weekly general audience: &quot;I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church.&quot;

In early 2022, he joined thousands of Cubans whose migration has amounted to the largest exodus in the Caribbean nation&#x27;s history.
Gonzalez, a 34-year-old barber, said he could no longer bear the hardships of a country going through its worst economic crisis since the 1990s, or the communist regime he had never embraced.
In Cuba, &quot;you lose hope,&quot; he told AFP from Miami, Florida, which he reached after a weeks-long odyssey across multiple countries.
That hopelessness, shared by many young people in Cuba, has pushed emigration to the United States to the highest levels on record.

After two years in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, many had hoped 2022 would herald a brighter future. Those hopes were dashed just a few weeks later with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The past 12 months have also been punctuated by record climate disasters, the overturning of federal abortion rights in the United States and the death of Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II.

Instead, 2022 was marked by a new war, record inflation and climate-linked disasters. It was a &quot;polycrisis&quot; year, a term popularized by historian Adam Tooze.
Get ready for more gloom in 2023.
&quot;The number of crises has increased since the start of the century,&quot; said Roel Beetsma, professor of macroeconomics at the University of Amsterdam.
&quot;Since World War Two we have never seen such a complicated situation,&quot; he told AFP.
After the Covid-induced economic crisis of 2020, consumer prices began to rise in 2021 as countries emerged from lockdowns and other restrictions.
Central bankers insisted that high inflation would only be temporary as economies returned to normal. But Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine …</span>

                              <span>Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#x27;s inauguration will be secured by &quot;100 percent&quot; of the capital district&#x27;s police force, an official said Tuesday amid widespread fears of violence.
Over the weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly placing explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia&#x27;s airport, hoping to sow &quot;chaos&quot; ahead of the inauguration Sunday.
The suspect was a supporter of Brazil&#x27;s outgoing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and told authorities he wanted to &quot;prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil&quot; under leftist Lula.
The device did not explode.
On Sunday &quot;there will be a mobilization of 100 percent of the police forces of the Federal District (of Brasilia) to ensure the safety not only of the president, but also of foreign delegations and the public,&quot; Lula&#x27;s future security minister Flavio Dino told reporters.
Lula backers have expressed fear on social media of riots or attacks on inauguration day, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend events in Brasilia.
But Dino sought to give assurances the event will be &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;peaceful,&quot; encouraging Brazilians to turn out to celebrate.
He added there had been &quot;no change&quot; to plans for the ceremony, in response to speculation that Lula might do his inauguration parade in a closed car instead of the traditional vintage convertible.
After Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9 percent of the vote in a runoff election in October, supporters of the vanquished president blocked roads and demonstrated outside military barracks demanding the armed forces prevent Lula&#x27;s inauguration.
On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators clashed with the police and set fire to buses and cars in Brasilia.
&quot;Small terrorist and extremist groups will not put the institutions of Brazilian democracy up against a wall,&quot; said Dino.
Bolsonaro, who has limited his public appearances after the defeat, has not confirmed that he will follow the tradition of handing over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday&#x27;s ceremony.

Co-founded by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) cyber chief Yaron Rosen, Toka &quot;sells technologies that allow clients to locate security cameras or even webcams within a given perimeter, hack into them, watch their live feed, and even alter it—and past recordings,&quot; Haaretzreported, citing internal documents it obtained and reviewed with a technical expert.

Russia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe 
Early in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion. But Russia meets a tougher resistance than expected. And after a failed attempt to take the capital Kyiv, the Russian …</span>

                              <span>Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. 
A friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov&#x27;s death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov&#x27;s friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have &quot;consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.&quot;
Antov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. 
From the BBC: &quot;Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov&#x27;s account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: &#x27;It&#x27;s extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.&#x27; The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a &#x27;patriot of my country&#x27; and backed the war.&quot;

&quot;Every war ends in a diplomatic way,&quot; Kuleba said in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&quot;
Kuleba suggested the summit could be mediated by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, a vocal advocate of diplomatic talks to end an invasion that has killed thousands of civilians, devastated Ukraine&#x27;s infrastructure, and sparked a massive humanitarian crisis.

More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago -- they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 -- before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding program, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as &quot;vulnerable&quot;, with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild -- with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand&#x27;s wild wetlands.
But since 2011, more than 150 captivity-bred birds …</span>

Ron DeSantis
Will Donald Trump&#x27;s former apprentice, popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis, turn on his one-time mentor by challenging him for the Republican nomination for president?
Trump is already gearing up for a potential battle with his MAGA (Make America Great Again) disciple, whose stock has soared among Republicans.
DeSantis won a landslide re-election in November&#x27;s midterms, in which Trump loyalists fared badly. The property mogul has coined a nickname for the self-styled anti-woke warrior: &quot;Ron de Sanctimonious&quot;.

                              <span>For thousands of years, predictions of apocalypse have borne little fruit. But with dangers rising from nuclear war and climate change, does the planet need to at least begin contemplating the worst?
When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia&#x27;s threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine.
&quot;We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis&quot; in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.
And on the year that humanity welcomed its eighth billion member, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the planet was on a &quot;highway to climate hell.&quot;

For the last 18 months, researchers from the French firm Urgo have been working towards achieving this Holy Grail of wound treatment, which would save serious burn victims from the painful and repeated skin grafts they currently endure.
The 100-million-euro ($106,000-million) &quot;Genesis&quot; project hopes to have a product ready by 2030.
Guirec Le Lous, the president of Urgo&#x27;s medical arm, told AFP that it is a &quot;crazy&quot; project.
&quot;Are we capable of designing artificial skin in a laboratory? No one in the world has succeeded,&quot; he said.

India provided about $4 billion in rapid assistance between January and July, including credit lines, a currency swap arrangement and deferred import payments, and sent a warship carrying essential drugs for the island&#x27;s 22 million people.

Writing before the mid-term election, New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg explained that hundreds of documents he&#x27;s sifted through, in addition to former Robert Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann&#x27;s details, revealed enough to show what Putin was after when he worked to swing the 2016 election for Trump. 
&quot;What Weissman found was all along Paul Manafort and others were avoiding talking about the meeting at the cigar bar I just mentioned or the idea of the Mariupol plan, and it was concealed from them, they felt whe…</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Monday that the company is now close to having 100 active Starlinks, the firm&#x27;s satellite internet service, in Iran, three months after he tweeted he would activate the service there amid protests around the Islamic country.
Musk said, &quot;approaching 100 starlinks active in Iran&quot;, in a tweet on Monday.
The billionaire had said in September that he would activate Starlink in Iran as part of a U.S.-backed effort &quot;to advance internet freedom and the free flow of information&quot; to Iranians.
The satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the government&#x27;s restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms amid protests around the country.
The Islamic Republic has been engulfed in protests that erupted after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for wearing &quot;unsuitable attire&quot;.

                              <span>Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.
Following his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.
&quot;The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset,&quot; parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.
Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel&#x27;s history.
While the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu&#x27;s right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Both live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.
Netanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.
However, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.
His incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.

                              <span>BEIJING (Reuters) -China will stop requiring inbound travellers to go into quarantine starting from Jan. 8, the National Health Commission said on Monday in a major step towards easing curbs on its borders, which have been largely shut since 2020.
China&#x27;s management of COVID-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.
Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China&#x27;s economy, fuelling last month the mainland&#x27;s biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
But China made an abrupt policy U-turn this month,…</span>
