                              <span>Donald Trump is taking advantage of the “weakness” in his opposing field, says UC Irvine Professor of Political Science Louis Desipio.

His comments come as the former US president campaigns for the 2024 presidential election.

“He’s not even campaigning very hard at this point which is a pretty dramatic statement,” Professor Desipio told Sky News Australia.

“There will be another Republican presidential debate coming up and that will give an opportunity for somebody to lead the pack.

“I don’t have high hopes that any of them will be able to do that much better than they did in the first presidential debate.”</span>

                              <span>The deadlock between the House Republicans is representative of the “failure” of the US government, says UC Irvine Professor of Political Science Louis Desipio.

His comments come amid fears a government shutdown is looming.

“Usually these shutdown controversies are when one party has one view and another party has another view,” Professor Desipio told Sky News Australia.

He said this time it is because a small far-right group within the Republican party are rejecting anything their leader Kevin McCarthy proposes.

“I think in the short term at least, it bodes pretty ill for the likelihood that the United States government will be open a week from Monday. “</span>

                              <span>Poland has announced that it has halted weapons supplies to Ukraine, citing the need to arm itself with more modern weapons. The move comes amid a brewing dispute between the two countries over Poland&#x27;s ban on grain imports from Ukraine.

“The Team Room” follows a fictional Special Forces ODA that deploys in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
 Green Beret veteran-turned-writer Bill Raskin has his first play premiering in Washington, DC, October 7-28 at The Keegan Theatre! “The Team Room” follows a fictional Special Forces ODA that deploys in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The production is running on a non-profit basis, and net proceeds will go the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. This non-profit mission has benefitted greatly from other SOF and SOF family leaders, including MG(Ret) Jim Linder and a cohort of retired SF NCOs who have mentored and advised our team of actors. Learn more and purchase tickets at the website below! Bill also welcomes any direct questions or outreach at chair@teamroomfoundation.org https://teamroomfoundation.org

                              <span>BBC News: How Norway outstrips US on Ukraine spending 
The United States has poured more than a hundred billion dollars into Ukraine&#x27;s effort to repel Russia&#x27;s invasion, spending far more than any other nation. 
But as President Volodymyr Zelensky comes to Washington to ask for more, there is growing Republican scepticism about funding the war effort. 
 In his Tuesday speech to the UN, Joe Biden made a passionate plea for the global community to not turn its back on Ukraine. 
&quot;Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence,&quot; he said.
&quot;But I ask you this: If we abandon the core principles of the United States to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they&#x27;re protected?&quot;

WNU Editor: The Ukraine sources that I trust are telling me that over half of this aid is now being lost due to corruption. It is almost as if everyone has come to the same realization that aid from the West is not going to be forthcoming as it has been in the past, and now is the best time to grab what you can before the spigot is turned off. 
I can speak personally on how rotten this corruption is. I am part of a group that helps to send needed drugs and medicines to Ukraine. Specifically it goes to my father&#x27;s home town that is south of Kyiv. We always had some losses, but our last three shipments of vital supplies just disappeared.</span>

NYPost: Confused Biden walks into flag, then appears to anger Brazilian prez with handshake snub at UN 
President Biden looked confused again Wednesday as he walked into a giant flag at the United Nations — then appeared to anger Brazil’s president by walking off stage without shaking his hand. 
The gaffe-prone oldest US president in history walked into the 7-foot-tall Brazilian flag as he took the stage, taking a moment to get his bearings as the flag wobbled. 
 He then struggled with the headset of his translation device, soon noted by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was with him for a joint speech agreeing to partner on workers’ rights.

Poland said Wednesday it will stop providing weapons to Ukraine amid a growing dispute between the two countries over a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports.
“We no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on social media. 
Poland has long been one of Ukraine’s staunchest backers since Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor, alongside multiple former Eastern bloc nations who fear they could be next if Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war is successful.

WNU Editor: A recent poll in Poland revealed widespread opposition to continue supporting Ukraine with weapons (approximately 75% against), and Polish parliamentary elections are coming up (October 15). So politics is at play right now.

Zero Hedge: Ukraine Will Not Get ATACMS Long-Range Missiles &#x27;Anytime Soon&#x27;: Fox 
Currently, with Zelensky in New York and soon to arrive Washington, the big question remains whether the Biden administration will grant him something that has long topped Ukraine&#x27;s wish list: the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS. 
Fox News Pentagon correspondent Lucas Tomlinson says it&#x27;s looking like the White House is set against it, for now at least. His sources told him the following: 

    
Ukraine will not get ATACMS, the 190-mile-range tactical ballistic missiles, urgently requested by Zelensky to destroy Russian forces in Crimea and other Russian-held territory ‘anytime soon,’ officials say. News comes one day before Zelensky visits Biden at the White House.

India has suspended visa applications by Canadian nationals, according to a third-party processor used by the Indian government, a sharp escalation in the diplomatic conflict that has followed Canada’s claim that Indian agents were behind an assassination in June on Canadian soil. 
The processing company, BLS International, issued the notice on Thursday. Contacted by The New York Times, a spokesman for India’s foreign ministry said he could not confirm that visa processing had been halted. A ministry news briefing was scheduled for Thursday afternoon.

PARIS — France and Germany remain committed to jointly developing a next-generation tank in the framework of the Main Ground Combat System project, French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told newspaper Le Monde in a joint interview. 
A separate project by German, Spanish and Italian defense companies to develop a modern battle tank is an industry initiative, and not an alternative to the MGCS, Pistorius said. France and Germany are meeting regularly and are “determined” to continue their joint project to create one of the most modern armored systems in the world, he told Le Monde.

Breaking Defense: Israel unveils new ‘5th generation’, ‘lightning’ version of Merkava tank 
The upgrades are focused not on the tank&#x27;s physical structure, but on incorporating the latest tech and systems. 
JERUSALEM — Israel this week unveiled the latest iteration of its Merkava family of tanks, what the Israeli Defense Force calls the ‘Lightning’ version of the Merkava IV. 
The advanced tank has been under development and undergoing trials over the last half decade. In a joint statement from Israel’s Ministry of Defense and the IDF, it was presented as a key to the future of the IDF, incorporating the latest sensors, artificial intelligence, networking and active protection system — technological, rather than structural advancements.

Moscow Times: Moscow’s Last European Neighbor to Ban Russian Cars 
Norway will be the last European nation that borders Russia to ban Russian-registered vehicles amid an uproar over an EU directive on import restrictions. 
Over the past week, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland have implemented bans on passenger vehicles with Russian license plates. 
“Norway will introduce restrictions on importing and using Russian-registered cars in Norway,” Eivind Vad Petersson, Norway’s Foreign Ministry state secretary, said Tuesday.

                              <span>Libertarian Institute: Rising Ammunition Prices Could Interfere with Western Plans to Arm Ukraine 
A top NATO official warned that rising ammunition prices could mean that Western countries do not spend enough on the military to sufficiently arm Ukraine. Washington and its allies have pledged nearly $100 billion in weapons to Kiev since the Russian invasion last year. 
On Saturday, the chair of NATO’s military committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer said alliance members need to spend more on defense to account for the rising prices. “Prices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up. Right now, we are paying more and more for exactly the same,” he said. “That means that we cannot make sure that the increased defense spending actually leads to more security.”

WNU Editor: The New York Times reported on the increasing cost of Western ammunition last week .... Russia Overcomes Sanctions to Expand Missile Production, Officials Say (September 13, 2023). The key line .... 
 .... it costs a Western country $5,000 to $6,000 to make a 155-millimeter artillery round, whereas it costs Russia about $600 to produce a comparable 152-millimeter artillery shell.  
Since that NYT publication a number of military blogs and main stream news stories have been reporting on the high cost of armaments, including the above post from the Libertarian Institute. No one is saying &quot;war profiting&quot;, but this is &quot;war profiting&quot;. 

One final note. As I said last week. You cannot win a war if the economies and cost of production favors your opponent.</span>

She had gotten divorced the year before and left the house in a small town in Holguín, in eastern Cuba, where she had lived with René Ferias, her husband of 22 years. 
A few days later, at dawn on Jan. 26, Ferias attacked her with a machete and killed her. “Imagine seeing your daughter hacked to pieces by a nasty man, who had not even been her husband for over a year, because he found out that she had another relationship,” said her mother, Nancy Alberteris.</span>

The paint spread to the Pariser Platz, the square at the foot of the monument, with bright footprints extending along the roadway.
Fourteen people were arrested at the site, police told AFP, without any indication of acts of violence.
The demonstrators wanted to send the message that it is &quot;time for political change&quot; in order to &quot;move away from fossil fuels&quot;, according to the statement.
&quot;We must get out of petrol, gas and coal no later than 2030. It is high time that (German Chancellor) Olaf Scholz speaks clearly,&quot; Last Generation spokesperson Marion Fabian said in the statement.
Germany wants to reach net zero targets by 2045.

To the sound of military bands and under a sunny sky, the 77-year-old monarch, clad in a sober suit and tie, enjoyed the public acclaim along with Queen Silvia, 79, wearing a canary yellow ensemble, as six horses led the royal procession.
The crowd broke into applause as they passed and waved Swedish flags to mark the milestone for Carl Gustaf, who was the world&#x27;s youngest monarch when he was crowned aged 27 in September 1973 after the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf.
The king is the longest reigning monarch in Sweden&#x27;s history and also the European monarch with the second-longest reign, behind his cousin Queen Margrethe of Denmark who took the throne…</span>

Lacking lakes, rivers and regular rainfall, Saudi Arabia today relies instead on dozens of facilities that transform water from the Gulf and Red Sea into something potable, supplying cities and towns that otherwise would not survive.

                              <span>Thousands of migrants on vessels from the North African coast landed on Italy&#x27;s southernmost island this week, sparking a crisis that has rekindled debate over the division of responsibility among the EU nations.
At a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a visit to the island, Giorgia Meloni said the bloc needed to work together to face the challenges of uncontrolled migration. 
It is &quot;the future that Europe wants for itself that is at stake here, because the future of Europe depends on Europe&#x27;s capacity to face major challenges,&quot; Meloni said.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump included the island nation on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and though the Biden administration has reversed other Trump-era measures, it has so far not removed Cuba from the list. &quot;Cuba has been an advocate of fairer global governance.

Kevin McCarthy recently announced an impeachment inquiry into Biden, which was cheered by right-wingers who sought to score political points or churn up more evidence. Some on the Republican side have cautioned away from jumping into the impeachment, seeking to prevent going into a political process without evidence of any presidential wrongdoing. 
Atlantic staff writer David A. Graham pointed out how similar this process is to the Benghazi scandal that helped to tank Hillary Clinton&#x27;s poll numbers.

                              <span>Comedian and YouTube personality Russell Brand is pushing back at new accusations that he sexually assaulted three women and a teenager according to the BBC.
The sexual assault report was &quot;part of a joint investigation by the Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches,&quot; with the BBC reporting, &quot;Four women are alleging sexual assaults between 2006 and 2013 ... At the time of the alleged assaults, Brand was a presenter for BBC Radio 2, Channel 4, and an actor in Hollywood films. Other claims made as part of the investigation include allegations about Brand&#x27;s controlling, abusive and predatory behaviour.&quot;
Late Friday night, Brand took to his social media platforms to defend himself, claiming his liaisons were all &quot;consensual.&quot;
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

The BBC reported that Brand claimed, &quot;Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.&quot;
He continued, &quot;These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I&#x27;ve written about extensively in my books I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual.&quot;
ALSO IN THE NEWS: &#x27;He’s probably guilty, but it doesn’t matter&#x27;: Trump fans aren&#x27;t scared off by 4 criminal indictments

The report adds Brand added he believes he&#x27;s the victim of as a &quot;co-ordinated attack&quot; and will be looking into the &quot;very, very serious&quot; allegations.

                              <span>Iranians at home and abroad marked the first anniversary Saturday of the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, with activists speaking of a renewed crackdown to prevent any resurgence of the protests which rocked the country last year.
Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, died a few days after her arrest by religious police for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women in force since shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Her family says she died from a blow to the head but this is disputed by Iranian authorities.
Anger over her death rapidly expanded into weeks of taboo-breaking protests which saw women tearing off their mandatory headscarves in an open challenge to the Islamic republic&#x27;s system of government under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

                              <span>A Belgian court on Friday handed out sentences ranging up to life in prison to eight men for the 2016 jihadist bombings in Brussels, ending the country&#x27;s largest-ever criminal trial.
The suicide bombings on March 22, 2016 at Brussels&#x27; main airport and on the metro system killed 32 people and were claimed by the Islamic State group.
French citizen Salah Abdeslam and Belgian-Moroccan Mohamed Abrini – already sentenced to life in jail by France for a 2015 massacre in Paris – were the highest-profile of six culprits found guilty of murder in July.
Abrini, who was one of the intended bombers but decided not to blow himself up at the last moment, was given a 30-year jail term.
The court ruled not to give Abdeslam an additional term after he was sentenced in Belgium to 20 years in 2018 over a shootout.
The attacks – near the headquarters of both NATO and the EU – were part of a wave of attacks claimed by the Islamic State group in Europe.
Hundreds of travelers and transport staff were maimed and seven years on, many victims, relatives and rescuers remain traumatized.

                              <span>Mexico on Friday extradited the son of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman to the United States to face narcotics charges, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.
Ovidio Guzman Lopez, also known as &quot;El Raton&quot; or &quot;The Mouse,&quot; was indicted earlier this year on drug trafficking charges linked to the fentanyl crisis plaguing the United States.
His father was convicted in 2019 of running what was believed to be the world&#x27;s biggest narcotics syndicate and is serving life in a supermax prison in the state of Colorado.
Garland hailed the extradition as &quot;the most recent step in the Justice Department&#x27;s effort to attack every aspect of the cartel&#x27;s operations.&quot;

                              <span>President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France&#x27;s envoy to Niger is living like a hostage in the French embassy and accused military rulers of blocking food deliveries to the mission.
The ambassador is living off &quot;military rations&quot;, Macron told reporters in the eastern town of Semur-en-Auxois.
&quot;As we speak, we have an ambassador and diplomatic staff who are literally being held hostage in the French embassy,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are preventing food deliveries,&quot; he said, in an apparent reference to Niger&#x27;s new military rulers. &quot;He is eating military rations.&quot;
Niger&#x27;s military leaders told French ambassador Sylvain Itte he had to leave the country after they overthrew President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
But a 48-hour ultimatum for him to leave, issued in August, passed with him still in place as the French government refused to comply, or to recognise the military regime as legitimate.
The coup has been condemned by France and most of Niger&#x27;s neighbors.
Macron said the envoy &quot;cannot go out, he is persona non grata and he is being refused food&quot;.
Asked whether France would consider bringing him home, Macron said: &quot;I will do whatever we agree with President Bazoum because he is the legitimate authority and I speak with him every day.&quot;
France keeps about 1,500 soldiers in Niger, and said earlier this month that any redeployment could only be negotiated with Bazoum.
The country&#x27;s new leaders have torn up military cooperation agreements with France and asked the troops to leave quickly.
Macron has for weeks rejected the call to remove the French ambassador, a stance backed by the EU which has described the demand as &quot;a provocation&quot;.
Like France, said EU foreign affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali last month, the EU &quot;does not recognize&quot; the authorities that seized power in Niger.
The impoverished Sahel region south of the Sahara, has suffered what Macron has called an &quot;epidemic&quot; of coups in recent years, with military regimes replacing elected governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea as well as Niger.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
