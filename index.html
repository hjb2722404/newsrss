Reports suggest Russian forces withdrew over fears of being encircled by Ukrainian forces.

Ukraine has reportedly re-taken the city a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk.

The city has been a vital logistics and transport hub for Russian troops since it was first taken.</span>

                              <span>Indonesian police said on Sunday that 127 people had died and 180 were injured after a stampede following crowd trouble at a football match in the province of East Java overnight.
After the match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya had ended, supporters from the losing team had invaded the pitch and police had fired tear gas, triggering a stampede and cases of suffocation, East Java police chief Nico Afinta told reporters.
Video footage from local news channels showed people rushing onto the pitch in the stadium in Malang and images of body bags.
The Indonesian top league BRI Liga 1 has suspended games for a week following the match that Persebaya won 3-2 and an investigation had been launched, the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) said.
There have been previous outbreaks of trouble at matches in Indonesia, with a strong rivalry between clubs sometimes leading to violence among supporters.

But many are leaving – homes are in ruins and the town is far from safe. FRANCE 24’s Gwendoline Debono filed this report, which was translated by Gulliver Cragg.</span>

                              <span>As any dog owner will attest, dogs can seem eerily attuned to human behavior. When humans yell or pick a fight, dogs often respond with anger and fear. Similarly, people with a sedentary lifestyle may have seemingly sedentary pets: a 2021 study found a correlation between dog obesity and human obesity.

Now, a new study sheds light on the peculiar ways that dogs seem to be able to pick up on human vibes. Specifically, researchers found that when you are stressed, your body produces a distinct odor — and our canine friends can smell it.
This likely is not a surprise for dog owners. Scientists have already demonstrated that dogs feel love for their owners, lead rich interior lives and can even cry tears of joy. Yet even though scientists know that dogs …</span>

                              <span>A 24-hour walkout by railway staff in Britain on Saturday was set to create severe disruption as strikes resumed following the mourning period for Queen Elizabeth II.
Members of four trade unions kicked off the action after workers halted work stoppages following the death of the queen on September 8.
It is the latest industrial action by rail workers demanding wage increases to keep pace with decades-high inflation amid a cost-of-living crisis.
Tens of thousands of staff in various industries — from the postal and legal systems to ports and telecommunications — have also gone on strike across Britain since the summer.
Workers at Britain&#x27;s largest container port, Felixstowe in eastern England, are currently conducting a second eight-day walkout over pay and conditions that is only set to end on Wednesday.
But it is the rail sector that has been spearheading the industrial unrest, carrying out its biggest stoppages in decades.
The latest had been planned for the week after the queen&#x27;s death, but was then postponed. Many rail workers are also set to strike again on Wednesday, and on other potential dates later in the month.
This weekend&#x27;s walkout coincides with preparations for Sunday&#x27;s London Marathon, leaving participants struggling to reach the capital, as well as the ruling Conservatives&#x27; annual conference in Birmingham also starting Sunday.
Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, apologized to people impacted but blamed the government.
&quot;The government has brought this dispute on,&quot; he told the BBC, as he joined other striking staff on picket lines across the country.
&quot;They (put) the challenges down to us, to cut our jobs, to cut our pensions and to cut our wages against inflation.&quot;
But Tim Shoveller of Network Rail, which owns and manages Britain&#x27;s railway infrastructure, described the strikes as a &quot;huge own goal&quot; leading to &quot;less money to spend improving the railway&quot;.

The European Commission on Thursday took Malta to the European Union&#x27;s highest court over its &quot;golden passport&quot; scheme that allows wealthy investors to buy Maltese – and therefore EU – citizenship, without having to live in the country. 
Despite repeated calls to end the scheme, Malta has raised €1.1 billion since 2013 through offering passports in exchange for investments, with most investors coming from the Gulf, Asia and Russia. 
Under pressure from the EU, Cyprus and Bulgaria have recently stopped offering similar schemes. Yet the only conces…</span>

                              <span>Russia was even more diplomatically isolated Saturday after President Vladimir Putin annexed four Moscow-held areas of Ukraine with Kyiv condemning the move and vowing to retake the territories.
Putin staged a grand ceremony in the Kremlin on Friday to celebrate the annexation, hours after shelling killed 30 people in Ukraine&#x27;s southern region of Zaporizhzhia.
&quot;I want to say this to the Kyiv regime and its masters in the West: People living in Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens forever,&quot; Putin said.
Washington announced &quot;severe&quot; new sanctions against Russian officials and the defence industry, and said G7 allies support imposing &quot;costs&quot; on any nation that backs the annexation.

&quot;Is it time to declare a climate emergency yet?&quot; NASA climate scientist Peter Kalmus—among the outspoken experts demanding more action from the U.S. government—tweeted Thursday.
As Jean Su at the Center for Biological Diversity explained earlier this year, &quot;Declaring a climate emergency isn&#x27;t a catchphrase, it&#x27;s a vital suite of actions to protect people and the planet from this crisis.&quot;

                              <span>Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons if Russia&#x27;s &quot;territorial integrity&quot; or existence is threatened.


		Should such an escalation materialize, it would probably be in the form of a smaller tactical nuclear weapon, likely launched on a short-range Iskander ballistic missile, according to experts.


Where are the bombs?


		A 2017 report by the institute maps out 47 nuclear storage sites across Russia -- 12 national-level facilities and 35 base facilities.


		They can even be watched closely by commercial satellites, as shown by the widespread, regularly updated imagery of activities at North Korean nuclear facilities.


		But its non-strategic or tactical nuclear weapons, which number as many as 2,000, are stored and not installed on delivery vehicles like the Iskander, according to Podvig.


How would we know?


		&quot;The weapons need to come out of storage, the units involved need to be alerted, and the Russians might also alert their strategic nuclear forces,&quot; Cancian, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told AFP.


		&quot;All of this would be visible,&quot; he noted.


		&quot;We can be quite certain that there are no hidden facilities,&quot; he said.


		&quot;Technically you could probably smuggle a couple of bombs out of a storage sight undetected,&quot; he said.


		&quot;The Russians will never be certain that it is undetected. That would be a gamble,&quot; said Podvig.


		&quot;It would be the kind of escalatory step (and) Russia would want that to be visible,&quot; Podvig said.

Warning the world

		The United States warned for weeks before the February 24 invasion that Russia intended to attack Ukraine, seeking to prepare Kyiv and allies -- and possibly deter Moscow from acting.


		Such alarm could go global if people expected an escalation to transcontinental nuclear war.


		But Washington would likely see issuing public warnings as useful in adding to pressure on Russia, according to Podvig.


		&quot;That message might have deterrence value.&quot;</span>

Kremlin officials are warning these regions will be protected by all of Russia&#x27;s military might, including its nuclear arsenal. 

“People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have become our citizens forever,” Mr Putin said.</span>

                              <span>Former Howard government minister Peter McGauran says Russian President Vladimir Putin has “lost the war”. 

“He now has to try to reclaim it somehow or find an exit ramp of which he’s showing no interest in,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“So, it is a very uncertain period.

“It is a very unpredictable and dangerous period we’re moving into, but militarily, he’s in deep trouble.”</span>

                              <span>The United Nations and Western leaders have condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin after the annexation of four Ukrainian regions. 

Mr Putin hosted a ceremony to formally annex the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya on Friday local time. 

The move has been labelled the most serious escalation of conflict since the war began in February. 

“This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. NATO alliance do not and will not recognise any of this territory as part of Russia,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. 

“We call on all states to reject Russia&#x27;s blatant attempts at territorial conquest.” 

The United States has imposed more sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation, which targets hundreds of individuals, lawmakers and companies.</span>

&quot;Putin’s rant was meant to make the world quail in fear,&quot; wrote Nichols. &quot;In reality, Putin is likely more terrified than anyone right now: He’s a Russian dictator losing a war of aggression, and he knows how that could end for him. In his speech, he justified the war in Ukraine using everything from the boundaries of ancient Russia to what he sees as the illegitimate dissolution of the Soviet Union.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday presided over a ceremony to annex four Ukrainian regions partly occupied by his forces, escalating his seven-month war and taking it into an unpredictable new phase.
&quot;This is the will of millions of people,&quot; he said in a speech before hundreds of dignitaries in the St George&#x27;s Hall of the Kremlin.
The ceremony took place three days after the completion of hastily staged so-called referendums in which Moscow&#x27;s proxies in the occupied regions claimed majorities of up to 99% in favour of joining Russia.
Ukraine and Western governments said the votes, announced only 10 days ago, had been conducted at gunpoint and were bogus and illegitimate.

LGBTQ demonstrators waved rainbow flags, donned shirts, skirts, scarves, wigs, masks, dyed their hair purple, pink, green, gold and blue. Just a few days after Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Putin mobilized 300,000 more soldiers against Ukraine, the Metro Pride parade blossomed in war-battered Kharkiv.

                              <span>Russia is seeing a wave of demonstrations in areas with high ethnic minority populations against President Vladimir Putin’s call for “partial mobilization”. Analysts say this approach is undermining the Kremlin’s legitimacy among these groups and is likely to give Russia poorly motivated soldiers for its war against Ukraine.
In Russia’s Caucasian Dagestan region near the Georgian border, protesters managed to block traffic on September 25. More than 7,000 kilometers away, in the Buryatia region just north of the Mongolian border, a group called the Free Buryatia Foundation has been set up to help reservists avoid the “partial mobilization” Putin announced after Ukraine’s lightning gains in the east.

                              <span>A protest movement in Iran over the death in custody of Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini entered its third week Friday, in defiance of an intensifying crackdown that rights activists say has cost at least 83 lives.
The women-led protests erupted after Amini, 22, died three days after her arrest by the notorious morality police in Tehran for allegedly breaching the Islamic republic&#x27;s strict dress code for women.
&quot;Women, Life, Freedom!&quot; protesters chanted on Thursday night in Sanandaj, the capital of Amini&#x27;s home province of Kurdistan in northwest Iran, before the crackle of gunfire was heard, in a video posted on Twitter by the Iran Wire news website.
Crowds were seen &quot;chanting slogans and confronting security forces&quot; in cities across the country, including Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd, said the site …</span>

Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-metalworker who led Brazil through an economic boom from 2003 to 2010, leads in the polls, seeking to stage a stunning comeback four years after being jailed on controversial corruption convictions -- since annulled by the Supreme Court.
Bolsonaro, the pugnacious ex-army captain whose popularity has suffered from the carnage of Covid-19 and a sputtering economy, is gunning for a come-from-behind win and has strongly hinted he would not accept a loss.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden, his administration pledging to help stave off China&#x27;s &quot;economic coercion,&quot; promised Pacific island leaders on Thursday to work harder with allies and partners to address their needs.
After a two-day Washington summit, the United States and leaders and representatives from 14 Pacific island states issued a joint declaration resolving to strengthen their partnership and saying that they shared a vision for a region where &quot;democracy will be able to flourish.&quot;
Those endorsing the document included the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, whose government had earlier indicated it would not sign the declaration, heightening concerns about his ties to China.

Her death has sparked the first big show of opposition on Iran&#x27;s streets since authorities crushed protests against a rise in gasoline prices in 2019.

“These are all just gestures made out of weakness because he’s losing on the ground.”
 On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally declared four regions of Ukraine as part of Russia following sham referendums this week in eastern and southern Ukraine. Putin made the illegal decree as he lobbed even more threats against the United States and its allies, another pot…</span>

I also have no information on what will be said. 
My friend thinks it will be an acceptance of Ukraine&#x27;s application to quickly join NATO. 
I doubt it. 
But if it happens a joint statement from the heads of NATO and the UN on a Friday evening is unprecedented. And if it is support of Ukraine&#x27;s fast track application to join NATO, war tensions are going to escalate.

I am about to give a presentation to a business group on the current geopolitical situation in the world, and what I see trending in 2023. I will not be in front of a computer until later this evening. 
If this joint statement does come out later today, I will (of course) post and analyze it. If this is all a false alarm. I will be relieved, and will sleep easier tonight.</span>

KYIV (Reuters) -President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced a surprise bid for fast-track membership of the NATO military alliance on Friday and ruled out talks with President Vladimir Putin, striking back at Moscow after it said it had annexed four Ukrainian regions. 
Zelenskiy signed the NATO application papers in an online video clearly intended as a forceful rebuttal to the Kremlin after Putin held a ceremony in Moscow to proclaim the four partially occupied regions as annexed Russian land. 
&quot;We are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine&#x27;s application for accelerated accession to NATO,&quot; Zelenskiy said in the video on the Telegram app.

Reuters: Ukraine calls emergency meeting of security chiefs 
KYIV, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will hold an emergency top-level meeting on Friday where &quot;fundamental decisions&quot; will be taken in the wake of Russian plans to annex four Ukrainian regions, an official said on Thursday. 
The Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin will sign documents on Friday proclaiming Moscow&#x27;s annexation of regions where Russia organised what Kyiv and the West said were sham referendums staged on Russian-held Ukrainian territory.

WNU Editor: With the Kremlin announcing the annexation of four regions later today and with 300,000 Russian soldiers being called-up to be deployed to Ukraine in the next few months, the war is now entering a very different phase, and Zelensky knows it.</span>

                              <span>NTD/Epoch Times: Morgan Stanley Warns of Something Worse Than a ‘Normal Recession’ 
Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson said that he’s convinced a corporate earnings recession is coming—and that it could be worse than a “normal” recession. 
Wilson said in a Sept. 26 interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that his team at Morgan Stanley is looking closely at the U.S. business earnings story and the impact of corporate profits on equities, which have been on a wild ride in recent months. 
“We think it’s unavoidable … to avoid an earnings recession and that’s what matters for stocks,” Wilson said, with his remarks coming on the same day that the so-called Wall Street fear gauge soared to its highest level since mid-June when U.S. equities last hit a bear market bottom.

Reuters: Hungary cannot support any new EU energy sanctions against Russia - govt 
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary cannot support the European Union&#x27;s planned eighth round of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine if those contain energy sanctions, Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x27;s chief of staff said on Thursday. 
The EU executive proposed on Wednesday fresh sanctions against Russia, including tighter trade restrictions, more individual blacklistings and an oil price cap for third countries. 
The proposed sanctions fall short of harder-hitting measures, including a ban on importing Russian diamonds, sought by Russia hawks Poland and the three Baltic countries.

The US urged energy infrastructure operators, including LNG carriers heading for Europe, to be on high alert after suspected sabotage hit gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany.
“Everybody should be on high alert,” US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Wednesday in Vienna. She called for an “expedited investigation” into who bears responsibility for three blasts that targeted the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines off the German coast. 
The Biden administration’s top energy official spoke in an interview at the International Atomic Energy Agency, where the US has this week been warning about Russia’s stranglehold on nuclear fuel markets. Germany’s Interior Ministry issued a general security threat on Wednesday after ruling out natural causes for the blasts on the Baltic Sea pipelines.

WNU Editor: I will not be surprised that besides the U.S. and northern Europe a number of other countries around the world are now increasing their security on critical infrastructure. The Nord Stream pipeline attacks have clearly shaken most governments, and I shudder on what would be the reaction if another attack that is equivalent to the Nord Stream attack should happen again somewhere in the world.</span>

Politico:  Calls grow for China and India to talk sense into Putin 
“They could let Mr. Putin know what a disastrously bad idea any use of nuclear weapons would be,” one U.S. official said. 
The U.S. and its allies are hoping to rally the international community to send an unmistakable message to Vladimir Putin: Using nuclear weapons would prompt a crippling economic and diplomatic response, even from Russia’s friends. 
 In particular, calls are growing inside and outside the Biden administration to enlist China and India, two major powers with close ties to Moscow, to amp up the pressure on Putin by signaling that even a limited nuclear strike in Ukraine would sever what few global lifelines Russia has left.

China has opened dozens of &quot;overseas police service stations&quot; around the globe to monitor its citizens living abroad, including one location in New York City and three in Toronto. 
&quot;These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate the international rule of law, and may violate the territorial integrity in third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods,&quot; reads a report by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights watchdog, released earlier this month. 
The report, titled &quot;110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,&quot; details China&#x27;s extensive efforts to combat &quot;fraud&quot; by its citizens living overseas, in part by opening several police stations on five continents that have assisted Chinese authorities in &quot;carrying out policing operations on foreign soil.&quot;

The $13 billion lead ship of a new class of advanced US Navy aircraft carriers is about to finally set sail on its first deployment after years of costly setbacks and delays that have at times made it the target of fierce criticism. 
The first-in-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which was commissioned over five years ago and has been over a decade in the making, will deploy for the first time next week on a short, service-retained deployment, Vice Adm. Daniel Dwyer, US 2nd Fleet commander, told reporters.

Norway and Denmark will increase security and surveillance around their energy infrastructure sites after the alleged sabotage of Russia&#x27;s Nord Stream gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. 
Major leaks struck two underwater natural gas pipelines running from Russia to Germany, with experts reporting that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea beforehand. 
Norway -- an oil-rich nation and Europe&#x27;s biggest supplier of gas -- will strengthen security at its land and offshore installations, the country&#x27;s energy minister said.

* The move could stem the yuan&#x27;s fall, as it remains on track for its largest annual loss against the dollar since 1994. 
* A hawkish Fed has pushed the dollar to 20-year highs this year, pressuring currencies around the world. 
The People&#x27;s Bank of China has told major state-run banks to prepare to shed dollar holdings while snapping up offshore yuan, which has continued to fall despite prior interventions, sources told Reuters. 
The scale of this latest effort to prop up the yuan will be big and could provide a floor to the Chinese currency, according to the report. 
The amount of dollars to be sold hasn&#x27;t been decided yet, but Reuters said it will primarily involve the state banks&#x27; currency reserves. Their offshore branches, including those based in Hong Kong, New York and London, were ordered to review offshore yuan holdings and check to see that dollar reserves are ready.

WNU Editor: IMHO there are three reasons why China will start to dump the US dollar. (1) The first is to prop up the yuan. (2) The second is to not possess US dollar reserves. China saw how the U.S. seized Russia&#x27;s foreign currency holdings, and Beijing does not want to be positioned to have the same thing happen to them. (3) The third reason is that many in China believe the U.S. economy is on the road to a slow collapse, and what better way to bail-out is when the US dollar is as high as high as it is right now .... Is the US economy about to tank? (Gregory K. Tanaka, China Daily).</span>

                              <span>Reuters: OPEC+ has begun talks on output cut at Oct. 5 meeting - OPEC source 
DUBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Leading OPEC+ members have begun discussions about an oil output cut at the group&#x27;s next meeting on Oct. 5, three sources told Reuters. 
 One OPEC source told Reuters a cut was &quot;likely&quot;, while two other OPEC+ sources said key members had spoken about the topic. 
A source familiar with Russian thinking told Reuters earlier this week that Moscow could suggest a cut of up to 1 million barrels per day (bpd).  The latest comments suggest that key OPEC members have started communicating over the matter, although the volume of any potential cut is still unclear. 
Next week&#x27;s meeting takes place against a backdrop of falling oil prices from multi-year highs hit in March, and severe market volatility.

WNU Editor: My gut tells me that there will be a push at this OPEC+ meeting to cut production that will deliberately and significantly raise oil and gas prices to impact the US midterm elections, while bleeding the US strategic oil reserves at the same time.

Reuters: EXCLUSIVE Afghan Taliban sign deal for Russian oil products, gas and wheat 
KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban have signed a provisional deal with Russia to supply gasoline, diesel, gas and wheat to Afghanistan, Acting Afghan Commerce and Industry Minister Haji Nooruddin Azizi told Reuters. 
Azizi said his ministry was working to diversify its trading partners and that Russia had offered the Taliban administration a discount to average global commodity prices. 
The move, the first known major international economic deal struck by the Taliban since they returned to power more than a year ago, could help to ease the Islamist movement&#x27;s isolation that has effectively cut it off from the global banking system.

&quot;Any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response,” the military alliance said after the Nord Stream explosions. 
LONDON — NATO on Thursday left the door open to possible military action in response to what it said was deliberate sabotage after explosions on underwater natural gas pipelines between Russia and Europe. 
“All currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,” it said in a statement. 
Western governments have pointed the finger of blame for the leaks at Russia, which has flatly denied any suggestion it was responsible for explosions that caused them.

Brazil’s upcoming presidential election has been shrouded by an unprecedented climate of tension and violence. 
As the Oct. 2 vote approaches, episodes of harassment and attacks have intensified, with even neutral players like poll institutes turning into targets. 
Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who aims to be reelected, is currently lagging in the main polls behind leftwing former President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva. 
And the battle between these two very different household names has divided the nation – with experts saying the level of political anger is different this year.

Reuters: Weary Bulgarians Fear More Political Turmoil After Latest Election 
DAVIDKOVO, Bulgaria (Reuters) - Bulgarians bracing for their fourth election in less than two years face a winter of want amid soaring inflation driven by the war in Ukraine, making many yearn for good government and stability after years of political turmoil. 
At stake is the next government&#x27;s ability to tackle rocketing energy costs and secure gas supplies at affordable prices after Russia&#x27;s cutoff in April over Bulgaria&#x27;s refusal to pay in roubles following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 
But fractious coalition-building is expected to drag out after the Oct. 2 vote amid deep rifts within the political elite over how to root out entrenched corruption, and the failure of a smattering of new parties to build a sustainable voter base.

WNU Editor: This is the fourth election in two years, and there are 28 political parties on the ballot. And while more than half are defending or actively promoting the Kremlin’s positions, the expectation is that there will be no clear winner when the results are finalized.

VP Harris visited the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to show America&#x27;s &#x27;rock-solid commitment&#x27; to South Korea&#x27;s security  Vice President Kamala Harris made an unfortunate gaffe during her speech at the Korean Peninsula&#x27;s Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Thursday, saying that the U.S. has a &quot;strong alliance&quot; with &quot;the Republic of North Korea.&quot; 
 &quot;It is an alliance that is strong and enduring,&quot; she added, intending to refer to the Republic of Korea, which is South Korea&#x27;s official name. 
The vice president then continued her remarks by professing the U.S.&#x27; support for South Korea&#x27;s defense against the increasingly aggressive North Korean government.

                              <span>CNN: Putin to host ceremony annexing occupied Ukrainian territories on Friday, Kremlin says 
Russia will on Friday begin formally annexing up to 18% of Ukrainian territory, with President Vladimir Putin expected to host a ceremony in the Kremlin to declare four occupied Ukrainian territories part of Russia. 
The ceremony would take place on Friday at 15:00 local time (08:00 ET) in the Kremlin’s St. George’s Hall, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
Putin will deliver a speech and meet with Russian-backed leaders of the four occupied regions on the sidelines of the ceremony, he added.
Next week, Russia’s two houses of parliament – the State Duma and Federation Council – will consider the annexation.

WNU Editor: Russia’s two houses of parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council, will make this into law next week.   After this passage I expect the rules of engagement and deployment of forces to the Ukraine war-zone will be radically changing. For example. This will no longer be classified as a &quot;special operation&quot;. Instead it will be classified as an &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; operation.

                              <span>Just a heads-up. 
Giving a presentation in Toronto tomorrow. It is a rush thing, and I am preparing for it right now. Flying out tonight, and returning Saturday evening. 
I gave a presentation last week to a business group on what to expect geopolitically in the spring of 2023 and beyond. Apparently I freaked-out a lot of people who were there on what I see is trending, especially on the war, and after the Nord Stream pipeline attacks this week they now want me to present it to a larger audience tomorrow.
Needless to say blogging will be light until then, but I have time posted a number of interesting stories for Friday and Saturday that I know will be of interest to the followers of this blog.</span>

Dariali, Georgia CNN  — With one bag in each hand and another on his back, Denis makes his way up a hill on foot, having just crossed the border from Russia into Georgia.  “I’m just tired. That’s the only thing I feel,” the 27-year-old says as he tries to catch his breath. 
Denis has just spent six days on the road, most of them just waiting in line to cross the border. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of Russians enduring a grueling marathon journey to leave their country. 
Though women and children are among those crossing, most are fighting-age men who fear the possibility that they will be drafted to fight the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.

Putin will preside over a treaty-signing on &quot;the entry of new territories into the Russian Federation&quot;, three days after the completion of hastily staged referendums in which Moscow&#x27;s proxies in the occupied regions claimed majorities of up to 99% in favour of joining Russia.

                              <span>New Yorker reporter Susan Glasser revealed to The Bulwark&#x27;s Charlie Sykes this week what she believed to be former President Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;ultimate grift.&quot;
While appearing on Sykes&#x27; podcast, Glasser talked about how Trump lobbied to get himself nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his ultimately unfruitful efforts to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
&quot;Donald Trump bragged and bragged and bragged about his, by the way, nonexistent nuclear deal with Kim Jong-un,&quot; Glasser said. &quot;And he would go to rallies and say, &#x27;Would you believe it, the prime minister of Japan has nominated me for a Nobel Peace Prize!&#x27;&quot;
There was much more to Trump&#x27;s nomination for the prestigious prize than met the eye, however.
IN OTHER NEWS: Experts slam Judge Cannon&#x27;s latest pro-Trump ruling: ‘Hilarious, corrupt, shameless, and obvious’
&quot;Then we learn, in the course of reporting for this book, that, in fact, the reason Shinzo Abe nominated Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize is that Donald Trump had him to a private dinner, just the two of them, at Trump Tower in the fall of 2018 at which he asked Shinzo Abe to nominate him.&quot;
Trump ultimately didn&#x27;t care about winning the prize, said Glasser, as much as being able to brag about having been nominated.
&quot;To me that is the ultimate grift,&quot; she said. &quot;A fake nuclear deal, a fake nomination for the Peace Prize, it&#x27;s got it all.&quot;
Trump ultimately was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
