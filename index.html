CNN: Blinken meets top Chinese diplomat as efforts to ramp down tensions continue 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken “had candid and constructive discussions on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues” with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on Thursday – the latest in a series of increased high-level interactions between Washington and Beijing. 
Their meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Jakarta comes less than a month after the two met in Beijing for what was also described by the US as “candid and constructive” conversation. 
Wang, who is the top foreign policy chief for the Chinese Communist Party, attended the diplomatic gathering in place of China’s Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, who is unable to attend due to health reasons, Reuters reported, citing a spokesman for his ministry.

(Bloomberg) -- Egypt and Ethiopia agreed to start “urgent” talks about finalizing an agreement relating to filling and operating a Nile dam which officials in Cairo argue will sharply curtail the nation’s access to fresh water. 
Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Premier Abiy Ahmed also agreed the nations would work to conclude the agreement within four months, Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency reported Thursday. The agreement would also include Sudan, it said.

Statement comes after US, Australia and New Zealand expressed concerns about new agreement with Beijing 
Solomon Islands has said that its policing pact with China poses no “threat” to the Pacific, rebuking western powers that raised fears the deal could inflame regional tensions. 
Prime minister Manasseh Sogavare inked a raft of deals during a trip to China this week, including an agreement allowing Beijing to extend its police presence in the developing Pacific nation until 2025. 
The US, Australia and New Zealand have expressed unease about the policing “implementation plan”, urging Beijing to soothe concerns by releasing more details.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The European Commission is helping the United Nations and Turkey try to extend a deal allowing the Black Sea export of Ukraine grain and is open to &quot;explore all solutions,&quot; a European Union spokesperson said on Thursday, ahead of the deal&#x27;s possible expiration on Monday. 
 The U.N. and Turkey brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative with Russia and Ukraine in July 2022 to help alleviate a global food crisis worsened by Moscow&#x27;s invasion and blockade of Ukrainian ports. Ukraine and Russia are among the world&#x27;s leading grain exporters.

London/Berlin CNN  — Germany announced Thursday that it would reduce its dependence on China in “critical sectors” including medicine, lithium batteries used in electric cars and elements essential to chipmaking. 
The government published its first ever “Strategy on China,” a 40-page document that highlights the tightrope Berlin must walk in managing its dependence on the world’s second-largest economy amid growing criticism of Beijing’s human rights record and attitude towards international law. 
China is Germany’s most important trading partner, with imports and exports between the two nations reaching nearly €300 billion ($335 billion) in 2022, according to the government.

Reuters: Ukraine&#x27;s spymaster comes out of the shadows 
KYIV (Reuters) - He wears a pistol to interviews with foreign journalists and discusses wartime intelligence. Weapons and military gear are strewn on the floor of his Kyiv office. He says he has &quot;sources&quot; close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
 For an intelligence chief running Ukraine&#x27;s spy operations during war with Russia, Kyrylo Budanov, 37, has built up an unusually public profile that he has used to get his message out and to menace Russia from afar. 
These days, a spy boss cannot stay in the shadows, he says.

The FBI colluded with a Ukrainian intelligence agency in an effort to disrupt Russian disinformation campaigns by flagging social media accounts in a failed effort that ensnared a verified Russian-language U.S. State Department account and others, the House Judiciary Committee said in a report released Monday. 
The report said the FBI partnered with the SBU, one of Ukraine&#x27;s intelligence agencies, to flag the accounts believed to have spread Russian disinformation. Both agencies flagged American accounts for removal, as well as those belonging to American journalists, the report said.

FOX News: Biden authorizes military to use up to 3,000 reserve troops to augment US forces in Europe

 
The Pentagon has increased troop presence in Europe amid Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine 
President Biden on Thursday authorized the Pentagon to tap up to 3,000 reservists for deployment to Europe to augment U.S. troops there in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve. 
Biden’s order authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to send active duty units and individual members who are assigned to a unit of the Selected Reserve or any member of the Individual Ready Reserve. 
Units deployed are not to exceed more than 3,000 total members at one time, of whom not more than 450 may be members of the Individual Ready Reserve, the order said.

Seymour Hersh: Fear And Loathing On Air Force One

 
Biden’s anxieties over the Ukraine War and the election in 2024 come into view. 
Let’s start with a silly fear but one that does signal the Democratic Party’s growing sense of panic about the 2024 Presidential election. It was expressed to me by someone with excellent party credentials: that Trump could be the Republican nominee and will select Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his running mate. The strange duo will then sweep to a huge victory over a stumbling Joe Biden, and also take down many of the party’s House and Senate candidates. 
As for real signs of acute Democratic anxiety: Joe Biden got what he needed before the NATO summit this week by somehow turning Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inside out and getting him to rebuff Vladimir Putin by announcing that he would support NATO membership for Sweden. The public story for Biden’s face-saving coup was talk about agreeing to sell American F-16 fighter bombers to Turkey.

Update #2: Biden offered Erdogan IMF money to ratify Sweden NATO bid – Seymour Hersh (RT)

 
WNU Editor: Russia provides billions of dollars in natural gas to Turkey on credit. Russia also permits the export of Ukrainian grain via through Turkey. Something tells me this relationship is now going to change since it looks like Turkish President Erdogan has decided to abandon his close ties to Russia for this promised IMF credit line from President Biden. 
A prediction. The IMF credit line is a stop-gap measure that will only last a short time. Turkey&#x27;s medium and long term economic interests would be better served by developing energy ties with Russia that in the end would dwarf whatever the IMF could offer.</span>

The United Nations Security Council is calling an urgent meeting of member countries in the wake of North Korea&#x27;s latest missile launch.

In a rare move, the North Korean government is requesting an opportunity to speak when the council convenes.

North Korea on Wednesday fired a submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile toward the East Sea, reigniting perennial tensions in the region.

EurAsian Times: US Military Aircraft ‘Roars &amp; Soars’ Over Taiwan Strait As Chinese Fighter Jets Watch Like A Hawk 
With the Chinese military drills in full force near the self-ruled Taiwanese Island, the Chinese military reportedly monitored a P-8A maritime reconnaissance aircraft flying over the Taiwan Strait yet again. 
On July 13, as China conducted a third day of continuous military drills to the south of the island that began earlier this week, Chinese fighter planes watched the US Navy patrol plane fly across the contested Taiwan Strait, which China continues to claim as its sovereign territory. 
Asserting that it “has sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction” over the Taiwan Strait, China regularly expresses outrage over US military activities across the narrow strait, often conducted by warships but also occasionally involving surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft.

Volodomyr Zelensky got the bad news in Vilnius — notwithstanding lip service from some of the NATO members — the United States and Germany are refusing to let Ukraine join the club out of fear of broadening the war with Russia. 
Make no mistake — NATO is at war with Russia, but the West is cognizant of its military weakness and is not willing as an organization to risk taking steps that would provoke direct fighting between Russian and NATO forces.

 In the final year of World War II, the U.S. spent about 38% of its GDP on its military. 
When adjusted for inflation, the military budget over those four years of war came to a staggering $4.1 trillion in 2020 dollars. 
And as Visual Capitalist&#x27;s Pallave Rao and Joyce Ma detail below, almost 80 years later, modern day military spending isn’t much of a far cry from World War II budgets.

A Russian general has said he has been fired as a commander after telling Moscow’s military leadership “the truth” about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of the Wagner group’s short-lived mutiny. 
Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms army, which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire as well as deaths and injuries the army was suffering from Ukrainian attacks. 
Popov’s emotional address was published late on Wednesday by Andrey Gurulyov, a retired Russian colonel general and Duma deputy.

 In a blunt intervention, Ben Wallace said his &quot;counsel&quot; to the Ukrainians was to keep in mind that they need to persuade some doubting politicians in Washington and other capitals that the tens of billions of pounds they are spending on military aid to their country for its war with Russia is worthwhile.

RT:  Wagner does not exist, Putin tells media

 
The Russian president has opened up about his Kremlin meeting with mutineers  
Russian law does not recognize the existence of private military companies, including ‘Wagner,’ President Vladimir Putin told the newspaper Kommersant on Thursday, when asked about his recent meeting with commanders of the mutinous group. 
While attending a technology fair in Moscow, Putin was asked whether ‘Wagner’ will continue operating as a combat formation.
  
  “Well, PMC Wagner does not exist!” Putin told the Kommersant correspondent. 
“We don’t have a law on private military companies! So it simply doesn’t exist!”

“The group exists, but legally it does not,” the president clarified. “It’s a separate issue, related to legalization, that needs to be taken up by the State Duma and the government. A complicated question.”

Biden previously claimed Putin was &#x27;losing the war in Iraq&#x27; 
President Biden committed multiple speaking gaffes during his trip to Lithuania this week to shore up support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia, including confusing the two nations, as well as their leaders. 
While speaking to the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania on Wednesday Biden referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as &quot;Vladmir,&quot; seemingly confusing Zelenskyy with Russian President Vladmir Putin.

Ukraine, rather than the mutiny of Russian private military company Wagner, was the main subject of recent secret talks between CIA Director William Burns and his Russian counterpart, the latter revealed on Wednesday. 
Sergey Naryshkin is the head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, the SVR 
The phone call between the two intelligence chiefs took place in late June and was first reported by Western media, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. They said Burns wanted to assure Moscow that the US government had nothing to do with the then-ongoing Wagner mutiny.

Russia will view the deployment of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as a direct nuclear threat to the Kremlin, Putin&#x27;s foreign minister has warned. 
Sergei Lavrov says Russia has privately warned the US, Britain and France of the dire risks of the planned move to give Kyiv the advanced warplanes. 
He implied that the use of F-16 - for which Ukrainian pilots are now being trained - could lead to Putin unleashing tactical nuclear weapons. 
He said the move was &#x27;just one example of an extremely dangerous turn of events is the United States plans to transfer F-16 fighter jets to the Kiev regime.

Reuters: Russia&#x27;s Lavrov: Ukraine conflict will not end until West drops plans to defeat Moscow 
(Reuters) -The armed confrontation in Ukraine will continue until the West gives up plans to dominate and defeat Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with an Indonesian newspaper published on Wednesday. 
The goal of the &quot;US-led collective West&quot; is to strengthen its global hegemony, Lavrov told the Kompas newspaper. Lavrov is due to attend the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum in Jakarta this week, as is U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 
&quot;Why doesn&#x27;t the armed confrontation in Ukraine come to an end? The answer is very simple – it will continue until the West gives up its plans to preserve its domination and overcome its obsessive desire to inflict on Russia a strategic defeat at the hands of its Kiev puppets,&quot; according to a transcript of the interview published on Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry website.

Reuters: Kremlin calls Western security assurances for Ukraine a dangerous mistake 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that security assurances the West is considering for Ukraine would be a dangerous mistake that would impinge on Russia&#x27;s own security and expose Europe to greater risks for many years ahead. 
G7 countries are expected on Wednesday to announce an international framework that would pave the way for long-term security assurances for Ukraine to boost its defences against Russia and deter future aggression, officials said. 
Moscow says shoring up its own security in the face of what it casts as an ever-expanding NATO and a hostile militarised Ukraine was one of the main reasons why it last year launched what it calls its &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine.

The Guardian: US and UK call for more gratitude from Kyiv after Zelenskiy’s Nato complaint 
Comments come after Ukrainian leader complained his country had not been given firm timetable for joining alliance 
Britain’s defence secretary and the US national security adviser have suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. 
Their unscripted remarks – at two different events on the margins of the second day of the Nato summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius – appeared to prompt a change of tack from the Ukrainian leader on Wednesday, who later said he was “grateful to all leaders of Nato countries” for their support and help.

Newsweek: NATO Summit Marked by Division Leaves Ukraine&#x27;s Future Uncertain 
Ukraine&#x27;s potential pathway to NATO membership was the main topic on the agenda at the alliance&#x27;s annual Summit, held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Vilnius, Lithuania, and sources in attendance told Newsweek there that the outcome came up considerably short of Ukraine&#x27;s expectations. 
After what multiple figures close to the Ukrainian delegation described as intense behind-the-scenes negotiations, the closest Kyiv came to receiving a guarantee of future membership was the inclusion of the word &quot;invitation&quot; in the summit&#x27;s official communique, which included the sentence: &quot;[NATO] will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree …</span>

                              <span>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
&quot;Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;He needs to lift the holdings,&quot; said Austin. &quot;This is a national security issue, a readiness issue.&quot;
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin&#x27;s call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
&quot;Is that something you&#x27;re willing to deal with, negotiate?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that&#x27;s an important policy,&quot; said Austin. &quot;I think our troops don&#x27;t get to choose where they&#x27;re assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I&#x27;m proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.&quot;
&quot;So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?&quot; asked Blitzer.
&quot;That&#x27;s our policy,&quot; said Austin.

This comes as President Joe Biden, who has already declared his confidence that Ukraine will be triumphant over the Kremlin invasion, proclaimed that they already have at a summit in Helsinki, during celebrations about Finland&#x27;s admission into NATO.
&quot;Put on your CIA director cap for a moment,&quot; said Tapper. &quot;What do you think went through Putin&#x27;s mind today when President Biden declared that Putin has already lost the war?&quot;

                              <span>The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been &quot;eaten alive.&quot;
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates &quot;do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.&quot; 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,&quot; she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson&#x27;s death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a &quot;racial justice issue,&quot; citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

                              <span>Doctors were able to complete a &quot;miracle&quot; surgery where they reattached a boy&#x27;s head who had suffered an &quot;internal decapitation&quot; as a result of being hit by a car while he was riding his bike, Fox News reported.  
Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was &quot;almost completely detached from the base of his neck.&quot; The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use &quot;new plates and fixations in the damaged area.&quot; 
&quot;Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room,&quot; Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
&quot;The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing,&quot; Einav said.</span>

                              <span>Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a &quot;big flirt&quot; but denied any &quot;aggressive&quot; behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to &quot;come off the road&quot;.
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said &quot;it didn&#x27;t happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way&quot;.
&quot;It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic,&quot; Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a &quot;big flirt&quot;.
But the alleged victim &quot;made it clear that he did not want to go any further,&quot; the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt &quot;crushed&quot; after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a &quot;stab in the back&quot;.
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as &quot;madness&quot;.
&quot;I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn&#x27;t and never have to anyone in my life,&quot; Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn&#x27;t recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, was artistic director of London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.</span>

What is significant about July 14? 
“Bastille Day” is known in France simply as “le Quatorze Juillet”, a reference to the date on which it is held. July 14 became an official national holiday in 1880 to commemorate key turning points in French history. 
The French Revolution officially began on May 5, 1789, when King Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates General to raise more money after h…</span>

                              <span>It was a legendary debate about racism in the United States between two of the country&#x27;s great minds. One a gay Black writer, the other a blue-blooded white dandy and leading thinker of the American right.
They went toe-to-toe over whether &quot;The American Dream is at the Expense of the American Negro&quot; at Britain&#x27;s Cambridge Union -- the world&#x27;s oldest debating society -- in 1965.
Now the epic joust between novelist James Baldwin and the influential conservative author and editor William F. Buckley Jr is being brought to the stage after nearly 60 years at Europe&#x27;s biggest theatre festival in Avignon, France.
And, as the play&#x27;s creators point out, few of the burning issues raised in the debate -- which went viral when it resurfaced on YouTube in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement -- h…</span>

                              <span>Russia responded to NATO vows of support for Ukraine with air strikes and nuclear saber-rattling on Thursday, as US President Joe Biden prepared to meet Nordic leaders unsettled by Moscow&#x27;s war.
Biden was visiting newest NATO member Finland a day after a summit in Vilnius in which the Western military alliance pledged its backing for Kyiv but failed to offer it a timeline for membership.
Moscow&#x27;s riposte came in the form of its latest aerial assault on Ukraine, with Kyiv saying early Thursday it had destroyed 20 Russian attack drones and two cruise missiles.
At least four people were wounded in the capital, where most of the Iranian-made drones were destroyed, Kyiv&#x27;s mayor said.
In a sign of its anger at Western backing for Kyiv, Moscow said it would regard F-16 fighter jets sent to Ukrain…</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden already had his work cut out to prevent Turkey from spoiling the NATO summit. What wasn&#x27;t expected was that Ukraine&#x27;s Volodymyr Zelensky would be the one casting an even bigger cloud -- and testing the US president&#x27;s diplomatic powers in real time.
Biden has celebrated what he calls unprecedented Western unity in support of Ukraine and NATO as one of the main achievements of his first term.
And the Vilnius NATO summit this week was meant to showcase that record ahead of his re-election fight next year.
Yet instead, as Biden flew to Europe on Sunday, the threat of embarrassing failure loomed.
NATO member Turkey had long threatened to torpedo the bid of Sweden to become the alliance&#x27;s latest entry. Now, less than two days before the start of the summit in Lithuania, Turkish Preside…</span>

Kundera’s renowned novel, “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,’’ opens wrenchingly with Soviet tanks rolling through Prague, the Czech capital that was the author’s home until he moved to France in 1975. Weaving together themes of love and exile, politics and the deeply personal, Kundera’s novel won critical acclaim, earning him a wide readership among Westerners who embraced both his anti-Soviet subversion and the eroticism threaded through many of his works.

Reuters: Leaders of Turkey and Greece vow to repair ties after year of tension 
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece and Turkey agreed on Wednesday to resume talks and confidence-building measures as they hailed a new &quot;positive climate&quot; in ties after more than a year of tensions between the historic foes. 
The two North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies have been at odds for decades over a range of issues including where their continental shelves start and end, energy resources, overflights of the Aegean Sea, and ethnically split Cyprus. 
Last year, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan halted bilateral talks in a dispute over airspace violations and after accusing Greek Prime Minister
of pressuring the United States to block the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.

WNU Editor: Both leaders have been re-elected by their voters in the past month. So at least that is behind them. Maybe some good will now come out of that outcome.

North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), Japanese and South Korean officials report. 
The long-range missile flew for more than an hour before landing short of Japanese waters on Wednesday morning. 
Pyongyang&#x27;s launch comes after it threatened retaliation against what it said were recent US spy plane incursions over its territory. 
Earlier this week it threatened to shoot down such planes.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Beijing lashed back at NATO&#x27;s accusation that China challenges the bloc&#x27;s interests and security, and opposed any attempt by the military alliance to expand its footprint into the Asia-Pacific region. 
In a strongly worded communique issued midway into a two-day summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on Tuesday, NATO said the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) challenged its interests, security and values with its &quot;ambitions and coercive policies&quot;. 
&quot;The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic, and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up,&quot; NATO heads of state said in their communique.

The Office of Naval Intelligence is sounding the alarm about the huge gap in U.S. and Chinese shipbuilding capacity and its implications.  
A U.S. Navy briefing slide is calling new attention to the worrisome disparity between Chinese and U.S. capacity to build new naval vessels and total naval force sizes. The data compiled by the Office of Naval Intelligence says that a growing gap in fleet sizes is being helped by China&#x27;s shipbuilders being more than 200 times more capable of producing surface warships and submarines. This underscores longstanding concerns about the U.S. Navy&#x27;s ability to challenge Chinese fleets, as well as sustain its forces afloat, in any future high-end conflict. 
In a statement to The War Zone, the U.S. Navy has confirmed the authenticity of the slide, seen in full below, which has been circulating online.

WNU Editor: The Pentagon has confirmed the above slide. 
The above report confirms what I fear. If a war should break out between the US and China and it lasts for a period of time, the U.S. will be forced to use their nuclear arsenals to offset the conventional military advantages that favor China.</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.
