New York Times: U.S. Hunts Chinese Malware That Could Disrupt American Military Operations 
The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to American military, intelligence and national security officials. 
The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People’s Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.

Warzone/The Drive: Northrop Grumman Bails On Next Generation Fighter Competition

 
Northrop Grumman has decided to focus on other opportunities, among them is the Navy’s own 6th generation fighter program.  
Northrop Grumman has removed itself from the running, at least as a prime contractor, to design and build a new sixth-generation stealthy crewed combat jet under the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. This is in line with a report last month that the field of NGAD combat jet competitors had shrunk from three to two, with the remaining pair widely believed to be Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company has left open the possibility of joining another NGAD team led by a different prime contractor. 
Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman&#x27;s CEO, spoke of her company&#x27;s current strategy around the Air Force&#x27;s multi-faceted NGAD program during an earning call earlier today. In May, the service announced it had formally released a classified contract solicitation for the engineering and manufacturing phase of the development of the NGAD combat jet. This aircraft is ostensibly intended to replace the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, but is expected to have significantly more expansive capabilities that go well beyond a traditional fighter concept.

                              <span>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Thousands of flag-waving Israelis renewed their protests nationwide after sundown on Saturday, capping a week of turmoil in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed through a highly-contested law that limited some Supreme Court power. 
From a remote intersection among the lush hills of the northern Galilee to the avenues criss-crossing the financial hub of Tel Aviv, protesters beating drums and blaring horns took to the streets on a hot evening at the end of Sabbath.</span>

According to a report from Rolling Stone, the fast-talking Ramaswamy, who has risen to double-digit figures in recent polls and is catching up with Trump rival Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), has found an audience that is intrigued by his presidential bid and that some Christian Nationalists like him -- they just wouldn&#x27;t vote for him.
As Rolling Stone&#x27;s Tim Dickinson wrote, a recent meet-up that included Pastors for Trump revealed a strong undercurrent of wariness of Ramaswamy due to his religion.

The police investigations into serious arson center around the deceased 45-year-old man and 22-year-old woman, a police spokesman said on Saturday, adding that the investigation is still in its early stages. 
The two jumped from the 12th floor of the 15-story building in the Kreuzberg district in a blaze that broke out on Friday afternoon. Flames were leaping behind them from the flat.</span>

Laura Nickel and Max Teske were working in the high school in Burg, a picturesque town in the eastern state of Brandenburg popular with tourists, when they noticed worrying behaviour among some of their students.
&quot;Right-wing extremism was on full display in the school,&quot; Nickel, 34, told AFP. &quot;From Hitler salutes to swastikas drawn on dictionaries and students&#x27; lockers, not to mention racist and homophobic language.&quot;
&quot;They were really the loudest pupils -- they did not hide,&quot; she added.
In April, the teachers sent an anonymous letter to the local press denouncing the behaviour they had witnessed.

The vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling India and Bangladesh hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest populations of Bengal tigers.
Their pelts, bones and flesh are bought by black marketeers as part of a broader illegal wildlife trade valued at an estimated $20 billion globally each year.
Research from big cat conservation group Panthera and the Chinese Academy of Sciences said tiger parts harvested in the Sundarbans have been exported to 15 countries, with India and China being the most common destinations.

Hosted by HKU, the meeting spanned from June 25 to 27 and revolved around the theme &quot;From Invention to Implementation – Solutions for a Sustainable Future&quot;.   The collaboration initiatives outlined in the MoU aim to collectively advance research and educational programmes centred around sustainability and carbon neutrality in the Asia Pacific region. The participating institutions have committed to undertaking the agreed-upon initiatives to achieve this shared objective.   As specified in the MoU, HKU, Fudan University and The University of Sydney will strive to formulate university-wide carbon neutrality targets. This collaborative effort will involve designing and implementing strategies to reduce carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality within their respective institutions.  The participating institutions will also co-organise regular round-table workshops and student exchange programmes, providing students with valuable opportunities to acquire knowledge and practical experience in environmental initiatives.  During his welcome remarks, Prof Xiang Zhang, President and Vice-Chancellor of HKU, stated that the MoU serves the pivotal role in enabling three universities in advancing university-wide carbon neutrality targets across respective institutions and leading research that brings sustainability and carbon neutrality throughout Asia-Pacific.     “It’s indeed an honour to witness and celebrate the beginning of a new…</span>

While not directly critical of Russia, their interventions on the second day of a summit were more concerted and forceful than those that African countries have voiced until now. They served as reminders of the depth of African concern at the consequences of the war, especially rising food prices. &quot;This war must end. And it ...</span>

                              <span>General Abdourahamane Tchiani is the new leader of Niger following a military takeover, state television reported Friday, two days after the country’s president was detained by members of his own guard.
Tchiani, the head of the Presidential Guard, has been named &quot;president of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland,&quot; a statement said.
Appearing on state television, the general said soldiers had seized power to the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel country.
The country’s elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, has been detained by the putschists since Wednesday morning.
Earlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron described the coup as &quot;dangerous&quot; for the region as Western powers scramble to preserve a key ally in the insurgent-stricken Sahel.
&quot;This coup is completely illegitimate and profoundly dangerous, for Nigeriens, for Niger and for the whole region,&quot; Macron said.
Macron said he had spoken to Bazoum, who is being held in his palace, and called for him to be reinstated.
Niger&#x27;s government had been seen by many in the international community as a bulwark against Islamist militancy in a vast, arid region that is beset by security challenges.
French and UN troops were in recent years forced to withdraw from neighboring Mali, but Paris still has 1,500 soldiers in Niger. Bazoum&#x27;s overthrow could put the future of their deployment in doubt.
Macron, speaking during a visit to Papua New Guinea, said it was imperative that the constitutional order be restored and vowed to support regional groupings like ECOWAS in mediation or sanctions against putschists.

In its annual white paper -- a rundown of the most pressing military threats and plans to ensure stability -- Japan&#x27;s defense ministry made a case for a significant hike in domestic defense spending as the world enters &quot;a new era of crisis&quot;.
While China&#x27;s growing military might and Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine were major focuses of the white paper, North Korea also ranked as a key concern for Japan.
&quot;North Korea&#x27;s military activities pose an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan&#x27;s national security than ever before,&quot; the document said.

                              <span>Representatives from various African and Caribbean entities joined forces at a historic event this week in the capital of Barbados, Bridgetown, to demand reparations for slavery and its legacy in today&#x27;s society.
The University of the West Indies (UWI), the Economic, Social and Cultural Council of the African Union (AU), Barbados&#x27; government, grant-making network Open Society Foundations and the Caribbean Pan African Network teamed up to &quot;call for reparations for historical crimes&quot;.
The meeting in Bridgetown, from Monday to Thursday, included strategy sessions and plenaries and marked the beginning of an &quot;intercontinental campaign&quot;, the UWI said in a statement, describing it as &quot;ground-breaking&quot;.
Attendees included ambassadors and representatives from AU member states and the Caribbean Community political and economic union (CARICOM).
&quot;This is a historic moment... humanity cannot go forward with all the toxic interferences of colonisation,&quot; Hilary Beckles, head of the CARICOM reparations commission, told a news conference on Thursday. &quot;We have to clean up this mess to allow humanity to function.&quot;
Outcomes of the meeting include a proposal for a roadmap for cooperation between the AU and CARICOM, the UWI statement said.
&quot;It is crucial to recognize how slavery, colonialism and racism intersect and impact the lives of Black people around the world,&quot; said AU official Youssouf Mandoha.

There are new, advanced types that can sense movement or destroy vehicles from hundreds of meters away. Most common, however, are older, simple weapons that were produced in the tens of millions and fill the armories of both the Ukraini...</span>

In a revised indictment, prosecutors accused Trump of seeking to erase security camera footage at Mar-a-Lago. 
Special counsel Jack Smith has brought three new felony charges against former President Donald Trump, including explosive claims that he asked an employee of his Mar-a-Lago club to delete security camera footage sought by investigators probing his handling of classified documents. 
In a 60-page superseding indictment unveiled Thursday, prosecutors also accused Trump of possessing a highly classified war plan that he shared with people lacking security clearances months after his presidency ended. 
And prosecutors added a third defendant: Carlos De Oliveira, a worker at Mar-a-Lago who is accused of joining Trump and aide Walt Nauta to seek the destruction of the security footage.

                              <span>WNU Editor: In the past two days the Western news media narrative is that Ukraine is making significant gains with Russia retreating from three main frontal attacks (see videos above). 
The Russian news media narrative is the opposite .... More Western-made Ukrainian tanks destroyed – Moscow (RT). More here .... Russia’s Battlegroup South repels attacks of Ukrainian assault groups in three directions (TASS). 
So who is right? 
I am not there, but it looks like Ukraine has committed everything in the past few days (including all of its reserves) to break the Russian lines even though there is no air support for their offensive. Ukraine needs a major victory, and they need it in the next few weeks. 
On a side note. It is reported that Putin told African leaders last night during a Russia - Africa summit dinner that the Kremlin believes Ukraine has only enough weaponry, ammo, and men to continue the offensive until the end of August. After that the Ukraine army, without more support from the West, will have a problem holding back any Russian counteroffensive should the Kremlin decide to launch one.</span>

                              <span>Responsible Statecraft: Moscow and Washington shadowboxing in the skies over Syria

 
Tensions related to the war in Ukraine are resulting in actual physical altercations on another battlefront thousands of miles away. 
U.S.-Russian tensions continued to rise this week as two U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones were damaged by flares released from Russian jets over Syria. 
The first incident on Sunday damaged the drone’s propeller but did not cause it to crash, but it echoed a similar episode over the Black Sea in March when the drone crashed after a collision with a Russian jet. Another incident occurred Wednesday over northwest Syria and resulted in damage to one of the drone’s wings. 
That makes for a reported total of six incidents involving Russian and American aircraft in July. The confrontations were a reminder of the potential dangers of U.S. and Russian forces operating in close proximity to each other in Syria, and they raise the question of why U.S. forces are still operating in a country where they have no legal mandate.

Tokyo’s annual defence white paper sets out plans to increase spending  
Japan has warned that deepening military co-operation between China and Russia is of “grave concern” for its security, in the country’s first defence white paper since it set out plans to expand defence spending last year. 
 Beijing and Moscow kicked off their largest joint naval and air exercise in the Sea of Japan earlier this month, underscoring how their collaboration has gained pace following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The white paper, which was approved by prime minister Fumio Kishida’s cabinet on Friday, also noted that the overall military balance between China and Taiwan was “rapidly tilting” in Beijing’s favour.

A US intelligence report has alleged China is likely supplying Russia&#x27;s army in Ukraine. 

It claimed Beijing was an &quot;increasingly important buttress for Russia in its war effort, probably supplying Moscow with key technology and dual-use equipment used in Ukraine.
&quot; 

Navigation equipment, jamming technology and fighter jet parts were some of the items being supplied by China, despite international controls.

NIAMEY (Reuters) -Leaders of the coup in Niger declared General Abdourahamane Tiani as the new head of state on Friday, and said they had suspended the constitution and dissolved all former institutions after overthrowing President Mohamed Bazoum. 
Tiani was the head of the presidential guard, whose soldiers shut Bazoum in his palace on Wednesday and said it had ousted him because of bad governance and worsening security. 
The general appeared on state television on Friday with a banner on the screen that described him as the president of a newly formed military council, the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland (CNSP).
&quot;The President of the CNSP is the head of state. He represents the state of Niger in international relations,&quot; an officer said, reading out a statement.

Zero Hedge: &#x27;Colossal Difference&#x27; Between Ukrainian &amp; Russian Losses, Putin Tells Africa Summit 
Throughout the Russia-Ukraine war true casualty figures have remained largely a secret, suppressed by both sides, which often happens in the middle of active conflicts. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to reporters Thursday on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit in St. Petersburg. He took the opportunity to once again highlight that Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive has failed, and that in the process Kiev has suffered huge losses, both in manpower and foreign-supplied equipment.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said Moscow is &quot;carefully&quot; examining proposals made by some African leaders to end the conflict in Ukraine. 
&quot;We respect your initiatives and we are examining them carefully,&quot; Putin said on the second day of a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg. 
 &quot;Previous mediation initiatives were monopolized by so-called advanced democracies. Now Africa too is ready to help resolve problems that appear to be outside of its area of priorities,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Reuters: Russian, Chinese officials join Kim at North Korea military parade 
SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese and Russian officials stood shoulder to shoulder with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they reviewed his newest nuclear-capable missiles and attack drones at a military parade in the capital, North Korean state media showed on Friday. 
The widely anticipated parade in Pyongyang the previous day commemorated the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, celebrated in North Korea as &quot;Victory Day&quot;.
 Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu&#x27;s visit was the first by Moscow&#x27;s top defence official since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. The Chinese delegation was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Their appearance at events with the North&#x27;s nuclear-capable missiles - banned by the U.N. Security Council with Chinese and Russian support - was in contrast from previous years, when Beijing and Moscow sought to distance themselves from their neighbour&#x27;s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development.

                              <span>Responsible Statecraft:  Uber Russia-hawk Victoria Nuland rises to acting deputy secretary of state 
She’s done as much as anyone to sour US-Russia ties; now, she is one of Washington’s top diplomats. 
In a little-remarked move, the Biden administration announced Monday that Victoria Nuland will take over as the acting second-in-command at the State Department. She replaces Wendy Sherman, who plans to retire at the end of this week. 
Nuland’s appointment will be a boon for Russia hawks who want to turn up the heat on the Kremlin. But, for those who favor a negotiated end to the conflict in Ukraine, a promotion for the notoriously “undiplomatic diplomat” will be a bitter pill.

The Intercept:  Niger Coup Leader Joins Long Line of U.S.-Trained Mutineers

 
Brig. Gen. Moussa Salaou Barmou, who trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, helped oust Niger’s democratically elected president. 
Brig. gen. Moussa salaou barmou, the chief of Niger’s Special Operations Forces and one of the leaders of the unfolding coup in Niger, was trained by the U.S. military, The Intercept has confirmed. U.S.-trained military officers have taken part in 11 coups in West Africa since 2008. 
“We have had a very long relationship with the United States,” Barmou said in 2021. “Being able to work together in this capacity is very good for Niger.” Just last month, Barmou met with Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, the head of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, at Air Base 201, a drone base in the Nigerian city of Agadez that serves as the lynchpin of an archipelago of U.S. outposts in West Africa. 
On Wednesday, Barmou, who trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the National Defense University in Washington, joined a junta that ousted Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s democratically elected president, according to Nigerien sources and a U.S. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The situation in Niger “remains fluid” a day after mutinous soldiers detained toppled President Mohamed Bazoum and announced they had seized power in a coup because of the West African country’s deteriorating security situation. 
Tensions remain high between supporters of the coup and people loyal to the deposed government, Al Jazeera’s Ahmed Idris, who has reported extensively on Niger, said.

Ukraine has launched the main thrust of its counteroffensive, throwing in thousands of troops held in reserve, many of them Western-trained and equipped, two Pentagon officials said on Wednesday, hours after Russian officials reported major Ukrainian attacks in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. 
A spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov, said the Ukrainians had mounted a “massive” assault with three battalions, reinforced with tanks, south of the town of Orikhiv, and then another a few miles farther south near the village of Robotyne, according to the state news agency Tass.

Kyiv Post: ‘Every 100m Cost 4-5 Men’: Ukraine’s Frontline Fighters Report Bloody Battles, Battered Morale

 
Ukraine’s grinding offensive is slowly gaining ground at the price of a continuous flow of dead and wounded. Soldiers say they will fight on but morale is suffering with no quick end in sight. 
Front-line Ukrainian soldiers told Kyiv Post their units are suffering from poor morale because of constant and accumulating losses, sometimes poor support and limited summer offensive ground gains against a tough and deeply dug-in Russian opponent. 
 Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) enlisted soldiers in individual interviews said slow, deliberate assault tactics currently used by Ukrainian military that have left individual fighters strongly suspecting they will be hit, and possibly killed, well before a break-through on the front could take place.

RT:  US drone locked weapons on Russian jets – Moscow

 
The Su-34 and Su-35 planes were forced to fire flares during a dangerous encounter over Syria, a senior military official said  
A US MQ-9 Reaper surveillance and attack drone flew “dangerously close” to a pair of Russian Su-34 and Su-35 fighter jets in Syria on Wednesday, Moscow said. It was the second such incident in less than a week. 
According to Rear Admiral Oleg Gurinov, the deputy head of the Russian Reconciliation Center for Syria, the incident occurred shortly after 7:30 am local time over the northwestern Aleppo Province. He said the Russian planes automatically fired decoy flares after their radars showed that the Reaper had locked its weapons on them.

European Central Bank policymakers delivered another interest rate increase as anticipated, with eurozone consumer prices still rising fast.  But ECB chief Christine Lagarde sent dovish signals, leaving open the possibility of a pause in its streak of rate hikes as the eurozone&#x27;s economic outlook has deteriorated.

The accident happened in the early afternoon at Laguna lake, near Manila, hours after Typhoon Doksuri had swept out of the northern Philippines.
&quot;Some survivors begged us to rescue those trapped beneath the boat,&quot; resident Monica de la Cruz, who watched the rescue effort off the municipality of Binangonan, told AFP.
&quot;They were crying and some of them were injured.&quot;
Cruz said the accident took place following a &quot;sudden gust of wind, big waves and rain&quot;, with locals initially too afraid to assist, fearing they would be &quot;dragged down as well&quot;.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal even war…</span>
