President Biden was at the US Capitol today to give a speech on democracy as he encouraged Americans to vote. 

“Recent polls have shown that overwhelming majority of Americans believe our democracy is at risk, that democracy is under threat,” he said. 

“They too see that democracy is on the ballot this year, and they’re deeply concerned about it. 

“Today, I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance. 

“We must vote knowing what’s at stake and not just the policy of the moment.”</span>

Under the agreement, Ukraine had been able to restart grain and fertiliser exports which had stalled due to the ongoing war with Russia.

Russia had previously suspended its participation in the deal after a drone attack on its warships.</span>

Certain corners of Twitter, frustrated by limits on what they could tweet, have been celebrating Musk’s takeover, saying that he will “return freedom of expression” to the platform. They saw this public firing as the first step, claiming that Vijaya Gedde, the employee in the video, had been “responsible for censorship”. But Musk didn’t fire Gedde publicly: this video is a montage of footage from two different interviews.</span>

                              <span>French journalist Laurent Richard founded Forbidden Stories in 2017 with a simple mission: to continue the work of journalists who have been assassinated or otherwise silenced. That same year, Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb. The organisation worked to continue her investigations and identify her killers, exposing corruption at the highest levels of the Maltese government. For Richard, the ultimate goal of Forbidden Stories is twofold: to bring crucial reporting to the world and to deter crimes against journalists by showing that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make sense to kill a reporter when there are 50 others ready to carry on their work&quot;. He joined us for Perspective as we mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists.</span>

This article sets out the broad outlines of how this global auction might operate.

In addition, droughts, and catastrophic hunger levels  have left over 500,000 children malnourished and at risk of dying. This is already nearly 200,000 more than the 2011 famine. Urgent immediate actions must be taken now, both to address the crisis in the short-term and long-term.

Brazil&#x27;s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro failed to concede defeat to leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in his first public remarks since losing Sunday&#x27;s election. 
In a national address on Tuesday that lasted just a few minutes, Bolsonaro thanked Brazilians who voted for him. 
He didn&#x27;t mention election results, but reiterated that he would follow the country&#x27;s constitution, which stipulates a transition of power on January 1.

FOX News: US, Saudi Arabia on high alert over intel of impending Iranian attack: report 
Planned strikes are believed to be targeting Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
The United States and Saudi Arabia are on high alert after Saudi intelligence shared with the U.S. indicated that Iran is expected to carry out an attack on targets in Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Officials from both countries reportedly told the Journal about the concern over coming attacks. Saudi officials said that in addition to Saudi Arabia, Iran is also looking to strike Erbil, Iraq, where U.S. troops are located. 
The planned attacks are said to be intended as a distraction from protests taking place in Iran against the Islamic nation&#x27;s leadership.

WNU Editor: I follow Iran very closely. I have seen no uptick in military positioning or movement. I would be shocked if Iran does launch strikes against Saudi Arabia. 
All that I can say is let us pray that such a conflict does not happen. A major war in the Middle East will mean +$200 for a barrel of oil coupled with widespread shortages and rationing. A collapse in supply chains and the global economy. A severe recession, or more likely a severe depression with massive unemployment and social unrest.

Sputnik: Moscow Wants Answers Over Truss&#x27; Alleged &#x27;It&#x27;s Done&#x27; SMS to Blinken Moments After Nord Stream Blasts 
Europe lost access to up to 110 billion cubic meters worth of natural gas on September 26, when a series of explosions rocked the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines carrying Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea. 
After a comprehensive, month-long investigation, the Russian military concluded that the Royal Navy was behind the sabotage.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wants answers regarding the mysterious “It’s done” iPhone message allegedly sent by then-Prime Minist…</span>

                              <span>WNU Editor: A lot of talk in alternative media that US military planes turned off their transponders early Monday morning (link here). 
I do not know if these reports are true. Main stream media is not reporting this story. Neither any of the military blogs that I follow. 
My gut tells me that if it did happen it was a test/exercise. 
Shutting down military transponders is what will happen if war breaks out between the U.S. and Russia. In this case it looks like someone wanted to test the reaction time.</span>

Leaked Documents Outline DHS’s Plans to Police Disinformation 
The Department of Homeland Security is quietly broadening its efforts to curb speech it considers dangerous, an investigation by The Intercept has found. 
Years of internal DHS memos, emails, and documents — obtained via leaks and an ongoing lawsuit, as well as public documents — illustrate an expansive effort by the agency to influence tech platforms. 
The work, much of which remains unknown to the American public, came into clearer view earlier this year when DHS announced a new “Disinformation Governance Board”: a panel designed to police misinformation (false information spread unintentionally), disinformation (false information spread intentionally), and malinformation (factual information shared, typically out of context, with harmful intent) that allegedly threatens U.S. interests. 
While the board was widely ridiculed, immediately scaled back, and then shut down within a few months, other initiatives are underway as DHS pivots to monitoring social media now that its original mandate — the war on terror — has been wound down.

The Diplomat: Blinken, Wang Have First China-US Talks Since 20th Party Congress 
Chinese foreign minister stressed to his U.S. counterpart that Washington should not expect Beijing to change course. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked on the phone on Monday. It was their first conversation — and the first high-level China-U.S. exchange — since the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) concluded on October 22. 
At the party meeting, Wang was elevated to the party’s Politburo. That indicates he is to replace outgoing Yang Jiechi as China’s top diplomat – formally, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, the CCP’s foreign policy body. Wang will move out of his foreign minister post along with the promotion.

                              <span>CNBC: Euro zone inflation hits record high of 10.7% as growth slows sharply 
* Preliminary data on Monday from Europe’s statistics office showed headline inflation came in at an annual 10.7% this month. 
* This represents the highest ever monthly reading since the euro zone’s formation. The 19-member bloc has faced higher prices, particularly on energy and food, for the past 12 months.
* But the increases have been accentuated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. 
Euro zone inflation rose above the 10% level in the month of October, highlighting the severity of the cost-of-living crisis in the region and adding more pressure on the European Central Bank.

                              <span>Elon Musk has teased fans on Twitter by weighing in on whether former president Donald Trump will be allowed to return to the social media platform after being kicked off in January 2021.

“If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump was coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money,” Elon Musk tweeted.

Fans of the 45th president begged the new owner to allow him back on the platform, with one user calling Donald Trump’s permanent suspension “the most outrageous act of censorship in modern America”.</span>

Tina Brown, author of &#x27;The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor - the Truth and the Turmoil&#x27;, told The Telegraph ahead of the release of her new book earlier this year that the Duke of Sussex&#x27;s &quot;whole personality has changed&quot;.

&quot;He’s so emotionally needy that he’s been completely and utterly taken over by Meghan and his whole personality has changed. It’s a really sad thing to a great many people,&quot; she told the publication.

&quot;Meghan seems to answer some huge need in Harry and it seems like they are in a powerful co-dependency. And I do question how it will end.&quot;</span>

This comes amid reports the US Air Force could deploy nuclear-capable bombers to the Northern Territory.

“The relevant US behaviours have increased regional tensions, seriously undermined regional peace and stability and may trigger an arms race in the region,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. 

“China urges the parties concerned to abandon the outdated cold war and … narrow-minded geopolitical thinking.”</span>

                              <span>Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says the Democrats have “kept Biden mostly at home” over the last couple of days during the US midterm elections campaign. 

“We understand that Joe Biden may be out in Pennsylvania, it’s very close to his home state, that one makes some sense, but he won’t be going across the country like (former) president Obama will,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“Obama’s probably the most popular Democrat right now nationwide and if I were the Democrats, I’d be doing the exact same thing.”</span>

                              <span>Around 3 million Texans have already cast their vote in next week&#x27;s midterm elections. 

The southern state hosts several interesting contests - including for the Governorship - as Democrat and failed presidential candidate Beto O&#x27;Rourke tries to oust Republican Greg Abbott. 

With the midterm elections approaching quickly, more and more Americans are talking about the issue of cost of living. 

Sky News spoke to Texans to discuss their key election issues as Americans gear up to head to the polls for the midterms, with some pointing to the cost of living crisis, gun laws, and abortion rights.</span>

“This a repetition that goes back 100 years in my country,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

He said the reason the Republicans stand to do well in the midterms is because the Democrats continue to talk about abortion when undecided voters are more focussed on the economy and the cost of living crisis.</span>

                              <span>The summer of 1994 was uncharacteristically warm for Great Britain. Hot, sunny days were followed by close, sticky nights — and by the end of June, pressure had started to build. The last week of the month was an explosive one, meteorologically and culturally. On Friday June 24, an exceptionally severe thunderstorm hit the south east of the UK, diffusing so much grass pollen it triggered a sudden and short-lived asthma epidemic. Two days later, and after years of mounting speculation, the British press broke the news that Prince Charles had accidentally revealed his unfaithfulness to Princess Diana during an ITN documentary. (When asked if he had stayed loyal to his wife, the Prince of Wales nodded. &quot;Yes absolutely,&quot; he said before adding of his marriage &quot;until it became irretrievably broken down.&quot;)</span>

* Ukraine has claimed that 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday as its forces continue to make gains 
* It marks the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin&#x27;s troops since Russia&#x27;s the invasion began in back in February 
* Footage has emerged showing panicked soldiers fleeing attack on armoured vehicle - only for it to flip over 
* Comes as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and push them to the front lines, regardless of skill 
Nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in one day in Ukraine, Kyiv has claimed, marking the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin since his troops invaded eight months ago.
Ukrainian forces have been making gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the country&#x27;s east and in the southern city of Kherson. 
 In a blow to Putin&#x27;s invasion, 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday, pushing the Russian death toll up to at least 71,200, Kyiv has claimed.

WNU editor: If you want to follow war reports from the Ukraine Ministry of Defense, the link is here (link here) 

I personally follow their reports everyday. But needless to say I am skeptical. And in the past few weeks I have found their reports very hard to believe like the claim that 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday. But they are a reference tool that all those who are following the war should check out each day. 
As for those who want to follow the Russian Ministry of Defense website. It is unfortunately blocked for outsiders. This may change in the future, so the link is here https://eng.mil.ru/</span>

   DW: Norway raises army alert level in response to Ukraine war 
The Norwegian armed forces will do less training and more active operations, the country&#x27;s prime minister said. Oslo is concerned about sabotage to its energy infrastructure. 
Norway&#x27;s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Monday that his country&#x27;s military would be put on a raised level of alert as part of increased security measures in response to the war in Ukraine. 
&quot;This is the most severe security situation in several decades,&quot; Stoere told a press conference  &quot;
There are no indications that Russia is expanding its warfare to other countries, but the increased tensions make us more exposed to threats, intelligence operations and influence campaigns.&quot; 
The increased alert level would be valid from Tuesday.

Insider: Chinese leader Xi Jinping&#x27;s power grab fueled a $6 trillion stock selloff and the yuan&#x27;s decline. These 4 charts capture the market meltdown 
* China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power — and that has rocked markets. 
* Investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout as Xi shut reformers out of decision making. 
* These 4 charts show how deep the meltdown in China-linked assets went last week. 
China&#x27;s leader Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power, shutting out reformers to effectively take sole charge of the world&#x27;s second-largest economy — and that has rocked markets. 
President Xi unveiled a new decision-making team stacked with like-minded political allies and publicly disrespected his business-friendly predecessor at the Communist Party congress last week. 
Spooked investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout Monday, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, the tightly-managed onshore yuan continued to lose ground to the dollar, having already dropped sharply this year.

Reuters: EU examines classifying Iran Revolutionary Guards as terrorists - Germany 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and the European Union are examining whether to classify Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Sunday. 
&quot;I made it clear last week that we will launch another package of sanctions, that we will examine how we can also list the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation,&quot; Baerbock said in a interview with ARD broadcaster on Sunday. 
Her comments come after the head of the Revolutionary Guards warned protesters that Saturday would be their last day of taking to the streets, in a sign that security forces may intensify their already fierce crackdown on widespread unrest.

 On Saturday, Meretz and Hadash Ta’al continued their strategy of calling people to vote for them so they won’t fall under the electoral threshold, known colloquially as “gevalt” campaigns.

                              <span>VICE: Facebook’s Monopoly Is Imploding Before Our Eyes 
Competition, miscalculations, and regulatory scrutiny have all but killed the advertising giant&#x27;s dreams of diversifying its business and rolling up the digital world into its platform. 
For years, the definition of success for many tech employees has been getting a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). 
Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, meanwhile, are often the five major companies people think of when they think of &quot;big tech.&quot; 
But there is evidence that Facebook—once a dominant monopoly rightly blamed for all sorts of societal ills—is on the precipice of dropping out of this group through years of sheer mismanagement, a failure to innovate, setting money on fire in pursuit of a metaverse that seemingly no one wants, a vulnerable business model that Apple is squarely taking aim at, and upstart competitors like TikTok that the company seemingly has no answer for. What seemed impossible just a year or two ago—that Facebook will become just another tech company, more or less—now seems like a very real possibility.

It’s become routine since Russia invaded Ukraine: President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak by phone whenever the U.S. announces a new package of military assistance for Kyiv.

                              <span>ABC News Australia: US Air Force to deploy nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Australia as tensions with China grow 
The United States is preparing to deploy up to six nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to northern Australia, a provocative move experts say is aimed squarely at China. 
An investigation by Four Corners can reveal Washington is planning to build dedicated facilities for the giant aircraft at Tindal air base, south of Darwin. 
The US has drawn up detailed plans for what it calls a &quot;squadron operations facility&quot; for use during the Northern Territory dry season, an adjoining maintenance centre and a parking area for &quot;six B-52s&quot;.

Update: Yup. A big bullseye .... Why the United States&#x27; big plan to deploy huge nuclear bombers to the Northern Territory is going to put a &#x27;bullseye&#x27; on Australia as tensions with China rise (Daily Mail).

Daily Mail: Liz Truss&#x27;s Putin radiation terror: Ex-PM spent final days in No10 &#x27;obsessing&#x27; with wind charts and weather forecasts as her fears grew that fallout would hit UK if Putin uses nukes in Ukraine, new look inside her doomed tenure reveals 
* Truss was told Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea 
* Radiation could pose threat to Europe if weapon blew in the direction 
* Ms Truss became fixated with the weather after hearing about possibility 
When Liz Truss was told, during the dying days of her mayfly Premiership, that the security services were picking up intelligence that Vladimir Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine it sent a chill down her spine. 
The Prime Minister was still adjusting to getting used to a new mobile phone number, for the first time in over a decade, as a result of a hack suspected to have been backed or orchestrated by the Kremlin, potentially giving Putin access to information about Western support for President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s regime. 
 In particular, Ms Truss was told that Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea, which would show the West what he was capable of without triggering a full-scale nuclear war.

Jerusalem Post: Israel must get rid of its nuclear weapons, UNGA majority decides 
Israel never admitted to possess nuclear weapons, but nevertheless, the UNGA resolution was aimed at Israel, not Iran.
Israel must dispose of all its nuclear weapons and place its nuclear sites under the International Atomic Energy Agency’s purview, the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee stated in an initial 152-5 vote. 
The five nations that opposed Friday’s resolution on the “risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East” were: Canada, Israel, Micronesia, Palau and the United States. Another 24 countries abstained, including European Union members.

DNYUZ/Newsweek: Putin Should Be Overthrown, Majority of Americans Say: Poll 
A majority of American voters believe seeking to remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power is a “reasonable objective,” according to a new survey conducted exclusively for Newsweek. 
On February 24 Putin ordered his army into Ukraine, triggering one of the biggest wars in Europe since the end of World War II. 
After the Russians initially made significant gains, Ukraine has recaptured some territory over the past couple of months, particularly around the northern city of Kharkiv and Kherson in the south. 
According to the Redfield and Wilton poll, conducted for Newsweek, 60 percent of U.S. voters think seeking to “remove Vladimir Putin from power would be a reasonable objective.”

   CBS News: Republicans head into final week with lead in seats, voters feel things are &quot;out of control&quot; — CBS News Battleground Tracker poll 
The election is already underway; millions have voted, and tens of millions more will before Nov. 8. Amid that, eight in 10 likely voters describe things in the country today as &quot;out of control,&quot; as opposed to &quot;under control.&quot; 
That doesn&#x27;t bode well for the party in power: Republicans are winning those who say &quot;out of control&quot; right now by more than 20 points, though they&#x27;re often the ones feeling that way to begin with.   So where do things stand?

Update #2: It looks like some Governor-ships are flipping Republican .... Governor’s Races Enter Final Sprint on a Scrambled, Surprising Map (New York Times).   
WNU Editor: The CBS/YouGov poll does not say how much of their sample size is Democrat/Republican/Independent. 
FiveThirtyEight says it is a dead heat, but when you look at their map projections it looks like the Republicans are going to pick up a minimum of two seats. 
The New York Times assessment on the governor-ships is blunt. A number of Republican pick-ups.
Bottom line. It is going to be a good night if you are a Republican.</span>

                              <span>In this photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan&#x27;s President Tsai Ing-wen watches soldiers operate equipment during a visit to a naval station on Penghu, an archipelago of several dozen islands off Taiwan&#x27;s western coast on Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2022.

StraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons 
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. 
Defending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. 
Preventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.

WNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.

The same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.</span>
