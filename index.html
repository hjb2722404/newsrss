                              <span>Former Israel Ambassador Dave Sharma says it is “very rare” for an Ambassador to be summoned by a Foreign Minister.

It comes as Australia’s Ambassador will be summoned to Israel to explain the federal government&#x27;s decision to reverse its recognition of West Jerusalem as the nation&#x27;s capital. 

“I think that tells you that this Labor decision took the Israeli government by surprise,” he told Sky News Australia.

“The normal practice if you’re doing something like this is to let your close partners and friends know in advance that such a decision is coming.”</span>

Former Israel Ambassador Dave Sharma says the announcement by Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong yesterday was “a pretty curious and unstructured way to roll out a policy of this importance”.

“Normally, a decision of this magnitude and consequence you’d expect a formal announcement,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“What instead happened was that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade changed the language on their website.”</span>

                              <span>Freshwater Strategy Director Dr Michael Turner says UK Prime Minister Liz Truss’ policy delivery was carried out “too hard, too fast”. 

He said Ms Truss’ tax cuts caught people “off guard” and there didn’t seem to be a “solid plan”. 

“The fallout came not necessarily because the public thought that tax cuts were bad per se, but because the key stakeholders in society … reacted very badly to it, they weren’t informed,” Dr Turner told Sky News Australia. 

“And actually being Prime Minister is as much about the communications as it is about the policy, and you need to bring people with you.”</span>

                              <span>Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says Labor’s decision to reverse the former government’s recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was “completely unnecessary”. 

“This is a completely unnecessary decision by the Albanese government, handled in the most shambolic of ways,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“If we look through what has occurred, at the last election, senior Labor figures, the Attorney-General as he is now and others, reassuring Australia’s Jewish community there was no difference between the parties in relation to their support for Israel and their position on these sorts of matters,” Mr Birmingham said. 

“Then we had leaks coming out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this week, suggesting that there was to be a change in relation to Australia’s recognition of West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital – these were then emphatically denied by Minister Wong’s office itself.
 
“And yet then hours later, we have the Minister coming out and making an announcement there has been a change in position – she did so on a holy day in the Jewish calendar, showing complete disrespect for the Israeli and Jewish communities in particular.”</span>

                              <span>Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham has criticised the manner in which Labor announced its decision to reverse the former government’s recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. 

Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced on Tuesday that Australia’s position has “always been and remains” in Tel Aviv.

Mr Birmingham said Mr Albanese should have “got on the phone” to Israel’s Prime Minister Yair Lapid before the decision was made and “consulted on the decision and advised and informed before it was being publicly announced”. 

“The test now is whether he will get on the phone and apologise for the shambolic way in which it was handled,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.

“He should be apologising for failing to at least show the basic diplomatic courtesies of engagement prior to announcement.”</span>

The warning from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy is the first official signal that Kyiv could be facing a tougher fight for funding as it fends off Russia&#x27;s invasion, with bipartisan support beginning to wane in the United States.
&quot;I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they&#x27;re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won&#x27;t do it,&quot; McCarthy told online politics outlet Punchbowl News.

                              <span>James Bond actor Daniel Craig on Tuesday received the same honor held by his fictional character, as he is set to retire from the role.
The 54-year-old British actor who played Bond for the fifth and final time in 2021 film &quot;No Time To Die&quot;, was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, a rare honor that author Ian Fleming bestowed on his fictional agent.
Craig bowed his head and smirked as Princess Anne, wearing naval uniform, put the order on its ribbon around his neck during an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The actor received the honor for his outstanding contribution to film and theatre.
Craig was in the British capital for the European premiere of whodunnit drama &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;, which closed the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been expecting you&quot;, the royal family&#x27;s official Twitter account captioned its photograph, quoting a line famously used by a Bond villain.
James Bond was said to have received the honor in his obituary in &quot;You Only Live Twice,&quot; Ian Fleming Publications tweeted.
It was not the first time Craig reprised his Bond role with the royal family in on the joke.
He donned a tuxedo to film a spoof clip with Queen Elizabeth II and her corgis for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Games Olympics hosted by London. .

Netanyahu, also commonly known as Bibi, is Israel&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, with a first term from 1996 to 1999 and an unprecedented 12-year stretch until 2021.
In &quot;Bibi: My Story&quot;, the 72-year-old politician said he will be &quot;forever grateful&quot; for the time in opposition that allowed him to complete his memoir, since a motley coalition of parties ousted him but failed to last its term.
Published just two weeks before Israelis go to the polls, the 650-page autobiography has not generated major headlines in Israel or abroad, lacking bombshell revelations offered in some politicians&#x27; memoirs…</span>

                              <span>President Jair Bolsonaro is prompting fears for Brazil’s democratic system by threatening to appoint new judges to the Supreme Court, the central institution to the country’s young democracy. Between the two presidential rounds, Bolsonaro is blowing hot and cold on the issue – making threats to galvanize his base, then backing down to reassure undecided voters. If re-elected, however, the far-right president could well find the numbers to make changes to the court.
The outcome of the bitter contest between Bolsonaro and social democratic ex-president Lula Inacio de Silva is hard to predict, ahead of the second round of Brazil’s presidential election on October 30.
After getting 48 percent of the vote in the first round on October 2, Lula started trying to reach out to evangelical Christian…</span>

The main suspect, identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders, was questioned earlier Monday alongside an older man suspected of sheltering her.
The 24-year-old has been charged with the rape and murder of a minor aged under 15 along with torture and abuse, the source said.
A judge ordered that she be held in provisional custody.
Prosecutors said in a press release Monday that under questioning, the woman made &quot;varying statements, switching between admitting and denying the facts of the case.&quot;
But she eventually said she had brought the girl -- identified only by her first name, Lola -- …</span>

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia&#x27;s Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from &quot;our enemy&quot;, a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament&#x27;s lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.
&quot;Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy,&quot; Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.
Russia uses the term &quot;special military operation&quot; to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.
The move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday&#x27;s session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.
They were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.
Another deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the &quot;special military operation&quot;. He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.
&quot;Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies,&quot; Svintsov said.

Schönbohm, who leads the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), has been under fire for his links to the Cyber Security Council Germany, which itself has been criticized for being too close to Russian intelligence circles.
Schönbohm helped set up the Cyber Security Council Germany 10 years ago.
The reported accusations against Schönbohm had &quot;permanently damaged the necessary trust of the public in the neutrality and impartiality of the leadership of the president of the most important German cybersecurity authority,&quot; the Interior Ministry said.</span>

The government &quot;recommits Australia to international efforts in the responsible pursuit of progress towards a just and enduring two-state solution&quot;, she said in a statement.

The protesters claimed that all the evicted students were women in a move that comes as the Taliban has increasingly restricted girls&#x27; access to education.
&quot;Today&#x27;s protest was for girls who have been expelled,&quot; organizer Zholia Parsi told AFP after Taliban forces dispersed the rally.
Organizers also called for the reopening of girls&#x27; secondary schools, which have been shut since the Taliban returned to power last year.
In several cities, women have staged sporadic protests against harsh restrictions imposed by the hardline Islamists.
The rallies are usually swiftly put down -- often harshly -- and journalists have increasingly been …</span>

PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, asking for higher salaries amid decades-high inflation and posing President Emmanuel Macron one of his stiffest challenges since his reelection in May.
The strike, which will primarily affect public sectors such as schools and transportation, is an extension of the weeks-long industrial action that has disrupted France&#x27;s major refineries and put petrol stations&#x27; supply in disarray.
Trade union leaders are hoping workers will be energized by the government&#x27;s decision to force some of them to go back to work at petrol depots to try and get the fuel flowing again, a move some say put in jeopardy the right to strike.
French government spokesperson Olivier Veran said more requisitions of staff could…</span>

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Russian missile struck an apartment building in the Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv early on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said, the latest strike on a city hours after the United States warned that it would hold Russia accountable for war crimes.
The missile, which caused one of three explosions heard in the southern city in the early hours of Tuesday, completely destroyed one wing of the building in the downtown area, leaving a massive crater.
A fire crew pulled the dead body of a man from the rubble, the witness said.
Monday brought Russian strikes on the capital Kyiv and other cities in which at least four people were killed, the second wave of air strikes in a week.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Moscow on Monday stepped up attacks across Ukraine, cutting electricity and killing eight people, including in kamikaze drone strikes on the capital, as a Russian warplane crashed near the border.
The plane struck a residential area of Yeysk, a town in southwestern Russia, according to Russian authorities.
Health minister Mikhail Murashko said three people had died and 19 were injured, Russia&#x27;s state-run TASS news agency reported, revising an earlier toll of six dead given by the ministry of emergency situations.

Officials said the man was killed near the event in the city&#x27;s Paraisopolis neighborhood, but gave no further details on his identity.

How Liz Truss’s now-abandoned tax proposal is pummeling the British economy — and Conservatives’ grip on power.
 The United Kingdom, not to mention the Conservative Party currently running it, is having a bumpy fall.
So bumpy, in fact, that new Prime Minister Liz Truss is reversing course on Trussonomics, the one signature policy her government had proposed in her just six-week tenure — and apologizing for all the economic turmoil it created.
On Monday, the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a near-complete reversal of Truss’s plan for massive tax cuts aimed at Britain’s weal…</span>

This is the first major update since Ethereum consensus switched to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September after the Mainnet and Beacon chains merged.
Additionally, the upcoming update introduces a basic change to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the technology that powers network smart contracts.

video:

Nicolle Wallace on her MSNBC show Deadline: The White House:
The congressional panel investigating the deadly Capitol riots could issue subpoenas tomorrow to those at the center of a plot to overthrow the election. People who lie about the results are still a threat to democracy to this day. 
The former president himself, Donald Trump. That subpoena promises to increase his legal troubles and dangers. The ones he has faced. There have been numerous investigations into his handling of government records, family businesses and failed attempts to overthrow. It laid the groundwork for a number of major decisions by the Special Committee on January 6. 
How Trump responds to the subpoena will be interesting.Trump may shout witch hunt and try to create a lot of distractions to cover up the fact that he is afraid to appear and testify because Michael Cohen suggested.
The 1/6 committee will likely provide Trump with a live forum where he wants to testify, although reports say the committee doesn’t generally agree on these topics.
Trump’s subpoena day is approaching.
The race will begin immediately as the former president will try to run out of time and avoid testifying.
Either way, once the committee issues the subpoena, pressure on Trump will increase.

The McGraw-Hill Building at 330 W. 42nd St. in Midtown Manhattan is a former print office and loft tower designed by Raymond Hood in a mix of Art Deco and International styles that was completed in 1931.
It’s known for “McGraw-Hill” prominently — and elegantly — spelled out in 11-foot-tall white terracotta letters atop the north and south facades of the 35-story property.
The building itself is a looker, and is also known for its ever-changing color palette that rises.  Of this eye-catching aesthetic, Hood once wrote, “Dutch blue at base, with sea-green window bands, the blue gradually fading to a lighter tone as the building rises , …</span>

European energy planners have crypto miners in their sights along with a myriad of other energy users.
The REPowerEU plan has been announcement in May in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had a profound impact on European energy supplies.  The Russian crisis was an opportunity “to accelerate the clean transition”, the European Commission said.  The “containment of energy consumption of the ICT sector” is an important part of the plan and includes blockchains among the objects of its attention as a subset of data centers.

Former president donald trump is no longer in the White House, but he is still the presumed leader of the Republican Party.  His endorsements have proven key in recent primaries, and his efforts to secure the vote will be key to his party’s success.
Insight into his mindset and way of thinking is invaluable with midterms just three weeks away, and the best way to see what he’s focusing on is his online behavior on TruthSocial Mediawhich, judging by the kind of content it promotes and amplifies, is pretty weird by any objective standard.
For writers and editors who cover political media, Trump’s social media account is a place that will occasionally reveal newsworthy pieces of content, like his 14-page memo. retort to the House Select Committee or nonsense insults at no …</span>

Vote yes to question 2 to ensure dental insurance companies pay for dental care.  We are voting on four issues on the ballot this year.  I am writing to recommend that you vote yes to question 2, which requires insurance companies to spend our dollars on actual dental care, instead of executive salaries, corporate profits, and administration.  I think patient money should be spent on patient care.  A yes vote to question 2 would require dental insurance companies to spend at least 83% of our premiums on members’ dental expenses.  And it would protect against increases in dental premiums above the CPI, unless approved by the state.
My own dental plan has high premiums and many deductibles.  I would feel better knowing that most of the dollars I send to the i…</span>

Democrats here had hoped to tilt the playing field in their favor, but after a Republican lawsuit and a court ruling, the state ended up with a more neutral map for the next decade.  The new lines have already caused heartburn-inducing primaries for Democrats this summer, and could bring more twists in the critical midterm elections in November.

                              <span>President Biden says the conservative Supreme Court majority and extremist Republicans are about to discover women’s political power.
Video of President Biden:

The president said: “With Dobbs’ decision, the court actually dared women to move on, lead, be heard. In my opinion, one of the most unusual parts of the decision was when most wrote, “Women are not without Suffrage or political rights”. Let me tell you one thing. The courts and extreme Republicans have spent decades trying to overthrow Luo. They’ll know in a minute.”
Biden later added: “The only way to stop these extremist laws that endanger women’s health and rights is for Congress to pass a law, I said in court nearly 50 years ago that Roy was right and I believe Congress should codify Roy once and for all.”
Biden said that if more Democrats are elected to the House and Senate, “If we do that, here’s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. When Congress passes it, and I will sign it in January, 50 years after Roy first decided the land law, “Together we will restore the right of choice for every woman on this land.  “
Speaker Pelosi dismisses Andre Mitchell’s GOP talking points on midterms When Mitchell tried to claim that voters were more interested in the economy and crime than choice.
Biden is right. Republicans are about to discover the political power of women who make up the majority of the country, and when they flex their political muscle, the repercussions will be felt across the country.
Polls have consistently underestimated women’s turnout in special elections. If the trend continues on Election Day, the president will be vindicated and Democrats can retain their one or two majorities in Congress.

The plane crashed in the dealership parking lot just after 7 a.m., and the Ohio Highway Patrol said the dealership and some vehicles in the parking lot were damaged.
Officials said no one else was injured.
The 1974 Beechcraft King Air E90 took off from Columbus at 6:35 a.m. for Parkersburg, West Virginia.
Marietta is a town of approximately 13,000 people in southeastern Ohio, located north of Parkersburg on the Ohio River. The dealership is located in the main business district of the town. Some Marietta residents said they were awakened by the crash and saw a cloud of smoke rising into the sky.

The fire at the crash site has been extinguished by firefighters.

                              <span>The U.S. housing market remains in “free fall” after a survey showed a “disastrous” decline in homebuilder confidence, a leading economist warned on Tuesday.
Homebuilder confidence plunged for the 10th consecutive month in October, falling to its lowest level since 2012, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ monthly survey.  The last downtick came like mortgage rates have reached low levels not seen since the Great Recession.
The survey results were “disastrous” and indicated there was “no bottom yet” for the current housing market slump, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
“The fall in the NAHB index makes it clear that the reported jump in new home sales in September was much more noise than signal,” Shepherdson said in a note to cl…</span>

The proof of stake (PoS) blockchain has seen millions of investments from venture capitalists and previously claimed the ability to process 160,000 transactions per second (TPS).
However, some community members have pointed out that the claimed TPS is well below expectations on the mainnet.
According to the Aptos blockchain explorer, the network is seeing around 4 TPS at the time of writing, while some Twitter users have reported not being able to send transactions.
Others on Twitter noticed Aptos Discord was shut down for a few hours after the mainnet launched, accusing the team of trying to shut down discussions abou…</span>

He’s a wizard on the basketball court, at least. 

For the Brooklyn Nets (when he’s playing), Irving is one of the toughest players to keep.  It’s lightning fast, can stop and start in no time, and has an unparalleled layup package.  He’s literally what kids call these days, “a walking bucket.” 

But something happened to the New Jersey native.  It’s something that can happen to anyone when they go too far down the rabbit hole and can’t find their way back. 

The NBA champion has apparently become the Black Alex Jones.

Or playing basketball Dr Umar Johnson.

Irving is a conspiracy theorist who has read a few books that aren’t even that deep into the conspiracy theory playbook.  Then he started spouting nonsensical, ill-informed “hotepian” nonsense (think “Harr…</span>

“I have always opposed my party to opposing reckless spending. I will do it again and again. We need people who say no,” the Republican said in his second term. 
Lee has repeatedly pointed to his voting record and twice told the Utah Valley University audience that he voted less in line with Trump than all but two Republican senators – Rand Paul and Susan Collins. 

“To suggest that I’m indebted to either party, that I’ve been a bootlicker for either party, is crazy. And it’s contradicted by the simple facts,” Lee said.

                              <span>Australian Financial Review Special Correspondent Misha Zelinsky has discussed Russia’s recent drone strikes on the regions of Kyiv, Dnipro and Sumy which killed at least eight people in total. 

The drones appear to be Iranian-made ‘kamikaze’ drones. 

“What you are seeing increasingly now, as Russia is losing the war on the battlefield, you’re seeing what I describe as temper tantrum-type attacks designed to terrorise ordinary Ukrainians and also make their lives more difficult as we head into winter,” Mr Zelinksy told Sky News Australia. 

“They want to try to freeze Ukraine (sic) in their homes -inability to have electricity on, inability to heat your home – you can imagine what that would be like in a Ukrainian winter.”</span>

                              <span>Foreign Minister Penny Wong has taken a dig at former prime minister Scott Morrison’s attempt to “play politics” as she reversed the former government’s recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

She said Australia’s embassy has “always been and remains” in Tel Aviv and Australia remains committed to a two-state solution. 

“I would say that Mr Morrison’s decision to play politics … resulted in Australia shifting position,” Ms Wong said during a media conference. 

“I know that this has caused conflict and distress in certain parts of the Australian community and today the government seeks to resolve that.”</span>

An LA-based Netflix consultant told The US Sun the Sussexes are &quot;in a tricky place right now&quot;.

It comes after Netflix executives were reportedly “confused” that Prince Harry and Meghan&#x27;s upcoming docuseries “contradicted what Harry has written” in his tell-all memoir.</span>

(Reuters) - The United States and Mexico said on Monday they will seek support from the United Nations for a security mission to restore order in Haiti amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, but did not identify who would lead the mission.
Haiti is facing dire shortages of basic goods and a paralysis of economic activity due to the blockade of a fuel terminal by gangs, which has halted transport and left many without food or clean drinking water amid an outbreak of cholera.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month suggested sending in a &quot;rapid-action force,&quot; according to a letter seen by Reuters.

                              <span>During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. 
The Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. 
“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”
The official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”
The FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn&#x27;t visit them personally. 
&quot;The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”
“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.”

                              <span>The United States said Monday that it had confidence in Pakistan&#x27;s ability to control its nuclear arsenal after President Joe Biden expressed alarm, leading Islamabad to summon the US ambassador.
&quot;The United States is confident of Pakistan&#x27;s commitment and its ability to secure its nuclear assets,&quot; State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
&quot;The US has always viewed a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests and, more broadly, the US values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan,&quot; he said.
Biden made the off-the-cuff remarks on Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program Thursday while at a private Democratic Party fundraiser in California where he began to discuss challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China, a close ally of Pakistan.
&quot;And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion,&quot; Biden said, according to a White House transcript.
Pakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a &quot;responsible nuclear state&quot; and that it takes safety measures &quot;with the utmost seriousness.&quot;
US officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden&#x27;s remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.
But Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.
Patel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.
&quot;This is a relationship we view as important and it&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re going to continue to remain deeply engaged in,&quot; he said.</span>

Major&#x27;s tenure as prime minister from 1990-1997 covered a turbulent period for the royals that included the divorce of Charles and his wife Princess Diana.
But reported scenes in the fifth series -- defended by streaming giant Netflix as a &quot;fictionalized dramatization&quot; -- have incensed the former premier.
In one scene, heir to the throne Charles attempts to draw Major into a conspiracy to force the abdication of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.
A statement issued by Major&#x27;s office castigated Netflix for the scenes describing them as &quot;damaging and malicious fiction&quot;.

                              <span>Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.
In an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned &quot;peace plan&quot; between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine&#x27;s continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.
&quot;This is a classic Putin play,&quot; she said of Musk&#x27;s recent attempts to interject himself as a &quot;peacemaker&quot; between Russia and Ukraine. &quot;Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.&quot;
Hill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.

&quot;He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process,&quot; she explained. &quot;He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.&quot;

Possible charges include the rape and murder of a minor aged below 15 along with torture, abuse and concealing a body, a source in the French judiciary told AFP, adding that prosecutors had ordered two people held in provisional custody.
The main suspect has been identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders.
She was arrested on Saturday in Bois-Colombes in Paris&#x27; northwestern suburbs, after being spotted on CCTV images from the block of flats home to the young victim, identified only by her first name, Lola.

                              <span>Russian-launched &quot;kamikaze drones&quot; attacked Kyiv early Monday, the Ukrainian presidency said, describing the strikes as an act of desperation nearly eight months into a war that has claimed thousands of lives.
Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv shortly before the first explosion at around 6:35 am (0335), followed by sirens across most of the country.
&quot;The capital was attacked by kamikaze drones,&quot; the president&#x27;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.
&quot;The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation,&quot; he added.
&quot;We need more air defense systems and as soon as possible. More weapons to defend the sky and destroy the enemy.&quot;
The attacks come exactly a week after Russia unleashed a massive wave of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital and cities across the coun…</span>

                              <span>When Liz Truss was running to lead Britain this summer, an ally predicted her first weeks in office would be turbulent.
But few were prepared for the scale of the sound and fury – least of all Truss herself.
In just six weeks, the prime minister’s libertarian economic policies have triggered a financial crisis, emergency central bank intervention, multiple U-turns and the firing of her Treasury chief.
Now Truss faces a mutiny inside the governing Conservative Party that leaves her leadership hanging by a thread.
Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon fumed on Sunday that the last few weeks had brought “one horror story after another.”
“The government has looked like libertarian jihadists and treated the whole country as kind of laboratory mice on which to carry out ultra, ultra free-market ex…</span>

&quot;We are astonished by the accusations that the kingdom is standing with Russia in its war with Ukraine,&quot; the Saudi defense minister, Prince Khaled bin Salman, tweeted late Sunday.
The Saudi-led OPEC+ cartel -- which includes Russia -- has angered Washington by deciding to cut production by two million barrels per day from November, adding further pressure on soaring crude prices.

EU border agency Frontex confirmed to AFP the arrival of the group in circumstances which the Greek ministry for civil protection said sent out an &quot;inhuman image.&quot;
&quot;The Frontex officers reported that the migrants were found almost naked and some of them with visible injuries,&quot; said Paulina Bakula, spokeswoman for the organization.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet that it was &quot;deeply distressed by the shocking reports and images of 92 people, who were reported to have been found at the Greek-Turkish land border, stripped of their clothes&quot;.

Stormy US-Saudi relations have seen new strain over Riyadh&#x27;s recent support for oil production cuts, with Biden warning of unspecified &quot;consequences.&quot;
The move last week by OPEC+ -- composed of the Riyadh-led OPEC cartel and an additional group of 10 exporters headed by Russia -- would reduce global output by up to two million barrels per day from November.
It could send energy prices soaring amid an energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, and as inflation-weary American voters prepare to cast ballots in midterm elections.

Lula attacked Bolsonaro as the &quot;king of fake news,&quot; drawing accusations of lying, corruption and a &quot;disgraceful&quot; record in return, as the rivals sparred in the first debate for their polarizing second-round showdown on October 30.
Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-president (2003-2010) who is seeking a comeback at 76, was particularly fiery criticizing Bolsonaro over his handling of Covid-19, which has killed 687,000 people in Brazil, second only to the United States.

Near the southern border with Equatorial Guinea, eight villages have registered complaints with the Campo Ma&#x27;an national park, a vast area of virgin forest from where the animals emerge.
An estimated 500 gorillas and more than 200 elephants -- both endangered species -- roam the reserve&#x27;s 264,000 hectares (652,000 acres).
A week after elephants flattened his banana plantation close by the park, Simplice Yomen, 47, is struggling to cope.

                              <span>In a bold restaurant move to the Upper East Side, Campagnola – an “Italian country restaurant” at 1382 First Ave.  for nearly 40 years – has moved from its apartment building to the modern Impala condo tower two blocks north at 1456 First Ave., where its new owner will be Aby Rosen’s RFR Realty.
It’s a great change of venue for Campagnola, which has long attracted celebrities, politicians and senior law enforcement officials entering through a rustic front room with a vaulted ceiling.  The menu’s hearty southern and northern Italian dishes are suited to the “country” theme and “meant to be shared,” its website says.  
But the president of Meridian Retail Leasing, James Famularo, who negotiated the lease for Campagnola owner Curt Huegel said Huegel “relyed on a talented designer, Delphine Mauroit, owner of DMDesign &amp; Architecture, to capture the soul and vibe of the original” – possibly including the original bar, furniture and artwork.
The new space in a former yoga studio at the base of the tower will have 3,400 “perfect L-shaped” square feet on the ground, Famularo said, plus 2,000 square feet in the basement.  The configuration allows the dining room to occupy the entire ground floor.
He couldn’t discuss the terms due to a nondisclosure agreement.  The move is expected to take place in about nine months.
The owner was replaced by Brandon Singer of MONA leasing, a brokerage firm backed by RFR.
Huegel’s company, Host Restaurants, owns several major locations in and out of town.  Among them is the Sefton Bar/Lounge opposite the original Campagnola – a lease which Famularo also managed.
Huegel was always known for restaurantsnot for the bars – but Famularo said he got the idea from Sefton when he noticed many Campagnola customers were looking for drinks nearby while waiting for their tables.

The laws would give police more powers to break up demonstrations and arrest protesters.

                              <span>Former DFAT Australia-China Council scholar Andrew Phelan says the US sanctions recently imposed on the export of high-end computer chips to China have had a “dramatic” and immediate effect on manufacturing in the country. 

The Biden administration recently announced a set of controls that restrict the export of advanced chips, chipmaking equipment and design software created with technology from the United States. 

“Every American engineering executive involved in the chip manufacturing, chip industry in China has resigned, effectively immediately,” Mr Phelan told Sky News Australia. 

“And ASML, the Dutch supplier of the capital equipment that is used in making high-end chips has ceased servicing its Chinese customers. 

“So … I think the Americans anticipated the third term, they were worried about China’s advances in chips, in artificial intelligence, in weaponizing these things, so they have stepped in, in what is the biggest I think US move against China in the last several years.”</span>

                              <span>India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has revealed India’s plans to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for cryptocurrencies during its G20 Presidency, from December 1, 2022 to November 30, 2023.
Sitharaman has already called for global collaboration to decide the future of crypto and has been cautious against mainstream crypto adoption citing financial stability risks.  However, speaking to local Indian journalists on October 15, she confirmed, “This (crypto) will also be part of India’s business (agenda during the G20 presidency).
The G20, or Group of Twenty, is a global forum for addressing major issues related to the global economy.  According to Sitharaman, no country alone can effectively manage or regulate crypto, adding that:

“But if it’s platforms, asset exchanges that have been created, buying and selling making profits and most importantly, these countries are able to understand the trade of money, are we able to establish for what purpose it is used?

Sitharaman further pointed to the use of crypto assets in money laundering, detected by India’s law enforcement agency, the Enforcement Directorate. 
She added that G20 members have also acknowledged the same concerns while reiterating the need for all countries to participate when it comes to effectively regulating crypto assets.
