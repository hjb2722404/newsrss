                              <span>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has extended her lead over fellow candidate Rishi Sunak in the bid for UK’s top job as prime minister after a poll of Conservative Party members revealed she was the strong favourite. 

The poll showed 62 per cent of Tory members would vote for Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and 38 per cent would go for Mr Sunak.  

“The thing about me is what you see is what you get,” Ms Truss said. 

“I’ve always been honest with people about what I can deliver, I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I will completely level with the public about, first of all, how tough things are going to be. 

“But also, the hope that they can have about the future because I have a positive vision for Britain, and I will be helping families immediately with the cost of living.”</span>

“I think the US-Australia partnership is really my focus and the work that we do together in the region, security, economic engagement, climate change, health security, all of those things,” she said during a media conference on Friday following her arrival in Australia. 

“So I think that China certainly is a big presence here in the region, but I think our partnership is what I’ll be focused on.”</span>

                              <span>Chinese officials have claimed Australia&#x27;s AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom and the United States is an attempt to get nuclear weapons - a claim which has been rejected by Canberra. 

The security deal between the three countries will allow the Royal Australian Navy to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in the future. 

Beijing will take its argument to a high-level meeting at the United Nations next month in a 32-page report, which a spokesperson for the Chinese government says gives “detailed statistics and facts” for China&#x27;s campaign against the security deal between Australia and its allies.</span>

                              <span>Europe is the latest place to succumb to higher interest rates, with the European Central Bank overnight raising its cash rate by half a per cent. 

Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood said the bank has taken its cash rate back to zero. 

“That’s a far cry from, as you can see, where they had been previously,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“The grave fear right now is that there is another recession on the way; that’s the reason the European Central Bank acted overnight.”</span>

Sputnik: Scoop: NATO Doesn’t Trust Ukraine With HIMARS, Operating Advanced Artillery Themselves, Source Says 
The US has delivered 12 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine, and the Pentagon announced Wednesday that Washington would soon send at least four more in the near future. The Russian military and the Donbass People’s Militias have accused Kiev of using the installations to strike civilian areas. 
The HIMARS mobile artillery operating Ukraine are manned by outstaffed career NATO military personnel, and information regarding the advanced weapons systems’ operation is not being transferred to the Ukrainian side due to a lack of trust, a Russian security source has told Sputnik, citing intelligence received from sources inside the Ukrainian military.

WNU Editor: A lot of bombshells in the above report. 
NATO does not trust Ukraine to operate these weapons. Manned by &quot;out-staffed career NATO military personnel?!?!?!? Guarded by private military contractors close to the Pentagon?!?!?! Targets are being selected by US intelligence and US military personnel. 
I do not know if this report is true, but Russian media and the Russian government do believe it is true. That NATO is now directly engaged on the ground against Russian forces in Ukraine.</span>

RT: Russia warns it could stop oil exports 
Foreign crude sales could be suspended if US-driven scheme succeeds, top official says 
 Russia will stop global oil exports if the West’s proposed price cap makes it unprofitable to continue production, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday. 
“If these prices which they are talking about are lower than the costs for oil production… naturally, Russia will not ensure the supply of this oil to the world markets, which means that we simply will not work at a negative profit,” he explained, as cited by TASS.

As to what will be the consequences if Russia halts its oil exports? This energy consulting group is making this dire prediction .... Price cap on Russian oil is a ‘ridiculous idea’ and could push oil to $140, says energy research group (CNBC).

Politico: Pelosi to Blinken: Label Russia as terrorist state, or else Congress will  
Her comments highlight the chasm in the actions lawmakers want the administration to take and what the secretary is comfortable doing.  
Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a message for Secretary of State Antony Blinken: Designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism — otherwise, Congress will. 
The warning, made on a call between the two earlier this week, was described to POLITICO by two sources familiar with the conversation. Spokespersons for the State Department and Pelosi’s office declined to comment. 
Congress gave the power to label another country as a state sponsor of terrorism to the secretary of state. Some in Congress, though, say lawmakers could pass a law to make the designation without the State Department, thus pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin on their own.

In a letter led by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to Secretary of Defense Llyod Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, a bipartisan group of six senators urged the Department of Defense to &quot;consider fourth-generation fighter aircraft and necessary flight training&quot; to be included in upcoming military aid packages.

* There had been concerns across the region that there could be a complete shutdown of gas supplies via the pipeline after it was closed earlier this month for maintenance. 
* Data on operator Nord Stream’s website showed that flows increased from zero to 29,284,591 kWh/h for 0600-0700 Central European Time Thursday. 
* On July 10, the last day of operations before the maintenance work began, flows were at roughly the same level, just above the 29,000,000 kWh/h. 
The operator of Nord Stream 1, a key gas pipeline which runs from Russia to Germany, said Thursday it was in the process of resuming flows to Europe.

Rome, Italy (CNN)Italy&#x27;s President Sergio Mattarella dissolved parliament on Thursday, triggering a snap election following the resignation of the country&#x27;s Prime Minister Mario Draghi earlier in the day. 
Mattarella branded the move &quot;inevitable&quot; following the political upheaval faced by the European Union&#x27;s third largest economy over the last 24 hours. 
Thanking Draghi and his ministers &quot;for their efforts over the past 18 months,&quot; Mattarella said in a short address from his Quirinale Palace in Rome.

WNU editor: Former Italian Premier Mario Draghi looks happy and relieved that he is no longer running the government. It makes you wonder if the reason why he is happy to now be out of power is because he knows how difficult and rough the coming months are going to be for Italy, and for the EU has a whole. 
As to who is poised to take power after elections? If polls continue to hold, it looks like this group will take power, and if they do it will be a geo-political earthquake for Italy and in the EU as a whole .... Italy’s far right celebrate Draghi’s downfall and look poised to take power (The Guardian).

* Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove 
* A whopping 71 percent of Americans do not want to see Biden run again in 2024 - including a majority of Democrats, 54 percent 
* The findings contrast with support for Donald Trump on the Republican side - 69 percent of Republicans said they want to see him run again in 2024 
* Republicans in Congress scored even worse than Biden by the Quinnipiac poll, where 23 percent of respondents approved, 68 percent disapproved 
More Americans are unhappy with President Biden&#x27;s job in office than at any point in his presidency, according to a dim new Quinnipiac poll. 
Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove. 
Among registered voters, 33 percent said they approved while 59 percent disapprove.   The low approval spelled bad news for Biden&#x27;s 2024 prospects.

What caught my eye in this poll is that Congressional Democrats ( a negative 30 - 63 percent job approval rating) are polling better than Congressional Republicans (a negative 23 - 68 percent job approval rating). Maybe the Democrats will keep control of Congress after this year&#x27;s midterms?</span>

Bill Burns says China ‘unsettled’ by Russia’s war in Ukraine and it may influence decisions on the possible use of force against Taiwan  Russia’s experience in Ukraine is affecting China’s calculations on how and when it may decide to invade Taiwan, the head of the CIA said on Wednesday. 
Appearing at the Aspen Security Forum, Central Intelligence Agency director Bill Burns played down speculation that Chinese president Xi Jinping could move on Taiwan after a key Communist party meeting later this year. 
“The risks of that become higher, it seems to us, the further into this decade that you get,” Burns said, adding: “I wouldn’t underestimate President Xi’s determination to assert China’s…</span>

ABC News Australia: CIA estimates about 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine war  
Around 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and a further 45,000 have been wounded in the war in Ukraine, the United States believes. 
CIA director William Burns said Russia&#x27;s efforts to occupy about a fifth of Ukraine had come at a great cost for both countries. 
&quot;The latest estimates from the US intelligence community would be something in the vicinity of 15,000 [Russian forces] killed, and maybe three times that wounded,&quot; he said.

WNU Editor: The CIA Director gives out the Russian casualty number, but he admits in his interview that this is an estimate, and no one really knows what the real number. Translation. He does not know. 
The BBC did a thorough analysis on the number of Russian military casualties a few weeks ago, and their estimate is around 4,000 .... War in Ukraine: Can we say how many people have died? (BBC). This number does not included casualties among Chechen and separatist forces (who have been doing a great deal of the ground fighting since April). 
My sources in Russia tell me that the BBC number is about right, and if you include Chechen and separatist forces the number is around 10,000. 
Ukraine also does not report its casualties. But the numbers that I hear from my sources in Ukraine that I trust are shocking, and I am going to wait until there is an official statement before posting it here.

William Burns&#x27; comment is a blow to Putin&#x27;s critics who believed the Russian leader was ill.   Vladimir Putin is “entirely too healthy,” CIA Director William Burns said Wednesday, throwing cold water on constant rumors that the Russian president is suffering from illness as he pursues his war on Ukraine. 
Burns, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, noted that his declaration was “not a formal intelligence judgment.” Still, given his position, Burns’ comment could help dampen hopes among Putin’s adversaries that the Russian’s demise is near.

(Kitco News) - Ukraine&#x27;s Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova confirmed that the nation sold around $12 billion worth of gold during Russia&#x27;s invasion of the nation. 
She said, &quot;We are selling (this gold) so that our importers are able to buy necessary goods for the country,&quot;  The situation has shown no signs of improving, and the war could be a long, drawn-out process. 
This scenario is something Ukrainian President Zelensky wanted to avoid. Foreign nations are reluctant to step into Ukraine and help as it could escalate the situation. Instead, they have committed to continue to arm the Ukrainian efforts from afar.

                              <span>The trailers for Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” one of the summer’s most anticipated movies, have raised some intriguing questions.  Is it a western?  Horror movie?  science fiction?  Satire?  Will it live up to the expectations raised by Peele’s first two jaw-dropping surf features, “Get Out” and “We,” or confuse them?
I can now report that the answer to all of these questions is: Yeah.  That is to say, there are fascinating internal tensions in the film, as well as impeccably managed suspense, sharp jokes, and a seductively unnerving atmosphere of general weirdness.
“Nope” seems less polemical than “Us” or “Get Out”, more at ease in its idiosyncrasies and flights of imagination even if it follows, in the end, a more conventional narrative path.  This might be cause for some disappointment, since…</span>

Profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, Tesla said, up from $3.3 billion in the first quarter, which was a record.  Sales fell to $16.9 billion from $18.8 billion in the first quarter.
The automaker was also hit by a sharp drop in Bitcoin price.  Tesla said in early 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency.  The company said on Wednesday that it had sold around 75% of its Bitcoin by the end of June.


Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profit almost doubled.  And earnings for the quarter beat analysts’ estimates.  But because Tesla is a fast-growing company, its progress, o…</span>

This indicator is called the yield curve, and it is a way of showing how the interest rates of various US government bonds compare., including three-month treasury bills and two- and ten-year treasury bills.
Usually, bond investors expect to be paid more for tying up their money for a long time, so interest rates on short-term bonds are lower than those on longer-term bonds.  Plotted on a graph, the different bond yields create an upward sloping line – the curve. 


But from time to time, short-term rates exceed long-term rates.  This negative relationship distorts the curve into what is called an inversion and signals that the norm…</span>

“We were unable to provide enough staff for this remote restaurant,” Laurie Schalow, the company’s director of general affairs, said in a statement.

                              <span>The White House has been forced to make an embarrassing clarification after US President Joe Biden said he has cancer during a speech in Somerset, Massachusetts.

During his remarks, President Biden was describing the fumes emitted from the oil refineries near his childhood home in Claymont, Delaware.

&quot;That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer and why for the longest time Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation,” President Biden said.

The White House was forced to make a quick clarification, stating that Mr Biden was referring to the non-melanoma skin cancers he had removed before his presidency.</span>

                              <span>Sri Lanka has elected former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as its new President.

However, the decision has not gone down well with protesters.  

Many in Sri Lanka consider Mr Wickremesinghe as a close associate of the Rajapaksa family, who they blame for the country’s economic crisis. 

On the spot where presidents are normally sworn in, protest leaders demanded Mr Wickremesinghe’s removal.  

“We will not stop this protest until Ranil Wickremesinghe is stepped down from the presidency and we get a president … the whole country can accept as one president,” a protester said.</span>

Mr Biden was discussing the effects of oil refinery emissions when he indicated he had cancer.

“The fact that he said he had cancer very clearly too, I think, is part of a general decline of his cognitive ability,” Mr Creighton told Sky News Australia. 

“In the 14-15 months I’ve been following his remarks closely, it’s getting worse and worse.”</span>

European countries are being asked to curb their consumption of natural gas by at least 15% until next spring, as part of a wider plan to deal with reduced supplies from Russia. 
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, on Wednesday presented a strategy on how countries can prepare for the winter period, when their energy needs are much higher. 
The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant, Gazprom, claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc — a major headache for European nations given they have been so dependent on Russian energy before the invasion of Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The situation is becoming incredibly difficult in Europe. Implementing a 15% reduction in the consumption of natural gas will not only be difficult to maintain, but near impossible if Europe experiences a severe and cold winter.

   Politico: European Commission sets out joint weapon-purchase plan 
Aim is to replenish stocks of arms after many EU countries supplied Ukraine 
The European Commission laid out plans Tuesday that will allow European Union nations to jointly purchase weapons, amid growing appeals from Ukraine for more military support in their pushback against Russian forces. 
The initiative will allow the EU to replenish arms that have already been provided to Ukraine, the Commission’s Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said.

Vladimir Putin was snubbed by Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who left him twiddling his thumbs in front of TV cameras during a summit in Iran yesterday. 
The Russian leader was holding face-to-face talks with his sometimes-ally in Tehran on Tuesday for the first time since ordering the invasion of Ukraine back in February.

 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said geopolitics today requires “Nixonian flexibility” to help defuse conflicts between the US and China as well as between Russia and the rest of Europe. 
While warning that China shouldn’t become a global hegemon, the man who helped reestablish US-China ties in the 1970s said that President Joe Biden should be wary of letting domestic politics interfere with “the importance of understanding the permanence of China.” 
“Biden and previous administrations have been too much influenced by the domestic aspects of the view of China,” Kissinger, 99, said in an interview Tuesday in New York with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “It is, of course, important to prevent Chinese or any other country’s hegemony.”

DW: How Ukrainian men try to get around the ban to leave the country 
Ukraine ordered a ban on men leaving the country at the beginning of the war, with few exceptions. Increasingly, however, men who want out are finding means and ways, often at a price. 
Anton (name has been changed) was a businessman in Ukraine. On February 24, he drove to the border with his wife and their two children to escape the Russian invasion. The trip, which usually takes only a few hours, took them almost the entire day. 
But while they were still en route, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country.

On a side note. My friends in Poland are telling me that the flow of refugees from Ukraine is non-stop, but now many men of military-age are entering the country.</span>

DNYUZ/New York Times: Putin signals Russian gas will resume in a key pipeline but at a reduced level. 
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested late Tuesday that natural gas would resume flowing to Europe after the Nord Stream 1 pipeline’s maintenance shutdown, but warned that supplies may be severely curtailed. 
Speaking to reporters in Tehran after meeting with the leaders of Iran and Turkey, Mr. Putin said that shipments via Nord Stream 1 had been hampered by repairs necessary for turbines made by the German company Siemens. 
Even before the pipeline was shut down on July 11 for annual maintenance, flows from Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, had been reduced to only 40 percent capacity.

Ukraine wants to be an arena in which more-powerful nations prove out weapons in real-world combat against Russian forces.   Ukraine is openly offering itself as a venue for NATO allies to donate and demonstrate advanced weaponry in real-world combat scenarios. 
The countries would then benefit from the combat experience of Ukrainian soldiers using those weapons against Russian forces, according to Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.  Ukraine “is essentially a testing ground,” Reznikov said on July 19 during a live webcast conversation with John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center. 
The entire interview can be viewed in the below video.

                              <span>Defense One: Ukraine Says It Needs at Least 100 HIMARS and Longer-Range Rockets    
More mobile artillery rocket systems, drones, and longer-range rockets would be a “game changer” said top Ukrainian defense official. 
The recent addition of new long-range fires capabilities to Ukraine’s arsenal has played a key role in defending against stalled Russian forces. 
But additional mobile rocket batteries and longer-range rockets would allow Ukraine to mount more effective counter attacks and reclaim territory stolen by Russia, Oleksii Reznikov, minister of defense of Ukraine, said Tuesday. 
Ukraine currently has eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, able to strike ranges of 85 kilometers or 52 miles, as well asf Howitzer cannons with a range of 18 miles. Another four HIMARS are on the way as of last week, according to the Defense Department, and the White House expects to announce another shipment later this week. 
Speaking at an Atlantic Council event Tuesday, Reznikov said the HIMARS had already helped Ukraine destroy approximately 30 Russian command stations, as well as ammunition storage areas.

Daily Mail: Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Ukraine and the West will face a &#x27;Judgement Day&#x27; response should they attempt to militarily dispute Russia&#x27;s control of Crimea. 
* Medvedev said a Western or Ukrainian attack on Crimea would see a major retort 
* Russia illegally annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 
* &#x27;Judgement Day come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide,&#x27; he said 
* Comments came a day after a Ukrainian military intelligence official said Kyiv could hit targets in Crimea with U.S.-made HIMARS missiles 
Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Ukraine and the West will face a &#x27;Judgement Day&#x27; response should they attempt to militarily dispute Russia&#x27;s control of Crimea. 
The refusal of Ukraine and Western powers to recognise Moscow&#x27;s ownership of the peninsula poses a &#x27;systemic threat&#x27; for Russia, the former president said yesterday, before declaring the Kremlin would hit back with maximum force if the territory is attacked. 
&#x27;Judgement Day come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide,&#x27; he announced, according to Russia&#x27;s TASS news agency.

Reuters: Ukraine wants to avoid winter war, says top presidential aide  
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine&#x27;s top presidential aide said on Tuesday that Ukraine does not want the war to last into winter, as this would give Russian forces time to dig in and make any Ukrainian counter-offensive more difficult. 
 In an interview with Ukrainian magazine NV, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy&#x27;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak expressed hopes that the U.S. arms lend-lease to Ukraine will provide a sufficient quantity of weapons before winter to allow Ukrainian troops to achieve &quot;victory&quot; before then. 
&quot;It is very important for us not to enter the winter. After winter, when the Russians will have more time to dig in, it will certainly be more difficult,&quot; Yermak said.

There are also a lot of reports (from the Ukrainian side) that the U.S. has indicated to Kyiv that should the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk fall, followed by the fall of Donetsk oblast, Washington will be re-evaluating its commitment to supporting Ukraine in this war. 
This probably explains why Ukrainian President Zelensky has ordered  the town of Siversk, which Russia needs to capture Donetsk, to be hold at all costs. Needless to say I have been hearing and reading of heavy loses for the Ukrainians in their attempt to hold onto this piece of territory.
Russia is also intensifying their attacks in the southern part of Ukraine, with heavy casualties being reported on both sides.</span>

                              <span>I like to say that New York City is known for being a beach town.  It certainly has more beach access than where I grew up – Atlanta’s landlocked metro;  that you can get to most of these beaches by metro, bus, bike or ferry, even better.
You don’t need the help of someone familiar with the city’s 22 km of public beaches to have a perfect day.  But I recently enjoyed a tour from a dedicated guide around Brighton Beach, and was looking forward to sharing it with you all.

For starters, there are plenty of ways to get to Brighton Beach.  My friend and guide Will Ferst, a freelance writer and food writing instructor, prefers to cycle down Ocean Parkway, which has a relatively shady bike path.  I rode along the Belt P…</span>

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, endorsed the recommendation of a panel of vaccine experts who had unanimously approved the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.  The decision removes the final regulatory hurdle for the fourth Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the United States.
The Novavax vaccine is expected to play a limited role in the country’s vaccination campaign, at least initially.  Last week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized it as a primary vaccination for adults, but has not yet considered it for a booster shot.

You’ll find pintxo bars littered with waxy paper napkins and people munching on savory two-bite snacks, like croquetas or Spanish tortillas, on a slice of bread and skewered with a toothpick;  and sidrerías (cider bars) nestled in the verdant mountains, with patrons slicing into a forearm-sized fire-grilled steak while sipping sparkling natural cider.

* &quot;That might seem hard to believe,&quot; Stanovaya said, &quot;But it&#x27;s what the Kremlin seems to believe.&quot; 
* But Putin will likely become &quot;most dangerous&quot; if his perspective shifts and he believes he&#x27;s losing. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin believes his forces are winning the nearly five-month war in Ukraine, despite failing to take Kyiv and suffering heavy troop losses, according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
In an op-ed for the New York Times, Stanovaya warned that Putin will become &quot;most dangerous&quot; when…</span>

                              <span>19FortyFive: Why Do We Keep Listening to the ‘TV’ Generals on Ukraine? 
Listening to television commentary and interviews of retired U.S. generals, one would be forgiven for believing Russia is on the ropes, and Ukraine was winning the war. Looking at on-the-ground battlefield reality in Ukraine, however, it quickly becomes apparent that the generals’ boasts continue a decade-long trend of rosy combat proclamations that all too often turn out to be disastrously wrong. American media, Congress, and the public need to start applying a little more scrutiny to what these officers say.

WNU Editor: The best part of this commentary is the last paragraph .... 
.... The danger in these types of statements is that they give false hope to the people of Ukraine, give an inaccurate picture to the American people of what’s possible, and encourages Congress to continue funding a strategy that almost certainly will fail.  
Could not have said it any better.</span>

Reuters: EU to Soften Sanctions on Russian Banks to Allow Food Trade 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will amend its sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday by allowing the unfreezing of some funds of top Russian banks that may be required to ease bottlenecks in the global trade of food and fertilisers, a draft document showed. 
The move comes amid criticism from African leaders about the negative impact of the sanctions on the trade, which may have exacerbated shortages chiefly caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and its blockading of ports in the Black Sea.

Update #2: EU to soften sanctions on Russian banks to allow food trade (FOX News)   
WNU Editor: This is a major reversal of sanctions, and one that I ma sure Ukraine is not happy with. 
So why the move to help Russian banks now? 
IMHO the &quot;softening&quot; of these sanctions is to not only to allow the trade of food and fertilizer, but to also dissuade any Russian move to make customers for its food and fertilizers pay in rubles thereby undermining the value of the euro even further.</span>
