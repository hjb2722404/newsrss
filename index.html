                              <span>A Trump 2.0 White House term would reportedly launch a wrecking ball into U.S. foreign policy — altering or even doing away altogether with decades long foreign policy mainstays. That purported plan includes a radical NATO makeover and an expedited accord to end the Russia-Ukraine war. 
Bloomberg News reported that former President Donald Trump is entertaining stripping the forged ties with some NATO countries, specifically establishing a two-tiered NATO alliance model.
It would mean that the charter&#x27;s Article 5 — which obligates all members in the alliance to defend any member under siege — would have to pony up and meet their defense-spending benchmarks, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s cited sources.

&quot;Faced with record numbers of illegal crossings at the Mexico border and mounting criticism from his own party,&quot; The Washington Post reports, &quot;Biden has deployed ICE officers more aggressively and ramped up deportation flights in recent months.

                              <span>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty on Wednesday by a Paris appeals court of illegal campaign financing over his failed 2012 re-election bid, confirming a previous ruling by a lower court.
He was sentenced to one-year year prison sentence, half of which is suspended, that can be served through alternative means like wearing an electronic bracelet without going to jail.

Sarkozy had been handed a one-year prison sentence in 2021 when first found guilty, though that was suspended while he launched his appeal.
Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, remained an influential figure among conservatives and is on friendly terms with President Emmanuel Macron - despite a string of trials and investigations linked to various legal issues surrounding his campaign finances.
He has always denied accusations that his party Les Republicains, then known as the UMP, worked with a public relations firm named Bygmalion to hide the true cost of his campaign - marked by lavish show events previously unseen in French politics. 
During a hearing, Sarkozy put the blame on some members of his campaign team: &quot;I didn&#x27;t choose any supplier, I didn&#x27;t sign any quotation, any invoice,&quot; he told the court.
France sets strict limits on campaign spending. Prosecutors allege that the firm invoiced UMP rather than the campaign. They say Sarkozy spent 42.8 million euros on his 2012 campaign, almost double the permitted amount.

                              <span>Debating eagerly in their classroom, Romanian teacher Gabriela Obodariu&#x27;s pupils faced up to a hard question: if horrors like the Holocaust were to happen in their time, what part would they play?
Under the fascist regime that ruled their country, allied with the Nazis, would they have been bystanders, resistance fighters -- or torturers?
Romania killed hundreds of thousands of Jews during World War II, yet polls show that awareness of those atrocities today is extremely low. The lesson is part of a national drive to fix that.
&quot;Such horrors didn&#x27;t stop and won&#x27;t stop,&quot; Obodariu, 56, told her students in the eastern city of Focsani.
Hers was part of a program of weekly classes on Jewish history and the Holocaust introduced into the curriculum in high schools all over Romania in September.

                              <span>Young men and women flocked to an ancient pagoda in central Hanoi on Wednesday hoping a Valentine&#x27;s Day offering would help them find a partner -- a major priority for many Vietnamese.
Office worker Nguyen Thi Ly respectfully placed a tray with sweets, water, money -- fake bills of both dong and US dollars -- and the familiar Valentine&#x27;s roses on the altar at the Ha Pagoda.
&quot;Please help me Buddha, I want to have a boyfriend this year to stop being single,&quot; she mumbled before the altar, already packed with dozens of other similar trays.
Vietnam is a communist state but Buddhist and Confucian traditions are still strong, with many people going to pray on the first, middle and last days of the lunar month for peace, luck and prosperity.

                              <span>Tourists and Parisians have long been accustomed to the sight of wild rabbits frolicking around the lawns of the historic Invalides memorial complex, one of the French capital&#x27;s great landmarks.
But efforts are underway to relocate the fluffy animals, accused of damaging the gardens and drains around the giant edifice that houses Napoleon&#x27;s tomb, authorities said.
Police said that several dozen bunnies had been captured since late January and relocated to the private estate of Breau in the Seine-et-Marne region outside Paris, a move that has prompted an outcry from animal rights activists.
&quot;Two operations have taken place since 25 January,&quot; the police prefecture told AFP on Tuesday.
&quot;Twenty-four healthy rabbits were captured on each occasion and released after vaccination&quot; in Seine-et-Marne, the prefecture said.
Six more operations are scheduled to take place in the coming weeks.
Around 300 wild rabbits live around Les Invalides, according to police estimates.
&quot;The overpopulation on the site is leading to deteriorating living conditions and health risks,&quot; the prefecture said.
Authorities estimate the cost of restoring the site, which has been damaged by the proliferation of underground galleries and the deterioration of gardens, pipes and flora, at 366,000 euros ($391,000).
Animal rights groups denounced the operation.
The Paris Animaux Zoopolis group said the rabbits were being subjected to &quot;intense stress&quot; or could be killed &quot;under the guise of relocation&quot;.
&quot;A number of rabbits will die during capture and potentially during transport,&quot; said the group, accusing authorities of being &quot;opaque&quot; about their methods.
The animal rights group also noted that Breau was home to the headquarters of the Seine-et-Marne hunting federation.
The police prefecture insisted that the animals would not be hunted.
In 2021, authorities classified the rabbits living in Paris as a nuisance but the order was reversed following an outcry from animal groups who have been pushing for a peaceful cohabitation with the animals.</span>

                              <span>A Texas showdown on Twitter/X had Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) trading fire with scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton. 
The first shot came from Michael Quinn Sullivan who called out the senator for failing to protect the Southern Border. 
His tweet reads: &quot;While Texans slept, @JohnCornyn sent $95 billion to help other countries with their border problems. Question: when was the last time Cornyn stayed up all night fighting for our border?&quot;

Paxton piled on. 
&quot;This is a question all Texans should be asking,&quot; according to his reply. &quot;Unbelievable that @JohnCornyn would stay up all night to defend other countries borders, but not America.&quot;
So that had Cornyn landing a counterpunch. &quot;Ken, your criminal defense lawyers are calling to suggest you spend less time pushing Russian propaganda and more time defending longstanding felony charges against you in Houston, as well as ongoing federal grand jury proceedings in San Antonio that will probably result in further criminal charges,&quot; according to the tweet. 
Paxton faced an impeachment effort stemming from a whistleblower lawsuit filed by four former senior employees claiming they were wrongfully terminated. 
They accused Paxton of axing them from their posts after reporting his suspected corruption to the FBI.
Those allegations eventually led to a Paxton impeachment vote on alleged bribery and abuse of office charges. 
He managed to get acquitted after a trial in the Senate.
However, the whistleblower lawsuit reportedly remains pending.</span>

                              <span>When House Republicans managed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by a single vote on Tuesday, two Democrats were missing from the House floor.
One of them, Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), soon revealed why she had been unable to attend on her X account.
&quot;Unfortunately, I recently tested positive for COVID-19 and am isolating in accordance with CDC guidelines,&quot; Chu wrote. &quot;Today, I was unable to be on the Floor to vote once again against impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. As I stated last week when this was first put to the House: impeaching a Cabinet member over policy disagreements isn&#x27;t a solution to our broken immigration system.&quot;

&quot;This is an abuse of power by House Republicans, and they degrade the oath they took to the Constitution to score cheap political points with their extremist MAGA base,&quot; she continued.
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the House under Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) adopted a proxy voting rule to handle precisely this situation, where members could cast votes on behalf of a lawmaker who was unable to attend. However, after the GOP won control of the House in 2022, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rescinded this policy.
The impeachment of Mayorkas, in which Republicans have remained vague about what high crimes or misdemeanors they are actually accusing him of, is expected to fail at trial in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</span>

The problem, as others were quick to point out, is that the image was from when Trump was still in office and therefore has nothing to do with the current U.S. president.
&quot;This is a photo from 2018 when Donald Trump was president,&quot; said Josh Schwerin, the communications director for Priorities USA.
Edwards responded to Schwerin, not acknowledging that he was in the wrong. Instead, he posted another purported border photo and wrote, &quot;Satisfied?&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;m just here waiting on Community Notes to correct another Republican&#x27;s lies,&quot; one X user wrote.
&quot;From 2018. Guess who was president then? Nice try,&quot; another internet user wrote.
National security lawyer Bradley P. Moss also joined in the conversation, saying, &quot;Impressive given that photo is from 2018.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has been impeached by the House — the first time this has happened to a cabinet member in over a century.
Republicans spearheaded the charge, arguing that Mayorkas was derelict in responsibilities to control migration at the southern border. However, their allegations have consistently been vague as to what law or laws he is supposedly violating or not enforcing.
DHS has been in charge of border patrol ever since the agency was founded in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

The matter now falls to the Senate, where it is exceedingly unlikely Mayorkas would face conviction if it comes for a vote due to the supermajority requirement.
This comes after the GOP&#x27;s previous attempt to impeach Mayorkas earlier this month failed due to a series of absences and vacancies that they had not accounted for.
It also comes just after former President Donald Trump successfully pushed Republicans in the House and Senate to oppose a bipartisan border security agreement that would have given Mayorkas and the Joe Biden administration greater tools and stronger mandates to remove certain migrants and improve border security.</span>

&quot;The only one that beat Donald Trump in the election is Donald Trump — and he&#x27;s doing a pretty good job right there,&quot; said Urban.

The 45th president appearing at a rally in Conway, South Carolina, on Saturday bragged about dressing down an anonymous NATO leader for asking him if they would be protected from Russian aggression if they were behind with remitting their requisite 2% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) share as agreed upon in 2014.

                              <span>Italian activists on Tuesday stuck photographs of climate change devastation to a glass panel protecting Botticelli&#x27;s famed Birth of Venus painting at the Uffizi museum in Florence.
Two activists from Last Generation posted images of a flooded Tuscan town over the goddess&#x27; giant shell on the 15th-century work, before being escorted to a police station, the campaign group said in a statement.
&quot;The government continues to pretend that fields did not burn in January, that water will not be a problem this summer, that houses destroyed by floods are accidental events and not caused by human choices,&quot; one of the protesters, Giordano, was quoted as saying.
&quot;And instead of dealing with these real problems, it makes absurd laws&quot; punishing climate activism, he said.
Italy&#x27;s parliament in January approved a law increasing penalties for people who damage monuments and cultural sites, following a series of climate protests.
In November, a judge in Florence ruled two activists who in 2022 glued their hands to the glass surrounding another Botticelli painting, also in the Uffizi, had not committed a crime.
The Last Generation organisation began carrying out peaceful but disruptive protests in Italy in 2022 ahead of the general election, urging politicians from all parties to make climate change their priority.
According to the European Commission, Italy is on track for significantly higher emissions than those set in its 2030 target.
The protests in Italy are part of a series of actions across Europe to focus attention on climate change.
Activists have thrown soup, cake, mashed potatoes and washable paint at heritage and culture sites and artworks in museums.

While Stewart talked about the recent special counsel report claiming Joe Biden had memory issues because he answered questions with &quot;I don&#x27;t recall,&quot; the host showed clips of Donald Trump and his adult children similarly answering questions.  
Co-hosts were annoyed that people look at the advanced age and don&#x27;t factor in &quot;intelligence&quot; and the danger they said Donald Trump presents to the world. 
Joy Behar said that the other problem is that Biden has a stutter that he has had his whole life, and it makes him pause to make sure he doesn&#x27;t stutter.

                              <span>Although Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been taking some Moscow-friendly votes lately, that apparently hasn&#x27;t been enough to get him off of Russia&#x27;s &quot;most wanted&quot; list.
Vice reports that leaked Russian Internal Affairs Ministry records show that Graham is one of several foreigners who have been singled out for arrest by Russian prosecutors, who have also issued warrants against Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Piotr Hofmański, the president of the International Criminal Court.
Interestingly, it appears that Graham&#x27;s indictment relates to his strong support for the government of Ukraine in its war against Russia, despite the fact that Graham voted against an aid package for the country on Tuesday morning.

&quot;Russian investigative reporters Mediazona found the database of 96,752 suspects could be accessed from the internet, then built a search tool to allow searches by name and discovered a large number of indicted foreigners,&quot; writes Vice. 
&quot;These included foreign fighters supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, officials with the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Ukrainian officials and lawmakers in Baltic states that voted to remove Soviet memorials from World War Two.&quot;
In fact, the warrant for Estonian PM Kallas relates to her decision to support taking down a monument of a Russian tank that had been in the capital city Tallinn two years ago.
In addition to the arrest warrants for foreigners, the database also contains warrants for more than 31,000 Russian citizens.</span>

                              <span>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who months ago pledged to stand by Ukraine and its efforts to repel invading Russian military forces, voted against passing military aid to Ukraine in the United States Senate on Tuesday morning.
In justifying his vote, Graham claimed that he opposed the package because it didn&#x27;t do enough to address the migrant crisis on the southern border, despite the fact that Republicans had also killed a bipartisan deal aimed at tackling that exact crisis.
Many of Graham&#x27;s critics were quick to pounce on his vote, which they noted went completely against his past declarations that supporting Ukraine was essential for American security.
&quot;An incredible transformation that would have left his late friend John McCain aghast,&quot; commented journalist Michael Weiss. &quot;Graham said backstage at an event I moderated in 2016 that he could not understand why the GOP didn’t just kick Trump out of the party.&quot;

Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-IL) was similarly stunned by Graham&#x27;s embrace of hardcore Trumpian nationalism.
&quot;No politician these past 8 years has emasculated themselves more than this one has,&quot; he declared.
Arnaud Castaignet, the vice president of Government Affairs and Public Relations at Skeleton Technologies, argued that Graham had shown himself to be utterly two-faced on aiding Ukraine.
&quot;This man literally went to Kyiv 9 months ago and told Zelensky and Ukrainians, with a straight face, &#x27;I will continue to stand with and for Ukraine’s freedom until every Russian soldier is expelled from Ukrainian territory,&#x27;&quot; remarked Castaignet, who works out of Estonia. &quot;Until Trump tells him not to.&quot;
This prompted Ret. Gen. Mark Hertling to discuss just how much Graham was helping to damage America&#x27;s international alliances.
&quot;For those who think our allies aren’t watching and are disgusted by the hypocrisy of US elected officials,&quot; he remarked.</span>

Parisian luxury jewelry house Chaumet, one of LVMH&#x27;s lesser-known properties, was thrust into the public limelight on Thursday when its design for the medals for the July 26-August 11 extravaganza was unveiled.

&quot;Je Anne&quot; (&quot;Yours, Anne&quot;) sticks faithfully to the account of the Jewish teenager whose story of hiding from the Nazis in war-time Amsterdam has become famous around the world.
The stage consists only of a concrete Star of David divided into sections representing the rooms in the &quot;secret annex&quot; where the Frank family and four others hid for more than two years.
The eight characters rarely leave the star, perching on bits of luggage, their only worldly possessions, creating a tense sense of claustrophobia throughout the production.

                              <span>Bitcoin spiked above $50,000 Tuesday for the first time in more than two years as investors grow optimistic that US approval of broader trading in the unit will ramp up demand.
The cryptocurrency has enjoyed a strong run in recent months, fuelled by expectations US lawmakers would allow the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price and let the public invest in crypto without directly purchasing it.
After initially dropping in reaction to last month&#x27;s green light by Washington, bitcoin has rallied about 25 percent since January 22.
That advance saw it hit as much as $50,328, according to Bloomberg data, its highest level since late 2021.
And observers were optimistic about the outlook.

                              <span>Russia has put Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on a wanted list, an official register showed Tuesday, as tensions soar between Russia and the West over Ukraine.
Kallas’ name appeared on the Interior Ministry’s register of people wanted in connection with criminal charges. It didn’t specify what charges Kallas was facing.
It is the first time the ministry has put a foreign leader on a wanted list. 
Kallas has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, spearheading efforts to increase military assistance to Kyiv and tighten sanctions against Russia.
She also has angered Moscow by pushing for the removal of monuments to Soviet World War II soldiers. Russia has laws criminalizing the “rehabilitation of Nazis” that include clauses punishing the desecration of war memorials.
Estonian Secretary of State Taimar Peterkop was also put on the wanted list, according to the register.
The moves appear to reflect an attempt by Moscow to up the ante as it faces pressure from NATO allies as fighting in Ukraine nears the two-year mark, but means little in practical terms as Russia-West contacts have been frozen during the conflict.
There was no immediate reaction to the move from the Estonian authorities.

Speaking at the White House, the two leaders both warned however against any indiscriminate Israeli ground incursion into Gaza&#x27;s southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians are trapped.
&quot;We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe,&quot; said the Jordanian monarch, taking the lectern after Biden had spoken first.

Speaking at a Saturday rally in Conway, South Carolina, Trump told a story about an anonymous NATO member asking if he would withhold U.S. support if their country didn&#x27;t pay their 2% to NATO. It isn&#x27;t the way NATO funding works, however. Countries are encouraged to contribute to their own militaries as part of a collective effort based on a formula that factors in their own GDP.

                              <span>US President Joe Biden has been roasted online after looking like a &quot;lost puppy&quot; on stage next to the King of Jordan.

The meeting between Joe Biden and King Abdullah II on Monday is their first since the deaths of the three US troops in Jordan.

Their meeting comes as the Biden administration continues its talks of a potential hostage release deal with Hamas.

Following the arrival of King Abdulah II, his wife Queen Rania and Crown Prince Hussein, Biden delivered a speech about the ongoing war in Gaza.

During his speech, Biden found the time to joke with the King by saying Barack (Obama) was &quot;watching&quot; him before forgetting the Prince was not on stage with him.

President Biden then spoke about America’s operation in the Gaza city of Rafah before forgetting what he was saying and fumbling his words.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden and King Abdullah II will discuss “the ongoing situation in Gaza and efforts to produce an enduring end to the crisis&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Donald Trump has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, requesting an extension of his election meddling trial. He advocates for immunity from prosecution, claiming that the Presidency is in jeopardy without it. The court&#x27;s judgment might determine whether Trump will face trial before November. Prosecutors have called for a quick resolution to the immunity issue, while Trump&#x27;s legal team accuses them of partisan motivation.</span>

                              <span>The Biden administration is playing down threats of imminent military action from Venezuela against neighboring Guyana, telling reporters Monday that recently released satellite imagery reveal “small-scale” activity in “remote locations.” 
The White House response comes after a Washington-based think tank released the images over the weekend, leading to concern that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro might follow through on weeks of threats to annex Essequibo, a large portion of Guyanan territory.</span>

                              <span>Following U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s statements on NATO support, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has reaffirmed the alliance&#x27;s common defense. 
&quot;NATO&#x27;S promise of protection applies unreservedly. All for one. One for all,&quot; Scholz said on Monday in Berlin at a meeting with the new, pro-European Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. 
Scholz went on to explain that he wanted to make it clear in light of the current situation: &quot;Any relativization of NATO&#x27;s guarantee of assistance is irresponsible and dangerous and is solely in Russia&#x27;s interests. Nobody should play with Europe&#x27;s security.&quot;</span>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…</span>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…</span>
