“Royalty and celebrity sort of go hand in hand because the royals do need that celebrity push sometimes to get their agendas out there,” he told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.</span>

Sophie has vocalised her support in the past for survivors of sexual violence in conflict regions. 

“I think, certainly, she has been described as the Royal Family’s secret weapon in the past,” Mr Myers told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo. 

“Hopefully, we will try and see a bit more of her work because it has always gone under the radar.”</span>

President calls tentative agreement ‘an important step forward’ but deal still needs to receive approval from a divided Congress 
US president Joe Biden has said a bipartisan deal to raise the US debt ceiling and avoid a default is ready to move to Congress and urged lawmakers to pass the deal he struck with Kevin McCarthy.
On Sunday night Biden told reporters at the White House that he believed the House Speaker negotiated in good faith and had the votes to pass the agreement, which the president said protects his key policy priorities and is “good news” for the American people.

                              <span>Reuters: Turkey&#x27;s Erdogan prevails in election test of his 20-year rule 
ANKARA (Reuters) -President Tayyip Erdogan extended his two decades in power in elections on Sunday, winning a mandate to pursue increasingly authoritarian policies which have polarised Turkey and strengthened its position as a regional military power. 
His challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, called it &quot;the most unfair election in years&quot; but did not dispute the outcome.

Official results showed Kilicdaroglu won 47.9% of the votes to Erdogan&#x27;s 52.1%, pointing to a deeply divided nation. 
The election had been seen as one of the most consequential yet for Turkey, with the opposition believing it had a strong chance of unseating Erdogan and reversing his policies after his popularity was hit by a cost-of-living crisis.

                              <span>Task &amp; Purpose: This drone-on-drone dogfight in Ukraine is a glimpse of the future of war 
Early this week the Ukrainian armed forces posted a short video to social media showing its drones in operation, flying over convoys, surveilling battlefields and in one brief bit of footage, taking out a Russian drone by crashing into it at top speed. 
The video, set to electronic music, offers a glimpse into the low-tech approach soldiers are taking to dealing with high-tech tools. 
The footage of the specific incident is short but shows what is starting to happen more and more in Ukraine. With both Russia and Ukraine making heavy use of uncrewed aerial vehicles, UAV dogfights are starting to pop up as the two warring parties try to keep the skies clear. It’s a risky strategy, given that both drones will likely be taken out, and a pretty rudimentary solution for dealing with 21st century technology. But if it’s dumb and it works, it’s not dumb.

                              <span>Reuters: Russia Unleashes Largest Drone Attack on Ukrainian Capital Ahead of Kyiv Day 
KYIV (Reuters) - Russia unleashed waves of air strikes on Kyiv overnight in what officials said appeared to be the largest drone attack on the city since the start of the war, as the Ukrainian capital prepared to celebrate the anniversary of its founding on Sunday. 
Ukraine&#x27;s Air Force said it downed 52 out of the 54 Russia-launched drones, calling it a record attack with the Iranian-made &#x27;kamikaze&#x27; drones. It was not immediately clear how many of the drones were shot over Kyiv. 
In what also appears to be the first deadly attack on Kyiv in May and the 14th assault this month, falling debris killed a 41-year-old man, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. 
The pre-dawn attacks came on the last Sunday of May when the capital celebrates Kyiv Day, the anniversary of its official founding 1,541 years ago. The day is typically marked by street fairs, live concerts and special museum exhibitions - plans for which have been made this year too, but on a smaller scale.

A beach resort bristling with fortifications. A major road lined with anti-tank ditches. Satellite analysis by BBC Verify has uncovered some of the extensive defences built by Russia as it prepares for a major Ukrainian counter-attack. 
After months of stalemate, the expected assault is likely to be a crucial test for Ukraine as it seeks to prove it can achieve significant battlefield gains with the weapons it has received from the West.
By examining hundreds of satellite images, the BBC has identified some key points in the significant build-up of trenches and other fortifications in southern Ukraine since October.

New York Times: ‘It’s Time’: Ukraine’s Top Commander Says Counteroffensive Is Imminent 
Ukraine’s top military commander signaled on Saturday morning that the nation’s forces were ready to launch their long-anticipated counteroffensive following months of preparations, including recently stepped-up attacks on logistical targets as well as feints and disinformation intended to keep Russian forces on edge. 
“It’s time to get back what’s ours,” Ukraine’s supreme military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, wrote in a statement.

RT:  Russia outlines conditions for Ukraine peace deal

 
Kiev should rule out joining NATO and the EU and respect the rights of minorities, Moscow’s deputy foreign minister says  
The Ukraine conflict could be settled if Kiev were to re-commit to its neutral status, recognize “new territorial realities,” and declare Russian as a state language, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview released on Saturday. 
Speaking to TASS news agency, the diplomat said Moscow “is convinced that a peace settlement will be possible only if the Ukrainian armed forces cease hostilities, and Western weapons shipments are stopped.”

                              <span>Reuters: At Least Three Killed in Clash on Iran-Afghan Border 
DUBAI (Reuters) - Two Iranian border guards and one Taliban fighter were killed after shooting broke out near a border post between Iran and Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman and Iran&#x27;s state media said on Saturday.
It was not immediately clear what had provoked the incident, in which several people were also injured, but it came amid tensions between the two countries over water rights. 
Iran has accused Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban rulers of violating a 1973 treaty by restricting the flow of water from the Helmand river to Iran&#x27;s parched eastern regions, an accusation denied by the Taliban. 
&quot;Today, in Nimroz province, Iranian border forces fired toward Afghanistan, which was met with a counter-reaction,&quot; spokesman for the Taliban-run interior ministry, Abdul Nafi Takor, said in a statement. 
&quot;The situation is under control now. The Islamic Emirate does not want to fight with its neighbours,&quot; the spokesman said, without identifying the victims.

                              <span>Incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has won Turkey&#x27;s run-off presidential vote for another five-year term, Supreme Election Board (YSK) head Ahmet Yener said on Sunday.
Erdoğan received 52.14% of the votes, Yener said.
His rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%, according to the preliminary results, Yener added.
Erdoğan can now remain in his seat for another five years and for a third time. The 69-year-old became prime minister in 2003. The parliament voted him as president in 2014.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turks vote on Sunday in a presidential runoff that could see Tayyip Erdogan extend his rule into a third decade and intensify Turkey&#x27;s increasingly authoritarian path, muscular foreign policy and unorthodox economic governance.
Erdogan, 69, defied opinion polls and came out comfortably ahead with an almost five-point lead over his rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the first round on May 14. But he fell just short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff, in a race with profound consequences for Turkey itself and global geopolitics.
His unexpectedly strong showing amid a deep cost of living crisis, and a win in parliamentary elections for a coalition of his conservative Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), the nationalist MHP and others, buoyed the vetera…</span>

And when he gets upset, &quot;El Popo&quot; starts to rumble as it has for more than a week.
&quot;Don Goyo&#x27;s angry because they didn&#x27;t put out his offering,&quot; said Jose Luis, a 55-year-old charcoal seller in Xalitzintla, the community closest to Popocatepetl.
Some residents even report having seen the mountain incarnate appear before them.
Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco.
&quot;We asked him &#x27;who are you?&#x27; He said: &#x27;Don&#x27;t you know me? I&#x27;m Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl. I&#x27;m the volcano,&#x27;&quot; the 77-year-old farmer said.

In Belgorod in southern Russia, the governor said the Ukrainian military was responsible for dozens of artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region but reported no casualties.

                              <span>(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday blamed Kosovo, the United States and European Union for escalating tensions in the Balkans and said it was watching with concern after violent clashes between Kosovan police and protesters opposed to ethnic Albanian mayors.
The United States and allies on Friday rebuked Kosovo, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas undermined efforts to improve troubled relations with neighbouring Serbia. NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.
The clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.
&quot;We decisively condemn Pristina&#x27;s provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,&quot; Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
&quot;The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,&quot; she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by &quot;Western mediators&quot; had come too late.
Serbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, and Moscow has blocked the country&#x27;s bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.

The number of people living in modern slavery has risen sharply in the last five years, according to a new report. North Korea and Eritrea have the highest rates in the world. 
There has been a significant rise in the number of people becoming victims of modern slavery in recent years, a new study published in London on Wednesday shows. 
An estimated 50 million people were &quot;living in situations of modern slavery&quot; in 2021, according to the Global Slavery Index released by the human rights organization Walk Free. 
That represents an increase of 10 million since a previous estimate five years ago.

                              <span>BBC: Hundreds of expelled Germans set to leave Russia 
Hundreds of Germans working in the education and cultural sectors will be expelled from Russia next month, the German foreign ministry says. 
It confirmed media reports that Russia had decided to cap the number of German employees from the start of June. 
They include teachers at the German school in Moscow and staff at the Goethe Institute cultural association. 
The move follows tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats and increasingly strained relations between Russia and Germany.

Last month, Russia and Germany each declared 40 employees of their respective embassies personae non gratae - or unwelcome - and expelled them.

The Telegraph: Drone attack damages Russian oil pipeline facility hundreds of miles from Ukraine 
Ukrainian drones attacked and damaged oil pipeline infrastructure hundreds of miles inside Russia on Saturday, Russian officials said. 
One of the pipelines reportedly attacked was the Soviet-built Druzhba pipeline in the Tver province of northwest Russia, 300 miles from the border with Ukraine. 
“There were no casualties. Emergency services are currently working at the scene,” the Tver government said in a statement. 
Russia has accused Ukraine of hitting oil pipelines previously, including the Druzhba pipeline, which sends oil to Europe.

Business Insider: Flying the F-16 in Ukraine is &#x27;high risk,&#x27; and Kyiv&#x27;s air forces can&#x27;t just fly the fighter jet headlong into Russia&#x27;s defenses 
* Momentum is building for Ukraine to receive the F-16s it has long sought. 
* If Kyiv&#x27;s air forces get the jet as expected, they won&#x27;t be able to fly them directly at Russian defenses. 
* Airpower experts, including former pilots, say Ukraine will have to get creative. 
Ukraine is a lot closer to getting US-made F-16s, but once it finally gets its hands on them, Kyiv&#x27;s air force likely isn&#x27;t going to be flying them into Russian-held territory or dogfighting with Russian fighters right out of the gate — at least not if it wants to keep them. 
The jet can&#x27;t risk going head-to-head against the Russian military&#x27;s more modern systems, like its air superiority fighters and the formidable S-400 air defense system, not without weakening them first.

&quot;And nobody&#x27;s advocating for that,&quot; an air power expert told Insider. &quot;That&#x27;s nuts.&quot;

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic placed the country&#x27;s army on full combat alert and ordered its units to move closer to the border with Kosovo, the Tanjug news agency reported on Friday. 
Vucic&#x27;s orders came as Serbs in the northern Kosovo&#x27;s municipality of Zvecan clashed with Kosovo police who were trying to help the newly elected ethnic Albanian mayor enter his office. 
The local vote had been boycotted by Serbs who represent a majority in the area.

Local media reported that Kosovo police fired tear gas at a crowd gathered in front of the municipality building.

Al-Monitor: Israeli brass sounds alarm on Iran&#x27;s readiness to launch nuclear attack 
Israeli officials are watching tensely as intelligence indicates Iran is working on the detonation mechanisms needed for a nuclear bomb. 
TEL AVIV — Israeli security chiefs have become especially worried recently, not only over Iran’s moves to enrich uranium, but also on Tehran&#x27;s rapidly growing capabilities to launch a military nuclear attack. 
Even in amid speculation about a US push to forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Israel’s top commander sounded an ominous warning. Speaking on May 23 at the annual Herzliya Conference, Lt. Gen. Herzl Halevi warned of negative developments that could lead to Israel taking action against Iran.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday announced he has nominated Air Force Gen. CQ Brown to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a brief ceremony in the White House’s Rose Garden. 
“Gen. Brown is a warrior, descended from a proud line of warriors,” Biden said, referencing Brown’s Vietnam veteran father as well as his grandfather, who led a segregated unit in World War II.
Brown’s command roles in the Indo-Pacific region, the Middle East and Europe give him “an unmatched firsthand knowledge of our operational theaters, and a strategic vision to understand how they all work together to ensure security for the American people,” Biden said, flanked by Brown, Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

                              <span>Warzone/The Drive: Iranian Underground Nuclear Facility May Be A Hard Target For America’s Biggest Bunker Busters

 
The U.S.’s heaviest conventional bunker busters may face challenges penetrating new underground tunnels near Iran’s Natanz nuclear site.  
The U.S. military’s most powerful, deeply burrowing Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker buster bombs, or MOPs, may be unable to penetrate a buried nuclear facility in central Iran, analysis of new satellite images suggests. The Air Force’s 30,000-pound class GBU-57/B MOPs are guided weapons specifically designed to penetrate highly fortified targets such as Iran’s underground nuclear facilities and can impact surfaces above targets with great accuracy. Most recently, a rare ‘live’ MOP was pictured at Whiteman Air Force Base, as you can read more about here.

Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said Wednesday that he “wouldn’t care” if Ukraine used American-made F-16s to strike Russian territory despite the risk of such an attack escalating into a direct clash between the US and Russia. 
When asked by Epoch Times reporter Liam Cosgrove if he was concerned about the potential of Ukraine using F-16s to hit targets inside Russia, Nadler said, “No, I’m not concerned. I wouldn’t care if they did.”

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said this in his opening remarks at the 12th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, according to an Ukrinform correspondent. 
 &quot;In total, the Contact Group has committed nearly $65 billion in security assistance. Now, Putin was hoping that our resolve would fade. And he was betting that our unity would crack. Instead, we remain as united as ever,&quot; Austin said.

                              <span>As financial belt tightening and layoffs rippled throughout the tech industry in recent months, fact checkers and researchers who were tasked with keeping disinformation and extremism off of social media platforms are becoming scarce, CNBC reported. 
&quot;The cuts come at a time of increased cyberbullying, which has been linked to higher rates of adolescent self-harm, and as the spread of misinformation and violent content collides with the exploding use of artificial intelligence,&quot; the report stated. 
In a mass effort to boost productivity with less overhead, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have all slashed thousands of jobs.
In an example of just how far tech companies are willing to go to cut costs, departments tasked with trust and safety and AI ethics have been slashed as well.

&quot;Twitter effectively disbanded its ethical AI team in November and laid off all but one of its members, along with 15% of its trust and safety department, according to reports. In February, Google cut about one-third of a unit that aims to protect society from misinformation, radicalization, toxicity and censorship,&quot; says CNBC. &quot;Meta reportedly ended the contracts of about 200 content moderators in early January. It also laid off at least 16 members of Instagram’s well-being group and more than 100 positions related to trust, integrity and responsibility, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.&quot;

It was unclear who the pope had been expected to meet with, as his agenda was not made public on Friday, as is customary.
Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin blamed the pontiff&#x27;s busy schedule, saying he was tired.
&quot;The pope was tired, yesterday he had a very busy day, he saw a lot of people .. he wanted to say hello to them all,&quot; said Parolin, according to Italian news agencies.
&quot;And probably at a certain point the resistence breaks down.&quot;
Francis had eight meetings Thursday, according to his published schedule.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
