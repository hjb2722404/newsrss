Mr Siracusa said 90 per cent of Mr Biden’s tour was about “optics” and “to be seen”. 

“The trip may have been about optics, but he’s further alienated the progressive wing at his party by failing to mention human rights,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

                              <span>Small Pacific island nations will not compromise their independence by offering to host Chinese facilities in the foreseeable future, former foreign minister Bob Carr says.

“These small island developing states are not Australian dependencies,” he told Sky News Australia.

“But they will make decisions in their own national interest, they’ll want to have a dialogue with China.

                              <span>Jewelry and gems worth millions – a conservative figure puts the value at $10 million – were stolen from a Brink’s armored truck near Los Angeles last week, the security firm said, leaving some victims ask how such theft could have happened.
The merchandise was loaded onto a Brink’s truck at an event hosted by the International Gem and Jewelry Show on July 10 in San Mateo, near San Francisco, said Brandy Swanson, the group’s events director.  She said the truck was on its way to another exhibit 370 miles away at the Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena.
But in circumstances that have not been made public, the merchandise was taken from the truck near Los Angeles early Monday, said Brink’s spokeswoman Dana Callahan.


The value of the stolen merchandise, which included several gold and diamond necklaces, was not immediately clear.  It was also unclear how many pieces had been taken.


One of the jewelers, who requested anonymity for security reasons given the expensive jewelry he handles, estimated the total value of what was stolen at between $20 million and $50 million.  Ms. Callahan said it was less than $10 million.
“Based on information customers provided to us prior to shipping their items, the total value of missing items is less than $10 million,” Brink’s said in a statement.  “We are working with law enforcement and will fully reimburse our customers for the value of their assets that were stolen, in accordance with the terms of our contract.”
The jeweler said Brink’s was not transparent with jewelry owners and many fundamental questions about the loss remained unanswered.
Neither authorities nor Brink’s released details of what happened, including the location of the theft and whether anyone was injured.


A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was working with local authorities but could not provide more information.  In its statement, Brink’s called the episode “a loss incident.”

                              <span>WNU Editor: Spent the day talking to friends and family who are still in Ukraine. Correction. It was more listening to friends and family on what they are going through right now in Ukraine. 
Sighhh ... it has been a draining day. But I should not complain. I am in Canada where I am safe. 
As for the above video report. Kudos to Dima at the Military Summary YouTube channel spending his day trying to understand the military situation on the ground by compiling both Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministry briefings into something that is meaningful. No one has come close to doing what he is doing, including all those high-paid retired Generals giving their 5 minute analysis on TV that is proven wrong 2 weeks later. 
Some other interesting news that I picked up today. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been making some remarks that is raising a few eyebrows. One .... he says he was misquoted when he said Ukraine will soon have a million soldiers. Reason being that his English is not good. He instead expects something like 700,000 soldiers. 
And two .... he has been quoted as saying that the Ukraine military has already suffered 100,000 casualties since the start of the war?!?!?!? I have been trying to find other Ukrainian media and government outlets to verify this casualty number, but no luck so far.

Russian media is saying that they have already destroyed a number of US supplied HIMARS systems, and that the Russian military advance continues. I am always skeptical of these reports, but I have noticed a reduction in reports of long range artillery strikes by Ukraine in the past few days.</span>

Reuters: Ukraine war shows West&#x27;s dominance is ending as China rises, Blair says  
LONDON (Reuters) - The Ukraine war shows that the West&#x27;s dominance is coming to an end as China rises to superpower status in partnership with Russia at one of the most significant inflection points in centuries, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said. 
The world, Blair said, was at a turning point in history comparable with the end of World War Two or the collapse of the Soviet Union: but this time the West is clearly not in the ascendant. 
 &quot;We are coming to the end of Western political and economic dominance,&quot; Blair said in a lecture entitled &quot;After Ukraine, What Lessons Now for Western Leadership?&quot; according to a text of the speech to a forum supporting the alliance between the United States and Europe at Ditchley Park west of London.

 CNN: US Navy challenges Chinese claims in South China Sea for second time in a week 
Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A US Navy warship on Saturday challenged Chinese claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea, the US 7th Fleet said in a statement -- the second operation of its kind this week. 
The guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold sailed near the Spratly Islands -- known as the Nansha Islands in China -- in the southeastern South China Sea in a so-called &quot;freedom of navigation operation&quot; (FONOP), the 7th Fleet statement said. 
The US Navy operation in the island chain where China has built military foritifications on man-made islands challenged &quot;restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), Vietnam, and Taiwan,&quot; the statement said.

The National: Saudi Arabia: no additional capacity to increase oil production beyond 13 million bpd  
The kingdom said it is targeting production capacity of 13 million bpd by 2027 
Saudi Arabia will not have any additional capacity to increase oil production beyond 13 million barrels per day, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said during his address to the US-Arab summit in Jeddah. 
“The kingdom has announced an increase in its production capacity level to 13 million barrels per day, after which the kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production,” he said. 
The kingdom previously said it was aiming at production capacity of 13 million bpd by 2027.

WNU Editor: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was very careful on what he was promising. MBS was talking about &quot;Production Capacity&quot; NOT &quot;production&quot; when he mentioned that they will be increasing production capacity to 13 mb/d (from 12 mb/d) by 2027. In other-words. Do not expect any significant Saudi oil production in the near future.

Gaffe-prone President Biden evoked winces from his entourage Saturday as he spoke of the “selfishness” of American troops on the final day of his trip to the Middle East. 
“For the first time since 9/11, an American President is visiting this region without American troops being engaged in combat — in a combat mission in the region,” Biden said during a speech to the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 
“We’ll always honor the bravery and selfishness — selflessness of the — and sacrifices of the Americans who served, including my son, Major Beau Biden, who was stationed in Iraq for a year,” he said.

                              <span>Space Review: Kalina: a Russian ground-based laser to dazzle imaging satellites 
There is strong evidence that a space surveillance complex in Russia’s northern Caucasus is being outfitted with a new laser system called Kalina that will target optical systems of foreign imaging satellites flying over Russian territory. Initiated in 2011, the project has suffered numerous delays, but recent Google Earth imagery shows that construction is now well underway. Kalina will complement a mobile laser dazzler known as Peresvet that has been operational since late 2019. 
 The Krona space surveillance complex Kalina is part of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Krona space surveillance complex, situated several kilometers west of Zelenchukskaya, a place well known in the astronomical community. Also located in its immediate vicinity are the Russian Academy of Science’s Special Astrophysical Observatory (housing the six-meter BTA telescope) and the RATAN-600 radio telescope.

But what is not vague is Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu ordering a major escalation in the war to stop Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes on the city of Denetsk and surrounding regions.

Patrick Buchanan: Is a US-Russia War Becoming Inevitable? 
If Putin makes a military move into Finland, the U.S. will go to war against the world’s largest nation with an arsenal of between 4,500 and 6,000 battlefield and strategic nuclear weapons… To go to war with the Soviet Union over the preservation of Finnish territory would have been seen as madness during the Cold War.
At the NATO summit in Madrid, Finland was invited to join the alliance. What does this mean for Finland? 
If Russian President Vladimir Putin breaches the 830-mile Finnish border, the United States will rise to Helsinki’s defense and fight Russia on Finland’s side. 
What does Finland’s membership in NATO mean for America?

                              <span>The fastest inflation in four decades has Americans feeling austere about the economy, even as their own finances have so far held up relatively well.
Just 10% of registered voters say the U.S. economy is “good” or “great,” according to a New York Times/Siena College poll — a remarkable degree of pessimism at a time when wages are rising and the the unemployment rate is near its lowest level in 50 years.  But the rapidly rising cost of food, gasoline and other necessities is nullifying wage increases and eroding living standards.


Americans’ bleak outlook is bad news for President Biden and congressional Democrats heading into this fall’s midterm elections, given that 78% of voters say inflation will be “extremely high” when they will go to the polls.

                              <span>Q: My co-op building has a new doorman who isn’t on duty.  He never opens the door.  He leaves packages unattended and all night in the lobby.  He is loud and indiscreet, converses on the phone, is often away from the office, and can be hostile and defiant towards shareholders and guests.  What recourse do shareholders have?  Can we withhold the part of the interview that goes towards his salary if his performance does not improve?
A: You cannot suspend maintenance because a building employee does not perform their duties according to your expectations.


Your grievances may be justified, but if all of a co-op’s shareholders withheld maintenance because they were dissatisfied with some aspect of the service, the building wouldn’t be able to function properly.

We asked for your own stories of the surprising ways technology has helped you unleash your creativity or discover new joys.
You guys (sniff) the responses were lovely.  Today we share a selection with you.
The mission here at On Tech is to explore the ways technology is changing the way we live, who we are, and the world around us.  We can’t ignore the harmful effects, but I don’t want us to lose sight of the wonder either.


How cool is it to be able to share knowledge gleaned online with a parent or easily swap songs from our favorite decade?  Also, BIRDS!  The birds are so big.  Here are edited excerpts of what some On Tech readers had t…</span>

Then it hit her.  From horizon to horizon, stern to bow, the sea all around them shone as their 52-foot-long ketch passed south of the Indonesian island of Java on a moonless night.


“What the hell?”  she remembered thinking.
What Ms McKinnon and his six teammates encountered in August 2019 was a glowing swell of seawater so bright and gargantuan in size that a satellite orbiting hundreds of miles above his head was able to see his reflections.  Last summer, a team of scientists reported on the satellite’s feat, which opened a window into one of the planet’s most puzzling features.

And Transport for London, the city’s public transport agency, urged people not to travel on Mondays and Tuesdays because the tracks could bend or warp under the effect of heat.
The UK government’s main emergency committee, Cobra, was also planning an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the response to the extreme weather.

                              <span>Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says China cannot dialogue with Australia in &quot;good faith&quot; while Beijing continues to amass nuclear weapons.

&quot;If the government&#x27;s got a dialogue wand it&#x27;s a productive dialogue then of course it should be pursued – but if we&#x27;re just being handled then that&#x27;s not a productive use of time,&quot; Mr Dutton told Sky News Australia.

&quot;The Australian government needs to be serious in the discussions and we need to ask China to explain their human rights abuses and to explain what&#x27;s happening in relation to their military build up. 

&quot;The government should be asking of China that if their conducting talks in good faith ... a sign of that good faith would be pulling back on the rapid expansion of their military arsenal.&quot;</span>

Mr Chalmers said it had not yet been confirmed China would be lifting trade ban on Australian goods. 

“We’d like to see it happen … that would be a welcome step,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“We’d like to see it not stop there, it should extend to the restrictions that are placed on some of our other exports as well in the interests of our employers and exporters here in Australia.”</span>

Mr Dutton said it was not unreasonable to ask China to take concrete actions to demonstrate it is not heading down the path &quot;the rest of the world believes them to be heading down&quot;.

In February, a Chinese Navy vessel aimed a military-grade laser at a RAAF P-8A Poseidon aircraft, which had been monitoring the ship from above over the Arafura Sea.

&quot;Their own rhetoric in relation to Taiwan, their own actions in relation to the assaults on our military personnel – as I say the P-8 was put in a very precarious position – had that plane gone down we&#x27;d be having a very different discussion.&quot;</span>

“Anything would be better than whatever it was that Kamala just said,” Ms Cousens said.

                              <span>The Biden-friendly media don&#x27;t even believe the US President&#x27;s trip to Saudi Arabia will do anything to alleviate the pain at the pump felt by millions of Americans, according to Sky News host James Morrow.

&quot;According to even the Biden-friendly politico.com, as far as oil prices are concerned, Joey of Arabia doesn&#x27;t stand an ice cube&#x27;s chance in the desert of getting the sheiks to do anything about pain at the pump,&quot; Mr Morrow said.

Mr Morrow said President Biden was certainly trying to make peace with the Saudis.

&quot;Fist bumping with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – you know, the same guy Biden said had made Saudi Arabia a &#x27;pariah state&#x27; for his brutal hit job on Muslim Brotherhood-connected journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&quot;</span>

Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas is in the running for the NCAA’s ‘Woman of the Year’ award. 

“This is just remarkable,” Ms Panahi said. 

“The patriarchy wins again and again,” she said. 

“It seems like biological male bodies are far better at being women than women are … where transwomen win woman of the year awards instead of women who have been women their entire lives.

“But that seems to not be interesting anymore.”</span>

&quot;All of us are feeling the pain of his loss because he was an inspirational leader, he was a great friend of our country, he was a force for good in the Indo-Pacific, across the world,&quot; Mr Dutton said.

&quot;He was murdered at the hands of an assassin who was clearly mentally deranged or was motivated by something that frankly none of us could ever understand.&quot;</span>

“Several people in the White House and on her staff approved that trainwreck,” Ms Panahi said.</span>

 Sri Lanka’s president finally resigned. Protesters celebrated, and they had reason to: Their mass demonstrations — including a takeover of the presidential mansion — drove President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from office.

DW: Russia&#x27;s Gazprom says no sign of Nord Steam 1 turbine 
Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has asked German engineering firm Siemens for the return of a turbine that was being fixed in Canada. There are fears state-owned Gazprom could use the opportunity to cut off gas. 
The Russian gas supplier Gazprom said Saturday it had asked German engineering company Siemens for details about the return of a turbine — under maintenance in Canada — to ensure the delivery of gas from the Nord Stream pipeline to Europe. 
Gazprom is conducting maintenance on the pipeline over a 10-day period and has stopped delivering gas through the conduit, which runs beneath the Baltic Sea.

WNU Editor: From what I understand the matter is now in front of the Canadian courts .... Canadian Law Firm Requests Judicial Review of Government Decision to Return Nord Stream 1 Turbines (Law.com). 
If this turbine is not returned next week, which I doubt it will be, I am willing to bet that Gazprom will say that they cannot resume normal operations until this is resolved.</span>

Bulgarian Military: Russia has taken control of one HIMARS MLRS, the media claim 
MOSCOW — Control of an American MLRS HIMARS provided to Ukraine by the United States has been taken over by the armed forces of Russia, say the media, mainly Russian. According to sources [not saying what sources, not naming names, not even mentioning the public, political or military status of the sources], the rocket system has already been transported to Russia, without mentioning whether this HIMARS MLRS has been sold or captured during hostilities.

WNU Editor: There has been reports on Russian social media for the past few days that Russian forces were able to get their hands on an intact US HIMAR system. Until there is an official announcement, I am skeptical of these reports, but iEarlGrey has been following it for the past few days, and his post is below.</span>

The Federalist: Did Gen. Milley Seize Presidential Power? Banks And Grassley Demand Answers 
Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, demanded Thursday that Gen. Mark Milley finally respond to allegations that he usurped presidential power over the military while he was President Donald Trump’s principal military adviser. Bob Woodward and Robert Costa raised the allegations in their 2021 book “Peril,” and according to the lawmakers, Milley still has not confirmed nor denied them.
“According to Bob Woodward’s book ‘Peril,’ Gen. Mark Milley directed senior military officers not to follow the president’s orders unless General Milley approved them first,” Banks said in a speech on the House floor on Thursday.

* President Biden laughed on Friday night after he was questioned about criticism over his fist bump with MBS 
* Image of the exchange drew harsh backlash from the widow of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
* Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in an assassination that US intel indicates was ordered by MBS 
* Biden told DailyMail.com reporter asking about potential future Saudi rights violations was &#x27;silly question&#x27; 
* But Biden confirmed he brought up Khashoggi&#x27;s murder in his meeting with MBS at the Saudi royal palace 
* &#x27;I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it,&#x27; Biden said 
* Biden told reporters that MBS &#x27;basically said he was not personally responsible&#x27; for the gruesome killing 
* &#x27;I indicated I thought he was,&#x27; Biden continued. &#x27;He said he was not personally responsible for it and he took action against those who were responsible&#x27; 
President Joe Biden laughed on Friday night after he was questioned about criticism over his fist bump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman outside the royal palace in Jeddah. 
The image of the friendly fist-bump drew harsh backlash from the publisher of the Washington Post and the widow of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in a gruesome assassination that US intelligence services say bin Salman ordered. 
Questioned about criticism of the fist bump by a DailyMail.com reporter, Biden laughed and then said it was a &#x27;silly question&#x27; when asked how he can be sure another murder like that of Khashoggi wouldn&#x27;t happen again.

                              <span>Financial Post/Reuters: Ukraine default fears grow as Naftogaz asks for debt freeze 
LONDON — Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz has asked its international creditors to defer payments on its debt for two years, fanning expectations that the government may soon do the same. 
Naftogaz which has a $335 million bond maturing as well as two interest payments due on July 19, said Russia’s invasion had left it short of cash as many of its customers were now unable to pay their bills. 
In its request for the payment freeze, Naftogaz said the five-month old war had resulted in a “significant economic and business decline in Ukraine” and that the missed bill payments had “negatively affected its liquidity position.”

As she walked across the stage to accept her degree, she heard cheers from friends and family.  She was a law school graduate – and that, to her, was extremely hot.
“It was a three-year process,” said Ms. Estime, 26, who graduated this spring from Shepard Broad College of Law at Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida.  “Three years of awakening and not I feel hot to get to this day where I’m like, ‘Wow, this is hot.&#x27;”

The league, founded in 1996 and in its 26th season, said there was a simple reason players weren’t allowed to fly charter planes: unlike the NBA – a multibillion-dollar operation that enters its 77th season which flies its players by charter – the WNBA said there was not enough money to pay for it. …</span>

                              <span>Energy politics in anyway is in breach of Norway’s international agreements and obligations, says State Secretary in Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy Amund Vik.  

Norway is reporting record profits as the Nordic nation increases exports of oil and gas to countries cut-off from Russian supplies.

Mr Vik said changing the demand is needed before taking action on supply. 

“You can’t just politically decide that the market is ready to turn off oil and gas,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

Mr Marles said the AUKUS alliance is “completely central” to Australia’s national security and relationship with the United States.

“So, this is a really important opportunity to make that clear,” he told Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen.

“AUKUS looms large in the agenda we’ve got with the United States and particularly the process that’s underway right now around narrowing down what submarine we actually do run with,” he said.</span>

                              <span>Zero Hedge: Saudis Double Russia Crude Imports As It Prepares For BRICS Inclusion 
Saudi Arabia has a thirst for heavily discounted Russian diesel and other fuel products banned by many countries in the West. 
The world&#x27;s largest oil exporter more than doubled the amount of Russian fuel oil in the second quarter to supply power generation stations to meet surging cooling demand this summer and allow the kingdom&#x27;s crude exports to increase. 
Western sanctions forced Russia to discount fuel oils on spot markets, which has increased demand in the East, not just from the Saudis but also from China and India.

Bloomberg: Biden Set to Leave Saudi Arabia With No Announcement on Oil 
President Joe Biden will leave the Middle East this week with no public announcements on increasing oil supply, people familiar with the matter said. 
Biden, who came to office vowing to turn the world’s biggest oil exporter into a “pariah” over the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, said he decided to make the trip to advance US interests and try and curb soaring gasoline prices, which have hurt him politically ahead of mid-term elections. 
Biden heads to Saudi Arabia from Israel later on Friday, where he’ll meet with King Salman bin Abdulaziz and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the nation’s de-facto ruler. He will meet other leaders from the oil-exporting Persian Gulf on Saturday.

Newsweek: Ukraine Building &#x27;Army of Drones&#x27; Though Donations to Monitor Front Line  
Ukraine is building an &quot;Army of Drones&quot; to monitor the front lines of its ongoing war against Russia. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s global donation initiative United24 announced the &quot;Army of Drones&quot; project last week alongside the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the country&#x27;s Ministry of Digital Transformation. 
The project calls for international donors to provide funds that the Ukrainian military will use to purchase drones, as well as direct &quot;dronations&quot; of unmanned aerial vehicles.

The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act is $37 billion above the president&#x27;s request. 
The House approved sweeping defense policy legislation on Thursday that marks the second straight year Democrats and Republicans endorsed significant increases to President Joe Biden’s Pentagon spending plan. 
The $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act, approved in a 329-101 vote, is $37 billion more than the administration sought in military spending. 
On top of the budget, the bill also rebukes several of Biden’s national security plans. 
Members maintained a nuclear cruise missile the administration planned to scrap, hampered F-16 sales to Turkey and limited the number of aircraft and ships the Pentagon can retire.

It was a routine play that required DJ, the fastest runner on the team, to suppress his desire to throw a triple in favor of doing what the situation dictated rather than risking a late inning in third.
But when this story was passed on to Ray Chang, the coach at DJ High School 7,000 miles away in Nanjing, China, Chang burst with pride.
“That’s great. I love hearing that,” Chang, who was born and raised in the United States, said over the phone. when these kids come to us, they’re so far behind an American kid in t…</span>

Woods was, perhaps for the last time as a British Open contender, at No. 18 on the Old Course in St. Andrews.  He had sealed two triumphs here, ended his Grand Slam career here, dreamed for decades of being here.
And now, after a tee shot under familiarly granitic Scottish skies, Woods knew it could be over, for good, in minutes.


Cheers rumbled from the stands, and not just those along No 18, as fiercely as they did when Woods tipped his cap on the Swilcan Bridge minutes after 3 p.m.  He had rubbed his eyes on the promenade, had tilted his cap a little more, and then, finally, the spectators and even the seagulls fell silent.

                              <span>&quot;This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,&quot; he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv&#x27;s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy&#x27;s predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an &quot;offended liver sausage&quot; when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Jeffrey Hall, special lecturer in Japanese studies at Japan’s Kanda University of International Studies, noted the growing online speculation that the group in question is the Unification Church, officially now known on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification that was founded by Sun Myung Moon, whose members are known colloquially as &quot;Moonies.&quot;

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine&#x27;s ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia&#x27;s attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of &quot;distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.&quot;
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. &quot;Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,&quot; Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations &quot;absurd.&quot;
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.</span>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms. There have been some cases in recent years where people illicitly made weapons themselves in Japan. But still, gun crime is very rare in Japan: last year th...</span>

Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…</span>

Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess&#x27;s enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America&#x27;s greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

Huge crowds had surrounded the leader&#x27;s home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President&#x27;s Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
&quot;The president was escorted to safety,&quot; the source added. &quot;He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit.&quot;

From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham&#x27;s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God&#x27;s order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president&#x27;s offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president&#x27;s office said.

                              <span>Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s lawsuit blaming China for COVID-19 was dismissed Friday when a federal judge ruled his court has no jurisdiction over foreign governments.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in a 38-page ruling, wrote that a federal law setting rules for when a sovereign foreign entity could be sued in U.S. courts doesn’t allow any part of the lawsuit filed by Schmitt in April 2020 to continue.

“All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh wrote.

Schmitt’s office filed a notice of appeal immediately after Limbaugh made his ruling.

When Schmitt filed the lawsuit, he claimed China was responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to cause a global pandemic by covering up the initial infection…</span>

&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,&quot; Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…</span>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
&quot;Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world&quot;, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France&#x27;s condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called &quot;absolutely unforgivable&quot;.
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.

                              <span>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
&quot;We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this,&quot; he said.

                              <span>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia&#x27;s largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney&#x27;s west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia&#x27;s east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
&quot;The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,&quot; state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia&#x27;s most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
&quot;We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,&quot; Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia&#x27;s annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia&#x27;s east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be &quot;business as usual&quot; at the forum.
Shouts of &quot;When will you stop the war&quot; and &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop the war&quot; were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.
Underlining tensions in the buildup, Retn…</span>

                              <span>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com &quot;Love Actually,&quot; asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist&#x27;s ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 &quot;Morning @snb19692,&quot; tweeted Grant. &quot;Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?&quot;
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
&quot;Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being &#x27;lynched,&#x27; as they put it, by the January 6 Committee,&quot; reported Julia Davis. &quot;Appearing on Tuesday’s…</span>
