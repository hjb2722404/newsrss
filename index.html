                              <span>Actress Amber Heard says she does not blame jurors for ruling against her in the defamation trial brought against her by former husband Johnny Depp. 

In her first interview since the verdict, Ms Heard hit back at the “hate and vitriol” on social media commentary surrounding the trial.

“Even if you think that I am lying, you still couldn’t look me in the eye and tell me that you think on social media there has been a fair representation,” she said.  

“You cannot tell me this has been fair.”</span>

19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia 
The Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. 
Militarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.

WNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky&#x27;s top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). 
Ukraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. 
I am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. 

Being straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:
 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;
 300 MLRS;
 500 tanks;
 2000 armored vehicles;
 1000 drones.
Contact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15. We are waiting for a decision.

Breaking Defense:  China ‘will fight to the very end’ over Taiwan: Chinese defense minister  
Gen. Wei Fenghe described the US Indo-Pacific strategy as &quot;an attempt to build an exclusive small group in the name of a free and open Indo-Pacific.&quot; It is designed &quot;to create conflict and confrontation, to contain and encircle others.&quot;
SINGAPORE: In a much anticipated keynote at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Chinese defense minister Gen. Wei Fenghe warned that China “will fight to the very end” if “anyone dares to secede” from China, a not-so-veiled shot at Taiwan. 
“We will fight at all costs. And we will fight to the very end. This is the only choice for China,” Wei said.

“The way that Starlink was able to upgrade when a threat showed up, we need to be able to have that ability,&quot; said Dave Tremper, the Pentagon&#x27;s director of electronic warfare. &quot;We have to be able to change our electromagnetic posture, to be able to change very dynamically what we&#x27;re trying to do without losing capability along the way.”  
WASHINGTON: The US military’s electronic warfare enterprise needs to take a page from SpaceX when it comes to responding to new threats, the Pentagon’s director for electromagnetic warfare said today.  After SpaceX sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine in February in an apparent effort to help Ukraine maintain its internet connection amid war with Russia, SpaceX founder Elon Musk claimed that Russia had jammed Starlink terminals in the country for hours at a time. 
After a software update, Starlink was operating normally, said Musk, who added on March 25 that the constellation had “resisted all hacking &amp; jamming attempts” in Ukraine.

Warzone/The Drive: The Afghan Army’s Last Commander On How His Country Really Fell 
Haibatullah Alizai recounts the final five harrowing days of his government and how he reluctantly became the Afghan Army’s last general. 
Though his President and Defense minister fled hours earlier, and with the Taliban fast approaching Kabul, Haibatullah Alizai was not ready to surrender.
It was the evening of Aug. 15, 2021. Alizai, a lauded special operations commander, had been given control of Afghanistan&#x27;s remaining army just days before. And now he was trying to convince the American Navy SEAL two-star admiral in charge of Kabul security to let him declare martial law and allow his small band of the best troops remaining in Afghanistan to keep the Taliban from entering the city.

* China regards Taiwan as part of its own territory and says that under international law this gives its rights over the whole channel 
China said on Monday it has sovereign and administrative rights to the Taiwan Strait, denying US claims that the channel consists of international waters. 
Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the strait fell within China&#x27;s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and domestic law.

Moscow Times: ‘Are There Even Any Left?’ 100 Days of War in Ukraine For an Elite Russian Unit  
On a remote plain on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border the morning of Feb. 24, hundreds of paratroopers from Russia’s 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade boarded helicopters they thought were bound for a training ground in western Belarus. 
But once the units were airborne, senior officers turned to the men to tell them that they were actually at war with Ukraine.   Instead of Grodno, they entered Ukrainian airspace on their way to Hostomel airport near the capital city of Kyiv. 
“The troops were f*****g shocked, people turned gray, especially considering we took fire in the air,” said Nikita Ponomarev, a paratrooper later captured by the Ukrainians. 
In the 100 days since the surprise assault on Hostomel, Russia’s war on Ukraine has shifted from this style of rapid maneuvering to the grinding artillery duels and the creeping Russian advances now taking place in the east of the country.

                              <span>Reuters: Hailing Peter the Great, Putin draws parallel with mission to &#x27;return&#x27; Russian lands 
(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin paid tribute on Thursday to Tsar Peter the Great on the 350th anniversary of his birth, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands. 
&quot;Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. 
He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia&#x27;s),&quot; Putin said after a visiting an exhibition dedicated to the tsar. 
 In televised comments on day 106 of his war in Ukraine, he compared Peter&#x27;s campaign with the task facing Russia today.

But June 22 is a day that is remembered by most Russians, and it is bringing back memories that are not pleasant. 
When I was a kid my father told me on a June 22 day why that date was important to him. The start of the war changed his life and the life of everyone he knew in 1941. I still remember the look that he had. It is the same look that my friends in New York City have when they remember 9/11.</span>

RFE: Interview: Edward Luttwak, A Military Adviser To Presidents, Explains How The Ukraine War Began And How It Might End 
Edward Luttwak is among modern times&#x27; most sought-after military strategists, advising the Pentagon, presidents, and prime ministers around the world. He&#x27;s also among their most controversial. Luttwak&#x27;s analyses and conclusions are often described as being blunt, unequivocal, counterintuitive, and sometimes jarringly cynical. 
A polyglot American born to Jewish parents in World War II Romania and raised in Italy and England, he is the author of seminal books like Strategy: The Logic Of War And Peace and The Grand Strategy Of The Soviet Union as well as more than a dozen others. But he is best known for his 1968 book Coup d&#x27;Etat: A Practical Handbook, which is required reading at some war colleges.

WNU Editor: I have been following Edward Luttwack since the 1980s. His analysis is usually spot on. And while I do not think his confidence in Ukraine salvaging a &quot;victory&quot; in this war is realistic, the above interview is my must read post for today.</span>

Washington Post: Biden says Zelensky &#x27;didn&#x27;t want to hear&#x27; U.S. warnings of invasion 
President Biden said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “didn’t want to hear it” when U.S. intelligence officials raised warnings of a looming Russian attack before the Feb. 24 invasion. 
Biden, who along with Congress has deepened U.S. involvement in the global effort to reject the Russian invasion by recently finalizing more than $40 billion in new military and humanitarian assistance, spoke at a Democratic fundraising event in Los Angeles on Friday night, according to the Associated Press and Bloomberg News. 
The president spoke about the American commitment to supporting Ukraine four months into the invasion, saying, “Nothing like this has happened since World War II.”

The world’s nuclear arsenal is expected to increase in the coming years for the first time since the end of cold war at a time that the risk of such weapons being used is the greatest in decades, a leading conflict and weapons thinktank has said. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and western support for Kyiv have heightened tensions among the world’s nine nuclear-armed states, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said on Monday.

The Navy’s aviation community will undergo a “safety pause” Monday in the wake of multiple fatal flight mishaps in less than two weeks. 
During the pause, units will review risk-management practices and train “on threat and error-management processes,” according to a Naval Air Forces statement. 
“In order to maintain the readiness of our force, we must ensure the safety of our people remains one of our top priorities,” the command statement said. 
Deployed units will conduct the pause at the earliest possible time.

The Guardian: Ukraine’s high casualty rate could bring war to tipping point 
Analysis: Kyiv’s fighting strength is stretched, yet Russia could now benefit from a pause in fighting 
Any way you count it, the figures are stark: Ukrainian casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 6oo and 1,000 a day. One presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told the Guardian this week it was 150 killed and 800 wounded daily; another, Mykhaylo Podolyak, told the BBC that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops a day were being killed. 
It represents an extraordinary loss of human life and capacity for the defenders, embroiled in a defence of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk that this week turned into a losing battle. Yet the city was also arguably a place that Ukraine could have retreated from to the more defensible Lysychansk, across the Siverski Donets River, the sort of defensive situation that Ukraine has fared far better in.

   RT: West has right to give Ukraine nukes – EU lawmaker 
Radoslaw Sikorski urged countries to “dissuade” Russia from using nuclear weapons against Ukraine 
The West could provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons to help defend itself against Russia, Radoslaw Sikorski, a member of the European Parliament and former Polish foreign minister, said. 
“The West has the right to give Ukraine nuclear warheads so that it could protect its independence,” Sikorski told Ukraine’s Espreso TV on Saturday.

                              <span>Reuters: Bulgaria Faces Risk of Political Instability as PM Loses Majority 
SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria&#x27;s prime minister pledged to lead a minority government on Wednesday as the populist ITN party quit the government over disagreements on budget spending and whether Bulgaria should back North Macedonia&#x27;s European Union accession. 
Kiril Petkov said he was &quot;optimistic&quot; his centrist PP party and its two remaining coalition partners could still deliver on pledges to uproot widespread corruption in the EU&#x27;s poorest member state after losing their parliamentary majority. 
But analysts say the rift is likely to bring fresh instability just as the Ukraine war causes inflation to surge. Petkov&#x27;s government only took office in December after a prolonged political crisis.

On the evening of May 31 in the central Iranian city of Yazd, an Iranian aerospace engineer was returning home from dinner with a colleague when he suddenly felt ill and collapsed into unconsciousness. 
Ayub Entezari was rushed to hospital, where he died after several unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate him, according to an Iranian opposition media outlet.   The cause of Entezari&#x27;s death: intentional poisoning, said Saudi-financed  Iran International News, which operates a news site and broadcasts satellite television newscasts from its headquarters in London.

Warzone/The Drive: Israel Has Extended The Range Of Its F-35s: Report 
Reports in the Israeli media suggest that IAF F-35s have been enhanced to hit Iranian targets unrefueled and carry at least one new weapon. 
Recent reports in the Israeli media claim that the country has developed a means of extending the range of its F-35I Adir stealth jets, allegedly providing them with enough reach to hit targets in Iran without needing aerial refueling. The development has been announced together with the integration of a new, locally developed smart bomb for internal carriage in the F-35. These apparent upgrades to the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities come as the Israeli leadership announces a harder line against Tehran’s nuclear program, while the air force conducts exercises widely thought to be dress rehearsals for potential raids against Iran.

                              <span>The opening hearing of the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol made it clear why Fox News split from every other major news network by refusing broadcast the audience during prime time.
This was so the network could continue to mislead its viewers about what happened on January 6, 2021.
ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, CNN and MSNBC broadcast the entire two-hour hearing live.  Fox News didn’t, pushing its anchors Bret Bayer and Martha MacCallum at Fox Business, while its opinion leaders aired counter-programming laden with misrepresentations and conspiracy theories about the riot.
The hearing began at 8 p.m., at the start of At Tucker Carlson Fox News broadcast.  Carlson continued to downplay the bloody riot on his show, as he has for more than a year, callin…</span>

                              <span>Nine months after my breakup, I met a mutual friend to observe the occasion of a lunar eclipse while drinking cheap red wine on her terrace.

She pulled out an old box of Christmas lights to wrap around the railing.  She looked at me with beaming eyes as she plugged them in and told me that my ex-partner had raved about me a few weeks earlier.

“She said she had never felt more loved and cared for than when she was with a black woman.”

I looked up from where I was sitting and wondered if I was going to end the night in a flurry of tipsy text messages reminding all my former lovers and friends that I’m not binary.  Instead, I poured myself more wine and drank like it wasn’t a weekday.

The sentiment seemed harmless, but being black, queer and female means you’re fighting the ‘angry black w…</span>

The mass movement coincided with a recent meeting in Los Angeles of leaders from the Western Hemisphere, where migration was a key focus.
Although migrant caravans have become a common occurrence and are usually dispersed by authorities long before they reach the southern border of the United States, the latest march of some 6,000 people walking along Mexican highways has drawn significant international attention.
[Over the weekend, Mexican immigration officials said the caravan had “dissolved” after talks with the migrants.]

“Many of us thought there would be no need to defend Gotland after the Soviet collapse,” Colonel Magnus Frykvall, commander of the Swedish Gotland Regiment, said in a telephone interview.  “It’s been put in a whole new light since the war in Ukraine in 2014, and it was even clearer to us with the current invasion.”
Exercise came as fears of a military conflict with Russia, which not so long ago seemed unimaginable in Sweden, led the country to apply for NATO membership.  Gotland poses a critical problem for Sweden, which, like Russia, borders the Baltic Sea.  Gotland is the largest i…</span>

This sound prompted families carrying bags of food, pots of coffee, soda coolers, grills, hookahs and many children into action, climbing iron ladders to get into the wagons. wooden train.
But the party had already started in car No. 9, where a group of women and dozens of children were cheering on an Arabic pop song played through a battery-powered speaker with flashing disco lights.
The train honked again and came to life, shaking the revelers, who laughed as they sat up and burst into applause at the sight of the world streaming past their windows.

                              <span>Defence Minister Richard Marles has held a breakthrough meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore.

Mr Marles met with General Wei Fenghe for more than hour on the sideline of the Shangri-La Defence Dialogue, marking the first time in three years the defence ministers of the two countries have met.

Lowy Institute Senior Fellow Richard McGregor says the meeting was “very interesting” as both Australia and China were willing to have a conversation.

He said before Mr Marles went to Singapore he said there was no meeting arranged so the occurrence of one shows both countries “decided it was about time to end the stand-off”.

“It’s important to remember though there’s no change in all the fundamental problems in the relationship, all that’s happening now is we’re talking about them,” he told Sky News Australia.

“In the case of the military that’s a good thing because it means we might be able to avoid the kind of incidents we had in the South China Sea a few months ago.”</span>

                              <span>China has ended its nearly three-year diplomatic freeze directed at Australia. 

It comes after Defence Minister Richard Marles sat down for a discussion with his Chinese counterpart on the sideline of a security summit in Singapore.

Mr Marles and Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe held a one-hour meeting at the Shangri-La Defence Summit in Singapore on Sunday where each raised concerns about one another&#x27;s nations amid rising tensions over the Indo-Pacific.</span>

The Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe says the nation only seeks peace and stability.

He is accusing the United States of being a bully and interfering in China&#x27;s internal affairs - including on Taiwan.

The US Defence Secretary on Saturday had accused Beijing of &quot;provocative and destabilising&quot; military activity and said it was up to America to improve the bilateral relationship.</span>

“They’re going to put resources into this: mental health resources, resources into the schools and that kind of thing,” he told Sky News Australia.

“But this government, this money, has to be accepted by the governments of the 50 states so they can reject the money and tell the federal government to go in a different direction.”</span>

                              <span>Joe Biden&#x27;s support within the Democratic Party seems to be declining after high-profile progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declined to endorse the president’s 2024 re-election bid.

During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said she would worry about the 2024 election after this November&#x27;s midterm elections.

“First of all, I’m focused on winning this majority right now and preserving a majority this year in 2022,” she said.

“I believe that the president has been doing a very good job so far. And should he run again, I think that we will take a look at it.”​

The comments come as more-and-more Democrats publicly raise their concerns about President Biden’s advanced age and declining popularity as the party faces a tough midterm election.</span>

                              <span>Thirteen-year-old Anne Frank began keeping her now-famous diary on June 12, 1942. She would spend a little more than two years confiding in its pages, sharing stories from daily life, observations, and hopes for the future from the cramped annex in Amsterdam she occupied with her family and several other Jews in hiding. The last entry in her diary is dated August 1, 1944, after which she was arrested and deported.</span>

VOA: Japan’s Kishida Vows Expanded Security Role in Asia  
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a plan to enhance the country’s military capability and assist Southeast Asian countries with maritime security during his Friday keynote address in Singapore before the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier security summit. 
“Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow,” he said, suggesting the Taiwan issue could pose an imminent threat to peace across East Asia. Kishida then made it clear that typically dovish Tokyo is planning to acquire counterstrike weapons to defend against potential attacks.

A lot of people /NGOs/etc. are now volunteering, freeing people like myself to get back to our normal routine.

Business Standard/ANI:  Russia-US dialogue is at unprecedented low level: Ambassador Antonov 
Russia-US dialogue is at an unprecedented low level. Trust is undermined, cooperation is collapsing even on issues of mutual interest, Russian Ambassador to US Anatoly Antonov said 
&quot;Russian-American political dialogue is at an unprecedented low level. Trust is undermined, cooperation is collapsing even on issues of obvious mutual interest. Communication between the parties is limited today,&quot; Antonov said on the air of the Bolshaya Igra (&quot;Big Game&quot;) show on Channel One, adding that the dialogue is &quot;limited to the discussion of technical issues,&quot; Sputnik reported. 
The diplomat also said that the sides currently do not conduct a dialogue on the strategic stability and called the situation &quot;wrong&quot; as the &quot;world expects concrete actions&quot; from the US and Russia. 
Antonov added that he is &quot;unaware&quot; of any unofficial dialogue between Moscow and Washington.

WASHINGTON — Even before the start of the war in Ukraine, an international alliance to rally the world against a Russian invasion came together so quickly that President Biden later marveled at the “purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.” 
Now, with the conflict in its fourth month, U.S. officials are facing the disappointing reality that the powerful coalition of nations — stretching from North America across Europe and into East Asia — may not be enough to break the looming stalemate in Ukraine.

WNU Editor: One thing that I learned in my travels is that in many places around the world many people do not like the U.S. government. The US culture/opportunities/people/etc. .... they love. The US government not so much. These unwilling governments know that, and they are going to bide their time.

And as for the current coalition that formed after the invasion. Lets see how united they are six months from now in the middle of winter.</span>

                              <span>Nearly all 50 Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times said Joe Biden (pictured on Friday) should not run for president   
Daily Mail: &#x27;To say our country was on the right track would flagrantly depart from reality&#x27;: Top Democrats say Biden should NOT run for re-election in 2024 
* Fifty top Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times said Joe Biden  should not run for re-election in 2024 president 
* Many were pessimistic about Biden&#x27;s leaderships, which is marred with failures 
* Biden failed to pass his $1.8 trillion Build Back Better agenda and voting rights expansion bill, and faced backlash over the chaotic exit from Afghanistan 
* The administration continues to face challenges from record high gas prices and soaring inflation, and a possible end to the federal abortion rights 
* Many Democratic leaders also worry about the presidents age, who was the oldest man appointed to office at 78 last January 
* Democrats are also at a loss of who should take control of the party as Republicans are expected to rack up major victories in the coming midterms 
Top Democrats across the country said President Joe Biden should not run for re-election in 2024 as they expressed worries over his current leadership and age. 
Nearly all 50 Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times feared a Biden re-election campaign would not help their party against Republicans, who are expected to make sweeping victories in the coming midterms. 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) member Steve Simeonidis, of Miami, said he was generally pessimistic about his party&#x27;s leadership and called on Biden, 79, to let someone new take over in 2024.

Her husband, Edward Grinnan, said the cause was suicide.  He said she had battled depression as well as lupus.

There are few easy answers or painless fixes when it comes to inflation, which has surged around the world as supply shortages collide with strong consumer demand.  It’s hard to predict how long today’s price spike will last, and the main tool to combat it is rising interest rates, which dampen inflation by slowing the economy – potentially sharply.

The national average gasoline price on Saturday was $5.00, up 60 cents from a month ago.  A year ago gasoline was selling for $3.08, according to the AAA automobile club.  The national average is at its highest level since March, when it topped his previous record set in July 2008, when oil was trading at over $133…</span>

                              <span>With 44 million Medicare beneficiaries and an annual test costing around $1,000 a year, plus expensive scans and biopsies for those who test positive, the price could be substantial.
He and other critics warn the risks of triggering the tests are substantial.  As paradoxical as it may seem, finding cancers earlier could mean as many deaths, at the same time, as without early diagnosis.  Indeed, at least with current treatments, cancers meant to kill are not necessarily cured if caught early.
And there are other risks.  For example, some will test positive, but doctors will be unable to locate the cancer.  Others will be aggressively treated with surgery or chemotherapy for cancers that, if left alone, would not have grown and spread and may even be gone.
Dr. Beer acknowledges that a blood test for cancer “is not without risk or cost, and will not detect all cancers”.
But, he said, “I think there’s the promise of real impact.”
Other experts are worried.
Dr. Barnett Kramer, a member of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine and former director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, worries that testing will go mainstream without ever showing it’s beneficial .  Once that happens, he said, “it’s hard to ring the bell.”
“Hopefully we’re not halfway to a nightmare,” Dr. Kramer said.
Damocles syndrome
When Susan Iorio Bell, 73, a nurse who lives in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, saw an ad on Facebook recruiting women her age for a cancer blood test study, she immediately signed up.  This aligned with his advocacy of preventive medicine and his belief in clinical trials.

Then a piece of the ceiling above the leak collapsed.  The super covered the hole with cardboard but never fixed the leak or the ceiling.  I called several times, and he always says “tomorrow” but never solves the problem.  I also called management twice and sent pictures.  The wall seems to be getting moldy.  The cardboard begins to crumble.  What should I do?
A: You can do lots of things.  Start by calling 311 to request an inspection at Department of Housing Preservation and Development.  An inspector would most likely issue a violation, which might not solve your problem immediately, but would create a paper trail of evidence.

                              <span>The federal government’s top auto safety agency is dramatically expanding an investigation into Tesla and its Autopilot driver assistance system to determine whether the technology poses a safety risk.
The agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said Thursday it was update of its preliminary assessment from autopilot to technical analysis, a deeper level of scrutiny that is required before a recall can be ordered.
The analysis will examine whether the Autopilot fails to prevent drivers from diverting their attention from the road and engaging in other predictable and risky behaviors while using the system.


“We’ve been calling for a closer look at Autopilot for some time,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, which coord…</span>

                              <span>It’s an enigma.  No one knows for sure why dolphins are seen more frequently and for longer periods in and around New York Harbor, the giant estuary where salty ocean tides mix with fresh water from the Hudson River.
“We’ve had a ton of sightings,” said Maxine Montello, an official with the New York Maritime Rescue Center.  “It’s a glory to see stronger populations but also a worry because there’s increased overlap with humans and shared resources,” she said, particularly during the summer months when more and more tourists and pleasure craft ply the bustling waters.
The dolphin revival around metropolitan New York – which has the most developed coastline in the country – stands in stark contrast to the grim periods of disease and soaring death rates that have periodically plagued the wate…</span>

                              <span>Valery Ryumin, a Soviet tank commander who became a cosmonaut and spent more than a year in space, setting endurance records – then, after 18 years, took another flight, this time on a space shuttle American – died on Monday.  He was 82 years old.
The Russian federal space company, Roscosmos, announced his death.  Dmitry Rogozin, the company’s director, called Mr Ryumin’s death an “irreparable loss”, but did not say where he died or name the cause.
Mr Ryumin’s first mission, on Soyuz 25, was supposed to last 90 days, but ended after just two when the vehicle failed to dock with the Salyut 6 orbital space station.


During his next two missions, Mr. Ryumin and his teammates set space endurance records: 175 days with Vladimir Lyakhov on Soyuz 32 in 1979 and 185 days with Leonid Popov on Soyu…</span>

It’s the final leg of a journey of thousands of miles, as the butterflies travel from their North American breeding grounds to their winter colonies, where they cover the fir trees.  Visitors who time their trips correctly may find the air so laden with monarchs that they can hear the flapping wings of butterflies.
“It’s a to-do list,” said Andrew Davis, an ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens.  “Imagine being surrounded by billions of butterflies. It’s a magical experience.
It is also one that may not last.  In recent decades, the number of Monarchs overwintering in Mexico and overwintering sites in Southern California droppedwhich raises fears that the species is seriously threatened with ext…</span>
