                              <span>Former US President Donald Trump has criticised the “grotesque effort” of human suffering to advance extreme political agendas – slamming President Biden’s “highly dangerous” rhetoric. 

Mr Trump said cynical politicians are “seeking to exploit the tears of sobbing families”.

“When Joe Biden blamed the gun lobby, he was talking about Americans like you,” he told the audience at the NRA conference. 

“He was shamefully suggesting that Republicans are somehow okay with letting school shootings happen,” he said. 

“This rhetoric is highly divisive and dangerous, and most importantly, it’s wrong.”</span>

Mr Trump asked members of the NRA for a moment of silence as he read the names of the children killed in the Texas school.

“Each precious young soul that was taken is an incomprehensible loss,” he said. 

“Stolen from us by a malice that no words can describe.”</span>

Mr Cruz said everybody is horrified by mass murders and pointed to the media’s blame on members of the NRA. 

“We must not react to evil and tragedy by abandoning the constitution,” he said. 

“Now is not the time for lies, or empty political gestures.”</span>

A more united Security Council originally imposed sanctions after North Korea&#x27;s first nuclear test in 2006 – and tightened them over the years.</span>

“Every building should have a single point of entry,” he said. 

“Above all, from this day forward every school in America should have a police officer or an armed resource officer on duty at all times.”</span>

Something is wrong in America.  We don’t know how to stop aggression and death.
The massacres in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas have once again shaken us.  We are preparing to fight the scourge of gun violence that threatens every part of the country: grocery stores and churches, street corners and malls, and schools full of schoolchildren.
Everyday life gives the impression at any moment that it could turn into horror.
In the midst of it all, our games continue.  Important matches with remarkable …</span>

                              <span>Also, look a little deeper and clay can give Gauff as much benefit as she gets out of it.  At 5-foot-9, Gauff is about the average height of top players these days, but she has long legs.  This can help her cover a lot of ground in a few quick steps, but it can make balls that sit low on grass and hard courts a little more difficult for her.
If there was a common thread running through Gauff’s first three matches, it was how often she was well placed.  The balls hit the clay and bounce right into her strike zone, giving her a series of belt-high fastballs she can play on, while taking advantage of the extra split second the clay gives her to put her feet or slide into position.
Always aggressive and on the hunt for forehands, she will inevitably make her share of mistakes, but so far she has hit more winners than unforced errors, which is always a good sign for any player.  She also rarely appeared unbalanced.
“I really like sliding,” she said.  “I think it helps me recover faster after I reach the ball. Then also, I mean, I play pretty hard on my forehand, so I think the clay bounces the ball even higher.
For her part, Anisimova, 20, also spent most of her childhood in Florida, but she said she became more comfortable on clay largely by playing numerous junior tournaments in the Latin American countries, where red clay is also much more common than her.  is in the United States.
Anisimova is a dangerous returner, capable of punishing slower serves, especially with her near-death backhand.  She also knows that her footwork and movement may be the weakest part of her still-developing game, and longer points on clay inevitably require her to cover more ground.  Clay makes his weakness a little less weak. 
“It gives me more time,” she said of clay after her victory over Muchova.  “Hard courts can sometimes be a bit too fast.”

                              <span>LIVERPOOL, England — Luis Díaz shows his forearm and places a finger on his wrist, as if taking his own pulse.  He does it without breaking eye contact, without stopping to breathe.  He doesn’t seem to notice that he’s doing it.  It’s a reflexive, unconscious movement, the best way to demonstrate what it means.
Díaz does not speak, he says, Wayúu, the language of Colombia’s indigenous community to which he can trace his roots.  He also does not wear traditional clothes or maintain any customs.  Life took him away from La Guajira, a strip of land bordered by the Caribbean Sea on one side and Venezuela on the other, the Wayúu homeland.
That’s when he traces his veins with his finger, feels his heartbeat.  “I feel Wayúu,” he says.  He may not be – by his own estimation – a “pure” Wayúu, but t…</span>

It’s been a devastating week for the people of Uvalde, Texas, but also for a nation struggling to understand how this kind of horror can happen again.
The gruesome details of 19 elementary school children and two adults killed by a lunatic 18 year old who had just purchased two assault weapons shortly after his birthday were painfully difficult to digest.  And the predictable rhetorical pattern that followed this tragedy sounds like the worst version of groundhog day already.
Like every other mass shooting that has come before, the immediate aftermath of the Uvalde school shooting saw political media rhetoric fall apart with two clear subgroups.
On the one hand, there was anger and disgust that such an event could happen again and an immediate call for policies that could …</span>

A recent court ruling found that racism operates in the Greenfield Police Department.  Mayor Roxann Wedegartner’s response demonstrates that she is not listening to a diverse constituency and failing to collaborate with city officials and employees.  First, she said she would consider appealing the verdict (with taxpayers’ money).  She does not seem to grasp that racism is pervasive in all American institutions.  No matter how well-meaning European Americans are, change will never happen without this fundamental recognition.  The court’s decision is an invitation, a mandate, to review the policy and make amends.  Let the judgment be an opportunity for change, not hunkering down with secure blinders.  Second, alleging that he lied under oath, Wedegartner discharged the white police officer who testified on behalf of the black officer who brought the case.  And she confined him to his house during working hours!  Is she judge, prosecutor and jury?  I am delighted with the number of citizens who joined in testifying outside of City Hall as well as the members of Council who spoke.  In the civil rights movement of the 60s, a favorite freedom song was “Which Side Are You On?”  Mayor Wedegartner, which side are you on?

The price of regular gasoline in California has already risen to over $6 a gallon, and it’s nearly impossible to find gasoline under $4 anywhere else.  Nationally, prices have risen nearly 50 cents per gallon in the past month.
The war in Ukraine is the most immediate cause of the price spike, as global refiners, tankers and traders shun Russian exports, pulling up to three million barrels of oil a day off the market.  Energy traders have also pushed up oil prices in hopes that Western governments will impose even tougher sanctions on Russia and its energy industry.
But another reason for the high prices is that, in sp…</span>

                              <span>More importantly, though, it negated nearly all of the reviews.  It was instructive, for example, to read most Madrid media accounts of the Mbappé deal.  Rather than a defeat for Madrid, Mbappé’s decision was presented as that of a mercenary and a traitor, a defector who gave his word to Pérez and then betrayed him.
Mbappé’s family were so distressed by this depiction that his mother decided to correct it publicly, claiming on Twitter that her son had never ‘gave his word’ to Real Madrid.
That he chose ‘El Chiringuito’ for his first appearance to discuss Super League was no accident either.  The show regularly features prominent Madrid supporters journalists known to burst into tears over the club’s successes, or rail against those – Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard – who are deemed to have brought dishonor to the club.
The spectacle is not, in this, an outlier.  Pérez oversees a vast network of soft news media, dependent not only on his grace and favor for information and access, but also intimidated by the breadth and weight of his business interests.  Pérez always claimed he was only powerful because he was Real Madrid president, but that’s not entirely true.  It is also powerful in many other ways.
This allowed him to lead Real Madrid as he sees fit.  Despite its size, the club’s hierarchy is relatively tight, with many recruitment decisions overseen by Pérez;  its general manager, José Ángel Sanchez;  and his chief scout, Juni Calafat.  Real Madrid is, in that sense, something of an aberration, almost a throwback to a time when most of its peers have diversified and deepened their personnel.
Pérez would say, of course, that it works: five Champions League finals in nine years is all the proof he needs.  This is perhaps his greatest gift.  No matter what he does, no matter how unlikely it seems, Pérez has a remarkable ability to emerge triumphant.
This may have been the year that destabilized the kingdom he so painstakingly built.  Rather, it could turn out to be the year that cemented him for good.

A Google video search of the terms “Fox News” and “crime” returns countless results from various crime segments.  Meanwhile, on Fox News.com, his national “CRIME” label is filled with new messages several times an hour during the day.

I am not a lawyer.  However, that does not prevent me from understanding the absurdity of the originalist approach to the Constitution.  
Although I am amazed that 55 men devoted just under four months at the end of the 18th century to produce another type of government, I am clear-headed about their accomplishment.  History reveals that they weren’t totally on board, as only 42 appeared at the signing.  Three of those present were uncomfortable and refused to sign.  However, imagine how rare it is for 55 people, crammed into one room, to agree on everything.
And they were men.  Founding Fathers, the name coined by Warren G. Harding, is too patriarchal.  I prefer the Founders.  I know of only two offstage contributors: Abigail Ada…</span>

Georgian voters turned out in record numbers to vote in the 2022 primary election, in a complete beating of the leftist media narrative that the electoral reform law enacted last year amounted to “Jim Crow 2.0”.
The law was met with outrageous claims from cable news pundits when it was signed into law.
MSNBC Host Joy Reid called the law like “putting Georgia back on an express train in Jim Crow times”.
“These laws are not only stupid, these laws are not only racist, but they are destructive to a functioning democracy”, mentioned MSNBC Contributor Jason Johnson.
MSNBC anchor Tiffany Cross called Georgia’s “voter suppression” law.
CNN anchor Don Lemon tagged it “Jim Crow 2.0” and “nothing less than an attack on the right to vote”.

Reuters: Brussels says about $24 bln of Russian central bank assets frozen in EU, less than expected 
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Reuters) - European Union states have reported the freezing of about 23 billion euros ($24.5 billion) of assets of the Russian Central Bank, a top EU official said on Wednesday, revealing for the first time a figure that was expected to be much higher. 
Russia has publicly said that Western sanctions led to the freezing of about $300 billion of its central bank&#x27;s assets globally. 
Of these frozen assets, only less than one-tenth is in the EU, according to information that the European Commission has collected from the 27 EU governments, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told a news conference.
He said that about 23 billion euros had been frozen in the EU since the start of the war in Ukraine in February, a figure that is dwarfed by the $100 billion frozen by the United States.

WNU Editor: This is far less than the $300 billion that was previously reported. The U.S. says they have seized $100 billion. Reuters is also saying that its sources in Moscow are saying that worldwide $300 billion in assets has been frozen. But I have been following this story since day one. And if you dig deep the Kremlin and the Russian Central Bank have never officially said how much money has been seized.  
I know two months before the invasion the Kremlin told many Russian companies to pull out their money from the West in the event of more sanctions being imposed. It looks like many followed this warning. It also looks like the Russian government has far more money than what they are acknowledging.</span>

China is pursuing a sweeping regional economic security deal with Pacific nations that would dramatically expand its influence and reach into those countries, in a pact that has western countries and some Pacific leaders deeply worried. 
The wide-ranging deal lays out China’s vision for a much closer relationship with the Pacific, especially on security matters, with China proposing it would be involved in training police, cybersecurity, sensitive marine mapping and gaining greater access to natural resources.

   Warzone/The Drive: Mysterious South China Sea Missile Launch Claimed To Be Caught By Airliner (Updated) 
Video taken from an airliner appears to show the launch of a missile from a ship or a submarine in the South China Sea. 
Video has emerged on social media that is said to show an apparent launch of a missile, possibly from a submarine, as viewed from a Cathay Pacific Boeing 777 flying over the South China Sea. Unseen individuals can be heard in the clip talking about whether it is heading their way. 
Twitter user @jchovernut, a pilot for U.S.-based airline Allegiant Air and a veteran of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s submarine community, posted the video, seen below, online on Tuesday. &quot;They were over the South China Sea &amp; were issued a last-minute hectic call from ATC: &#x27;turn left 90 degrees immediately!!,&#x27;&quot; according to one Tweet accompanying the video.

Maritime Executive: Iran&#x27;s IRGC Turns a Panamax Boxship Into a Warship  
Iran&#x27;s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) operates its own naval division, and while it is known best for its small armed speedboats, it is about to begin operating a far larger class of warship. 
Open-source intelligence analysts have obtained a photo of what appears to be a new IRGC &quot;base ship&quot; in shipyard at Bandar Abbas. The newly-renamed Shahid Mahdavi wears a coat of haze gray, and she has new gun emplacements on the stern, but open-source intelligence analysts have noticed that her lines are otherwise identical to the Iranian-flagged container ship Sarvin.

RFE: Iranian Oil Seized From Formerly Russian-Flagged Tanker Stopped Off Greece  
The United States has confiscated Iranian oil held on a Russian-operated ship near the Greek island of Evia in the Aegean Sea, according to news reports quoting Greek sources. 
 Following a &quot;judicial intervention by U.S. authorities concerning the ship&#x27;s cargo,&quot; the process is currently under way for the oil &quot;to be handed over&quot; at U.S. government expense, an unidentified official quoted on May 26 by the AP news agency said. 
The vessel was temporarily seized by Greek authorities on April 15 when it anchored off the port of Karystos on Evia. At the time, it was flying a Russian flag and was carrying a crew of 19 Russians.

Gen. Cavoli is nominated to be NATO&#x27;s next commander.  
The US general nominated to be the next commander of NATO suggested in a Senate hearing on Thursday that he may offer military options to facilitate grain exports from Ukraine and help break Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s southern coast. 
When asked what NATO could do about Russia’s blockade, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who currently serves as the commander of US Army Forces in Europe and Africa, said if he’s confirmed, he would “provide the military options required by our civilian leaders.” 
“Clearly the way we would approach that would have to be a whole of government approach, which may or may not include a military component,” he added.

   Washington Post: Ukrainian volunteer fighters in the east feel abandoned 
DRUZHKIVKA, Ukraine — Stuck in their trenches, the Ukrainian volunteers lived off a potato per day as Russian forces pounded them with artillery and Grad rockets on a key eastern front line. Outnumbered, untrained and clutching only light weapons, the men prayed for the barrage to end — and for their own tanks to stop targeting the Russians. 
“They [Russians] already know where we are, and when the Ukrainian tank shoots from our side it gives away our position,” said Serhi Lapko, their company commander, recalling the recent battle. “And they start firing back with everything — Grads, mortars. 
“And you just pray to survive.”

TASS: West has declared total war on Russian World — Lavrov  
The top diplomat warned that the Western policy of &quot;cancelling&quot; Russia would continue for a long time 
MOSCOW, May 27. /TASS/. The West has declared a total war on Russia and the Russian world, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday. 
&quot;The West has declared a total war on us, on the Russian World. Nobody makes any secret of this,&quot; Lavrov said at a meeting of the Council of the heads of Russia’s constituent territories at the Foreign Ministry. 
Lavrov warned that the Western policy of &quot;cancelling&quot; Russia would continue for a long time.

WNU Editor: This is a transformation for Lavorv. From saying in March that the West has declared ‘total war’ on Russia (link here), to total war on the &quot;Russian world&quot;. He is tapping into the perception among many Russians that the West is waging a Russiaphobe campaign.

The Hill: US effort to impose tougher UN sanctions on North Korea blocked by China, Russia  
China and Russia on Thursday blocked an effort to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations Security Council that was led by the U.S. after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un conducted a spate of missile tests this year, including the launch of several intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
Both China and Russia hold veto powers at the U.N. Security Council, which they exercised after the introduction of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) — North Korea’s official name — for the tests with more restrictive sanctions.

CNN: US preparing to approve advanced long-range rocket system for Ukraine 
Washington (CNN)The Biden administration is preparing to step up the kind of weaponry it is offering Ukraine by sending advanced, long-range rocket systems that are now the top request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials say. 
The administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. 
Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a gamechanger in their war against Russia.

                              <span>Created on the island of Sicily in the mid-19th century, Cosa Nostra soon became one of the most powerful branches of the Italian mafia. In 1986, the Italian justice system launched a counter-offensive, with the Palermo prosecutor&#x27;s office leading the charge. Judge Giovanni Falcone became a symbol of the fight against the mafia but on May 23, 1992, he was killed in a car bombing, along with his wife and three bodyguards. His colleague and friend Paolo Borsellino was murdered less than two months later. Three decades on, our correspondents report on how these assassinations by Cosa Nostra sparked an awakening and an ongoing fight against the mafia.</span>

                              <span>The ethnic minority Rohingya Muslims suffer severe persecution in Myanmar. Following a deadly crackdown by the Burmese army in 2017, some 740,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, where they were settled in the southern town of Cox’s Bazar. Five years on, the town is home to the world’s largest and most dangerous refugee camp, with frequent floods, fires and gang wars. In December 2020, the Bangladeshi government decided to relocate some of the Rohingya refugees to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal. Our reporters Alban Alvarez and Mathilde Cusin managed to gain access to it.</span>

While technically a defeat, the two-week battle nevertheless won tremendous respect for General Charles de Gaulle’s Free French – and helped set the stage for the famous British victory at El Alamein, which months later turned the tide of war in the West. FRANCE 24 looks back at the Battle of Bir Hakeim, 80 years later.</span>

                              <span>A recent statement released by French authorities has pledged France and Australia to “rebuild” a bilateral relationship – after accusing the previous Morrison government of a “breach of trust”. 

It comes as France accused its allies “of stabbing it in the back” – when Australia opted for nuclear-powered submarines to be built with US and British technology.

Following Australia’s federal election outcome, French President Emmanuel Macron called Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to congratulate him on his election win.

The full statement released by French authorities says:  

“After acknowledging the severe breach of trust following the decision of the previous prime minister, Scott Morrison to terminate the submarine contracts, the French president and Australia&#x27;s prime minister have agreed to rebuild a bilateral relation based on trust and respect to jointly overcome global challenges, foremost among which is the climate emergency and the strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific.”</span>

Mr Smith said Ms Wong will bring pro-active foreign policy and will be an effective Foreign Minister.

“Access to our labour markets … that’s what Pacific Islanders really want.”</span>

                              <span>Jurors have finished hearing evidence from actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard in their defamation trial.

Ms Heard returned to the stand for the last time ahead of closing arguments.

She claims she has been &quot;harassed, humiliated and threatened&quot; every day since accusing her former husband of physical and sexual abuse.

She was questioned if she was surprised by the number of people testifying against her.

British model Kate Moss denied rumours she was pushed down stairs by Mr Depp while they were dating.

Mr Depp has denied ever hitting Ms Heard.</span>

                              <span>British supermodel Kate Moss denying Amber Heard&#x27;s claim her former boyfriend Johnny Depp abused her was the &quot;quickest testimony&quot; of the whole trial, says Mitry Lawyers&#x27; Richard Mitry.

Mr Mitry said Ms Moss&#x27; testimony was not pivotal to the outcome of the case but was important because it &quot;directly refuted&quot; Ms Heard&#x27;s claim about Depp in her statement.

During Ms Heard’s testimony, she mentioned Kate Moss and a rumour that the actor once pushed the model down a flight of stairs, leaving the door open for Depp’s legal team to bring her in to take the stand.

Ms Moss denied rumours she was pushed down stairs by Mr Depp while they were dating.

&quot;By Kate Moss not only denying that in all of three minutes, which is probably the quickest testimony in this whole trial, categorically stating good things about him – naturally it&#x27;s going to help his case.&quot;</span>

The discussion topics covered nanotechnology, antenna design, 6G networks and much more, with five leading scientists outlining the latest research and potential applications of breakthrough technologies. The series attracted an international audience of over 2,000 scholars and guests.     The power of plasmonic biosensors    Nanotechnology and its biosensor applications are becoming ever more prevalent in the field of biomedical microsystems.   Kicking things off on March 1, Professor Stella W. Pang, Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Centre for Biosystems, Neuroscience, and Nanotechnology at CityU, spoke about “Nanotechnology for High-Performance Devices and Sensors”.     Noting the increased use of plasmonic sensors, she explained the ability of nanoimprint technology “to generate a large area of nanostructures within a few seconds”, showing high reproducibility and throughput. The novel 3D multiple layer plasmonic biosensors exhibit enhanced electric fields and a much higher sensitivity. This made it possible to detect lung cancer A549 live cells and nanoscale DNAs at very low concentrations by monitoring the highly sensitive resonance peak shift.   Also, hybrid coupling of plasmonic and photonic crystal modes leads to a record high sensitivity of 1376 nm/refractive index unit. “Combining these biosensors with 3D engineered platforms, we can separate cancer cells from normal cells for identification, which will further improve the sensitivity such that cancer patients could be diagnosed at a much earlier stage, potentially saving millions of lives,”…</span>

Reuters: Exclusive-U.S. and Ukraine Discuss Danger of Escalation as New Arms Extend Kyiv&#x27;s Reach 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the United States and its allies provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated arms, Washington has held discussions with Kyiv about the danger of escalation if it strikes deep inside Russia, U.S. and diplomatic officials tell Reuters. 
The behind-the-scenes discussions, which are highly sensitive and have not been previously reported, do not put explicit geographic restrictions on the use of weapons supplied to Ukrainian forces. 
But the conversations have sought to reach a shared understanding of the risk of escalation, three U.S. officials and diplomatic sources said.

                              <span>OilPrice.com: Here&#x27;s How Russian Crude Is Finding Its Way To Customers 
* Refinitiv Eikon: Greece has emerged as a new hub for Russian oil via ship-to-ship (STS) loadings. 
* Vortexa: Russia has been increasing fuel exports to Greece, with shipments set to jump to about 2.5 million barrels. 
* Trading Russian crude and oil products remain legal for now. 
Small tankers and ship-to-ship transfers are being used to keep the flow of Russian oil to China steady, Bloomberg reported this week, citing sources from the brokering industry.
Typically, the report notes, Russian ESPO crude is shipped directly to China. But lately, buyers are opting for loading the crude on small tankers and shipping it to South Korean waters, from where it is loaded onto supertankers and then taken to China. 
According to Bloomberg’s sources, the change is a result of reprioritization among buyers as shipowners avoid loading Russian oil because of Western sanctions. Currently, almost all of the ESPO available for sale is going to China.

Rigzone/Bloomberg: Saudi Arabia Making $1B From Oil Exports Every Day  
Saudi Arabia’s oil exports reached $30 billion in March, the highest in at least six years, driven by a rally in oil prices and rising production. 
The value of crude exports, now almost $1 billion a day, increased by 123% year on year, the kingdom’s statistics office said. 
Saudi Arabia’s crude production rose to 10.3 million barrels a day in March, with Brent oil prices averaging $112 a barrel. Prices have jumped almost 50% this year, mostly due to the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The higher revenues helped the kingdom post a 57.5 billion riyal ($15 billion) budget surplus between January and March. It will be one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

WASHINGTON — Newly disclosed documents have shed a crack of light on secret executive branch plans for apocalyptic scenarios — like the aftermath of a nuclear attack — when the president may activate wartime powers for national security emergencies. 
Until now, public knowledge of what the government put into those classified directives, which invoke emergency and wartime powers granted by Congress or otherwise claimed by presidents, has been limited to declassified descriptions of those developed in the early Cold War. 
In that era, they included steps like imposing martial law, rounding up people deemed dangerous and censoring news from abroad.

Afghanistan: Nearly 20 million going hungry  
Nearly 20 million people in Afghanistan – almost half the population – are facing acute hunger, humanitarians warned in a UN-backed report, published on Monday. 
The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis for the country also revealed a pocket of “catastrophic” levels of food insecurity in the northeast, affecting thousands. 
The analysis was conducted in January and February by partners who include the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sister agency the World Food Programme (WFP), and many non-governmental organizations.

And they.ve decided, it is their prime time to demand anything, so as not to destroy European unity, &quot;Zerkal was indignant.

                              <span>Reuters: EU to make breaking sanctions against Russia a crime, seizing assets easier 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to make breaking European Union sanctions against Russia a crime, a move that would allow EU governments to confiscate assets of companies and individuals that evade EU restrictions against Moscow. 
Breaking EU sanctions on Russia is now a criminal offence in 12 EU countries. It is either an administrative or a criminal offence in 13 and two treat it only as an administrative offence, Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said. Penalties for sanction breaking across the EU vary accordingly. 
The Commission proposal aims to unify that approach to make sanctions evasion a serious crime in all members of the 27-nation bloc, he told a news conference.

ABC News Australia: US and Japanese warplanes in show of strength following North Korean missile launches 
US jet fighters have joined Japanese warplanes in a show of strength, a day after North Korea launched ballistic missiles into the waters separating it with Japan. 
The exercise was meant to &quot;showcase combined capabilities to deter and counter regional threats&quot;, the US military said in a statement. The flight of eight aircraft consisted of four American F-16 jets and four Japanese F-15 warplanes, according to Japan&#x27;s Air Self-Defence Force. 
Japan and the United States wanted to show their combined resolve in the wake of North Korea&#x27;s latest missile launches, two US officials told Reuters anonymously.

Rigzone: Oil Inventories Down to Dangerously Low Point 
 Crude oil inventories are down to a dangerously low point across Europe, North America, and OECD Asia just as OPEC+ spare production capacity has dwindled to the lowest levels since April 2020. 
That’s according to a new BofA Global Research report, which was sent to Rigzone on Monday. The report also highlighted that petroleum product inventories have fallen to “precarious levels” for middle distillates and gasoline “as the market heads into the peak of the U.S. driving season”. 
“As a result, refined petroleum cracks have recently spiked to record levels, contributing to boost volatility across the oil complex,” the BofA Global Research report stated.

   CNN: &#x27;They were shooting directly at the journalists&#x27;: New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted attack by Israeli forces 
(CNN)Several shots ring out in quick succession, cutting through a clear, blue spring morning in Jenin, in the West Bank. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack. 
The cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: &quot;Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!&quot; 
When the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue.   There&#x27;s no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked &quot;Press.&quot;

Reuters: Tanks, but no ammo – Germany&#x27;s Ukraine pledges show military muddle 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Four weeks ago, Germany agreed to send dozens of anti-aircraft tanks to help defend Ukraine from Russia&#x27;s invasion, part of what it called a turning-point after decades of military restraint. 
Berlin says it can deliver the first Gepard tanks in July.  That&#x27;s too slow, a Ukrainian parliamentarian said on Tuesday, as Russian forces launched an assault on the country&#x27;s east. 
&quot;For us, July is like, &#x27;what?&#x27;&quot; Anastasia Radina, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, told Reuters at the World Economic Forum.

Reuters: Biden&#x27;s public approval falls to 36%, lowest of his presidency -Reuters/Ipsos 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s public approval rating fell this week to 36%, the lowest level of his presidency, as Americans suffered from rising inflation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday. 
The two-day national poll found that 59% of Americans disapprove of Biden&#x27;s job performance. His overall approval was down six percentage points from 42% last week. 
Biden&#x27;s approval rating has been below 50% since August, raising alarms that his Democratic Party is on track to lose control of at least one chamber of Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm election.

                              <span>Axios: Scoop: Israel rejects U.S. request to approve missile transfer to Ukraine 
Israel turned down a U.S. request to allow Berlin to supply Ukraine with anti-tank missiles produced in Germany with Israeli technology under an Israeli license, two U.S. and Israeli officials said. 
Why it matters: The issue of weapons supply is one of the last policy differences between the U.S. and Israel when it comes to the war. 
Under pressure from the Biden administration, Israel has adjusted its policy toward Moscow and gradually taken a more pro-Ukraine position than it did when Russia began its invasion. But it has so far not supplied advanced weaponry to Ukraine. 
Driving the news: Amir Eshel, director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, visited Washington two weeks ago for talks with Pentagon officials on security cooperation between the U.S. and Israel.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday called for “total help” from other countries as Russian forces continue to advance in the eastern region of Ukraine amid Moscow’s ongoing invasion of the country. 
In an address, Zelensky stressed Ukraine’s need for aid from other countries, saying that Russian forces have significantly more equipment and soldiers than Ukraine in some places and adding that Moscow’s “desire to fight still remains.” 
“The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who defend the state are resisting the extremely fierce offensive of Russian troops in the east. 
In some areas, the enemy is substantially superior in terms of equipment, number of soldiers,” Zelensky said. “The Russian authorities have made an illustrative decision — they have allowed to hire older people for contract service. That is, they no longer have enough young people, but the desire to fight still remains.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday slammed former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for suggesting earlier this week that Ukraine cede some territory to Russia in the name of peace. 
In a Wednesday address, Zelensky said Kissinger “emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia” and that Kissinger’s “calendar is not 2022, but 1938” — a reference to the Munich Agreement, which allowed for Nazi Germany to annex land in western Czechoslovakia. 
“Behind all these geopolitical speculations of those who advise Ukraine to give away something to Russia, ‘great geopoliticians’ are always unwilling to see ordinary people,” Zelensky said. “Millions of those who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace. You must always see people.”

                              <span>US reporter Chris Nguyen says it “remains to be seen” whether the US will enact stronger gun reform, following the horrific Texas school shooting. 

It comes after 19 children and two adults were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde on Tuesday. 

“Many folks say, you know; enough is enough,” Mr Nguyen told Sky News Australia. 

“Others say, don’t politicise this.”</span>

Reuters: Russia offers fast-track citizenship to residents of occupied Ukraine 
Russian forces launched offensives on towns in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, with constant mortar bombardment destroying several houses and killing civilians.
President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday simplifying the process for residents of Ukraine&#x27;s Russian-occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions to acquire Russian citizenship and passports. 
The decree extends a scheme available since 2019 to residents of areas controlled by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine&#x27;s Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

* Russians are also pushing north and west from Popansa, in all-out effort to surround cities from the south

ABC News Australia: China seeks region-wide Pacific Islands agreement, FSM decries draft plan as threatening &#x27;regional stability&#x27; 
Foreign Minister Penny Wong is promising to blitz the Pacific with a host of visits over coming weeks as Australia grapples with the fallout from a renewed push by China to dramatically expand security and commercial ties with the region. 
On Wednesday, Reuters revealed that China will seek a region-wide deal with almost a dozen Pacific islands, covering policing, security and data communications cooperation. 
A draft communique and five-year action plan sent by Beijing to 10 Pacific islands ahead of a foreign ministers meeting on May 30 prompted pushback from at least one of the invited nations, which says it showed China&#x27;s intent to control the region and &quot;threatens regional stability&quot;.

(Bloomberg) -- The top U.S. envoy to Iran nuclear talks says efforts to revive the 2015 agreement are faltering but that he believes offering Tehran “limited” sanctions relief could still salvage the accord and provide the basis for a broader deal. 
In testimony prepared for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Wednesday, Special Envoy Robert Malley says that a return to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action would help keep a lid on Iranian nuclear activity that accelerated after President Donald Trump’s 2018 decision to pull out of the deal despite an array of punishing sanctions.

Ukraine’s top military intelligence official says he knows just how long Vladimir Putin’s army can last. 
As Russian forces enter the third month of war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin only has enough supplies and equipment to last him another 12 months on the war effort, according to Ukrainian intelligence. 
And by the end of the year, Putin’s military’s juices will be running out, Ukraine’s top military spy, Kyrylo Budanov, said in a newly published interview.
“The active phase should go to the maximum decline by the end of the year,” Budanov told local newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda. “Russia has 12 months of resources to wage a normal war.”

Chinese military researchers have been drawing up plans to destroy Elon Musk&#x27;s Starlink satellite system should Beijing deem it a threat to Chinese national security. 
A paper published last month stated that China needs to develop capabilities to track and monitor and if necessary destroy each and every Starlink satellite in orbit around the Earth.

Japan, which hosts the largest number of American troops outside of U.S. territory, is the linchpin of Washington&#x27;s power projection in the Pacific. The U.S. ally is also among the nations most likely to be involved in a potential defense of Taiwan in the future.

                              <span>Mark F. Cancian, CSIS: What Does $40 Billion in Aid to Ukraine Buy?  
Congress has approved $40 billion in aid for Ukraine and other countries affected by the conflict―the sixth aid package since the war began. A major change is that this package looks ahead months rather than weeks. 
The aid package provides $19 billion for immediate military support to Ukraine, continuing the effort that has been vital to sustaining Ukrainian resistance, and $3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe. The package also contains about $16 billion for economic support to Ukraine, global humanitarian relief, and a wide variety of international programs as well as $2 billion for long-term support to NATO allies and DOD modernization programs. 
Although some elements of the aid package will be available quickly, many will take years to fully implement. This raises questions about why long-term elements could not have gone through the regular congressional authorization and budget processes.

WNU Editor: This is where the $40 billion US aid package is going .... 
$3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe 
$16 billion for economic support to Ukraine and global humanitarian relief 
$2 billion for long-term support to NATO allies and DOD modernization programs 
Hmmmm .... $21.9 billion already spent and none of it is going to the Ukraine military. 
As for the rest .... 
$6 billion for training, equipment, weapons, logistic support, supplies and services, salaries and stipends and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of Ukraine (and the specifics of the expenditures remain to be determined). 
$9 billion to replenish U.S. weapons stocks already sent to Ukraine. 
$4 billion for the Foreign Military Financing Program (this allows a foreign country like Ukraine to buy brand new weapon systems). 
The last number .... $4 billion .... is what the Ukraine military will be getting to spend on new weapon systems.

                              <span>JPMorgan placed Bitcoin’s (BTC) fair price at $38,000, 28% higher than its current level of around $29,500, according to a note to clients the bank released on Wednesday.  “Last month’s crypto market correction looks more like a capitulation from last January/February and looking forward, we see an upside for bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,” the note reads.  Bank strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was the main author of this document.
A note from bank investors placed the fair value of bitcoin at the same level in February.  It was trading around $43,000 at the time.
Crypto has outmoded real estate as the preferred “alternative asset” of the bank, along with hedge funds, continues the note.  This mentioned:

“So far, there is little evidence of VC [venture capital] funding dries up after Terra’s collapse.  Of the $25 billion in VC funding year-to-date, nearly $4 billion has come after Terra.  Our best guess is that venture capital funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be avoided.

Venture capital funding would be key to avoiding this crypto winter, he added.
On the same day, the great venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its fourth cryptocurrency fund at $4.5 billion.  Also on Wednesday, crypto-focused venture capital firm NGC Ventures launched its third blockchain fund with $100 million raised from investors such as Babel Finance, Huobi Ventures and Nexo Ventures.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly said expressed his personal antipathy to cryptocurrency, going so far as to call it a fraud, but the bank itself has taken a more practical stance.  This becomes the first major bankin the Metaverse earlier this year.  Dimon praised crypto for its ease of cross-border payment.

The Conservative Political Action Committee wrapped up a two-day event Friday night in Hungary, one that should concern all Americans about the prospect of rising illiberalism within the conservative movement.
The fact that CPAC Hungary even happened should have made headlines in America.  Not only because Hungary is a country that is increasingly moving away from democracy and back towards authoritarianism, but because the event included video messages from the two leading figures of the Republican Party: donald trump and Tucker-Carlson.
Not to mention the fact that CPAC Hungary took place in the shadow of Orban-ally by Vladimir Putin brutal invasion of Ukraine.

Let’s tighten restrictions on poisonous hate speech on social media.  It is imperative that we conduct threat assessments.  Absolutely, no more gun control regulations.  And, we must analyze the racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic, white supremacist manifestos.  But if we do all of this and continue to minimize or ignore how these murderous men were socialized as boys and young men, the mass shootings will continue to plague us.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump lost again in Georgia, as his endorsed candidates lost in their Republican primaries for governor, secretary of state and attorney general.
But those weren’t the only races voters decided on Tuesday.  Here’s a look at the winners and losers of some of the biggest contests in Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas:

Mr. Raffensperger, who is Georgia’s top election official as secretary of state, won his GOP primary against Rep. Jody Hice, a Republican congressman who voted to void the 2020 election and who was backed by Mr. Trump. 
The Associated Press called the win for Mr. Raffensperger, who was able to win back the trust of Republican voters in Georgia by portraying himself as a champion of “election integrity” and refuting the lies of Mr. Trump and his allies on the 2020 elections.

In the wake of the killing in Uvalde, here’s what America can learn from Australia’s response to tragedy.
 Tuesday’s shooting in Uvalde, Texas, has already kicked off another national debate about gun control. It is worth considering, as one piece of evidence about what policies do and do not work, the experience of Australia in the late 1990s. 
Between October 1996 and September 1997, Australia responded to its own gun violence problem with a solution that was both straightforward and severe: It collected roughly 650,000 privately held guns. It was one of the largest mandatory gun buyback programs in recent history.
