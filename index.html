                              <span>The White House has been forced to make an embarrassing clarification after US President Joe Biden said he has cancer during a speech in Somerset, Massachusetts.

During his remarks, President Biden was describing the fumes emitted from the oil refineries near his childhood home in Claymont, Delaware.

&quot;That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer and why for the longest time Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation,” President Biden said.

The White House was forced to make a quick clarification, stating that Mr Biden was referring to the non-melanoma skin cancers he had removed before his presidency.</span>

                              <span>Sri Lanka has elected former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as its new President.

However, the decision has not gone down well with protesters.  

Many in Sri Lanka consider Mr Wickremesinghe as a close associate of the Rajapaksa family, who they blame for the country’s economic crisis. 

On the spot where presidents are normally sworn in, protest leaders demanded Mr Wickremesinghe’s removal.  

“We will not stop this protest until Ranil Wickremesinghe is stepped down from the presidency and we get a president … the whole country can accept as one president,” a protester said.</span>

                              <span>US President Joe Biden’s remarks are “getting worse and worse” amid the “decline” of his cognitive ability, says The Australian’s Adam Creighton.

Mr Biden was discussing the effects of oil refinery emissions when he indicated he had cancer.

“The fact that he said he had cancer very clearly too, I think, is part of a general decline of his cognitive ability,” Mr Creighton told Sky News Australia. 

“In the 14-15 months I’ve been following his remarks closely, it’s getting worse and worse.”</span>

“The sentence really made very little sense,” Mr Creighton told Sky News Australia. 

“Almost every major poll has a question asking Americans if they think the President is mentally fit, and extraordinarily more than 50 per cent say no.”</span>

As the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state media that the &quot;geography is different.&quot;
&quot;It is far from being only DPR (Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic) and LPR (Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic), it is also Kherson Region, Zaporizhzhia Region and a number of other territories, and this process continues, it continues steadily and persistently,&quot; Lavrov said during an interview with RIA Novosti, published Wednesday.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi won a confidence motion in the upper house Senate on Wednesday, but three main coalition parties refused to take part in the vote, effectively torpedoing his administration. 
The motion asked the house to approve a speech made by Draghi earlier in the day, when he demanded unity from his coalition allies. 
The vote was approved by 95 to 38 with many dozens of senators absenting themselves.

* The plan asks the 27 EU nations to cut their gas consumption by 15% between 1 August 2022 and 31 March 2023. 
* The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant Gazprom claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc. 
European countries are being asked to curb their consumption of natural gas by at least 15% until next spring, as part of a wider plan to deal with reduced supplies from Russia. 
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, on Wednesday presented a strategy on how countries can prepare for the winter period, when their energy needs are much higher. 
The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant, Gazprom, claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc — a major headache for European nations given they have been so dependent on Russian energy before the invasion of Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The situation is becoming incredibly difficult in Europe. Implementing a 15% reduction in the consumption of natural gas will not only be difficult to maintain, but near impossible if Europe experiences a severe and cold winter.

Aim is to replenish stocks of arms after many EU countries supplied Ukraine 
The European Commission laid out plans Tuesday that will allow European Union nations to jointly purchase weapons, amid growing appeals from Ukraine for more military support in their pushback against Russian forces. 
The initiative will allow the EU to replenish arms that have already been provided to Ukraine, the Commission’s Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said.

* Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin met face-to-face in Iran on Tuesday 
* It was the first meeting between the two leaders since war in Ukraine started 
* But Erdogan kept Putin waiting for 48 seconds in what appeared to be a snub 
* Putin was &#x27;humiliated&#x27;, Ukraine foreign ministry adviser said, while others said it showed how far his standing has fallen since the war 
Vladimir Putin was snubbed by Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who left him twiddling his thumbs in front of TV cameras during a summit in Iran yesterday. 
The Russian leader was holding face-to-face talks with his sometimes-ally in Tehran on Tuesday for the first time since ordering the invasion of Ukraine back in February. 
 But he was left waiting for a toe-curling 48 seconds in front of the world&#x27;s press as Erdogan failed to arrive on time for a hand-shaking photo-op.

                              <span>Bloomberg: Kissinger Warns Biden Against Endless Confrontation With China 
 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said geopolitics today requires “Nixonian flexibility” to help defuse conflicts between the US and China as well as between Russia and the rest of Europe. 
While warning that China shouldn’t become a global hegemon, the man who helped reestablish US-China ties in the 1970s said that President Joe Biden should be wary of letting domestic politics interfere with “the importance of understanding the permanence of China.” 
“Biden and previous administrations have been too much influenced by the domestic aspects of the view of China,” Kissinger, 99, said in an interview Tuesday in New York with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “It is, of course, important to prevent Chinese or any other country’s hegemony.”

Pelosi&#x27;s office declined to comment on her travel plans.  August 1 is the anniversary of the founding of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

He secured 134 votes in the 225-member house, while his main rival, ruling party politician Dullas Alahapperuma, got 82. 
The Marxist candidate, Anura Dissanayake, won three votes.  Mr Wickremesinghe became acting president after Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week and resigned by email.

DW: How Ukrainian men try to get around the ban to leave the country 
Ukraine ordered a ban on men leaving the country at the beginning of the war, with few exceptions. Increasingly, however, men who want out are finding means and ways, often at a price. 
Anton (name has been changed) was a businessman in Ukraine. On February 24, he drove to the border with his wife and their two children to escape the Russian invasion. The trip, which usually takes only a few hours, took them almost the entire day. 
But while they were still en route, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country.

Speaking to reporters in Tehran after meeting with the leaders of Iran and Turkey, Mr. Putin said that shipments via Nord Stream 1 had been hampered by repairs necessary for turbines made by the German company Siemens. 
Even before the pipeline was shut down on July 11 for annual maintenance, flows from Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, had been reduced to only 40 percent capacity.

Ukraine wants to be an arena in which more-powerful nations prove out weapons in real-world combat against Russian forces.   Ukraine is openly offering itself as a venue for NATO allies to donate and demonstrate advanced weaponry in real-world combat scenarios. 
The countries would then benefit from the combat experience of Ukrainian soldiers using those weapons against Russian forces, according to Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.  Ukraine “is essentially a testing ground,” Reznikov said on July 19 during a live webcast conversation with John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.

                              <span>Defense One: Ukraine Says It Needs at Least 100 HIMARS and Longer-Range Rockets    
More mobile artillery rocket systems, drones, and longer-range rockets would be a “game changer” said top Ukrainian defense official. 
The recent addition of new long-range fires capabilities to Ukraine’s arsenal has played a key role in defending against stalled Russian forces. 
But additional mobile rocket batteries and longer-range rockets would allow Ukraine to mount more effective counter attacks and reclaim territory stolen by Russia, Oleksii Reznikov, minister of defense of Ukraine, said Tuesday. 
Ukraine currently has eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, able to strike ranges of 85 kilometers or 52 miles, as well asf Howitzer cannons with a range of 18 miles. Another four HIMARS are on the way as of last week, according to the Defense Department, and the White House expects to announce another shipment later this week. 
Speaking at an Atlantic Council event Tuesday, Reznikov said the HIMARS had already helped Ukraine destroy approximately 30 Russian command stations, as well as ammunition storage areas.

Daily Mail: Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Ukraine and the West will face a &#x27;Judgement Day&#x27; response should they attempt to militarily dispute Russia&#x27;s control of Crimea. 
* Medvedev said a Western or Ukrainian attack on Crimea would see a major retort 
* Russia illegally annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 
* &#x27;Judgement Day come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide,&#x27; he said 
* Comments came a day after a Ukrainian military intelligence official said Kyiv could hit targets in Crimea with U.S.-made HIMARS missiles 
Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Ukraine and the West will face a &#x27;Judgement Day&#x27; response should they attempt to militarily dispute Russia&#x27;s control of Crimea. 
The refusal of Ukraine and Western powers to recognise Moscow&#x27;s ownership of the peninsula poses a &#x27;systemic threat&#x27; for Russia, the former president said yesterday, before declaring the Kremlin would hit back with maximum force if the territory is attacked. 
&#x27;Judgement Day come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide,&#x27; he announced, according to Russia&#x27;s TASS news agency.

Reuters: Ukraine wants to avoid winter war, says top presidential aide  
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine&#x27;s top presidential aide said on Tuesday that Ukraine does not want the war to last into winter, as this would give Russian forces time to dig in and make any Ukrainian counter-offensive more difficult. 
 In an interview with Ukrainian magazine NV, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy&#x27;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak expressed hopes that the U.S. arms lend-lease to Ukraine will provide a sufficient quantity of weapons before winter to allow Ukrainian troops to achieve &quot;victory&quot; before then. 
&quot;It is very important for us not to enter the winter. After winter, when the Russians will have more time to dig in, it will certainly be more difficult,&quot; Yermak said.

There are also a lot of reports (from the Ukrainian side) that the U.S. has indicated to Kyiv that should the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk fall, followed by the fall of Donetsk oblast, Washington will be re-evaluating its commitment to supporting Ukraine in this war. 
This probably explains why Ukrainian President Zelensky has ordered  the town of Siversk, which Russia needs to capture Donetsk, to be hold at all costs. Needless to say I have been hearing and reading of heavy loses for the Ukrainians in their attempt to hold onto this piece of territory.
Russia is also intensifying their attacks in the southern part of Ukraine, with heavy casualties being reported on both sides.</span>

Russia’s weaponization of natural gas is putting Europe on edge — and forcing leaders to prepare for winter, now.
 Nord Stream 1, the pipeline that delivers natural gas from Russia to Germany, is shut down as it undergoes annual maintenance. Typically, this is routine. But typically, a war isn’t raging in Europe.
That’s why Germany — and the rest of the European Union — was nervous that when the 10-day maintenance was scheduled to end on July 21, the pipeline wouldn’t come back online. Instead, Russia may keep it closed, or drastically reduce the flows that run through it, as retaliation against…</span>

The new leader will be announced on September 5.

The Conservative Party has narrowed the contest to two finalists who will compete to take over leadership of the Conservative Party, and of the United Kingdom, from Boris Johnson.
Members of the Conservative Party will decide between Rishi Sunak, former the chancellor of the exchequer (fancy name for finance minister) who helped kick off the Cabinet rebellion against Johnson that prompted his resignation; and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary. Sunak is expected; he had led voting among members of Parliament throughout all the early rounds of voting. But Truss edg…</span>

The world wasn’t built for this heat.
 Europe is baking under heat so extreme that it’s causing train tracks to bend and roads to buckle. 
The heat wave, which brought record-breaking temperatures to the UK, France, and elsewhere in the past two weeks, is exposing a frightening reality: Much of Europe isn’t built for extreme heat, or for a climate that’s swiftly changing.

The Novavax vaccine is expected to play a limited role in the country’s vaccination campaign, at least initially.  Last week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized it as a primary vaccination for adults, but has not yet considered it for a booster shot.

* Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russia expert, in a NYT op-ed said that Putin believes he is winning in Ukraine. 
* &quot;That might seem hard to believe,&quot; Stanovaya said, &quot;But it&#x27;s what the Kremlin seems to believe.&quot; 
* But Putin will likely become &quot;most dangerous&quot; if his perspective shifts and he believes he&#x27;s losing. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin believes his forces are winning the nearly five-month war in Ukraine, despite failing to take Kyiv and suffering heavy troop losses, according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
In an op-ed for the New York Times, Stanovaya warned that Putin will become &quot;most dangerous&quot; when…</span>

                              <span>19FortyFive: Why Do We Keep Listening to the ‘TV’ Generals on Ukraine? 
Listening to television commentary and interviews of retired U.S. generals, one would be forgiven for believing Russia is on the ropes, and Ukraine was winning the war. Looking at on-the-ground battlefield reality in Ukraine, however, it quickly becomes apparent that the generals’ boasts continue a decade-long trend of rosy combat proclamations that all too often turn out to be disastrously wrong. American media, Congress, and the public need to start applying a little more scrutiny to what these officers say.

WNU Editor: The best part of this commentary is the last paragraph .... 
.... The danger in these types of statements is that they give false hope to the people of Ukraine, give an inaccurate picture to the American people of what’s possible, and encourages Congress to continue funding a strategy that almost certainly will fail.  
Could not have said it any better.</span>

Reuters: EU to Soften Sanctions on Russian Banks to Allow Food Trade 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will amend its sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday by allowing the unfreezing of some funds of top Russian banks that may be required to ease bottlenecks in the global trade of food and fertilisers, a draft document showed. 
The move comes amid criticism from African leaders about the negative impact of the sanctions on the trade, which may have exacerbated shortages chiefly caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and its blockading of ports in the Black Sea.

Update #1: EU Moves To Unblock Russian Bank Funds To Boost Food Trade (AFP) 
Update #2: EU to soften sanctions on Russian banks to allow food trade (FOX News)   
WNU Editor: This is a major reversal of sanctions, and one that I ma sure Ukraine is not happy with. 
So why the move to help Russian banks now? 
IMHO the &quot;softening&quot; of these sanctions is to not only to allow the trade of food and fertilizer, but to also dissuade any Russian move to make customers for its food and fertilizers pay in rubles thereby undermining the value of the euro even further.</span>
