CNN: Putin says Russia is rerouting trade to China and India  
President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Russia is rerouting trade to “reliable international partners” such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa as the West attempts to sever economic ties.
“We are actively engaged in reorienting our trade flows and foreign economic contacts towards reliable international partners, primarily the BRICS countries,” Putin said in his opening video address to the participants of the virtual BRICS Summit. The “BRICS” acronym refers to an informal grouping of the five developing economies. 
According to Putin, trade between Russia and the BRICS countries increased by 38% and reached $45 billion in the first three months of the year.

The document lists some do’s and don’ts of an active shooter. Do: Find shelter, hide, introduce a small target, and call or text for help. Don’t wear anything while running, hide in the shooter’s line of sight, or plead for your life.

After receiving a tip of a sensational robbery – the theft of cash from a farm belonging to President Cyril Ramaphosa of neighboring South Africa – they had traced large money transfers the suspects had made from bank accounts South Africans to Namibian bank accounts.
All that remained was to build a case against the suspects to establish a link between the money and the burglary.

Middle-class people did not speak like that in the pastoral of Chandernagore, a small town in West Bengal, about 30 miles from Kolkata.  Her father was a chemical engineer in a wool factory, her mother an artist who taught cooking.  She told him to stop saying such things or else the neighbors might think he was crazy.

It shares the qualities of the contemporary novels she wrote for 20 years: sharp observation, attention to class and gender antics, astonishing capacity for the child’s gaze, door always open to the supernatural.  And like Mantel’s most famous books, these stories are dark and absurd, the hissing voices of children brewed with wisdom and worldliness.
These are fictional stories.  It says on the back cover, and they have the structure and weight of the well-made news.  But they also weave around parts of Mantel’s memoir,”Give up the ghostwhich is about writing, chronic illnesses an…</span>

France 24: Xi warns about &#x27;expanding military alliances&#x27; at BRICS summit: state media 
Beijing (AFP) – Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against &quot;expanding&quot; military ties on Wednesday in a speech ahead of a virtual summit with top leaders from Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa. 
Beijing is hosting the meeting of the influential club of BRICS emerging economies, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world&#x27;s gross domestic product. 
Three of its members -- China, India and South Africa -- have abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

Bloomberg: Refugee Food Rations Cut as War in Ukraine Worsens Global Hunger 
(Bloomberg) -- The World Food Programme is cutting food rations for refugees by as much as half, as it faces a hunger crisis worsened by the war in Ukraine and funding constraints. 
“We are being forced to make the heart-breaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley said Monday in a statement. 
Food prices are near a record high after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sharply reduced Kyiv’s key exports of grain and vegetable oil, adding to price pressures from logistics snarl-ups and a rebound in demand after the pandemic. 
Efforts to let Ukraine resume crucial agricultural exports are moving slowly.

Reuters: Lithuania: We&#x27;re ready if Russia cuts us out of common power grid over Kaliningrad disruptions  
VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania will be prepared if Russia disconnects it from the regional power grid in retaliation for blocking rail shipments of some Russian goods to Moscow&#x27;s Kaliningrad exclave, but no military confrontation is expected, its president told Reuters. 
He spoke after the Kremlin warned Lithuania on Tuesday that Moscow would respond to the ban on the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU to Kaliningrad in such a way that citizens of the Baltic state would feel the pain. 
With relations between Moscow and the West at a half-century low over Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania banned the transit of goods sanctioned by the European Union across its territory to and from Kaliningrad, citing EU sanction rules.

Peace across the world has declined to the lowest level in 15 years as uncertainty over post-Covid economic recovery and Russia’s war in Ukraine loom large, according to the 16th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI). 
The report, produced by the Institute for Economics &amp; Peace (IEP) thinktank, said the rise in food and fuel costs have increased food insecurity and political instability globally, especially in south Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 
The average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.3 per cent in 2021, the report said.

UK Health Security Agency says evidence of limited community transmission of virus found in wastewater 
Public health officials have declared a national incident after routine surveillance of wastewater in north and east London found evidence of community transmission of poliovirus for the first time. 
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said waste from the Beckton sewage treatment works in Newham tested positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus in February and that further positive samples had been detected since. 
No cases of the disease or related paralysis have been reported, and the risk to the general public is considered low, but public health officials urged people to make sure that they and their families were up to date with polio vaccinations to reduce the risk of harm.

* A powerful earthquake struck a rural, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more. 
* Officials warned that the toll may still rise. 
* Rescuers rushed to the area by helicopter, but the response is likely to be complicated since many international aid agencies left Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. 
A powerful earthquake struck a rugged, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing at least 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more in the country’s deadliest quake in two decades, the state-run news agency reported. Officials warned that the already grim toll may still rise.
In the remote area near the Pakistani border, residents searched for survivors and the dead by digging with their bare hands through the rubble of collapsed stone and mudbrick houses, according to footage shown by the news agency Bakhtar. 
It was not immediately clear if major rescue equipment was being sent — or even if it could reach the area.

Mohammed bin Salman welcomed by President Recep Erdoğan in state visit expected to yield significant trade deals 
Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in the Turkish capital Ankara with a full ceremonial welcome, the beginning of a state visit ending years of animosity between the two countries that peaked with the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. 
The Crown Prince, sometimes known as MBS, was greeted with a grand procession on horseback and a state band. 
He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks.

QUITO: Police used tear gas on Tuesday (Jun 21) to disperse hundreds of Ecuadorans taking part in a ninth day of Indigenous-led fuel price protests the military described as a &quot;grave threat&quot;. 
Some 500 protesters among thousands who arrived in Quito from around the country in recent days were teargassed as they blockaded a street in the capital with burning tree branches. 
They quickly regrouped to march with watery eyes on the CCE culture centre - traditionally used by Indigenous people to launch protests but requisitioned by police over the weekend to use as a base.

William M. Arkin, Newsweek: Why Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky Won&#x27;t Say Ukraine Is Winning the War 
Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky won&#x27;t say it, and Vladimir Putin can&#x27;t. But Ukraine is winning the war. 
Russian propaganda leaflets fluttered from the sky north of Kyiv last week. &quot;They are trying to force you to defend the interests of others!&quot; they declared, encouraging civilian to resist service in the military. The leaflets labeled the local regime &quot;tycoons,&quot; &quot;gangs&quot; and &quot;terrorists,&quot; claiming that the war-makers were serving only their own interests in fighting. 
One problem with these leaflets: they were addressed to &quot;Citizens of the Chechen Republic!&quot;, intended for a different audience, from a different era, for a different war. Taken out of deep storage and shipped to Belarus, they were shot across the border by Soviet-era artillery, echoing an earlier time, representing a sloppy and uncoordinated war effort, speaking to no one.

WNU Editor: The above post is saying the complete opposite on what I see and know is happening in this war. In the current environment and taking into account what the West is providing to Ukraine I do not see a pathway for Ukraine to change the direction of the war. The only thing that will change the situation is a massive escalation in military support from the West to the Ukraine Army, and a complete imposition of sanctions on everything from Russia.</span>

CNN: Biden says it’s ‘not likely’ he will visit Ukraine on Europe trip  
President Joe Biden said Monday he is “not likely” to visit Ukraine when he travels to Europe for the Group of Seven summit and a meeting of NATO leaders later on this week. 
The President told reporters a stop in Ukraine is “not likely” on the upcoming trip, which will include stops in Germany and Spain. Biden said he does not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by adding a stop. 
On Saturday, Biden will travel to Schloss Elmau in southern Germany to attend the G7 Leaders’ Summit, a meeting that is expected to include a focus on Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine. 
On June 28, the President will travel to Madrid, Spain, for the 2022 NATO Summit – another alliance that has been aiding Ukraine amid Russia’s advancements.

DNYUZ/New York Times: After a Pivotal Period in Ukraine, U.S. Officials Predict the War’s Path 
WASHINGTON — When Russia shifted its military campaign to focus on eastern Ukraine this spring, senior officials in the Biden administration said the next four to six weeks of fighting would determine the war’s eventual path. 
That time has passed, and officials say the picture is increasingly clear: Russia is likely to end up with more territory, they said, but neither side will gain full control of the region as a depleted Russian military faces an opponent armed with increasingly sophisticated weapons. 
While Russia has seized territory in the easternmost region of Luhansk, its progress has been plodding. Meanwhile, the arrival of American long-range artillery systems, and Ukrainians trained on how to use them, should help Ukraine in the battles to come, said Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

LA Times: In eastern Ukraine, some stand against their defenders 
In Russian, the word “molodetz” roughly translates to “good job” or “bravo,” and that’s what 75-year-old Leonid was saying as he pointed at the Russian artillery’s handiwork — the wreckage of a bombed-out building in a central street of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine.
“The Ukrainian soldiers, they’re bad people, cowards,” added the retired security guard, who, like others, asked that his last name not be used for reasons of privacy. “They hide here, and then the moment the attack happens they run away.” 
His attitude demonstrated that in this part of the country, now the focal point of Moscow’s invasion that began in late February, the Ukrainian army is not necessarily fighting on friendly ground.

Row escalates over Vilnius’s refusal to allow steel and iron ore to cross Russian enclave of Kaliningrad 
The head of the Kremlin’s security council has threatened the “population of Lithuania” in an escalation of the row over Lithuanian railway’s refusal to allow some goods to cross to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. 
After a meeting in the region, which is wedged between Lithuania and Poland, 800 miles from Moscow, Nikolai Patrushev, a close ally to Vladimir Putin, upped the rhetoric by threatening “serious consequences”. 
“Russia will certainly respond to such hostile actions,” Patrushev said. “Appropriate measures … will be taken in the near future … Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania.”

Bamako, Mali — Mali&#x27;s military government says Islamist militants have massacred 132 civilians in the central Mopti region, in one of the deadliest attacks of the decade-long militant insurgency.

The attack on three villages the evening of June 18 is one of the deadliest since Mali’s conflict began in 2012.

As Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine crossed the 100-day mark this month, Taiwanese citizens told a recent survey that the island was unlikely to last the same amount of time in the event of a Chinese attack. 
But after Joe Biden&#x27;s recent pledge to defend Taiwan, local residents reported a rise in confidence about potential U.S. support. 
Six years into the Taiwanese presidency of Tsai Ing-wen, tensions across the Taiwan Strait show no signs of abating. 
The Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping continues to assert its decades-long claim to the island, with China&#x27;s defense minister, Gen. Wei Fenghe, vowing publicly to &quot;fight to the very end&quot; at Asia&#x27;s premier defense forum this month.

Reuters: Taiwan scrambles 29 jets to warn away Chinese planes in its air defense zone 
TAIPEI — Taiwan scrambled jets on Tuesday to warn away 29 Chinese aircraft in its air defense zone, including bombers that flew to the south of the island and into the Pacific, in the latest uptick in tensions and largest incursion since late May. 
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for the past two years or so of repeated missions by the Chinese air force near the democratically governed island, often in the southwestern part of its air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands.

Summit News: Ukraine Bans Main Opposition Party, Seizes All Its Assets 
‘Beacon of democracy’ cracks down on dissent.  Ukrainian authorities have banned the country’s main opposition party and seized all its assets, once again undermining the narrative that President Zelensky is presiding over a beacon of democracy. 
The country’s Ministry of Justice announced the move via Facebook, revealing that the Opposition Platform — For Life had been shut down and its assets, money and property transferred to the state. 
The party had previously had its operations suspended in March after it was accused of being complicit with Russia and being “anti-Ukrainian.” 
The ban means that Zelensky’s main political opposition has been eliminated. The OPPL was the second largest party in the country and its popularity surpassed that of Zelensky’s Servant of the People party last year.

   AFP: Oil turbulence could last five years, ExxonMobil boss warns 
Consumers must be prepared to endure up to five years of turbulent oil markets, the head of ExxonMobil said Tuesday, citing under-investment and the coronavirus pandemic. 
Energy markets have been roiled by the Ukraine war as Russia has reduced some exports and faced sanctions while Europe has announced plans to wean itself off dependency on Russian fossil fuels in coming years. 
Speaking ahead of ExxonMobil&#x27;s unveiling as the fourth international partner for Qatar&#x27;s natural gas expansion, chairman and chief executive Darren Woods said major uncertainty lies ahead.

President Biden moved to limit the U.S. military&#x27;s use of land mines Tuesday, in a realignment with the 1997 Ottawa Treaty.

Reuters: Russian Journalist&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize Fetches Record $103.5 Million at Auction to Aid Ukraine Children 
(Reuters) -Dmitry Muratov, the co-winner of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize and the editor of one of Russia&#x27;s last major independent newspapers, auctioned off his Nobel medal for a record $103.5 million to aid children displaced by the war in Ukraine. 
All proceeds from the auction, which coincided with the World Refugee Day on Monday, will benefit UNICEF&#x27;s humanitarian response for Ukraine&#x27;s displaced children, Heritage Auctions, which conducted the sale in New York, said in a statement. 
Muratov&#x27;s Novaya Gazeta newspaper, fiercely critical of President Vladimir Putin and his government, suspended operations in Russia in March after warnings from the state over its coverage of the war in Ukraine.

* Director-general Tedros Adhanom confided to a senior European official: source 
* The Mail on Sunday first revealed concerns about Wuhan&#x27;s Institute of Virology 
* Worldwide death toll of Covid pandemic now estimated to be above 18million 
* WHO initially branded lab leak fears &#x27;a conspiracy theory&#x27;, accepting China story 
The head of the World Health Organisation privately believes the Covid pandemic started following a leak from a Chinese laboratory, a senior Government source claims. 
While publicly the group maintains that ‘all hypotheses remain on the table’ about the origins of Covid, the source said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), had recently confided to a senior European politician that the most likely explanation was a catastrophic accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, where infections first spread during late 2019.

* The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained training materials from West Point showing that cadets are being taught critical race theory 
* The training materials inform cadets about their &#x27;whiteness,&#x27; and ask them to consider what W.E.B Du Bois would think of the movie Barbershop 
* The director of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton, described the materials as &#x27;anti-American&#x27; propaganda, and said the military was &#x27;under attack from within&#x27; 
The United States Army is teaching critical race theory to cadets at its prestigious West Point Academy, newly obtained training materials reveal. 
The documents, obtained by Fox News Digital from the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, show that the Army&#x27;s future leadership is being taught to acknowledge its &#x27;whiteness&#x27; and &#x27;privilege,&#x27; and to answer training questions through the lens of critical race theory. 
Judicial Watch had to sue the US military under the Freedom of Information Act twice before the training slides were released, according to Fox News.

                              <span>The Dutch government said on Monday that tighter gas supplies from Russia to Europe prompted it to declare an “early warning” phase of a natural gas crisis, a move that will see production more electricity by burning coal.
Russia’s actions in recent days – primarily the roughly 60% cut in flows through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany – have markedly darkened the mood in Europe on energy.  Governments and industry in Europe are now convinced that Moscow plans to use gas as a political weapon against Europe’s biggest economies in the coming months.

Historian Timothy Snyder on the war in Ukraine and the future of democracy.
 What does it mean to live in history?
In a very obvious sense, we’re always living in history. But there are those moments that feel different, where you can sense that the stakes are massive and that the shape of the future depends on how it all turns out.
The war in Ukraine is very much one of these events and, however it turns out, it will send ripple effects across the globe. In Europe, it has already precipitated a major shift in how nations like Germany and France and Finland and Sweden imagine their own defense.

A “foreign policy for the middle class” and centering human rights collide in the Middle East.
 As the average national gas price topped $5 a gallon, the White House formally announced that President Joe Biden, in a significant policy turnaround, would be traveling to Saudi Arabia. 
On the campaign trail, Biden had called the oil-rich kingdom a “pariah” in response to US intelligence groups’ conclusion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz ordered the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Though the US relationship with Saudi Arabia teetered along in the background, Biden had resisted directly meeting MBS. But July 13-16, …</span>

                              <span>Sri Lanka&#x27;s Parliament sessions will be restricted to two days this week instead of four amid the current fuel supply crisis in the country, the leader of the House, Dinesh Gunawardena, said on Tuesday. The island nation, home to around 22 million people, is currently facing its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. Sri Lanka&#x27;s economy is experiencing extreme fuel shortages, soaring food prices and a lack of medicines.</span>

                              <span>Former president Donald Trump has declared he would &quot;win&quot; in a potential 2024 GOP showdown with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, according to a new report.

The New Yorker revealed on Monday Mr Trump was &quot;very close to making a decision&quot; amid growing speculation he is about to launch a third consecutive presidential run.

The outlet asked the former president if he&#x27;s worried about the Florida governor entering the race.

“I don’t know if Ron is running, and I don’t ask him,” Trump said.

“It’s his prerogative. I think I would win.”</span>

                              <span>The Guardian: As many as 320 dead in Ethiopia gun attack, witnesses suggest 
Witnesses say victims of massacre in country’s western Oromia region were ethnic Amharas – a minority in the area 
The suspected death toll in an attack by gunmen in Ethiopia’s western Oromia region has risen, with new witness testimony suggesting that between 260 and 320 civilians were killed on Saturday. 
Reports of the massacre surfaced on Sunday, as survivors described one of the deadliest such incidents for several years in Ethiopia. 
The country’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has condemned what he described as “horrific acts” in Oromia, but has not given any details of the violence.

Daily Mail: Putin&#x27;s icy grip on Arctic &#x27;battleground of the future&#x27;: West urged to &#x27;wake up&#x27; to Russian threat as Moscow builds new military bases, races to extract natural resources worth $30trillion and exploit new shipping routes with China&#x27;s help 
* West urged to &#x27;wake up&#x27; to Russian threat in the Arctic, with dozens of new military bases built in last decade     * Putin will rely more heavily on region as Europe turns off gas supply and Western sanctions bite, report says 
* Kremlin hopes to plunder $30tr in Arctic resources, and exploit new shipping lanes opened by melting ice 
* Moscow is increasingly partnering with China in these missions, giving Beijing back-door access to region 
The West has been told to &#x27;wake up&#x27; to Russia&#x27;s growing plot to weaponise and monetise the Arctic, turning the once pristine and peaceful polar region into the &#x27;battleground of the future.&#x27; 
For years Vladimir Putin has been building airbases, missile launch pads, radar stations and naval yards north of the Artic Circle - but the region is now set to take on renewed importance after Russia was hammered by Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, which also trashed its reputation as Europe&#x27;s second-most powerful army.

                              <span>France 24: East Africa leaders meet on DR Congo conflict 
Nairobi (AFP) – East African leaders met in Kenya on Monday to discuss the security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo&#x27;s violence-torn east. 
The meeting comes as heavy fighting revives decades-old animosities between Kinshasa and Kigali, with the DRC blaming neighbouring Rwanda for the recent resurgence of the M23 militia. 
Rwanda has repeatedly denied backing the rebels, while both countries have accused each other of carrying out cross-border shelling. 
After weeks of sabre-rattling, the leaders of six of the seven nations in the East African Community (EAC) met in the Kenyan capital Nairobi to discuss the way forward.

Dmytro Kuleba, Foreign Affairs: How Ukraine Will Win  
Kyiv’s Theory of Victory 
As Russia’s all-out war of aggression in Ukraine drags on for a fourth consecutive month, calls for dangerous deals are getting louder. As fatigue grows and attention wanders, more and more Kremlin-leaning commentators are proposing to sell out Ukraine for the sake of peace and economic stability in their own countries. Although they may pose as pacifists or realists, they are better understood as enablers of Russian imperialism and war crimes. 
It is only natural that people and governments lose interest in conflicts as they drag on. It’s a process that has played out many times throughout history. The world stopped paying attention to the war in Libya after former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi was toppled from power, in 2011. It disengaged from Syria, Yemen, and other ongoing conflicts that once generated front-page news. And as I know well, the rest of the world lost interest in Ukraine after 2015, even as we continued to fight Russian forces for control over the eastern part of the country.

Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - The West&#x27;s Response As It Meets With Reality 
This morning I watched an hour long discussion (vid) by &#x27;experts&#x27; at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies about assessing Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine. I have to say that these folks know nothing that is relevant. They seem to have never heard of Sun Tsu&#x27;s dictum &#x27;Know your enemy&#x27;: 
 Sun Tzu says, “To know your enemy, you must become your enemy,” but how do you become your enemy? You need to put yourself in the place of your enemy so you can predict his actions.
Not once did the CSIS people consider the view of Russia or its real intent. They talk about this or that U.S. option but do not even once consider how the other side would react to it. 
One of the CSIS &#x27;experts&#x27; says that Russia had planned to take Kiev but failed. Take Kiev with what? There were some 20-30.000 Russian soldiers near Kiev which has some 3 million inhabitants. Historically one needs one soldier for every 40 civilians to occupy a city or country after the fighting is mostly over. Russia would have needed more than two and a half times the number of troops it had around Kiev to take and hold the city.

                              <span>Reuters: Russia warns NATO-member Lithuania over Kaliningrad transit 
 LONDON (Reuters) - Russia warned NATO member Lithuania on Monday that unless the transit of goods to Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic Sea was swiftly restored then Moscow would take undisclosed measures to defend its national interests. 
With east-west relations at a half-century low over Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Vilnius banned the transit of goods sanctioned by the European Union through Lithuanian territory to and from the exclave, citing EU sanction rules. 
Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry summoned Lithuania&#x27;s top envoy in Moscow to deliver a protest while the Kremlin said the situation was beyond serious. 
&quot;The situation is more than serious,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. &quot;This decision is really unprecedented. It&#x27;s a violation of everything.&quot;  Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry demanded Vilnius reverse what it cast as an &quot;openly hostile&quot; move immediately.

New laws also increase quotas on Ukrainian-language speech and music on television and radio 
Ukraine’s parliament has voted through two laws that will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music as Kyiv seeks to break many remaining cultural ties between the two countries following Moscow’s invasion. 
One law will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, unless they renounce their Russian passport and take Ukrainian citizenship. 
The ban will only apply to those who held Russian citizenship after the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule.  It will also ban the commercial import of books printed in Russia, Belarus and occupied Ukrainian territory, while also requiring special permission for the import of books in Russian from any other country.

                              <span>For 17 years, biologist Zeb Hogan has been searching for the largest freshwater fish in the world.  On June 13, his team found it – a giant freshwater stingray, or Urogymnus polylepis.
The stingray, which emerged from the troubled waters of the Mekong in Cambodia, was 13 feet long before being returned to the river.  And at 661 pounds, it was 15 pounds heavier than a giant Mekong catfish caught in Thailand in 2005.  Dr Hogan said he had previously established that freshwater fish were the biggest ever caught.
Although this species of giant stingray has an extremely dangerous venomous barb that can grow to nearly a foot in length, it does not generally pose a threat to humans.  Most often, they end up on the market as a cheap source of protein.

                              <span>The idea came to Harry James Hanson and Devin Antheus when they were both attending ‘church’ – their word to describe a drag show.
This particular performance took place in December 2017, on the evening of the winter solstice, at Aunt Charlie’s Lounge, a beloved queer dive bar in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood.  The two, both now 32, were struck that evening by the age of the performers, which they estimated to be around 60 on average.
Hailing from Wisconsin and friends since meeting on Myspace when they were 14, Mr. Antheus and Mx.  Hanson, who uses a gender-neutral title and courtesy pronouns, “had a lack of queer elders growing up,” Mx.  Hanson said.


Watching the queens perform at Aunt Charlie’s salon planted a seed in Mx’s mind.  Hanson, photographer, creative director and d…</span>

Peanut butter is a clever shorthand ingredient, used to anchor the tasty five-ingredient sauce.  But a neighbor came by with tuna he had caught 55 miles off Brooklyn under a blazing sun: a few necklaces, loin, grattons for the tuna tartare.  I thanked him and came up with a new plan.  (But you should make this salmon tonight.)
I was most excited for the collar, a fat cut that comes from between the gills and the head.  Jump at the chance to cook one, if you can get it from your fishmonger or someone who fishes offshore.  No recipe required: Broil, broil or roast under a light sprinkle of salt until soft and shiny, perfect for picking with chopsticks or a …</span>

                              <span>Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday that they would submit a bill next week to dissolve the country&#x27;s parliament, which if passed would trigger new elections with Lapid serving as caretaker prime minister. 
&quot;After exhausting all efforts to stabilize the coalition, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and... (Foreign Minister) Yair Lapid have decided to submit a bill&quot; dissolving parliament &quot;next week&quot;, the two leading Israeli coalition partners said in a statement. Lapid and Bennett were expected to issue statements at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)
They also said that if the bill is approved, Lapid will take over as premier of a caretaker government. 
Should that eventuate, it would be Lapid who would host US President Joe Biden during his scheduled visit to Israel next month.
The ideologically divided eight-party alliance was forged one year ago and includes religious nationalists, like Bennett, Lapid&#x27;s centrist Yesh Atid party, left-wingers and, for the first time in Israeli history, lawmakers from an Arab Islamist party.
But the coalition, cobbled together to end the tenure of divisive leader Benjamin Netanyahu, was under threat from its inception. It lost its majority in Israel&#x27;s 120-seat parliament in April when a member of Bennett&#x27;s Yamina party announced her departure.
Recent divisions over the renewal of a measure that allows Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank to live under Israeli law caused fresh friction, with some left-wingers refusing to back it.
That was anathema to hawks in the alliance, notably Justice Minister Gideon Saar, who reject any notion that West Bank settlers live outside Israel.
The Netanyahu-led opposition had warned it would submit its own bill to dissolve parliament on Wednesday but Bennett and Lapid appear to have moved to pre-empt that opposition move.

                              <span>Dmitry Muratov, the Russian editor in chief of the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, on Monday will auction off his Nobel Peace Prize gold medal to benefit children displaced by the war in Ukraine.
Muratov won the prize in 2021 alongside journalist Maria Ressa of the Philippines, with the committee honoring them &quot;for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression.&quot;
Muratov&#x27;s paper in March suspended operations in Russia, after Moscow adopted legislation providing for tough jail terms against anyone criticizing the Kremlin&#x27;s bloody military campaign in Ukraine.
Muratov was among a group of journalists who founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union. This year it became the only major newspaper left voicing criticism of President Vladimir Putin and his tactics insid…</span>

                              <span>The daughter of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has said she is concerned about her father&#x27;s welfare after his transfer to a penal camp where conditions are tougher.
&quot;No one notified the attorneys or the family about this transfer,&quot; Dasha Navalnaya told US broadcaster CNN on Monday.
&quot;It is very concerning,&quot; she said. She said the conditions where he is now are very different from those people imagine in usual prisons. &quot;This is one of the most dangerous and famous high security prisons in Russia, known for torturing and murdering the inmates,&quot; she said.
&quot;They fenced off a separate barrack in the area to really create a prison within the prison so that he can&#x27;t speak publicly and isolate him from any information,&quot; she said, calling this &quot;purely psychological torture.&quot;
Navalny, one of the most prominent critics of the Kremlin, was in quarantine after being transferred to penal colony 6 in Melekhovo near the city of Kovrov, he said last week on Instagram.
The camp has particularly harsh detention conditions and is located about 150 kilometres further away from the Pokrov penal colony, or some 260 kilometres north-east of Moscow.
At the time, his aide said she feared for his life. Navalny narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in August 2020, for which he blames Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny has made many enemies with his revelations about corruption and abuse of power in the Russian state apparatus.
In May, a court confirmed Navalny&#x27;s nine-year prison sentence for fraud. This made the transfer to a penal camp with harsher detention rules legally binding.</span>

A trial against alleged officials and members of the banned neo-Nazi network &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; has begun at the Munich I Regional Court. The men are alleged to have continued the &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; organization, which was banned by the German Ministry of the Interior in September 2000, and to have spread right-wing extremist ideas. Peter Kneffel/dpa
Alleged members of the banned neo-Nazi network &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; went on trial on Monday in the southern German city of Munich.
Prosecutors allege that senior figures in the network are among the 10 defendants, who are accused among other things of spreading right-wing extremist propaganda.
The men are accused of keeping the organization going despite the fact it was banned by the federal government in September 2000.
Some of the accused are alleged to have sold music CDs with banned right-wing rock music and merchandise with banned neo-Nazi symbols.
The public display of Nazi symbols, such as the swastika or the Hitler salute, are criminal offences in Germany.</span>

                              <span>SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The boat used by killed British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira to travel Brazil&#x27;s Amazon was found on Sunday evening, authorities said in a press statement.
The speedboat was submerged about 20 meters (65 ft) deep under the Itacoai river in the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil with the help of six sandbags, authorities said.
They added they were led to the site of boat&#x27;s sinking by the latest suspect in the killings, Jeferson da Silva Lima, or &#x27;Pelado da Dinha&#x27;, who surrendered himself to police on Saturday.
Phillips, a freelance reporter, was doing research for a book on the trip with Pereira, a former head of isolated and recently contacted tribes at federal indigenous affairs agency Funai.
They were reported missing on June 5 after traveling together by boat through the Javari Valley, a remote region bordering Peru and Colombia. According to police, both were shot with hunting ammunition.
Shock at their fate has echoed across Brazil and around the world, highlighting the overhaul of indigenous agency Funai under President Jair Bolsonaro, along with a rising tide of violence and criminal incursions on native lands.
On Sunday, police identified five more suspects for the murders.

DOLLOW, Somalia (Reuters) -Each morning in this Somali border town, 11-year-old Bashir Nur Salat plots his day&#x27;s mission behind a crooked wire fence. Armed with only a friend&#x27;s yellow school shirt, a borrowed book and toothy grin, he eyes his prize through the mesh: lunch.
Bashir lives where three crises converge - global warming, spiralling food prices and war. He, like millions of others in Somalia, are in the crosshairs of what some aid workers are calling the &quot;The Three Cs&quot;: climate change, costs and conflict.
The worst drought in four decades in war-torn Somalia forced his family to leave their farm three months ago and to move about 100 kilometers (62.5 miles) north to the town of Dollow, on the border with Ethiopia.

It also continued a trend in recent years that has seen many countries in the region swing to the left, although some would argue those are populist moves as much as ideological ones.
Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Bolivia and Honduras have all moved to the left in their last elections and Petro&#x27;s victory sparked a feeling of fraternity amongst these leaders.

                              <span>Pope Francis has fueled the rumor mill with a postponed Africa trip and the curious timing of an upcoming meeting of cardinals -- but experts caution against assuming a resignation is nigh.
Hobbled by pain in his knee and forced to use a wheelchair in recent weeks, the 85-year-old pontiff postponed a July trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan last week.
That move, along with an unusual decision to hold a consistory to name new cardinals during the vacation month of August, triggered intense speculation about his plans for the future, including the most radical -- that he was planning to step down.
Not so fast, many say.
&quot;In the pope&#x27;s entourage, the majority of people don&#x27;t really believe in the possibility of a resignation,&quot; a Vatican source told AFP.

                              <span>Allies of French President Emmanuel Macron started working Monday to cobble together a working parliamentary majority to salvage his second term, after his alliance crumbled in the election against surges from the left and far-right. 
Macron&#x27;s Ensemble (Together) coalition emerged as the largest party in parliamentary elections but was dozens of seats short of keeping the parliamentary majority it had enjoyed for the last five years.
It will now begin work to try and find a majority by forming deals with other parties on the right, stirring up turmoil unprecedented in French politics in recent years.
Macron, 44, now also risks being distracted by domestic problems as he seeks to play a prominent role in putting an end to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and as a key statesman in the EU.

                              <span>A Japanese court ruled on Monday that the country&#x27;s failure to recognize same-sex marriage is constitutional, in a setback for activists after a landmark verdict last year found the opposite.
The district court in western Japan&#x27;s Osaka rejected arguments made by three same-sex couples as part of a series of suits filed by activists seeking marriage equality.
&quot;From the perspective of individual dignity, it can be said that it is necessary to realize the benefits of same-sex couples being publicly recognized through official recognition,&quot; the court ruling said.
But the present failure to recognize such unions is &quot;not considered to violate... the Constitution&quot;, the ruling added, saying &quot;public debate on what kind of system is appropriate for this has not been thoroughly carried out&quot;.
The verdict comes after a district court in northern Sapporo last year found the opposite, ruling that the government&#x27;s failure to allow same-sex marriage violated the constitution&#x27;s provision guaranteeing equality under the law.
That ruling was welcomed by campaigners as a major victory that would pile pressure on lawmakers to accept same-sex unions.
Japan&#x27;s constitution stipulates that &quot;marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes&quot;.
But in recent years, local authorities across the country have made moves to recognize same-sex partnerships, although such recognition does not carry the same rights as marriage under the law.
The prefecture of Tokyo last month said it would begin recognizing same-sex partnerships from November, revising current rules.
More than a dozen couples filed suits seeking marriage equality in 2020 in district courts across Japan. They said the coordinated action was intended to put pressure on the only G7 government that does not recognize gay unions.

Several allies - including Cabinet ministers - of French President Emmanuel Macron are being forced to resign after losing their legislative seats in a less-than-stellar showing for the president&#x27;s centrist bloc at weekend elections.
Macron&#x27;s La Republique en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) had hoped to build on his recent re-election and score a parliamentary majority in this month&#x27;s elections, so the president would be able to push through his policies.
Instead, Sunday&#x27;s run-off vote left LREM with 245 of 577 seats, making it the largest bloc, but still reliant on other parties if it hopes to get key legislation passed.
Before the vote, LRE…</span>

Under a sweltering sun, 84-year-old Nguyen Co looks out from the stone steps of a temple on Ly Son Island off the coast of central Vietnam. A broad grin spreads across his leathery face, even as he turns his gaze to a huge mound where a six-metre-long whale lies buried - the sea creature he has come to worship.
Co is the leader of a group of worshippers on the island who pray to whale spirits, asking for a good catch and protection at sea.
Dressed in a striking red-and-gold traditional áo dài, a long tunic worn over trousers, Co explains whales have been known to rescue fishermen caught in storms at sea.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy predicted Russia will escalate its attacks this week as European Union leaders consider whether to back Kyiv&#x27;s bid to join the bloc and Moscow presses its campaign to win control of the country&#x27;s east.
&quot;Obviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities,&quot; Zelenskiy said in his Sunday nightly video address. &quot;We are preparing. We are ready.&quot;
Ukraine applied to join the EU four days after Russian troops poured across its border in February. The EU&#x27;s executive, the European Commission, on Friday recommended that Ukraine receive candidate status.

                              <span>BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian federal police on Sunday said that five more suspects helped hide the bodies of British journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, after having already arrested three men for their murder in the Amazon rainforest.
The police did not name the new suspects, adding in a short statement that ongoing investigations aim to &quot;clarify all the circumstances, motives and those involved in the case&quot;.
So far, Amarildo da Costa Oliveira, a fisherman who police say confessed to killing the two victims, his brother, Oseney da Costa, and a third man, Jeferson da Silva Lima, have been arrested.
Phillips, a freelance reporter who had written for the Guardian and the Washington Post, was doing research for a book on the trip with Pereira, a former head of isolated and recently contacted tribes at federal indigenous affairs agency Funai.
They were reported missing on June 5 after traveling together by boat through the Javari Valley, a remote region bordering Peru and Colombia. According to police, both were shot with hunting ammunition.
Shock at their fate has echoed across Brazil and around the world, highlighting the overhaul of indigenous agency Funai under President Jair Bolsonaro, along with a rising tide of violence and criminal incursions on native lands.

                              <span>By Mimosa Spencer and Gilles Guillaume PARIS (Reuters) -Voting was underway in France on Sunday in a parliamentary election that could deprive newly re-elected centrist President Emmanuel Macron of the absolute majority he needs to govern with a free hand. Initial projections were expected at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) from the election that could change the face of French politics. Turnout by midday was a bit stronger - at 18.99% - than at the same time during a first round of voting last Sunday and than in 2017, when it reached only 18.43% and 17.75% respectively.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron may find himself without a ruling majority during his second term and unable to push through his economic reform agenda with a free hand after a new left-wing alliance did well in the first round of voting.
The second round will be held on Sunday. Here are three possible outcomes.
ABSOLUTE MAJORITY
Scared off by increasingly strident warnings against Jean-Luc Melenchon&#x27;s radical left platform, voters elect more than 289 Macron-supported candidates to parliament.

                              <span>European Union countries are expected at a summit next week to grant Ukraine EU candidate status following a recommendation from the bloc&#x27;s executive on Friday, putting Kyiv on course to realise an aspiration seen as out of reach before Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion, even if actual membership could take years.
	

		British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Friday and offered a stepped-up training for Ukrainian forces. Back in Britain on Saturday, he stressed the need to avoid &quot;Ukraine fatigue&quot; after nearly four months of war.

                              <span>DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Saturday told the United Arab Emirates that Tehran gave a high priority to improving ties with its neighbours, Iranian state media reported, a day after the UAE voiced concern over Tehran&#x27;s nuclear programme.
The UAE&#x27;s envoy at the United Nations&#x27; nuclear watchdog on Friday said he hoped Iran would work with the body to provide reassurances to the international community and the region about Tehran&#x27;s nuclear programme.
In a phone call with his UAE counterpart, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian &quot;pointed to the priority of neighbours in Iran&#x27;s foreign policy and called for more consultation ... to expand bilateral ties,&quot; state media said.
In 2019, U.S.-allied UAE started engaging with Iran after years of tense relations.
Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear deal have stalled since March and Tehran has restricted the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s ability to monitor the Iranian nuclear programme after a dispute with the U.N. watchdog.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) picked familiar faces for its new set of leaders on Saturday, as the party faces government probes and a string of setbacks in recent state elections.
Tino Chrupalla will return to his role as co-leader, joined by Alice Weidel. There had been speculation that the party might move away from its dual leadership system. But now the duo heads both the party and its legislative group in the Bundestag.
But there were differences. Chrupalla was chosen with support of 53.4% of members present, whereas Weidel got 67.3% However, Chrupalla managed …</span>

Lithuania&#x27;s parliament last month voted to accept for further debate a draft bill legalizing same-sex civil partnerships, after voting down a similar bill in May 2021. In a pastoral letter to the faithful, the Lithuanian Bishops Conference -- a body which unites the country&#x27;s bishops -- quoted a 2016 treatise by Pope Francis which states &quot;de facto union...</span>
