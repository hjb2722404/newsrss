“I think Prigozhin probably will go to Belarus but then very quickly he will try to go elsewhere.”</span>

                              <span>BBC: Greek elections: Mitsotakis hails conservative win as mandate for reform 
Greek conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis has trounced his centre-left rival in the second election in a month and said he has a &quot;strong mandate&quot; to move faster on the path of change. 
His New Democracy party (ND) won 40.5% of the vote, almost 23 points ahead of Syriza, with most of the votes counted. 
He beat Syriza in May, but called new elections in a bid to win a majority. 
&quot;ND is today the most powerful centre-right party in Europe,&quot; he told delighted supporters in Athens. 
Mr Mitsotakis is credited with successfully returning the Greek economy to stability and growth after a severe debt crisis and three international bailouts. 
Although many Greeks are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, voters chose to stick with the party promising lower taxes and improved public health.

Zero Hedge: Russia Wants World To Know It Had China&#x27;s Full &#x27;Support&#x27; During Wagner Mutiny 
The AFP is describing mixed emotions among Russians living in some large cities of &quot;relief&quot; and &quot;sympathy&quot; after Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group mounted a short-lived armed mutiny which made it halfway toward Moscow from the Rostov region on Saturday. 
Prigozhin stood down and ordered his convoys to turn around, reportedly after the mediation of President Viktor Lukashenko, and will now go to Belarus - with his mercenaries being given the option of signing a contract with the Russian military. 
As we detailed, video clips showed a peaceful handover of military HQs in the south, particularly in Rostov-on-Don, after which the regular military command took back control.

WNU Editor: There was nothing much that China could do when the mutiny was in play. But now that it is over the concern in Beijing is how will this impact Russia&#x27;s military objectives and operations in the war in Ukraine. 
On this question my Chinese friends and I are in agreement. Putin will be adopting a more aggressive stance in prosecuting the war, an escalation that Beijing is going to feel very uncomfortable to support, but in the end they will support it albeit privately.</span>

The Federalist: Whistleblower: FBI Tipped Off ‘People Very Close’ To Joe And Hunter Before IRS Investigative Team’s ‘Day Of Action’

 
Wolf told the team that she didn’t want them asking interviewees about Hunter’s father or ‘the big guy.’ 
The night before an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigation team began looking into Hunter Biden’s tax crimes was set to conduct key interviews and approach Hunter for a consented search of his home, FBI headquarters allegedly tipped off “people very close to President Biden and Hunter Biden,” thwarting the investigation, according to a whistleblower testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee released Thursday. 
Starting in January 2020, IRS criminal supervisory special agent and whistleblower Gary Shapley and his team of agents began investigating Hunter Biden for tax evasion after incriminating material was found on Hunter’s infamous laptop. “I am alleging, with evidence, that DOJ provided preferential treatment, slow-walked the investigation, did nothing to avoid obvious conflicts of interest in this investigation,” Shapley told the committee.

Politico:  U.S.-trained Ukrainian pilot who died in combat had been eager to get back into the fight

 
Capt. Vladyslav Savieliev graduated from a pilot training course at a Mississippi air base in March. 
When Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Capt. Vladyslav Savieliev, a Ukrainian Air Force pilot with deep experience flying MiG-29 fighter jets against Russian forces, desperately wanted to fight for his country. 
But Savieliev, who at the time was enrolled in a two-year selective pilot training course run by the U.S. military at a Mississippi Air Force Base, still had another year to go before completing the program. 
Savieliev, known by his call sign “Nomad,” finally returned to Ukraine after graduating in March from the U.S. military’s Aviation Leadership Program, an undergraduate pilot training course designed to boost military relationships with foreign nations. He died weeks later on a combat mission June 2, the Ukrainian Air Force announced last week.

Moscow Times: Prigozhin&#x27;s Insurrection Creates Headaches for Russia-China Alliance, Experts Say 
Yevgeny Prigozhin’s rebellion against Moscow will have stoked alarm in China and could throw sand in the wheels of the “no-limits” strategic partnership between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, experts said on Sunday. 
After a 24-hour armed insurrection in which Prigozhin’s Wagner mercenaries seized control of parts of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and sent a convoy of troops hundreds of kilometers north towards Moscow, analysts said Beijing would see Putin’s failure to keep the mercenary boss in check as smacking of “incompetence.”

                              <span>New York Post, by Dalibor Rohac: Wagner Group’s ‘coup’ was short-lived, but the end is near for Putin 
Yevgeny Prigozhin’s short-lived “coup” attempt — if we indeed witnessed one — has left many understandably confused.

One thing should be clear, however.

This is the beginning of the end of Russia’s war in Ukraine — and likely also of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule. 
First, here is what we know about the odd events of the past two days.

After almost a year of Wagner Group owner Prigozhin’s near-constant and escalating verbal attacks against Russia’s Ministry of Defense, he commanded his mercenaries to march into Russia.

From what I have seen heard, and read, there was little if any public support in Russia for this rebellion, and more importantly, all media (main stream and social), political, military, and economic leaders rallied around the Kremlin when the Wagners started their march towards Moscow. 
This is also week 4 of the Ukraine counteroffensive. And while there are reports of some Ukrainian advances along some parts of the front lines, the Russian military is also launching their own counteroffensives, taking advantage of weaknesses in the Ukrainian lines where forces were removed for their counteroffensive in the southeastern part of the country.</span>

Washington Post: U.S. spies learned in mid-June Prigozhin was planning armed action in Russia 
U.S. spy agencies picked up intelligence in mid-June indicating Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeniy Prigozhin was planning armed action against the Russian defense establishment — which he has long accused of bungling the war in Ukraine — and urgently informed the White House and other government agencies so they were not caught off guard, several U.S. officials said Saturday. 
The exact nature and timing of Prigozhin’s plans were not clear until shortly before his stunning takeover of a military command and tank run toward Moscow on Friday and Saturday, officials said. 
But “there were enough signals to be able to tell the leadership … that something was up,” said one U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. “So I think they were ready for it.”

The Telegraph: Russians &#x27;threatened US base with destruction&#x27; in Syria 
The US and Russia came close to engaging in a direct military confrontation in Syria after the Russians threatened an American special forces base at the height of the civil war, it can be revealed. 
US commanders threatened to respond with military force after the Russians ordered American special forces to leave their base “or face destruction”. 
After the special forces had dispersed into the Syrian desert as a precautionary measure, General Stephen Townsend, the commander of the US-led coalition’s Combined Joint Task Force, contacted his Russian opposite number to send him an ultimatum: “Are we talking or are we fighting.”

After a brief pause, during which the Russians weighed up their options, they replied: “We are talking.” 
The response helped to defuse a major crisis between US and Russian forces operating in Syria during the civil war, which could easily have escalated into a major confrontation between Moscow and Washington.

Reuters: Moldova bans pro-Russian Shor party after months of protests 
CHISINAU (Reuters) -Moldova&#x27;s Constitutional Court on Monday banned the pro-Russian Shor party that has led months of protests and is headed by an exiled businessman accused by the West and the government of trying to destabilise the country. 
The court declared the party led by Ilan Shor, who lives in Israel, unconstitutional. Its decision triggered an immediate ban and the justice ministry will create a commission to complete all legal procedures for the party&#x27;s dissolution.

WNU Editor: Wow!!!! What an incredible 4 minutes to watch. It looks like the White House press corps is now finally going after the Biden administration for answers on allegations that President Biden used his son to personally enrich himself and his family when he was Vice President.</span>

                              <span>Appearing on MSNBC on Sunday morning, retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffery suggested that, not only is Vladimir Putin damaged within his own country after the Wagner Group rebellion was aborted, but that his allies in the international community may be hesitant to help him out in the near future.
Speaking with host Chris Jansing, McCaffery noted that the Russian president has been getting help from outside his country with much-needed military technology following his invasion of Ukraine, but now his precarious position, as evidenced by a threat of a possible coup, may make those sources dry up.
Asked by the MSNBC host if Putin will survive after the rebellion was quelled, McCaffery said the Russian president has a whole new set of problems that he will have to deal with.
&quot;Well, in the long run, it surely doesn&#x27;t look very good for him,&quot; he admitted. &quot;His international partners are going to be very hesitant to back him up with new infusions of military technology. He&#x27;s an economic disaster zone. The only thing he ever had was energy to sell the world and the Europeans have walked away from that.&quot;
&quot;It looks as if he&#x27;s really in a very weakened position,&quot; he added. &quot;I think the internal part was the biggest threat to him.&quot;

Blinken in a series of television interviews said tensions that led to the aborted mutiny by forces led by Yevgeny Prigozhin had been rising for months and that the turmoil could affect Moscow&#x27;s capabilities in Ukraine. &quot;Our focus is resolutely and relentlessly on Ukraine, making sure that it has what it needs to defend itself and to take back...</span>

                              <span>According to the former United States Ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Putin&#x27;s response to the called-off Wagner Group revolt exposed him as being weak and severely damaged his tough-guy reputation.
Appearing on MSNBC with host Jonathan Capehart, ex-Ambassador Michael McFaul stated the Russian president ended up looking like a &quot;rat in the corner&quot; during the biggest crisis of his career.
Reflecting on the fact that Putin had previously threatened the Wagner Group&#x27;s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin with arrest only to back off after a deal was brokered by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Capehart asked, &quot;Do you think Vladimir Putin can let this go? Especially given as you pointed out what he said in that televised speech yesterday?&quot;
&quot;I honestly do not know,&quot; McFaul admitted. &quot;I was very surprised that he capitulated so fast.&quot;
&quot;By the way, I think that there&#x27;s a lot about our theories about how he is going to fight in Ukraine, and whether he has an off-ramp and all these arguments about if he is a rat in the corner he&#x27;ll never negotiate,&quot; he continued. &quot;Well, yesterday he was a rat in the corner and he didn&#x27;t double down, he didn&#x27;t escalate, he negotiated, and, he looks very weak in terms of whether he is in charge of his own country.&quot;
&quot;I suspect he is going to be looking for a way to reassert himself, vis-à-vis Mr. Prigozhin, and the Wagner fighters. I just do not exactly know how,&quot; he added.

                              <span>A year after the US Supreme Court scrapped the constitutional right to abortion in the United States, President Joe Biden on Saturday vowed to fight against the &quot;extreme and dangerous&quot; effort by Republicans to curb access to the procedure nationwide.
The high court&#x27;s decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision passed the regulation of abortion back to individual states -- some of which have since moved to drastically restrict the procedure.
&quot;State bans are just the beginning,&quot; Biden said in a statement on the anniversary of the ruling. &quot;Their agenda is extreme, dangerous, and out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.&quot;

But having fallen short of five seats in parliament to be able to form a single-party government, Mitsotakis chose to ask 9.8 million Greek voters back to the ballot boxes.
Casting his vote, Mitsotakis, who hails from one of Greece&#x27;s most influential political families said the country is &quot;voting for a second time in a few weeks to get a stable and effective government&quot;.

In a statement marking this week&#x27;s Eid al-Adha holiday, Hibatullah Akhundzada -- who rarely appears in public and rules by decree from the Taliban&#x27;s birthplace in Kandahar -- said steps had been taken to provide women with a &quot;comfortable and prosperous life according to Islamic Sharia&quot;.
The United Nations expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; last week that women were being deprived of their rights under Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban government and warned of systematic gender apartheid.

The 76-year-old pop superstar is winding down a glittering live career with a global farewell tour, playing his last concerts in the United States in May ahead of a final gig in Stockholm on July 8.
The singer-songwriter has said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more excited&quot; to make his debut at Glastonbury, Britain&#x27;s best-known music festival hosted on a farm in southwest England for five decades.
He will take to the main Pyramid Stage on Sunday night, with fans eagerly awaiting the identity of four &quot;collaborators&quot; set to join him who have yet to be announced.

Officially, the purpose of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit to Beijing last week and his brief meeting with Xi Jinping — his first since he became secretary of state — was to warn China against further provocation.

The USS Ronald Reagan&#x27;s port call in Danang comes as the US and Vietnam celebrate the 10th anniversary of their &quot;comprehensive partnership&quot;, with the two countries sharing increasingly close trade links, as well as concerns over China&#x27;s growing strength in the region.

Late on Saturday, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a founder of the Wagner army, said he was halting his &quot;march for justice&quot; on Moscow after a deal that spared him and his mercenaries from facing criminal charges. The deal also exiled Prigozhin to Belarus. &quot;Today the world saw that the masters of Russia do not control anything. Nothing at ...</span>

Yevgeny Prigozhin, a former Putin ally and founder of the Wagner army, said his men reached within 125 miles (200 km) of the capital on Saturday. Earlier, Moscow deployed soldiers in preparation for their arrival and told residents to stay indoors. The Wagner fighters captured the city of Rostov hundreds of miles to the south ...</span>

An agreement on Saturday by Wagner&#x27;s boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to order his fighters back to their camps quelled immediate worries of major conflict inside Russia. But the episode signaled that Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s grasp on power is weakening. Images of tanks on Russian streets brought to mind the failed 1991 coup by communist hardliners that raised concerns about the security of ...</span>

Polymeropoulos, who is also a nonresident senior fellow in the Forward Defense practice of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, was speaking on MSNBC when he said he doesn&#x27;t see how &quot;there&#x27;s any reconciliation between Prigozhin and Putin.&quot;
&quot;Prigozhin has deeply humiliated Putin. This is not a victory for him, whatever has occurred that has caused this pause,&quot; Polymeropoulos said. &quot;I think Putin is really looking weak in front of the Russian people. He is not gonna forget this.&quot;
Polymeropoulos added that, if he were advising the Ukrainian military, he would instruct them to &quot;put the gas on&quot; during this period of upheaval.

                              <span>Masha Gessen began by declaring that we still don&#x27;t know exactly what the stand down means, or whether the rebellion is truly over. Regardless, though, Putin has to make some difficult choices, according to the journalist, who is also the author of Surviving Autocracy.
&quot;We don&#x27;t know what it means, as the previous speakers have said. I think there are two entirely contradictory forces right now acting on Putin. On one hand, there is some sort of deal, whether that means he has to give Prigozhin some of what he wants, which is probably more autonomy, more backup, less dependence on the Ministry of Defense, which is who has been struggling with for the last couple of weeks,&quot; they said.
On the other hand, according to the author, Putin still has to make sure &quot;to prevent this from happening again.&quot;
&quot;So he needs to crack down on the people who supported Prigozhin, on Prigozhin himself and people who have encountered Prigozhin&#x27;s forces in places that they have made it to in the last 24 hours. For, example, a large city in southern Russia, the seat of the southern military command in Russia, where, as they&#x27;re packing up to leave, according to .. reporting from there, people are applauding and saying thank you.&quot;
Gessen asks how Putin is &quot;going to balance these two completely contradictory&quot; positions.

Police said a security guard was wounded in the attack at Qalandia checkpoint and distributed a photo of an M-16 rifle used by the gunman who was claimed by Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed group associated with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas&#x27; Fatah party.

                              <span>Boebert actually took the position on Saturday that these types of international conflicts, like the one between Vladimir Putin and a paramilitary group, didn&#x27;t exist under former president Donald Trump.

tweeted Saturday.


	Boebert was excessively mocked in the comments on her own Twitter post.


	Another wrote, &quot;I remember when we had presidents that didn’t have multiple felony charges pending and didn’t call everyone a loser that he disagreed with. Ahh the good ol days.&quot;

stepped up to take a shot at Boebert&#x27;s message, choosing to retweet her post without additional commentary.

I am retweeting without comment this statement about what is happening to Putin by a Republican Member of Congress. https://t.co/yU07E9U26Y

                              <span>Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the paramilitary group that has been at the root of enormous chaos in Russia over the last two days, has reportedly announced that his troops marching toward Moscow would turn around.
The news comes from the New York Times, which announced that the decision came &quot;minutes after the leader of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, said he had successfully negotiated with the Wagner boss.&quot;
&quot;The statements offered the possibility that the rapidly evolving security crisis embroiling President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia’s government could be resolved without armed fighting between Russian authorities and Mr. Prigozhin’s forces,&quot; according to the report. &quot;But Mr. Prigozhin did not say whether his forces were leaving the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, a Russian military hub he has seized.&quot;

Zero Hedge: Putin Reassures Allies In Phone Calls, Erdogan Expresses &#x27;Full Support&#x27; Against Coup 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to reassure regional allies that he will crush the Wagner uprising now threatening the military and government, and will maintain a stable Russia. 
In what&#x27;s being described as his first international phone call since the Wagner mutiny began, which is grabbing the attention of Western governments, Putin spoke to his Belarus ally, President Alexander Lukashenko. &quot;The president of Russia called the president of Belarus this morning, there was a phone conversation,&quot; Belarusian state media confirmed. &quot;Vladimir Putin informed his Belarusian colleague about the situation in Russia.&quot;

WNU Editor: It must have been a tough day for Putin to call his foreign allies and tell them that he is control when tens of thousands of Russian troops had to be deployed onto the streets of Moscow to counter a convoy of Wagner forces. 
Fortunately for Putin, some of his allies like the Turkish and Egyptian Presidents, know what it is like to experience a coup.
 But the country that really counts is China, and so far they have said nothing. But Chinese state media have reported extensively  on this crisis, and they have expressed complete confidence that Putin will not only survive this insurrection, but come out stronger .... Putin vows to take ‘decisive actions’ against rebellious Wagner (Global Times). 
As to what is my take. 
This is a huge win for the West, because it gives substance to the Western media narrative that Putin is weak and Russia is not stable. Bottom line. The job of the US State Department and EU Foreign ministries to convince governments on the fence to edge away from Russia just got a little bit easier.

Update: The Duran predicted this months ago. Their analysis on this crisis (video below) was made before Prigozhin agreed to disengage his forces, but it is still a must see.</span>

                              <span>NewsRescue: Zelensky prepares ground to delay presidential election 
Ukraine will be unable to hold elections as long as martial law is in place, President Vladimir Zelensky told British national television BCC on Friday. 
His original five-year tenure will end in May 2024.

“According to the law, elections must take place during a period of peace, when there is no fighting,” Zelensky told the BBC when asked if a presidential election will take place next year.

Ukrainian legislation requires a parliamentary election by October 29 of this year. 
According to Rodion Miroshnik, former ambassador of the Lugansk People’s Republic in Moscow, in order for the 60-day campaign to begin on August 28, Kiev would need to lift martial law. Miroshnik told TASS that presidential elections will have to take place by March 2024.

WNU Editor: I do not think Prigozhin&#x27;s exile to Belarus is going to last long. But he had no choice. I know that outside of Moscow there is a huge military base with tens of thousands of soldiers present with heavy armor, and this morning they were all ordered out of their base and deployed to destroy Prigozhin&#x27;s approaching convoy at all costs. And in Rostov where Prigozhin was holed up, a massive Chechen force with Russian special forces were approaching the city to attack and evict him out of the military base that he was in. 
Bottom line. Receiving little if any public support and no support from any Russian military unit Prigozhin had to cut a deal. 
So what is next? 
Prigozhin will be exiled to Belarus, but he will be closely watched and his movements and communications will be severely restricted. 
The Wagner fighters who initially refused to participate in Prigozhin&#x27;s &quot;march&quot; will sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. 
There will be no changes in the Russian Ministry of Defense as demanded by Prigozhin. 
Belarus President Lukashenko is the big winner in this crisis. 
This is a big wake-up call for Putin. 
The vast majority of Russians understand why this war is being fought, and they support it. But they are not supporting the strategy on how to fight it. My fear is that Putin, in order to placate the growing impatience with the pace of the war, is going to significantly escalate the war that will include the use of strategic bombers as well as expanding what targets the Russian military will be permitted to destroy.</span>

WNU Editor: Busy since early this morning talking to friends, family, and contacts in Russia.

The sentiment has been this (quoting one commentator) .... One thing is certain, everybody understands that it’s an internal power struggle no one is afraid of soldiers from either side … formally the same side. 
Russian military blogs that I follow are saying this .... Prigozhin outlawed himself and PMCs Wagner. It&#x27;s a pity, they are patriots and good soldiers. 
The latest news that I have heard (which was 10 minutes ago) is that the Wagner convoy that was on its way to Moscow has stopped and they have not moved in the past few hours. Apparently a deal is being brokered.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…</span>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
