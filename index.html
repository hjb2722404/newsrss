“There’s not a region in the world that’s got a greater interest or greater stake than us ensuring we deal with the challenges of climate change, by reducing our carbon emissions and by ensuring we can build more resilience into our infrastructure in our nation.”</span>

                              <span>Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles says China declaring it will not pull out of the Taiwan Strait is “deeply concerning” as he calls for a de-escalation of tensions in the region. 

China admitted last night it will continue with its military drills for the foreseeable future. 

Marles said he wants a return to a more “peaceful environment”. 

“We will continue to stand firm on articulating the need for a global rules-based order and the application of that order all around the world – including in the Taiwan Strait,” he told Sky News Australia.</span>

The ministry was created in 2019 because President Volodymyr Zelensky had promised that Ukraine would be a pioneering e-government. Since the Russian invasion, digital transformation has been put on a &quot;war footing&quot;, Fedorov said. He told FRANCE 24&#x27;s Gulliver Cragg about several projects: a chatbot that allows people to send information about the movements of the Russian army, a joint project on drones with the Ukrainian military, as well as the use of artificial intelligence for facial recognition. The latter includes identifying slain Russian soldiers and informing their families via social media.</span>

Canadian investment firm Cypherpunk Holdings was one of the firms that opted to sell off crypto in the middle of the crypto winter of 2022, liquidating 100% of its Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) by June.  One of the world’s first public companies to invest in Bitcoin, Cypherpunk said at the time that it maintained its long-term “bullish outlook on crypto” despite selling off all of its digital coins.
One may find Cypherpunk’s crypto liquidation somewhat odd, as the company’s shares publicly trade under the symbol HODL on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  The acronym is widely used in the crypto community to refer to “Hold …</span>

                              <span>Issey Miyakethe Japanese designer famous for his style of pleated clothes and his cult perfumes, and whose name has become a global synonym of cutting-edge fashion in the 1980ss, died August 5.  He was 84 years old.
The death was announced Tuesday by studio Miyake Design, which said the cause was liver cancer.  He did not say where Mr. Miyake died. 
Mr. Miyake is perhaps best known for his signature micro pleating, which he first unveiled in 1988 but has recently seen growing popularity among a new and younger clientele.


Its proprietary heat treatment system means the accordion pleats are machine washable, never lose their shape and offer the ease of loungewear.  He also produced the black turtleneck that became part of the signature look of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.


This is a developing story.

For Hampshire County voters, three Democratic candidates are running for Hampshire County Sheriff. 
Each has unique qualifications to run the Hampshire County Jail and Reformatory.  I believe Caitlin Sepeda’s background in public health and nursing gives her the vision to lead this facility into the future. 
I encourage constituents to read her position papers and meet her in person.  Her position papers outline how she plans to run the house of corrections.  By meeting her, you understand that she has the knowledge, skills and ability to put those plans into action.

One is the self-proclaimed champion of the “scammer nation”.  The other is a veteran leftist who is in his fifth bid for high office.  Both are products of Kenya’s calcified and corrupt political system, but claim they can transform it – if elected president.
The hotly contested race to lead the flagship East African nation of Kenya reaches its climax on Tuesday when 22 million registered voters must choose between William Ruto, 55, currently the country’s vice-president, and Raila Odinga, a 77-year-old political veteran years old who is making his fifth candidacy for the presidency.
With the vote just days away, the race has been a headache – a testament to Kenya’s maturing democracy, which,…</span>

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has just claimed the ball, the clock has passed the 90th minute and the referee has calmed the chaos.  Arsenal won a penalty, one last chance to win the game.  It is also a chance for Emery, in his first season as Arsenal manager, to lead his side to the Champions League at the expense of bitter north London neighbors Tottenham Hotspur.
But Aubameyang, usually a lock from the penalty spot, fails to score.  That shot, that missed opportunity, was the moment, as far as Emery was concerned, that not only ended Arsenal’s hopes of playing alongside European footballi…</span>

                              <span>As a deadly fire continued to burn in northern California’s Klamath National Forest last week, local fisherman Kenneth Brink counted dead fish in a river that had taken on the consistency of ‘auburn milk. chocolate”.
Mr. Brink, 45, a member of the Karuk tribe, lives in Happy Camp, a town of fewer than 900 people on the Klamath River in Siskiyou County, California.  The city is close to the border with Oregon.  On Friday, he traveled about 20 miles upstream, where he made the grim discovery: thousands of dead suckers, salmon and trout, many of them floating belly up.


“It smells bad,” Mr. Brink said.  “If it was in that river, he’s dead.”
The McKinney Fire began July 29 and swept over 60,000 acres, killing four people and becoming California’s largest fire so far this year.  According to l…</span>

Calls on Neal to fix ‘fallout disposal provision’ for retirees

I don’t know how many people know about the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, but it makes it impossible for many of us in Massachusetts to increase our fixed incomes, especially in this horribly bloated economy. 
WEP essentially removes 60% of what you are owed to Social Security based on what you have contributed due to a state or municipal pension.  My husband was state, I was municipal.  This makes it impossible for many to retire, as their pension is not substantial and their Social Security payment has been decimated. 
I used to receive statements of the amount I was owed to Social Security to date, based on what I had contributed.  The Social Security …</span>

Trump’s Florida residence was tied to an investigation into whether he illegally took government records when he left the White House have drawn attention to an obscure criminal law prohibiting the deletion of official documents.  Penalties for violations of this law include disqualification from holding any federal office.
Because Mr. Trump is widely believed to be preparing to run for president again in 2024, this unusual sanction has raised the prospect that he could be legally barred from returning to the White House.
Specifically, the law in question — Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code – makes it a crime if someone who has custody of government documents or records “conceals, removes, mutilates, erases,…</span>

But she still won’t accept the misconception that the election can somehow be overturned, a fantasy that has taken hold among many Republicans in the state, encouraged by one of her opponents, Tim Ramthun.


And for that, she takes on the grief of voters in the final days before Tuesday’s primary.

In order for the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the so-called intradermal injection, which would involve injecting one-fifth of the current dose into the skin instead of a full dose into the underlying fat, the Department of Health and Human Services Social media will have to issue a new emergency declaration allowing regulators to invoke the FDA’s emergency use powers.

Torturing a sentence of by Thomas Frank seminal political analysis, what’s wrong with tuesday’s national media coverage referendum in Kansas on abortion rights?
Monday evening, the Democratic political analyst James Carville    told me he thought the Aug. 2 vote on reproductive rights was the most consequential vote in thirty years, and it doesn’t take a political genius to figure out why.  The outcome of the vote not only determines Kansas women’s abortion rights, but it is the mother of all political indicators following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v.  Wade.
And even?  Besides a brief mention at 9 a.m. Hello Joe, morning shows on all three major cable news networks ignored Tuesday’s vote – a vote that will set states’ course on health care, choic…</span>

“History shows that strong democracies tend to be more stable and less prone to conflict – and that the poor governance, exclusion and corruption inherent in weak democracies make them more vulnerable to extremist movements and foreign interference. “, Mr. Blinken said in a speech at the University of Pretoria, the first leg of a tour of Af…</span>

                              <span>Former US President Donald Trump is claiming his home has been raided by the FBI.

FBI agents searched his Mar-A-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, according to Mr Trump. 

The former president expressed his anger at the raid in a statement saying it is an attack by “Radical Left Democrats”. 

“Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those countries, corrupt at a level not seen before.”</span>

Mr Paterson said it was not Australia’s place to “dictate” to either Taiwan or US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi what they can do.  

“Where I think we have a very strong interest is in recognising the malign behaviour of the Chinese government,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“It is a grossly disproportionate reaction to fire ballistic missiles into other people’s territorial waters.”</span>

CNN reports the investigation is in relation to the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been transferred to Florida.

Donald Trump, who was not in Florida at the time of the raid, released a statement about the incident.

&quot;These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,&quot; Mr Trump wrote. 

&quot;Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.&quot;</span>

The patients were women, of course, but almost all of the medical staff were too.  As we walked through the hallways, which smelled of disinfectant, she pointed out that they were clean and freshly painted — a drastic change from a year ago, when they were fetid with bodily fluids and litter.  The hospital, too, had suffered from corruption and dysfunction endemic to the republic.  Much of the civil service stopped receiving salaries as early as April or May.  The former government had attempted to switch to a new payroll system, while simultaneously burning through its cash reserves in a last-ditch attempt to fund anti-Taliban militias.

                              <span>Clu Gulager, a rugged character actor who appeared in critically acclaimed films like “The Last Picture Show” as well as low-budget horror films, and who memorably portrayed gunslingers in two TV westerns , died Friday at the home of his son John in Los Angeles.  .  He was 93 years old.
John Gulager confirmed the death.  He said his father’s health had declined since he suffered a back injury several years ago.
Mr. Gulager’s raw good looks and his upbringing in the Southwest made him a natural for the westerns that proliferated on television in the 1950s and 1960s. He was seen regularly in ‘Wagon Train’, ‘Bonanza’ , “Have Gun – Will Travel” and other shows.

                              <span>In the East River, near Mary Ellin’s penthouse home, her father had once, at age 8, nearly drowned;  when he was rescued, he was found still holding the pennies he had earned that day selling newspapers.
He often seemed like a ‘shaky, uncertain man’, Ms Barrett wrote – drumming her fingers, molding the insides of buns into tight balls, smoking too many cigarettes, chewing too much gum, jumping when the phone rang, gambling with his piano.
Yet he came out of it blow after blow after blow;  between his 20s and his 60s, he wrote about 1,500 songs.
Mrs. Barrett came to see her father’s drive as the product of the anxiety and tenacity that lingered from a childhood in the ghetto.  He was “the street fighter”, she writes, “not loud and feisty but quiet, stubborn”, never shaking the feeling that he was acting “with his back against the wall, writing, composing, negotiating his way out of a corner”.
Mary Ellin Berlin, born November 25, 1926 in Manhattan, grew up in a different world.  His childhood memories included dinners with the Astaires, the Goldwyns, the Capras, and Somerset Maugham, who, lying on the floor, placed a glass of water on his forehead and stood up without spilling a drop.
Although she sometimes had to chase her father for attention and felt alienated by the fame of her parents – her mother, Ellin Mackay, was an heiress and popular novelist—Mary Ellin felt less resentment than delight at her good fortune.  When she relentlessly invited people to family theater seats for her father’s 1946 Broadway smash hit, “Annie Get Your Gun,” an annoyed friend told her to stop.

                              <span>As countries around the world try to cope with rising prices, there may not be a major economy that understands how to live with inflation better than argentina.
The country has struggled with rapidly rising prices for much of the past 50 years.  During a chaotic period in the late 1980s, inflation soared to an almost unbelievable 3,000% and locals rushed to get groceries before clerks with price guns could do so. their turn.  Today, high inflation is back, exceeding 30% every year since 2018.
To understand how Argentines are coping, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurant owners, real estate agents, barbers, taxi drivers, moneychangers coins, street artists, street vendors and the unemployed.
The economy isn’t always the best topic of conversation, but in Argentina it has animated just about everyone, sparking curses, deep sighs, and educated opinions on monetary policy.  One woman happily showed her stash for a wad of US dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed money in her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress snuck up. is asked if she had immigrated to the right country.
One thing has become startlingly clear: Argentines have developed a very unusual relationship with their money.
They spend their pesos as quickly as they receive them.  They buy everything from televisions to potato peelers in installments.  They don’t trust banks.  They barely use credit.  And after years of constant price hikes, they have little idea what things should cost.
Argentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to imagine almost anywhere else in the world.  Life is especially manageable for those who can afford to turn the system upside down.  But all of these stark workarounds mean that few of those who have held political power through years of economic distress have found themselves paying the real price.

But the good news could now become a problem for President Biden later.
Mr. Biden and his aides pointed to the hiring spree as proof that the United States is not in a recession and celebrated the report, which showed employers added 528,000 jobs in July and wages rose 5.2% from a year earlier.  But the still blistering pace of hiring and wage growth means the Federal Reserve may need to act more decisively to rein in the economy as it seeks to tame inflation.
Fed officials were waiting for signs that the economy, and in particular the labor market, was slowing.  They hope employers’ voracio…</span>

                              <span>National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby schooled Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy on Tuesday about whether the United States &quot;owned Afghanistan.&quot;
During a White House briefing on the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri, Doocy said President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration &quot;gave a country&quot; to terrorists.
&quot;What did you think was going to happen?&quot; Doocy asked.
&quot;I would take issue with the premise that we gave a whole country to terrorist groups,&quot; Kirby replied. 
&quot;It&#x27;s harboring the world&#x27;s number one terrorist, how is that not giving a country to a terrorist-sympathizing group?&quot; Doocy pressed.
Kirby objected to Doocy&#x27;s assumptions.
&quot;I mean, Peter, the way you ask that, it makes it sound like we owned Afghanistan a year ago,&quot; the White House official remarked. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t our country. It was an independent sovereign state and the president made a bold decision to end a war that had been going on for 20 years.&quot;

                              <span>WASHINGTON, D.C. — Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters that he&#x27;s satisfied with the slaying of the top al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri after a military action ordered by President Joe Biden. Still, Graham said he wants more. 
&quot;It&#x27;s beyond brazen that he would be living in a house of the Minister of Interior,&quot; said Graham. &quot;So, my advice would be to move assets forward, get countries in the region who would not benefit from an al-Qaeda rise, and start hitting the training camps.&quot;
“What unnerves me is that al-Zawahiri felt comfortable enough being out in the open in the Kabul area after the Taliban takeover. So much for the Taliban rejecting al Qaeda,&quot; Graham tweeted on Monday evening. &quot;This is proof positive that Afghanistan has once again become a safe haven for international terror…</span>

                              <span>Washington on Tuesday imposed a new round of sanctions targeting Kremlin-connected elites for their role in supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s war on Ukraine.
&quot;As innocent people suffer from Russia&#x27;s illegal war of aggression, Putin&#x27;s allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,&quot; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
The financial sanctions hit Putin-associate and billionaire Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, who owns the Witanhurst estate, the second-largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace. They also targeted Guryev&#x27;s son and Caribbean-based yacht Alfa Nero.
Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov, one of Russia&#x27;s largest taxpayers, and two subsidiaries of his MMK, which is among the world&#x27;s largest steel producers, also were slapped with sanctions, as well as two other Russian elites: Alina Maratovna Kabaeva and Natalya Valeryevna Popova, the statement said.
&quot;The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin&#x27;s enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives,&quot; Yellen said, adding that the goal is &quot;to choke off revenue and equipment underpinning Russia&#x27;s unprovoked war in Ukraine.&quot;
In a joint action, the State Department imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions, on oligarchs &quot;running massive revenue-generating companies,&quot; including Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko and Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko, as well as nearly 900 officials, and a series of defense- and technology-related firms aiding &quot;Russia&#x27;s war machine.&quot;
The Treasury sanctions seize any US-based funds or property owned by the individuals or organizations, and prohibit American-based firms from having any financial dealings with them, although investors will have a few weeks to wind down transactions with MMK.</span>

                              <span>WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a rare moment of bipartisanship, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) told Raw Story that he thinks his Republican colleagues need to stand with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). 
Pelosi landed in Taiwan a little after 10 p.m. local time amid China&#x27;s threats that they&#x27;d conduct military exercises around the island while she is there. 
Sullivan explained that he was among the group of Republicans who went to Taiwan in 2021 as China was withholding vaccinations to the island. Sullivan was joined by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) and too faced threats from China as they delivered vaccines. China told the 2021 group to reconsider their trip as well, but it was ignored.

The Egyptian jihadist, who the United States says has been killed in a hideout in the Afghan capital Kabul, never even attempted to replicate the charisma and influence of his predecessor Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States.
But after US special forces killed bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, he played a key role in encouraging a decentralization of the group, which resulted in Al-Qaeda franchises emerging all over the planet.

&quot;Are you here to support Taiwan or to provoke a war? What the hell are you doing here, Pelosi?&quot;
Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement insisting the congressional delegation&#x27;s trip to the island that most of the international community including the United States considers part of China &quot;in no way contradicts&quot; U.S. adherence to the &quot;One China&quot; policy, but rather &quot;honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan&#x27;s vibrant democracy.&quot;

                              <span>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) used her congressional Twitter account to claim that Democrats engaged in a conspiracy to claim terrorist mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed to boost their midterm fortunes.
In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Greene suggested that Democrats were taking action because President Joe Biden had not gotten a boost from Russia&#x27;s war on Ukraine. 
&quot;November is coming and proxy war with Russia, killing more people and grinding Ukraine to a stump, is not as popular with voters as the admin thought it would be,&quot; she opined. &quot;The [White House] admin looks extremely weak &amp; controlled by Zelensky and the Global World Order, but don’t be fooled.&quot;
Greene said that Democrats &quot;are not done with weapon sales and money laundering in the form of &#x27;humanitarian aid&#x27; in Ukraine.&quot;
RELATED: John Kirby flattens Fox News host who says Al Qaeda &#x27;feels pretty good&#x27; after drone strike
She argued that there was a conspiracy to kill al-Zawahiri because Ukraine was &quot;causing problems for weak Dems upcoming re-elections.&quot;
&quot;They even pivoted back to killing an old Al Qaeda terrorist so Biden could murmur his tough guy talk claiming he led the killing of Zawahiri,&quot; the lawmaker wrote. &quot;Biden should be impeached NOT taking credit!&quot;
Greene said that there were many &quot;good questions&quot; about the killing.
&quot;If we were in Afghanistan for so many years, why is it we just found out where Zawahiri is and finally killed him?&quot; she asked. &quot;What trade was made for that Intel?&quot;
&quot;Is there proof he was killed?&quot; Greene continued. &quot;It was recently reported he was sick and dying.&quot;

                              <span>US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in Taiwan late on Tuesday, starting a visit that Beijing had warned her against taking, saying it would undermine Sino-US relations.
Live television images showed the 82-year-old lawmaker, who flew on a US military aircraft into Taipei&#x27;s Songshan Airport, being greeted on arrival by Taiwan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
&quot;Our congressional delegation’s visit to Taiwan honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant Democracy,&quot; Pelosi said in a statement shortly after landing.
&quot;America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.&quot;
China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, and a foreign ministry spokesman said earlier this week that any visit by Pelosi would be &quot;a gross interference in China&#x27;s internal affairs&quot; and warned that &quot;the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army will never sit idly by&quot;.
Pelosi was on a tour of Asia that includes announced visits to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan.

Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most serious crisis in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when many people feared the world was on the brink of nuclear war.
Russia&#x27;s defence ministry, headed by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine&#x27;s deputy head of military intelligence, had admitted to the Telegraph newspaper that Washington coordinates HIMARS missile strikes.

                              <span>LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign minister Liz Truss, the frontrunner to replace British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has a smaller lead over her rival Rishi Sunak than previously thought, according to a poll of party members.
Truss is backed by 48% of Conservative Party members compared with 43% for former finance minister Sunak, according to the poll of 807 people by Italian data company Techne, carried out July 19-27.
This suggests a much tighter race than a previous poll of Conservative members carried out by YouGov on July 20-21 that showed Truss with a 24-point lead over Sunak.
Sunak and Truss are competing in a summer tour of hustings around Britain for the votes of about 200,000 Conservative members, who will select the next prime minister with the winner announced Sept. 5.

                              <span>(Reuters) - The Kremlin warned the United States on Tuesday that an expected visit to Taiwan by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi would put it on a collision course with China and provoke tensions in the region.
&quot;We cannot say for sure right now whether she will or will not get there, but everything about this tour and the possible visit to Taiwan is purely provocative,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
China has repeatedly warned Pelosi against going to Taiwan, which it claims as its own. Beijing says a Pelosi visit would contravene the one-China principle that Washington has vowed to abide by.

Even though Moscow has been able to pull in billions of dollars from continued energy sales at elevated prices, largely unpublished data shows that much of its domestic economic activity has stalled since the February 24 invasion, according to the report released in late July.

                              <span>A land iguana that disappeared more than a century ago from one of the Galapagos Islands is reproducing naturally following its reintroduction there, Ecuador&#x27;s environment ministry announced Monday.
The reptile from the Conolophus subcristatus species, one of three land iguanas living on the archipelago, disappeared from Santiago Island in the early part of the 20th century according to a 1903-06 expedition there by the California Academy of Sciences, the ministry said.
In 2019, the Galapagos National Park (PNG) authority reintroduced more than 3,000 iguanas from a nearby island to restore the natural ecosystem of Santiago, which lies at the center of the Pacific archipelago.
The remote island chain was made famous by British geologist and naturalist Charles Darwin&#x27;s observations on evolution there.
In 1835, Darwin recorded a huge number of iguanas of all ages on Santiago.
PNG director Danny Rueda said &quot;187 years later we are once again seeing a healthy population of land iguanas with adults, juveniles and newborns.
&quot;It&#x27;s a great conservation achievement and strengthens our hopes of restoration on the islands that have been severely affected by introduced species.&quot;
Located close to 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos islands are home to unique flora and fauna and are a Natural World Heritage site.

Zawahiri had been in hiding for years and the operation to locate and kill him was the result of &quot;careful patient and persistent&quot; work by the counter-terrorism and intelligence community, a senior administration official told reporters.
Until the U.S. announcement, Zawahiri had been rumored variously to be in Pakistan&#x27;s tribal area or inside Afghanistan.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official provided the following details on the operation:
* For several years, the U.S. government had been aware of a network that it assessed supported Zawahiri, and over the past year, …</span>

One person familiar with Pelosi&#x27;s itinerary said that most of her planned meetings, including with President Tsai Ing-wen, were scheduled for Wednesday, and that it was possible that her delegation would arrive in Taiwan early on Wednesday.
&quot;Everything is uncertain,&quot; the person said.
Taiwan newspaper Liberty Times said Pelosi&#x27;s delegation was due to arrive at 10:20 p.m. (1420 GMT) on Tuesday, without naming sources.

                              <span>President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. killed top al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who served as Osama bin Laden&#x27;s No. 2 in the ongoing attacks on the United States. But according to an NBC report from 2020, former President Donald Trump had an opportunity to do the same, but refused because he didn&#x27;t recognize al-Zawahiri&#x27;s name. 
Reporting in early 2020, NBC News reported that intelligence officials briefed then-President Trump many times about the most worrisome terrorist threats, specifically mentioning al-Zawahri.
Trump would ultimately agree to take out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Yemeni al Qaeda chief Qasim al-Rimi. But other of the significant names on the CIA&#x27;s list were ignored.  
Trump &quot;was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name,&quot; the report said at the time. 

&quot;He would say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?&#x27;&quot; the former official told NBC.
A Pentagon official agreed, noting, &quot;That was the only name he knew.&quot; 
By contrast, Biden explained that after &quot;relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family.&quot;
&quot;This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians, and one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success,&quot; Biden also said.</span>

                              <span>On Monday&#x27;s edition of CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room,&quot; retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling broke down the significance of the successful U.S. strike that took out Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda who took over from Osama bin Laden.
Zawahiri, noted Hertling, has been sought by the U.S. for decades — and was a critical piece of the terrorist operation.
&quot;How significant is this strike killing the al-Qaeda leader?&quot; asked anchor Wolf Blitzer.
&quot;This is a target the U.S. has been going after for three decades, even before the 9/11 strike,&quot; said Hertling. &quot;He leads al-Qaeda with various networks around the globe. Central places in control. These areas, we&#x27;re talking about an individual who is the CEO of this organization. You can debate how powerful he is, compared to bin Laden, but it&#x27;s a big deal.&quot;
Another important aspect, said Hertling, is how the U.S. was able to take him out despite no longer having on-the-ground intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, having withdrawn U.S. forces last year.
&quot;This is more than likely a drone strike. I would give that a 70 percent possibility,&quot; said Hertling. &quot;I would not rule out a hand strike on this individual, either. What you are talking about, the kinds of things we were talking about when we withdrew from Afghanistan, this will be an over-the-horizon strike with very little capability for collecting intelligence within Afghanistan. This was a significant hit by both the intelligence community and anyone who pulled off the operation.&quot;

                              <span>Top Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed over the weekend in Afghanistan while hiding out at the home of an Afghan government official and Taliban member, the New York Times reported. 
According to reports, President Joe Biden, who was isolated with a rebound infection of COVID-19, authorized the strike against al-Zawahiri. Biden will address the nation at 7:30 p.m. EST Monday evening. 
He is among the most pursued terrorists in the world after the slaying of Osama bin Laden, MSNBC reported. 
The Times also reported that the operation was not a military one, and instead was conducted through the CIA. The government won&#x27;t respond to questions about it, however. 
Al-Zawahiri was among the top organizers of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Towers, the Washington Post described. 
&quot;Zawahiri was a senior adviser to bin Laden at the time of al-Qaeda’s first high-profile terrorist attacks, the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds of people,&quot; said the report. &quot;Three years later, working from al-Qaeda’s base in Afghanistan, he helped oversee the planning of what would become one of history’s most audacious terrorist attacks: the Sept. 11 strikes in New York and Washington.&quot;
Sept. 11 hijackers were sent to begin training in the U.S. while Zawahiri was in charge of following up on other terrorist attacks that aimed to weaken the U.S. economy. 
&quot;He launched an ambitious biological weapons program, establishing a laboratory in Afghanistan and dispatching disciples to search for sympathetic scientists as well as lethal strains of anthrax bacteria,&quot; said the Post.</span>

                              <span>QAnon influencers and anti-vaxxers are spreading an antisemitic conspiracy theory about the global food crisis caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
Conspiracy theorist Twitter accounts have started pushing disinformation blaming Jewish people for the interruption of grain exports from Ukraine, echoing claims by the Russian government -- which has blamed western sanctions on the disruption, according to research by the Network Contagion Research Institute that was reported by The Guardian.
&quot;According to NCRI, the accounts frequently link rising food insecurity to a &#x27;cabal of shadowy, and often Jewish elites, for bringing about the New World Order,&#x27; rather than to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,&quot; the newspaper reported.
Russia has blocked Ukraine&#x27;s shipping ports, which puts millions of people in Africa and elsewhere at risk of starvation, but antisemitic social media users are making up claims about Jewish manipulation of the food supply.

“Never believe for one moment there’s a shortage of anything. Food. Water. Oil. They create and manufacture these shortages. These aren’t naturally occurring whatsoever,&quot; claimed QAnon influencer GhostEzra.
The NCRI and the Rutgers Miller Center conducted open-source analysis of Russian disinformation websites and individuals, and then analyzed the use of terms around food security on Twitter and Telegram, and detected the pattern of disinformation flowing from Kremlin-linked media and QAnon influencers and other conspiracy theorists.
“There is a significant overlap between QAnon and other anti-vax and online conspiracy communities,” said Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst at the NCRI and a research fellow at the Rutgers Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience. “Some of the more colorful food-mandate conspiracies intermingle with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”</span>

During the over-the-top discussion, Errol Musk claimed that other members of his family have substantial accomplishments, telling the hosts, &quot;You know, we are a family that have been doing a lot of things for a long time. It&#x27;s not as if we suddenly started doing something.&quot;
He also added that rival son Kimbal is his actual &quot;pride and joy,&quot; adding that that Elon&#x27;s brother is also a &quot;billionaire&quot; -- albeit a single-billion billionaire.
Pressed on photos of a pale and fleshy Elon that have popped up in the tabloids recently, Errol told the hosts, &quot;Elon is very strongly built but he&#x27;s been eating badly,&quot; and stated he has been urging his son to use a supplement called garcinia cambogia to help with his weight gain.

Asked if he owns a Tesla, the father of the car company founder admitted he drives a Bentley, later adding that he also owns a Mercedes Benz.
Towards the end of the 20-minute interview, he was asked by the laughing hosts if his son is circumcised, and he joked it off by claiming he would send them a picture.</span>

                              <span>UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced &quot;a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War&quot; and was just &quot;one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.&quot;
&quot;We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,&quot; Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
&quot;Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,&quot; he said, calling on nations to &quot;put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.&quot;
Guterres&#x27;s comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The meeting, held at the UN&#x27;s headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.
Guterres said the conference was &quot;a chance to strengthen&quot; the treaty and &quot;make it fit for the worrying world around us,&quot; citing Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.
&quot;Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used,&quot; the secretary-general implored, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of the August 6, 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city by the United States.
&quot;Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,&quot; Guterres added.
In January, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- had pledged to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons.
At the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach agreement on substantive issues.

                              <span>Hong Kong has tipped back into a technical recession, new government figures showed Monday, weighed down by mounting interest rates, weakened global trade and the city&#x27;s continued adherence to strict coronavirus controls.
Following a year-on-year decrease of 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the city&#x27;s GDP again reported decline in the second quarter on Monday -- but with a narrower margin of 1.4 percent -- according to advance estimates released by the Census and Statistics Department.
The downturn is reversing last year&#x27;s recovery when the economy enjoyed a 6.3 percent annual growth after the slowdown in 2019 and 2020, when the city was first upended by months of huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, and then the pandemic.
