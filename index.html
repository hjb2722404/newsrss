                              <span>Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s legacy is viewed “a little bit more negatively” in Russia than if you asked people in Europe, the United States or other places around the world, CNN correspondent Fred Pleitgen says. 

Mr Gorbachev died at the age of 91 after a long illness, according to Russian media outlets. 

“There are a lot of people who obviously also like Mikhail Gorbachev or liked Mikhail Gorbachev a lot, but there are also people who are very critical of him,” Mr Pleitgen told Sky News Australia.

“Because they felt that, you know after Mikhail Gorbachev - after the Soviet Union fell apart - that the country lost some of its prestige, lost its place in the world where … before that it was on par with the US as a world superpower, a nuclear superpower. 

“And they felt almost a sense of humiliation.”</span>

Mr Gorbachev died at the age of 91 after a long illness, according to Russian media outlets. 

“The curtain has come down on one of the world’s most significant leaders,” Mr Chalmers said during a media conference on Wednesday.  

“When the world saw conflict and stalemate, he saw peace and possibility. 

“He was the epitome of courage and vision, and he was a reminder that it takes more courage to end a war than to start one. 

“The world mourns his passing.”</span>

                              <span>Defence Minister Richard Marles is confident Australia can continue to strengthen ties with the Solomon Islands after the Pacific Island nation announced a ban on naval visits by the United States. 

The Albanese government has not indicated whether the naval ban also applies to Australian ships. 

However, the Deputy Prime Minister says the government doesn&#x27;t take the relationship for granted. 

“Ultimately, those sorts of decisions are clearly decisions for the Solomon Islands government, and we understand and respect that,” Mr Marles said. 

“We really do feel confident that we will be able to build our relationship with Solomon Islands to a point where we are the natural partner of choice.”</span>

Former president donald trump insisted that he be immediately reinstated as president or a new election is called.  His reasoning?  A Mark Zuckerberg interview in which the Facebook founder reiterated his previous claim that the FBI warned him of a potential Russian fake news spill weeks before the 2020 general election that Trump lost to the president Joe Biden.
Yes, the former president really demanded that he be reinstated as president 664 days after losing the election.  By any objective measure, that’s insane.  Damn crazy.

Less than 50 years ago John Boyle was the County Sheriff of Hampshire.  Sheriff Boyle lived at Union Street Jail in Northampton and ran the jail.  His deputies signed court summonses and found people on the streets to fill the jury pools.
The sheriff also performed ceremonial duties – carrying the mace at Smith College’s debut and leading parades, wearing his top hat, tailcoat and gold waistcoat.  He was the face of the county of Hampshire.
Since then, our county government has been abolished and the state government has taken control of the courts and correctional services.  The sheriff became just another, albeit important, state employee.  Managing the old county jail and reformatory, overseeing prisoner rehabilitation, serving court proceedings, executing evictions – these are all important jobs.
The sheriff is the only official elected by the citizens of the county of Hampshire, and only by the citizens of the county of Hampshire.  It is more important than ever that the Sheriff continues to represent the county of Hampshire at its public events. 
As far as I know, none of the current sheriff candidates have even mentioned this issue.

Reuters: Russia can&#x27;t stop war, even if Ukraine drops NATO hopes -Putin ally 
(Reuters) - A top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow would not stop its military campaign in Ukraine even if Kyiv formally renounced its aspirations to join NATO. 
Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia&#x27;s Security Council, also said in a French television interview that Russia was prepared to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy subject to certain conditions. 
Even before the February invasion, Moscow made clear Ukrainian membership of NATO was unacceptable to it. 
&quot;Renouncing its participation in the North Atlantic alliance is now vital, but it is already insufficient in order to establish peace,&quot; Medvedev told LCI television in quotes reported by Russian news agencies.

But he is right that the &quot;goalposts&quot; to end the war have moved since March. The goal of the Kremlin right now is for regime change in Kyiv, and to assert control over the Russian-Ukrainian dominated parts of Ukraine.

During the runup to the financial crisis, your humble blogger pointed out that financial time moved faster than political time. Market players often had better and more comprehensive access to important information than officials did and had strong incentives to act on it. 
By contrast, regulated entities were motivated to shuffle their feet and mumble until problems became undeniable…and then the regulators themselves would too often hope gunshot wounds would magically heal themselves, rather than risk having to answer embarrassing questions by going into emergency response mode.

The world can still step back from the abyss. The nuclear weapon states – the US, Russia, China, France and the UK – must lead the way 
In 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict for the first and only time. 355,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki by two nuclear bombs. 
Two. That number alone puts in stark perspective the world’s current arsenal of about 13,000 nuclear weapons. 
And yet in many ways the 13,000 weapons held globally represents progress; it’s less than a quarter of the more than 63,000 weapons in circulation in 1985 during the cold war.

                              <span>VOA: US Navy Stops Iran From Seizing Drone Ship  
Pentagon — The U.S. Navy said its forces overnight prevented a support ship from Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from capturing a U.S. unmanned surface vessel operating in the Arabian Gulf. 
The U.S. military released video Tuesday showing the IRGC support ship Shahid Baziar &quot;unlawfully towing a Saildrone Explorer unmanned surface vessel in international waters&quot; &quot;in an attempt to detain it.&quot; 
U.S. Navy patrol coastal ship USS Thunderbolt immediately responded, along with a MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter based in Bahrain. 
Shahid Baziar disconnected its towing line to the drone and departed the area approximately four hours later, the Navy said.

* Mikhail Gorbachev - the last leader of the Soviet Union - has died in a Moscow hospital aged 91 
* Gorbachev helped bring the Cold War to an end and failed to prevent the collapse of the USSR 
* Under his rule, the Iron Curtain which had divided Europe since the Second World War disintegrated

                              <span>WNU Editor: A lot of updates today. 
I could be wrong, but I am having the impression that this Ukraine counter-offensive lost some steam today, and that high casualties are being reported. 
Interestingly, unlike the Russian Ministry of Defense that is now giving a lot of updates on this counter-offensive, the Ukraine military command has been very quiet. This (of course) could change by tomorrow, but my gut is telling me that Ukraine is throwing everything into this battle, and  a better picture on what is happening will be made more clearer by the weekend.</span>

                              <span>OilPrice.com: Iran Is Ready To Release Millions Of Barrels Of Oil Into The Market 
Iran has considerable volumes of oil in floating storage that it could quickly release should a deal with the United States be finalized. 
In an update earlier this month, OilX claimed that Iran has some 40 million barrels, the bulk of which is probably condensate. 
Vortexa estimates Iranian crude in floating storage at 60 to 70 million barrels while Kpler has estimated them at 93 million barrels, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.

Update #2: Iran May Drain Offshore Oil Cache If Nuclear Deal Reached -- Bloomberg   
WNU Editor: A massive release of this oil onto world markets will result in a major decrease in oil prices for the short term. 
So why the offer now?
 I see this as an attempt by Iran to push the Biden administration to agree to Tehran&#x27;s terms to reach a deal, and in return Iran will release this oil just weeks ahead of the US midterm elections.</span>

Military ends nationwide curfew after influential cleric entreats supporters to retreat from Baghdad&#x27;s Green Zone and apologises for violence 
Supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, carrying guns and driving tuk-tuk vehicles, have begun withdrawing from Baghdad&#x27;s Green Zone after the influential Shia cleric called on Tuesday for them to end their actions. 
Following the move, the Iraqi military&#x27;s Joint Operations Command said it had been decided to lift the nationwide curfew in the capital Baghdad and other provinces, following two days of violence. 
During a news conference in Najaf, Sadr ordered his followers to end their protests, sparked by his withdrawal from politics on Monday, and apologised to Iraqis after 28 people were killed in clashes.

Negative economic growth in the year’s first half may be a foreshock to a much deeper downturn that could last into 2024. 
Stephen Roach, who served as chair of Morgan Stanley Asia, warns the U.S. needs a “miracle” to avoid a recession. 
“We’ll definitely have a recession as the lagged impacts of this major monetary tightening start to kick in,” Roach told CNBC’s “Fast Money” on Monday. “They haven’t kicked in at all right now.”

OilPrice.com: The World’s Energy Problem Is Far Worse Than We’re Being Told 
* Citizens around the world can sense that something is very wrong, and it looks like the economy may be headed for a serious recession in the near term. 
* The operation of our economy requires energy of the correct type and the right quantity. 
* The International Energy Agency and politicians around the world have recommended a transition to the use of renewables to try to prevent climate change for quite a few years. 
No politician wants to tell us the real story of fossil fuel depletion. The real story is that we are already running short of oil, coal and natural gas because the direct and indirect costs of extraction are reaching a point where the selling price of food and other basic necessities needs to be unacceptably high to make the overall economic system work. At the same time, wind and solar and other “clean energy” sources are nowhere nearly able to substitute for the quantity of fossil fuels being lost.

Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sogavare has announced a temporary moratorium on visits by foreign naval vessels after turning away a U.S Coast Guard Cutter last week. 
Speaking at a ceremony welcoming hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH-19) to Honiara, Sogavare said that bureaucratic issues were behind the denial of diplomatic clearance to USCGC Oliver Henry (WPC-1140). 
“Unfortunately, by the time the approval was communicated on the evening of 20th August 2022, the Ship’s captain had decided to leave our waters.” Sogavare said in statement.

The company did not specify the reason for the dispute, but did say it ‘had already secured the volumes necessary to meet its commitment towards its customers.’ 
French utility Engie announced that Russian energy giant Gazprom will reduce gas deliveries as of today over a contract disagreement. 
The company did not specify the reason for the dispute, but did say it “had already secured the volumes necessary to meet its commitment towards its customers and its own requirements,” adding that measures were in place to reduce the potential “financial and physical impacts” of the disruption.
Emmanuelle Wargon, the head of France&#x27;s energy regulatory commission, said today that the agency is “not too worried” about the supply squeeze, saying French gas reserves are now 91 percent full and should be entirely filled by the end of September or the beginning of October.

More than two-fifths of Americans believe civil war is at least somewhat likely in the next 10 years, according to a new survey – a figure that increases to more than half among self-identified “strong Republicans”. 
Amid heated rhetoric from supporters of Donald Trump, the findings, in research by YouGov and the Economist, follow similar results in other polls. 
On Sunday night, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham predicted “riots in the streets” if Trump is indicted over his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House, materials recovered by the FBI at Trump’s home this month.

* Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the US has sent lots of weaponry to the eastern European nation. 
* Among those are M777 Howitzers and the 155mm ammunition for the weapons. 
* But this has depleted the US&#x27;s own stockpiles of the munitions, The Wall Street Journal reported. 
The US has provided Ukraine with so much weaponry to fend off Russia&#x27;s unprovoked invasion that Pentagon stockpiles for some munitions are &quot;uncomfortably low,&quot; defense officials told The Wall Street Journal. 
Lower levels of 155mm ammunition, which can be fired from US-made M777 Howitzers, have some officials especially concerned, the Journal reported on Monday. 
An unnamed defense official told the Journal that the level of 155mm ammunition in US stockpiles hasn&#x27;t reached critical levels, but it&#x27;s &quot;uncomfortably low&quot; and &quot;is not at the level we would like to go into combat.&quot;

   Warzone/The Drive: Taiwan Says It Will Now Shoot Down Rogue Chinese Drones 
After a string of embarrassing incursions by Chinese drones over its outlying islands, Taiwan has vowed to shoot them down, if necessary. 
As its next move in the fast-developing challenge of Chinese drone incursions, the Taiwanese military has reportedly confirmed that it will, in the future, shoot down unmanned aerial vehicles that don’t respond to its warnings. The move comes after authorities on the self-governing island said they would deploy undisclosed domestically developed drone defense systems across its territory, which followed a highly public encounter between a Chinese drone and two Taiwanese soldiers, as you can read about more here.

Fortune: Europe could face ‘terrible’ winters for a decade due to energy crisis, one official warns 
This year, Europeans have struggled with record-high energy prices as extreme weather and the war in Ukraine put unprecedented stress on the market. 
While heat waves are drying up some of the continent’s key shipping routes and threatening nuclear energy production this summer, there’s no evidence that things will improve once the weather cools.
The pressure could persist for multiple winters to come, and even up to a decade, one official warns.  “The next 5 to 10 winters will be terrible if nothing is done,” tweeted Belgium Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten on Sunday.

Daily Mail: France warns it may have to RATION energy this winter 
* Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne urged French businesses to reduce consumption

France&#x27;s Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Monday company urged bosses to take steps to reduce their energy consumption.
&#x27;If we act collectively then we can overcome the risk of shortages, but unless everyone takes part and if all the bad-case scenarios come together then we could be forced to impose reductions on consumers,&#x27; she told the Medef business group.

June lows look increasingly attractive
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView captured the latest dive below the 2017 bull market peak for BTC/USD, with US stocks falling at the same time.
The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite indices lost 1.1% and 1.25% respectively in the first hour, while BTC/USD lost 2.5% in a single hourly candle.
The latest moves came as no surprise to traders already wary of a deeper correction in the biggest cryptocurrency.  Previously, many had called for a retracement to the macro lows seen in June.

It prohibits schools that receive federal money from discriminating against students “on the basis of sex.”  But 50 years later, “sex” has become much more complicated.  The Biden administration is proposing to redefine femininity and turn Title IX into a barrier to women’s progress.

In June, the Department of Education made headlines with new regulations under Title IX that would limit due proc…</span>

Lithium, for example, is a metal essential to the production of EVs’ batteries. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, lithium mines produced an estimated global total of 100,000 metric tons in […]</span>

                              <span>Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive in the country&#x27;s south-east, hoping to re-take the strategically important city of Kherson.
 
It comes as United Nations inspectors head to the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia over concerns the facility has been damaged. 

“Anyone want to know what our plans are, you won’t hear specifics from any truly responsible person because this is war, and this is how it is during the war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

“But the occupiers should know we will push them to the border.” 

Russian shelling at the nuclear plant has forced some Ukrainians to flee and start camping miles away, with one person saying it’s “scary, very scary” and that even men were “afraid”.</span>

“So, you don’t want to shock the engine, and they just couldn’t quite get that fourth engine down to the temperature they wanted to.”</span>

Kiev’s troops suffered great losses in a failed attack ordered by president Zelensky towards Kherson, Moscow says 
 Ukraine’s much-heralded “counter-offensive” in Kherson has “failed miserably,” the Russian Defense Ministry insisted on Monday, listing estimated losses suffered by Kiev during the operation. 
Ukrainian forces had attempted to attack in three directions on orders of President Vladimir Zelensky but made no gains, Moscow explained.

One of Iraq&#x27;s most powerful figures, who has been at the centre of a long crisis over forming a government, says he is retiring from political life. 
Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand Shia cleric with millions of followers, announced his decision on Twitter. 
Several people were reported killed in clashes after his supporters stormed the presidential palace. 
Hundreds have been camped outside parliament for weeks after previously storming it in protest at the deadlock. 
Mr Sadr&#x27;s announcement comes two days after he called for all parties and figures involved in political life following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq to quit.

Insider: Satellite images show holes in the roof of a building at the Ukrainian nuclear power plant Russian troops have been using as a shield 
* New satellite images show damage to the roof of a building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. 
* The plant in southern Ukraine, which is Europe&#x27;s biggest, has been occupied by Russia for months. 
* It has also been the site of recent fighting, which has led watchdog agencies to voice concern. 
Satellite images published on Monday show local fires and damage to a building at southern Ukraine&#x27;s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which occupying Russian troops have been using as a shield. 
One image captured by Maxar Technologies and obtained by Insider shows a handful of holes in the roof of a building at the power plant, which has suffered damage from fires and explosions amid ongoing fighting and shelling in the area. 
A few of the holes appear to have darkened scorch marks around them, but it is unclear exactly what caused them.

An inspection team from the UN nuclear watchdog is on its way to Ukraine&#x27;s embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the organisation&#x27;s head said. 
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the team was expected to arrive at the plant later this week. 
&quot;We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s biggest nuclear facility,&quot; he tweeted. 
The nuclear plant has been occupied by invading Russian troops since March.
Fighting around the facility in Ukraine&#x27;s south-east has led to mounting global concern over the safety and security of the site. 
Ukraine and Russia have accused one another of shelling the area.

Turkey will five times increase the cost of passage through the Black Sea Straits in October, the Sabah newspaper reports, citing sources in the Turkish Ministry of Transport. 
The increase in fees for the lighthouse, medical care, and evacuation of merchant ships is provided for by the Montreux Convention, which regulates navigation in the straits.  According to the media, Turkey has abolished the payment system for collecting fees for passage through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which was introduced in 1983. 
Turkey calculates the toll in French francs. In 1983, the franc was set at $0.8. Due to inflation and the rise in the price of gold, fees have practically depreciated. From October 7, 2022, the franc exchange rate will be set at four dollars.

Ukraine claims it has broken through Russian lines in a major new counter-offensive in the south as Kyiv forces go on the attack against the invading troops. 
The &#x27;Kakhova&#x27; Ukrainian military group said it had seen &#x27;the retreat&#x27; of pro-Russian separatist fighters from their positions in Kherson. 
Russian forces seized Kherson on March 3, the first major city to fall following Putin&#x27;s barbaric invasion.

* NASA scrubbed the Artemis I mission at 8:35am ET due to a leaking engine on the $22.2B rocket 
* The issue was not tested in the last dress rehearsal, so engineers need more time to formulate a fix 
* NASA is now eyeing Friday, September 2 at 12:48pm ET for the second attempt of the Artemis I launch 
* The Artemis I mission is a vital first step if US space agency is to land humans on the moon in three years&#x27; time 
* It has been 50 years since people last walked on the lunar surface, when Apollo 17 landed in December 1972 
NASA was forced to postpone its highly anticipated Artemis I mission Monday following a leak in engine 3 that was not detected in the last wet dress rehearsal due to testing being cut short because of a separate hydrogen leak. 
The issue was identified around 7:30am ET and the launch was officially scrubbed at 8:35am ET. Now the hundreds of thousands of people who attended the event are heading home without seeing the first stage of the epic moon mission kick off.

                              <span>David Axe, Daily Beast: How a Major COVID Relapse Could Soon Hit America—and the World 
Federal COVID funding is beginning to run out in the U.S. As the once extensive government investment in vaccines, therapies and testing vanishes, epidemiologists are bracing for a major shakeup in—some would say collapse of—critical efforts to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
Vaccine initiatives could suffer the biggest blow. With the impending end of government funding, Americans would have to start paying for their own COVID shots—a disincentive that could further suppress the country’s middling vaccination uptake, currently plateaued at 67 percent “fully” vaccinated, usually with two doses of a messenger-RNA vaccine. 
Another likely victim is COVAX, the international vaccine consortium that buys jabs for poorer countries. COVAX has been struggling even before the coming squeeze on U.S. funding. Now an existing shortfall in doses is set to get a lot worse.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Germany will keep up its support for Kyiv &quot;for as long as it takes&quot;, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday, calling for an enlargement of the European Union to eventually include Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. 
Faced with Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Scholz urged the EU&#x27;s 27 members to &quot;close ranks, resolve old conflicts and find new solutions&quot;, setting out his vision for the future of Europe in a speech at the Charles University in Prague. 
&quot;Our Europe is united in peace and freedom and is open to all European nations who share our values,&quot; he said.  Germany had undergone a &quot;fundamental change of heart&quot; in recent months on its military support for Ukraine, he said.

Ethnic Estonians and Russian-speakers differ over the war in Ukraine, prompting government fears over integration. 
NARVA, Estonia — Anna Gisser was out for a stroll through Narva’s leafy Siivertsi park last week, when the 82-year-old pensioner was stopped by two policemen and told to wait. 
Workers were in the park loading a Soviet-era tank memorial onto a truck and carting it off to a museum — part of Tallinn’s effort to remove what for ethnic Estonians glorifies half a century of brutal Soviet occupation, but what local Russian-speakers feel commemorates fallen Red Army soldiers from World War II. 
“I feel disgusted,” said Gisser, a Russian-born former energy construction worker who has lived in Estonia since 1957. “For me, this is about memory … they’ve disrespected my very being.”

Radio Free Asia: Letter says Chinese Communist Party is too powerful, warns against personality cult 
While CCP leader Xi Jinping isn&#x27;t named, the letter appears as he gears up to seek a third term in office.  As ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping prepares to seek an unprecedented third term in office, three veteran party members have spoken out against the ongoing centralization of power and signs of a personality cult around the general secretary. 
 An open letter jointly penned by CCP elders Dong Hongyi, Ma Guiquan and Tian Qizhuang calls on the party to amend its charter, deleting the phrase &quot;the party will lead in everything,&quot; which it criticizes as granting &quot;unlimited power&quot; to the ruling party.  &quot;This phrase first appeared during the Cultural Revolution on Mao Zedong&#x27;s instructions so as to restore order as soon as possible ... but has no wider meaning,&quot; the letter, posted by the rights website Weiquanwang, said.

After the US Federal Reserve stepped up hawkish comments on the inflation outlook, risky assets were sold across the board and crypto is still reeling.
A fairly non-volatile weekend did little to improve the mood, and BTC price action returned to focus on areas below $20,000.
In doing so, several weeks of upside have effectively disappeared and, in turn, traders and analysts expect a retest of the macro lows seen in June this year.
While all is now quiet on the Fed front until September’s rate hike decision, there is still plenty of room for upheaval as geopolitical uncertainty and inflation linger, the latter continuing to rise. increase in Europe.

One of his questionable rulings on partisan gerrymandering is awaiting review this fall by the US Supreme Court.  But this month, state judges have outdone themselves, decision 4-3 that illegal gerrymandering could also be a legal excuse to strike down two constitutional provisions that voters strongly endorsed.

When North Carolina redrew the state’s legislative districts after the 2010 census, it was still under the “preclearance” regime created by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, meaning the new map has been reviewed and approved by the US Department of Justice.

    This column will discuss some federal government policies that impact our economy.  Policies have different consequences for different people.  However, the column is not about Economics 101. Instead, I hope to raise some ethical questions.  If more people benefit than lose from a policy, are we supporting what is best for the majority?  What if the majority gains a little but the minority loses a lot?
Is saving an existing job by limiting imports more important than creating new jobs through increased exports?  What should we do to ensure that the highly visible inflation rate does not blind us to the less visible unemployment rate?  Often, the consequences of policies are uncertain.

For instance, layer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon are designed to have ultra-low transaction fees and fast settlement times.
The increase in the number of new blockchain networks is also a result of the recognition that there is no perfect solution that will be able to meet all the needs associated with blockchain technology at the same time.  Therefore, as more and more organizations become aware of this rising technology and its capabilities, the interconnection of these unique blockchains becomes necessary.

According to the Philly Voice, the alligator is an emotional-support animal named Wally who was adopted in 2016 by reptile enthusiast Joie Henney.

The alligator had already been receiving attention in the press in recent days, the Voice noted, as it was leading the vote in the America’s Favorite Pet online popularity contest.

Henney, who currently has cancer, had also set up a GoFundMe to help feed and the care for his reptiles as he received treatment for the disease.</span>

Biden’s White House must have known they were in deeper waters than expected when a Economist Obamaa democrat sounderand even the Washington Post started calling out the bailout of student loans – both the electoral bribe aspect and the potentially devastating consequences for the economy.
Nevertheless, they persisted.  And to limit the damage, they have implemented what is perhaps the only bribe more effective than cash: Twitter dunks on Republicans.  A Twitter thread slamming Republicans as hypocrites on Paycheck Protection Program funds.
Point and laugh!

    My name is Keith Pontbriand.  I was held in the Hampshire County Jail, so I know the three candidates for the position of sheriff very well. 
I choose to endorse Mrs. Yvonne Gittelson for sheriff.  She’s the best candidate because of what I saw her do while I was incarcerated.  She was a highly respected person among staff and the prison population because of her passion for her work, the respect she showed us and the trust she had in us, as well as the challenges she gave us. 
I’ve seen her with hard-core criminals with no security personnel, just cameras, and she’s never scared, which makes the inmates and staff respect her.  She is dedicated to charting a positive course for everyone she works with. 
I sincerely believe that Mrs. Yvonne is the answer to the change that must be brought to the prison.  I saw her pushing for inmate education when she had little help.  She helped me get my Hi-SET (GED) while I was there, and I’m proud to show my son that I finally got there. 
She wanted remand inmates to be able to get an education instead of sitting around doing nothing.  I’ve been sober for over 24 months today and it’s thanks to the pills she gave us.  The addiction programs offered on the tablet have helped me a lot. 
The things she accomplished were nothing short of a miracle with many inmates.  I hope everyone takes the time to get to know this woman like I do.  We need a nurturing but firm female sheriff, and that’s Mrs. Yvonne.

                              <span>Twelve men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 and one of the goals of Artemis is to put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface.


		The name Artemis was chosen to echo that of the Apollo program.


		Here is an overview of the Artemis program:

Artemis 1: test flight


		Blastoff is scheduled for 8:33 am (1233 GMT) on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.


		Orion will orbit the Moon before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis 2: first crew


		The four members of the crew will be named before the end of the year. A Canadian is expected to be among them.

Artemis 3: Moon landing


		NASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.


		Artemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.


SpaceX Moon lander


		SpaceX&#x27;s Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.

Gateway space station


		The launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.


		Astronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.

Destination Mars

		The ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the &quot;next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars.&quot;


		The goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.


		While a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.</span>

                              <span>The United States plans to name an ambassador at large for the Arctic, reflecting the region&#x27;s growing strategic and commercial importance as its shrinking opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the region, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, a day after visiting the Arctic, saying Russian capabilities there pose a strategic challenge to the 30-nation alliance.
Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a &quot;special military operation,&quot; has heightened Western concerns about Russian ambitions around the world.
China, which describes itself as a &quot;near-Arctic&quot; state, also has ambitions in the region and has said it intended to build a &quot;Polar Silk Road.&quot; China has its eye on mineral resources and new shipping routes as ice caps recede with rising temperatures.
In a statement on Friday, the U.S. State Department said President Joe Biden planned elevate the area&#x27;s importance within the U.S. government by nominating an ambassador-at-large for the Arctic region, subject to the Senate&#x27;s advise and consent.
It did not say who would be nominated.
&quot;An Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative is of critical strategic importance to the United States,&quot; the Department said.
&quot;As one of eight Arctic nations, the United States has long been committed to protecting our national security and economic interests in the region, combating climate change, fostering sustainable development and investment, and promoting cooperation with Arctic States, Allies, and partners,&quot; it said.
The eight Arctic nations are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.

                              <span>Pope Francis will on Saturday create 20 new cardinals picked from the four corners of the world, most of whom could one day end up choosing the pontiff&#x27;s successor.
Francis has raised the possibility of retiring due to his declining health, a path taken by his predecessor Benedict XVI. If he were to do so, a conclave involving all cardinals aged under 80 would be called to pick a successor.
Sixteen of the 20 cardinals created Saturday would be eligible for that conclave based on their ages.
The ceremony at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is the 85-year-old pope&#x27;s eighth since being elected in 2013 and includes clergy known for their pastoral work and, in some cases, progressive views.
All parts of the globe are represented, including new cardinals from Brazil and Nigeria, Singapore and East Timor, am…</span>

                              <span>As the costs of importing energy soars worldwide and climate crises wreak havoc, interest in nuclear power is on the rise with nations scrambling to find alternative sources.
Investment in nuclear power declined after Japan&#x27;s 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world&#x27;s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, as fears over its safety increased and governments ran scared.
But following Moscow&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February, the subsequent squeeze on energy supplies and Europe&#x27;s push to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, the tide is now turning back in favour of nuclear.
Governments face difficult decisions with rising gas and electricity bills and scarce resources threatening to cause widespread suffering this winter.

But the 36-year-old&#x27;s reputation as a firm crisis leader -- deftly navigating her small nation through the Covid pandemic and a historic NATO membership application -- has been challenged in the last few days.
Marin has become entangled in controversies over her partying, earning her the nickname &quot;Party Sanna&quot; in Finland&#x27;s tabloid press.
A poll published by leading newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Friday showed that 42 percent of Finns had a worse opinion of their prime minister due to the scandals.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Russia&#x27;s capabilities in the North are a strategic challenge for NATO, its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, welcoming Canada&#x27;s recently announced investments in North American defense systems after making his first visit to the Canadian arctic.
&quot;The importance of the high North is increasing for NATO and for Canada because we see a significant Russian military buildup,&quot; Stoltenberg said, standing alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Cold Lake, Alberta.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the arctic, using the region to test new weapons systems, Stoltenberg said. He also warned that Russia and China were forming a strategic arctic partnership that challenged NATO&#x27;s values and inter…</span>

LIMA (Reuters) - LGBT activists in Peru held a protest on Friday questioning how their government handled the death of a Peruvian transgender man in Indonesia earlier this month who was detained at the airport upon arriving to celebrate his honeymoon.
Rodrigo Ventosilla, a Peruvian graduate student at Harvard University and transgender rights activist, died on the tourist island of Bali of &quot;bodily failure&quot; days after being detained for alleged cannabis possession.
Peru&#x27;s foreign ministry issued a statement this week calling Ventosilla&#x27;s alleged drug possession a serious crime in Indonesia and that transphobia had not been a factor in his arrest, but did not acknowledge he had later died while in custody.
&quot;We reject and condemn the foreign ministry&#x27;s statement,&quot; said LGBT activist Luz Manriquez at a small protest in Lima.
Manriquez said the government&#x27;s statement was biased because it adopted Indonesia&#x27;s position and did not demand an investigation.
&quot;It lacks empathy because it does not recognize that a Peruvian has died in the hands of police from another country,&quot; Manriquez added.
Brenda Alvarez, a lawyer for Ventosilla&#x27;s family, told reporters on Friday the foreign ministry had agreed to apologize over the statement and launch an investigation.
Peru&#x27;s foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
Alvarez added there is no date for when Ventosilla&#x27;s body will arrive in Lima.
The Indonesian police told Reuters this week the case is closed and that no violence was involved in Ventosilla&#x27;s death.
&quot;Even if you are detained in another country, it is unreal and painful that (the Peruvian government) can leave you like this,&quot; said Arturo Davila, a member of Diversidades Trans Masculinas, a trans rights organization that Ventosilla founded seven years ago in Peru.

Fewer than half of Angola&#x27;s registered voters turned out for Wednesday&#x27;s election, which now looks certain to give President Joao Lourenco a second five-year term and extend the rule of the MPLA, which has governed the southern African oil producer since independence from Portugal in 1975.

                              <span>Argentine authorities seized 1.6 tons of cocaine hidden in animal feed destined for Dubai and detained 12 people, police said on Friday.
The seizure, which took place overnight from Thursday to Friday in the central city of Rosario, highlights the role played by Argentine ports in trafficking South American drugs internationally.
The cocaine &quot;is worth approximately $60 million,&quot; said Mariano Giuffra, head of the dangerous drugs department in the federal police.
The arrests took place at various sites around the country.
&quot;They are all Argentines and some of them are known drug traffickers,&quot; added Giuffra.
Several firearms, sports cars and a large amount of cash were also seized.
Rosario, located 310 kilometers (190 miles) from Buenos Aires, is Argentina&#x27;s third-largest city and the main port for agricultural exports to the Atlantic.
It is also the most violent city in Argentina, with a murder rate three times the national average.
The cocaine had been hidden in bags of corn fodder that was about to be loaded onto a container destined for Dubai.
Police said the cocaine probably originated in Colombia, the world&#x27;s largest producer of the drug.
While most cocaine is produced by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia -- where growing coca leaf, which is the main ingredient in the white powder, is legal -- experts say Argentina has increasingly taken on an important role in trafficking the drug.
Argentina has several major ports, has a large supply of quality chemicals needed to turn coca leaf into cocaine, and provides ample opportunities for money laundering.

The plant -- Europe&#x27;s largest nuclear facility -- was severed from Ukraine&#x27;s power network for the first time in its history on Thursday due to &quot;actions of the invaders&quot;, Energoatom said.
In an update, the operator said that as of 2:04 pm (1104 GMT) the plant &quot;is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine&quot; once again.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Actors in a heavily bombarded city in southern Ukraine have returned to the stage, putting on their first performance since Russia&#x27;s invasion in an underground shelter converted into a tiny theatre.
A few dozen theatre-goers descended steep concrete steps into the subterranean venue on Thursday for the opening night of a show put on by the Mykolaiv Art Drama Theatre. Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.
&quot;Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller,&quot; said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.
Theatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as &quot;art-therapy&quot;, giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.
Ievhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night&#x27;s show, agreed.
&quot;When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, &#x27;it was fun&#x27;,&quot; he said. &quot;There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good.&quot;

                              <span>Six weeks after the Vél d’Hiv roundup in Paris, the Vichy regime committed another unspeakable crime by arresting some 6,000 Jews in the non-occupied zone on August 26, 1942 – an event that remains little-known in France, 80 years on.
As a Resistance fighter in Lyon, rescuing Jews was at the core of René Nodot’s mission. But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.
“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”

                              <span>Family members of 10 miners who have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for three weeks said on Thursday they rejected a government plan to find the miners that they said officials described as lasting from six to 11 months.
Three miners had been rescued and hospitalized, the Security and Citizen Protection Ministry said in an update on the rescue efforts at the mine in the Sabinas municipality of the northern state of Coahuila.
Television footage showed family members outside the mine clamoring for information on the missing men.
&quot;I hope we find them safe,&quot; Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier on Twitter. Lopez Obrador had said nine miners were likely to be trapped, but authorities revised the number later.
Some 92 soldiers were working at the scene, as well as specialists and rescue dogs, the president said.
The Labor Ministry said it had not received any complaints about safety at the mine, which began operations in January.

                              <span>Australia on Friday tapped a former high court judge to investigate ex-prime minister Scott Morrison&#x27;s decision to secretly appoint himself to several key ministerial portfolios.
Incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the creation of the inquiry, saying the country&#x27;s system of &quot;parliamentary democracy&quot; had been tested.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, conservative leader Morrison appointed himself to the ministries of health, treasury, finance, resources and home affairs without telling colleagues or the public.
Albanese said the inquiry was essential &quot;to ensure that this can never happen again&quot;.
The probe will be led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and will report by November 25.
&quot;We need to have a quick and appropriate inquiry,&quot; said Albanese, adding this is &quot;not about the politics, but how this happened, why this happened and who knew about it.&quot;

He did not rule out Morrison or other former government ministers from being compelled to give evidence if necessary.
Morrison has insisted he was right to take &quot;emergency powers&quot; during the tumult of the pandemic.
&quot;I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest,&quot; he said in a defiant first public appearance after the scandal broke, dismissing critics who were &quot;standing on the shore after the fact&quot;.
Three of Morrison&#x27;s fellow conservative prime ministers have also criticized the former premier&#x27;s behavior.

                              <span>It&#x27;s an opening night like no other at Mykolaiv&#x27;s theatre, with the audience ushered down into an underground shelter this week for the first performance since war broke out.
&quot;We need this place to fight on the cultural front too,&quot; says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.
The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides &quot;a form of &#x27;art therapy&#x27;&quot; for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.
Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.

But this year&#x27;s crop is devastated, another casualty of a blistering heatwave that has engulfed southern China in the country&#x27;s hottest summer on record and subsumed half its land in drought.
&quot;This is absolutely the first time in my life encountering such a disaster,&quot; he tells AFP.
&quot;This year is a very miserable one.
&quot;We should be harvesting fruits right now, but it&#x27;s all gone, dead from the scorching sun.&quot;
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, forcing power cuts that have hit agricultural workers hard.

After 15 years, including four prior formal sessions, negotiators have yet to reach a legally binding agreement to address the growing environmental and economic challenges involving the high seas, also known as international waters -- a zone which encompasses almost half the planet.
Many had hoped that this fifth session, which began on August 15 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, would be the last and yield a final text on &quot;the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction,&quot; or BBNJ for short.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a radiation disaster as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine&#x27;s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut.
Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia&#x27;s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe&#x27;s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and keep the plant safe.
&quot;If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,&quot; he said in an evening address. &quot;Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situ…</span>

                              <span>Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes slammed Republicans for a history of giving favorable treatment to CEOs and other wealthy people.
During an appearance on Real America&#x27;s Voice, Cortes said that Democrats were &quot;smart&quot; to forgive student loans for many borrowers.
&quot;Privileged people, many of whom chose to go and pursue worthless degrees are getting a handout from Joe Biden,&quot; he told podcast host Steve Bannon. &quot;In terms of political payoffs, and that&#x27;s what this is, a crass political payoff, at least the Democrats are smart enough to payoff American voters.&quot;
&quot;Establishment Republicans, they pay off CEOs and defense contractors,&quot; Cortes continued. &quot;This about that contrast. If you&#x27;re going to do power politics and you&#x27;re going to do crass payoffs, at least the Democrats know where their bread is buttered and they&#x27;re going to pay off voters.&quot;
The ex-Trump adviser added: &quot;What Mitch McConnell does and establishment Republicans do is they reward the CEOs of places like Northrop Grumman and therein lies one of the key reasons why in America, as you often talk about, the Republicans have won election after election for decades while we are losing our country.&quot;
As president, former President Donald Trump signed a tax cut law that reportedly helps billionaires pay less in taxes than the working class.

                              <span>LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.
Roizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia&#x27;s military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.
The court declined prosecutors&#x27; request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.
Roizman denies all the charges.
On Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words &quot;war&quot; and &quot;invasion&quot; to describe Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine.
Russia says it is conducting a &quot;special military operation&quot; there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
State news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.
Roizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia&#x27;s fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin&#x27;s decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.

                              <span>KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.
Russia&#x27;s defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.
&quot;I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine,&quot; Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.
&quot;Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families.&quot;
Brown said the human toll of the attack was &quot;just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine.&quot;
She cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.
&quot;All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain,&quot; she said.
