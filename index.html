Reuters: Ukraine war spurs European demand for U.S. arms, but not big-ticket items 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European demand for U.S. weaponry is soaring, but instead of big-ticket items like jets and tanks, shopping lists are focused on cheaper, less-sophisticated items such as shoulder-fired missiles, artillery, and drones that have proven critical to Ukraine&#x27;s war efforts. 
Countries close to Russia like Poland, Finland and Germany are striking deals to build U.S. weapons in Europe, negotiating new deals to buy arms and looking to speed up existing contracts, according to interviews with military officials and industry executives, and a Reuters review of recent announcements by governments and defense manufacturers. Demand is centered around basic weapons and munitions: 155-millimeter artillery rounds, air defenses, communications equipment, shoulder-fired Javelin missiles and drones, nearly a dozen European military attachés in Washington told Reuters in a series of recent interviews.

                              <span>WNU Editor: A lot of updates on the Russia - Ukraine war from the Military Summary channel. Alexander Mercouris gives his update on the war below. 
Fighting is being reported along the entire front lines. There are also numerous reports that the Russian Army that was called up in September and have been training for the past few months have left their camps, and are now being deployed not far from the front lines.  I concur with the Military Summary channel&#x27;s opinion that the expected Russian offensive will only happen after President Putin gives his State of The Union speech on February 21.</span>

Allies with available battle tanks should send them now to Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday, as NATO partners struggle to muster the heavy vehicles pledged for Kyiv. 
&quot;Those who can send such battle tanks should really do so now,&quot; Scholz told the Munich Security Conference, adding he would be &quot;intensively campaigning&quot; for allies to move on the issue. 
Scholz&#x27;s call marked a dramatic reversal of roles as he had for months been under pressure from allies to approve the delivery of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine.

Air Force Magazine: Russian Air Force ‘Has Lot of Capability Left’ One Year On From Ukraine Invasion 
While the red stars on the aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, have not been very visible in recent months, Russia’s air force remains largely intact despite its grinding war in Ukraine, according to independent analysis and official comments.
The fighting in Ukraine has been dominated by artillery exchanges, and neither side has been able to establish air superiority. But as Russian forces begin a new offensive, there are mounting concerns among Ukrainian allies that Moscow may be preparing to make greater use of its fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. 
Though U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III sought to dispel fears that Ukraine will face a qualitatively different Russian air threat, he did acknowledge that Russia still has lots of aircraft, which could put additional stress on Ukraine’s air defenses.

NEAR BAKHMUT, Ukraine/MUNICH (Reuters) -Ukrainian soldiers fighting to hold off a Russian push on the small eastern city of Bakhmut pleaded for more weapons from the outside world as senior Western leaders met in Munich on Friday to assess the year-long war shaking Europe. 
&quot;Give us more military equipment, more weapons, and we will deal with the Russian occupier, we will destroy them,&quot; said Dmytro, a serviceman standing in the snow near Bakhmut which Russia&#x27;s Wagner mercenary group is attacking. 
Nearly one year into the invasion, President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s troops are intensifying assaults in the east.

Space News: Defense giants are hungry for space companies 
TAMPA, Fla. — Large defense companies are itching to buy space assets as part of the market is on the verge of a shake-out, executives discussing deal-making in the industry said Feb. 8. 
Phillip Ingle, a managing director in Morgan Stanley’s investment banking division, highlighted large “appetite for the big primes to get their hands on attractive space assets” during the SmallSat Symposium in Mountain View, California. 
U.S. Department of Defense budgets orientated “towards space are growing much more healthfully than other parts of the defense budget,” Ingle said, encouraging primes “to grow their space businesses because that’s where a lot of the growth is.” 
Defense giants Raytheon and L3 Harris have set up venture capital arms in recent years to capture emerging technology, he noted, following the steps of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Space News: Analyst: U.S. military space budget likely to get another boost in 2024 
Congress has supported significant spending increases due to concerns about Russian and Chinese anti-satellite weapons  
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration in its budget proposal for fiscal year 2024 is likely to seek a significant increase for the U.S. Space Force, the National Security Space Association’s head of legislative affairs Mike Tierney said Feb. 16. 
The White House is expected to release the president’s federal budget proposal for fiscal year 2024 on March 9. 
Tierney during an online forum said he has not seen any actual numbers but “things are starting to trickle out in the rumor mill.” 
“What we’re hearing is another substantial increase for the Space Force in the ‘24 request,” he added. 
Tierney, a veteran budget analyst, predicts the increase could be anywhere from $3 billion to $6 billion above what was requested in fiscal year 2023. 
Funding for military space programs — including the Space Force and other space programs across DoD — grew from $17.7 billion in 2021 to $21.8 billion in 2022, Tierney said. In fiscal year 2023, the Pentagon requested $26.9 billion and Congress upped it to $28.5 billion

Daily Mail: ISIS leader Hamza al-Hosi is killed in helicopter raid in Syria that left four US servicemembers and a dog wounded 
* Hamza al-Hosi was killed in the raid last night in northeast Syria 
* The raid was a joint operation between the US and Syrian Democratic Forces 
ISIS leader Hamza al-Hosi has been killed in Syria in a helicopter raid carried out by US and Syrian forces. 
Four active service members were injured, along with a dog, and all are receiving treatment in Iraq. They suffered blast injuries from an explosion. It&#x27;s unclear what the cause of that explosion was. 
US Central Command announced the raid on Friday in a statement.

                              <span>WNU Editor: While US Secretary of State Blinken has told Ukraine to hold back on taking Crimea (link here), U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland has a different opinion. She is also still calling for regime change in Moscow. 
Here are the key parts of her Carnegie Endowment interview (The transcript is from CubaSi)
....
..... Unless the Crimean peninsula is at the very least “demilitarized” Ukraine won’t feel safe, while the ideal end to the current conflict is with a revolution in Moscow, the US Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said on Thursday. 
 Ukrainians “have to get to a map that is more sustainable for them,” Nuland said in a video interview with the Washington think tank Carnegie Endowment. 
They have “significant chunks of territory they need to be a viable state, before you even get to the question of Crimea, and that’s what they’re focused on now.” 
The US position is that Ukraine is “owed and due all of their territory within their international borders,” which means Crimea as well, Nuland added.  And it continues ....  ....Asked how she saw the conflict ending, Nuland said the West “must never trust, as long as Vladimir Putin is in power, or somebody like him, that this is truly over.” Even if the fighting ends on Ukraine’s terms, there “has to be a long-term plan” to build up Ukraine’s military as a deterrent. She also expressed a preference for Russians overthrowing their government for a “better future” offered by the West.</span>

Unherd: OSINT picks holes in Seymour Hersh’s Nord Stream claims 
Open-source analysts argue that the journalist&#x27;s theory doesn&#x27;t add up 
Since he published an explosive Substack piece earlier this month, arguing — in great detail — how the United States was responsible for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipeline between Russia and Germany last year, the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has received both enthusiastic support and dismissal. The White House responded quickly to label Hersh’s claims ‘utterly false and complete fiction’, an assessment which the CIA and State Department echoed. Russian state representatives have, unsurprisingly, been more open to the theory. Indeed, the State Duma today proposed an urgent UN investigation into the attack based on the article.

WNU Editor: An interesting read. It looks like Seymour Hersh&#x27;s timeline is wrong when he said the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had links to the US intel community when he was young. Jens Stoltenberg  actually knew a Soviet diplomat when he was in his twenties, and was told by Norways Security Service to break contact with this suspected KGB spy. 
It also looks like Seymour Hersh is wrong in identifying the naval ships that were involved in this operation. Apparently some were not in the vicinity during the timeline of this operation. 
Does this mean that Seymour Hersh&#x27;s annonymous sources are wrong? Maybe. But there is a lot of details and information in his reporting, and they are not being refuted.

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Joint naval exercises including South Africa, Russia, and China get underway in waters off South Africa&#x27;s east coast Friday, despite U.S. concerns and Ukrainian condemnation. Critics say the 10-day military drills will do little to benefit South Africa and act as a propaganda boost for Moscow on the one-year anniversary of its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
While the West is upping its arms shipments to help Ukraine fend off Russia’s invasion, South Africa begins wargames today with Russian warships that proudly support the offensive. 
Russia’s “Admiral Gorshkov,” which arrived in Cape Town this week, is marked with the Kremlin’s pro-war symbol, the letter &#x27;Z.&#x27;

Reuters: U.S. tries to woo India away from Russia with display of F-35s, bombers 
BENGALURU -The United States brought its most advanced fighter jet, the F-35, to India for the first time this week alongside F-16s, Super Hornets and B-1B bombers as Washington looks to woo New Delhi away from its traditional military supplier, Russia. 
India, desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power, is concerned about Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war and faces pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow. 
The American delegation to the week-long Aero India show in Bengaluru, which ends on Friday, is the biggest in the 27-year history of the show and underlines the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India.

The country&#x27;s description of its rival in defense papers typically reflects the relationship between the two. During past times of animosity, South Korea referred to its neighbor as the &quot;main enemy,&quot; &quot;present enemy&quot; or &quot;enemy.&quot;

VOA: North Korea Threatens ‘Unprecedented’ Response to US-South Korea Drills 
North Korea warned Friday of an unprecedented response if the United States and South Korea go ahead with planned joint military exercises, which have recently ramped up in response to North Korean weapons tests. 
In comments published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, North Korea’s foreign ministry predicted the Korean Peninsula “will again be plunged into the grave vortex of escalating tension” if the U.S.-South Korea drills go ahead. 
“In case the U.S. and south Korea carry into practice their already-announced plan for military drills … they will face unprecedentedly persistent and strong counteractions,” the statement said.

Daily Mail: EU bans the export of toilets to Russia - where one in five households have no indoor plumbing - in a bid to punish Putin for Ukraine invasion 
* The European Union banned the exportation of lavatories to Russia last summer 
* Russian citizens could be impacted as only one in five have indoor plumbing 
* Russian soldiers are looting toilets in Ukraine to send back to families in Russia 
The European Union has banned the export of lavatories to Russia in a bid to punish Vladmir Putin for his invasion into Ukraine. 
The banned sale of lavatories was brought in in July 2022, but is only just being reported. It could have a considerable effect on Russian citizens given that one in five do not have indoor plumbing in their homes. 
According to the Telegraph, the situation is so dire that toilets have been looted by soldiers fighting in Ukraine to be sent back to their loved ones in Russia - a pattern which has previously been brought to light by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.   Read more ....

President Joe Biden is a &#x27;healthy&#x27; and &#x27;vigorous&#x27; 80-year-old who is fit for office, his doctor said after his annual physical on Thursday at Walter Reed. 
White House physician Colonel Kevin O&#x27;Connor provided an update on his health amid concerns over his age as he prepares to announce a 2024 run for president. 
The results were largely unchanged from last time, aside from a lesion on his chest that has been sent for cancer screening.   O&#x27;Connor said Biden&#x27;s gait &#x27;remains stiff&#x27;, but insisted it has not worsened since the last examination.

Sputnik: New Corroborating Evidence Emerges Showing US Trace Behind Nord Stream Blasts 
US investigative journalist Sy Hersh opened a Pandora’s Box of incriminating evidence that purportedly directly links the Biden administration to September’s sabotage attacks against the Nord Stream gas pipeline network. On Wednesday, Russia called a special Security Council meeting to discuss the new information. 
An email forwarded to Sputnik by a US journalist from an individual identifying themselves as a servicemember that took part in last summer’s NATO BALTOPS 22 exercises in waters near the site of the Nord Stream pipeline explosions provides new information corroborating last week&#x27;s bombshell Substack report on the incident by Seymour Hersh.

Daily Mail: NORAD scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian Tu-95 bombers off the coast of Alaska on Valentine&#x27;s Day - the second incident in a week 
* Several Russian strategic bombers and fighter jets were intercepted by NORAD 
* The flights were in no way related to Chinese spy balloons 
* NORAD claimed that it &#x27;had anticipated&#x27; this Russian activity 
For the second time this week, NORAD has scrambled fighter jets on Valentine&#x27;s Day to intercept Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers off the coast of Alaska, it claimed, as activity over the skies continues to unnerve Americans. 
Several Russian strategic bombers and fighter jets were intercepted by North American air defense forces as they flew over international airspace near Alaska, they said, in routine incidents unrelated to tensions over the war in Ukraine. 
The aircraft, which were identified on Monday, did not enter U.S. or Canadian airspace and did not pose a threat, the joint U.S.-Canadian centre said in a statement dated February 14.

The U.S. will spell out ethics, principles, and practices for the use of artificial intelligence in military contexts in a new declaration Thursday, with the hope of adding cosigners from around the world. 
The announcement is intended to highlight a &quot;contrast&quot; between the U.S. approach and what one senior defense official called &quot;the more opaque policies of countries like Russia and China.&quot; 
U.S. Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins will announce the declaration at an AI in warfare conference in the Netherlands.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said alliance members had agreed to ramp up industrial production to replenish NATO and Ukraine&#x27;s stockpiles. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said  alliance defense ministers gathered in Brussels had agreed on a need to expand industrial capacity for producing munitions. 
The gathering included discussions on Finland and Sweden&#x27;s membership bids, support for Ukraine and NATO&#x27;s attempts to stock up on weapons and ammunition.

WNU Editor: When you look at the details, this announcement is a disappointment. The US, France, Germany, Norway are the only countries that have signed contracts to increase their ammo-making capacity .... At least four states strike ammunition production deals - Stoltenberg (Ukrinform), and these deals will not kick in until later this year. 

For the past few weeks I have been hearing and reading reports from Ukraine that they are limiting their use of ammunition, and if the current rate of use and re-supply from the West continues, they will be out by July. To say that this is going to be a disaster for Ukraine is an understatement.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday “the time is now to ratify both Finland and Sweden” as new members of the alliance. 
Speaking during a joint news conference in Ankara with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Stoltenberg said the main issue is not whether the two countries are ratified together, but that their ratification comes “as soon as possible.” 
Çavuşoğlu said Turkey could evaluate the two bids separately. 
Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO members that have not ratified Finland’s and Sweden’s accession in a process that must be unanimous.

Jeremy Warner, The Telegraph: Zelensky plays his fawning Western suitors like a violin 
Slowly but surely, Western engagement in Putin&#x27;s war is ramping up. European leaders may not yet be ready to give Volodymyr Zelensky the combat aircraft he seeks, but it can surely only be a matter of time. The only question is who coughs up first, and thereby gets the credit as a saviour of the Ukrainian nation. Anything, it would seem, to deflect from political and economic woes at home.

Lloyd stated that President Biden&#x27;s commitment to NATO&#x27;s collective defense agreement is &#x27;ironclad&#x27; 
In the event that Russia launches an attack or invasion against Estonia, the United States will enter the conflict, according to the head of the Department of the Defense. 
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III spoke Thursday at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium. 
The conference focused heavily on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is approaching its year anniversary.

* Biden addressed the nation on Thursday after four objects had been shot down 
* He promised &#x27;sharper rules&#x27; for dealing with unidentified objects in U.S. airspace 
* He said three objects likely belonged to private companies, not spy agencies 
President Joe Biden said Thursday he made no apologies for shooting down a Chinese spy balloon but admitted three other mysterious aerial objects, destroyed by U.S. warplanes, were not thought to be surveillance vehicles. 
He finally broke his silence after more than a week of questions about a spate of apparent incursions into American airspace. 
But he abruptly left the stage at the end of his remarks when a reporter demanded to know whether his family&#x27;s business interests got in the way of dealing with China.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping and his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, called on Thursday for the lifting of sanctions on Iran as an integral part of a stalled international agreement on its nuclear programme. 
Xi also accepted an invitation from Raisi to visit Iran and would do so at his convenience, the two leaders said in a joint statement on the last day of a three-day state visit to China by Raisi. Xi last visited Iran in 2016 as part of a tour of the Middle East. 
The leaders in their statement called for the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, under which Iran agreed with several countries, including the United States, to curb its nuclear programme in return for economic sanctions relief.

WNU Editor: China is positioning itself to take advantage of the economic benefits that it can gain from Iran once sanctions are lifted, while having access to Iranian oil. Beijing is clearly playing the long game (i.e. 10, 20, 30 years in the future) in this relationship.   Iranian President Raisi Ends Trip To China.

                              <span>France 24: Iran-based Egyptian Saif al-Adel is new al Qaeda chief, says US 
Saif al-Adel, an Iran-based Egyptian, has become the head of Al-Qaeda following the July 2022 death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the US State Department said Wednesday. 
&quot;Our assessment aligns with that of the UN – that al-Qaeda&#x27;s new de facto leader Saif al-Adel is based in Iran,&quot; a state department spokesperson said. 
The United Nations report released Tuesday said that the predominant view of member states is that Adel is now the group&#x27;s leader, &quot;representing continuity for now.&quot; 
But the group has not formally declared him &quot;emir&quot; because of sensitivity to the concerns of the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, who haven&#x27;t wanted to acknowledge that Zawahiri was killed by a US rocket in a home in Kabul last year, according to the UN report.

                              <span>Reuters: Ukraine pounded by missiles, Russia eyes capturing Bakhmut by April 
KYIV (Reuters) -Russia battered Ukraine with multiple missile strikes on Thursday as its troops sought to advance in the east, Kyiv said, while Western allies pledged to keep military aid flowing for an intended Ukrainian spring counter-offensive. 
Following a pattern of heavy bombardments at times of Ukrainian battlefield or diplomatic advances, Russia launched 32 missiles in the early hours, Ukraine&#x27;s Air Force said.  Half were shot down, it added, a lower rate than normal. 
Among them, air defences in the south downed eight Kalibr missiles fired from a ship in the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials said. 
Other missiles struck northern and western Ukraine as well as the central regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Kirovohrad.

Politico:  Blinken: Crimea a ‘red line’ for Putin as Ukraine weighs plans to retake it 
The secretary of state, in a private call with experts, expressed his hesitation about a possible Ukrainian offensive for the peninsula. 
A Ukrainian attempt to retake Crimea would be a red line for Vladimir Putin that could lead to a wider Russian response, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a Zoom call with a group of experts Wednesday. 
The Russian president sees Crimea as fully part of Russia, not Ukraine, and would be loath to see the peninsula ripped from his clutches — even though that’s precisely what he did to Ukraine nearly a decade ago. 
Republican and Democratic administrations have since then said repeatedly that “Crimea is Ukraine.” 
The top diplomat’s comments, sure to frustrate Kyiv, came after someone on the private call asked if the U.S. is willing to help Ukraine realize its long-term goal of retaking the territory seized by Moscow.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden plans to deliver his most extended public remarks yet — as early as Thursday — about the unidentified objects that the U.S. military has been shooting down, three people familiar with the matter said. 
Biden will explain how he has tasked his administration with setting parameters about how to deal with balloons and other aerial objects spotted in the future. 
The exact timing of Biden’s remarks has not been settled. The president is due to take a physical exam Thursday that could last several hours. 
With federal investigators analyzing the wreckage and many questions still unanswered, Biden has been sparing in his remarks.

Konstantin Vorontsov, deputy director of the non-proliferation and weapons control directorate in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that the US is weaponizing space and blurring the boundaries between military and civilian infrastructure in orbit.

DPA: NATO to set up efforts to better protect underwater pipelines 
NATO is to set up a coordination cell to better protect critical infrastructure following the alleged acts of sabotage on the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday.
The aim is &quot;to map our vulnerabilities and engage with industry&quot; Stoltenberg said at NATO&#x27;s headquarters in Brussels. 
&quot;This will support our efforts to prevent and counter threats to critical infrastructure, including undersea cables and pipelines,&quot; he added.

Western Standard: German political party wants U.S. troops kicked out over allededly blowing up Nord Stream pipeline 
Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party wants U.S. troops out of Germany if the report is accurate that the US blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. 
The AfD Co-chairman Tino Chrupalla wants an investigation into the allegations made by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. 
“As the American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh claims to have learned from a source involved in the operational planning, the United States of America is said to have planned the demolition of Nord Stream and carried it out jointly with Norway,” said Chrupalla at a press conference.

(Reuters) - The United States should try to prove it was not behind the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines that connected Russia to Western Europe, the Russian embassy to the United States said on Thursday. 
Moscow considers the destruction of Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines last September &quot;an act of international terrorism&quot; and will not allow it to be swept under the rug, the embassy said in a statement.

This a brief combat report from the battlefield here and abroad in the aftermath of the release last Wednesday of my story about Joe Biden’s decision to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. 
First, many thanks for your interest in what the pipeline story was all about: a very dangerous Presidential decision. You are careful readers.
I’m an old hand at dropping bombshell stories that are based on the disclosures of sources I do not, and cannot, name. There is a pattern to the response by the mainstream media. It dates back to my breakthrough story: the My Lai massacre revelation. That story was published in five installments, over five weeks in 1969, by the underground media group Dispatch News.

Newsweek: Russia-West Ties Reach &#x27;Point of No Return&#x27; Amid Ukraine War: Lavrov 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed the U.S. and its Western allies for pushing ties with Moscow to the &quot;point of no return&quot; by supporting Ukrainian efforts to resist the Kremlin&#x27;s ongoing invasion. 
Addressing members of the Duma—the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia—on Wednesday, Lavrov reeled off a list of grievances with Western nations, which he accused of seeking a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; around Russia. 
The West, Lavrov told Russian lawmakers according to the state-run Tass news agency, has a policy of &quot;many years of containment of Russia&quot; alongside &quot;the transformation of fraternal Ukraine into anti-Russia, into a Russophobic military stronghold.&quot;
Lavrov complained about NATO expansion since the end of the Cold War; a long-term Russian gripe cited by Russian President Vladimir Putin as one of many justifications for years-long Russian aggression against Ukraine.

Meduza: Putin planning Federal Assembly address for February 21, followed by ‘large-scale concert-rally’ at Luzhniki Stadium on February 22 
Vladimir Putin will give his belated annual address to Russia’s Federal Assembly on or around February 21, and will participate in a large-scale concert and rally event at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium the following day, RBC reported on Friday, citing “three sources familiar with the discussion” of the Kremlin’s plans. According to RBC, the rally is expected to be a “continuation” of Putin’s address. 
A source from Russia’s parliament confirmed to RIA Novosti that a rally event is being planned for February 22, and added that 200,000 people, including Putin, are slated to attend. 
One of RBC’s sources said that Russian authorities want to ensure the address takes place as close as possible to the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

WNU Editor: Putin&#x27;s State of the Nation address will all be on the Ukraine war, the economy and sanctions, and threats from NATO. But what caught my eye was this report .... Russian parliament to hold extraordinary meetings on Feb 22: RIA (Reuters). 
This tells me that Putin will make a declaration/announcement during the State of the Nation address that parliament will then follow-up on the next day. Needless to say. No one is saying why parliament is being summoned the next day. But there is someone who I trust who told me earlier today that Putin may make a formal declaration of war against Ukraine, and parliament will then follow-up on the next day to make it legal. I hope he is wrong, but we shall know more on February 21.</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg: Ukraine to Receive Fewer Battle Tanks From Allies Than Promised 
(Bloomberg) -- German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius indicated that western allies are struggling to put together two full battalions of Leopard 2 tanks to send to Ukraine as promised. 
Germany and Portugal are the only two nations to commit to sending the A6 version of the Leopard 2, with 14 pledged by the government in Berlin and three from the Portuguese, Pistorius told reporters Wednesday after meeting NATO counterparts in Brussels. “We will not reach the size of a battalion,” he said. 
Poland has assembled about 30 units of the older A4 version of the Leopard 2, which is almost enough for the standard Ukrainian battalion of 31, but many of them are in poor condition and need repairs before they can be deployed, Pistorius said. Those tanks will only get to Ukraine at the end of April, he added.

FOX News: Ukraine killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops every day, eliminates 5,000 in single battle 
Ukrainian forces are killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops every day, and they eliminated 5,000 troops in a single battle in late January, according to U.K. officials citing data from Ukraine. 
Russian troops, including the elite 155th naval infantry, stormed the Ukrainian coal mining city Vuhledar near Dontesk in late January. Ukrainian forces repelled the offensive, however, and killed, injured or captured 5,000 Russian troops. 
Meanwhile, U.K. officials say the war is exacting a heavy toll on Russia, with 824 Russian troops dying each day, according to Ukrainian updates.
&quot;The 155th brigade already had to be restaffed three times. The first time after Irpin and Bucha; the second time they were defeated near Donetsk – they recovered again,&quot; Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, a Ukrainian defense forces spokesman, told Politico. &quot;And now almost the entire brigade has already been destroyed near Vuhledar.&quot;

                              <span>Politico:  Lawmakers seize on spy balloon to inflate defense spending 
Lobbyists, meanwhile, are pitching new radars and other homeland defense systems to the Pentagon and Congress. 
Defense hawks in Congress cite many reasons to keep money flowing to the Pentagon: enemy fleets, hypersonic missiles, nuclear threats. 
Now they have a new one, and it was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean on Feb. 4. 
Lawmakers and lobbyists are pouncing on a Chinese spy balloon’s seven-day incursion over North America this month to push back against possible defense budget cuts — and make the case for even more funding — as Congress grapples with the growing threat from Beijing and doubts about the military’s ability to detect similar objects. 
“I don’t think there’s one U.S. senator who has been going to these briefings that thinks that the message out of this is less defense spending,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). His state has been at the center of two of the recent flights.

                              <span>The Hill: Half in new survey believe news organizations mislead, misinform public 
A new survey found that half of Americans believe that national news organizations intend to mislead, misinform or persuade the public. 
More than half of the Americans surveyed, 53 percent, in the Knight Foundation and Gallup poll said they held an unfavorable opinion of the media, which was down slightly from 2020 levels. 
“This study suggests that many Americans are not solely skeptical of news today — they feel distrust on an emotional level, believing news organizations intend to mislead them and are indifferent to the social and political impact of their reporting,” the report says.

   EurAsian Times: Russia Is Launching ‘Military Balloons’ With Corner Reflectors Into Ukraine To Exhaust Its Air Defenses – Kyiv 
The Pentagon informed that an F-16 shot down the object, employing the same AIM-9X Sidewinder missile as in the last three shootdowns. 
Pentagon officials assured that none of these objects shot down appeared to pose a military threat. However, there has been a proliferation of balloons being sent to the continent. 
Intriguingly, even as the United States and Canada are actively fighting the menace of UFOs, Russia has now borrowed a fig leaf from this playbook and started infiltrating Ukrainian airspace with its balloons.  Ukraine alleges that the move is aimed at tiring out Ukrainian air defenses.

OilPrice.com: The IEA Expects Global Oil Demand Hit A Record High In 2023 
* The InternationEnergy Agency has raised its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2023 by 100,000 bpd from last month. 
* The agency’s new forecast sees global oil demand increasing by 2 million barrels per day from 2022 levels. 
* China’s resurgent oil demand will account for nearly half the projected increases this year. 
Global oil demand is set to increase by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, pushed up by growth in Chinese consumption after the reopening, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday as it raised its 2023 demand growth estimate by 100,000 bpd from last month’s forecast.
This year, world oil demand is set to average a record 101.9 million bpd, up by 2 million bpd from 2022, the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report today. 
The increase is 100,000 bpd higher than the 1.9 million bpd rise the agency expected at the time of the publishing of its January report.

                              <span>FOX News: Biden to sell 26 million barrels more from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is currently at its lowest level since 1983 
The Biden administration on Monday announced another sale of oil from the Energy Department&#x27;s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with 26 million barrels set to be delivered to the market from April 1 to June 30, which will take the number of barrels in the reserve to a new low dating back to 1983. 
Unlike the largest-ever drawdown of the SPR that Biden announced in response to Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, the latest release of 26 million barrels is in response to a requirement included in two laws enacted by Congress during the Obama administration under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. 
The announcement comes ahead of a potential uptick in gas prices as the U.S. nears the summer driving season.

WNU Editor: The Biden administration is trying to keep oil prices and the inflationary impacts that it can have as low as possible. Unfortunately, this is only a short term measure. The real solution is to expand domestic oil and gas production, but this is a policy that the Biden administration has all but discouraged since taking office.

The Managing Director of the IMF warned that we need to “think of the  unthinkable,” as we live in “a more shock-prone world” impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the recent earthquake across Syria and Turkey. 
“We all have to change our mindset to be much more agile and much more oriented towards building resilience at all levels, so we can handle the shocks better,” Kristalina Georgieva said Tuesday, during a World Government Summit panel hosted by CNBC’s Hadley Gamble. 
 “What we are very concerned [about] is the unexpected,” Georgieva said.

                              <span>NEW YORK, Feb 15 (IPS)  - Eletrobras is Latin America’s biggest electricity company, responsible for around 30% of Brazil’s power capacity and 50% of all its transmission lines.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic&#x27;s presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society&#x27;s political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

                              <span>Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men&#x27;s World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
&quot;Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,&quot; Murangira said.
&quot;They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.&quot;
&quot;Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.&quot;
Rwanda&#x27;s soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda&#x27;s Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men&#x27;s event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in France.

                              <span>Peru&#x27;s Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children&#x27;s hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.

                              <span>Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

                              <span>Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the &quot;toxicity&quot; of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, &quot;and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes&quot;, Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was &quot;now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire&quot;, Cumming said.
&quot;So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I&#x27;m now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!&quot;
The queen&#x27;s death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

                              <span>A man was crushed to death by a &quot;telescopic&quot; urinal in central London on Friday, despite the efforts of ambulance crews, an air ambulance and firefighters.
Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London&#x27;s West End, the city&#x27;s theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a &quot;telescopic urinal&quot; when he became trapped, police said.
&quot;We&#x27;re sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene,&quot; Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
&quot;Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.&quot;
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.</span>

                              <span>Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
&quot;We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,&quot; said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
&quot;Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,&quot; added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a &quot;quagmire.&quot;
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte&#x27;s removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo&#x27;s arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country&#x27;s south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru&#x27;s vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

                              <span>NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran&#x27;s government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
&quot;The victim publicized (the) Iranian government&#x27;s human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution,&quot; Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran&#x27;s head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

                              <span>A British teenager was on Friday sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for videos promoting racist violence that have been linked to two mass killings in the United States.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and a &quot;propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology&quot;.
&quot;You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you,&quot; Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

A paved road of more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) begun in 312 B.C. by Roman statesman Appius Claudius Caecus, the &quot;Via Appia&quot; is an archaeological treasure trove, where an ongoing excavation hopes to uncover the actual starting point of the road in Rome.

Sharma is the custodian of a temple dedicated to Nathuram Godse, who on January 30, 1948, gunned down a figure celebrated the world over as an apostle of non-violent struggle.
For generations, the young religious zealot -- hanged the following year -- was roundly despised as the archvillain of India&#x27;s long struggle to free itself from British colonial rule.

&quot;Do you swear to always be loyal to the motherland?&quot; a group leader said.
&quot;I swear!&quot; they replied in chorus.
Some parents watched as their children took the oath in the presence of officials, war veterans and local leaders of the militaristic youth group.
Daria Chertkova said her 12-year-old son Stanislav made a &quot;conscious decision&quot; to join the group by himself.
&quot;We supported it,&quot; she told AFP.

A truck-sized asteroid that suddenly loomed out of the darkness a few days ago -- with the Earth in its sights -- sailed harmlessly past us on Thursday, space scientists said.
Despite what we&#x27;ve seen in movies like &quot;Armageddon,&quot; no global mission to blow it up or knock it off course with nuclear weapons was required.
Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.
Phew.
The rock, which was spotted for the first time on Saturday by an amateur stargazer in Crimea, came closest to the southern tip of South America at around 0029 GMT Friday, according to scientists who were tracking it.
At its nearest point, the asteroid was just 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) from Earth&#x27;s surface -- just a quarter of the heigh…</span>

                              <span>Mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting fresh revelations from the US trial of former security chief Genaro Garcia Luna, accused of receiving vast sums of money to allow the notorious Sinaloa cartel to smuggle cocaine.
The trial of Garcia Luna, who was Mexico&#x27;s public security minister from 2006 to 2012, began on Monday at the same New York court that handed convicted drug lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman a life sentence in 2019.
The prosecution&#x27;s first witness, an ex-police officer who later worked for Guzman&#x27;s Sinaloa cartel, said he had witnessed former gang boss Arturo Beltran Leyva, who was killed in 2009, give bribes to Garcia Luna.
&quot;He was paid until Beltran&#x27;s last day,&quot; Sergio Villarreal Barragan said in Spanish.

                              <span>Former President Donald Trump on Thursday evening claimed he could end the war between Russian and Ukraine in a single day were he still president.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
&quot;IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS,&quot; he wrote. &quot;SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!&quot;
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

&quot;FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!&quot;
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a &quot;genius&quot; at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.</span>

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved its Doomsday Clock forward to 90 seconds before midnight.
The clock has been maintained since 1947 and is used as a metaphor for the likelihood that we&#x27;ll blow ourselves up. Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, &quot;It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.&quot;
In 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. Today it&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
&quot;Before encountering Earth, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth&#x27;s orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun,&quot; NASA said in a statement. &quot;After its encounter, the asteroid&#x27;s orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth&#x27;s and Mars&#x27; orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.&quot;
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world&#x27;s telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.</span>

                              <span>Egypt unveiled Thursday a gold-laced mummy and four tombs, including of an ancient king&#x27;s &quot;secret keeper&quot;, discovered in the Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.
The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt&#x27;s former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, &quot;decorated with scenes of daily life,&quot; belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.
It was found in the pyramid complex of Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty, who reigned some 4,30…</span>

                              <span>“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…</span>

                              <span>The Danish government&#x27;s plan to abolish a public holiday to help fund the defense budget amid the war in Ukraine is putting Denmark&#x27;s cherished welfare model at risk, the country&#x27;s biggest trade union warned.
&quot;It&#x27;s a big threat to the Danish model&quot;, said Lizette Risgaard, the head of the FH union which has 1.3 million members in a country of 5.9 million inhabitants.
&quot;Politicians should stay out of labour market issues. If they go through with this they&#x27;ll be imposing their will and violate our agreements&quot;, she thundered in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.
The left-right government coalition in power since December, headed by Social Democratic Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, plans to scrap the religious holiday known as &quot;Great Prayer Day&quot;, observed since the 17th century.
