"Will 2016 Donald Trump win in 2024? I don't think so," Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

"He has to figure out what he wants to be when he runs for office next time and he hasn't gotten there yet."]]></summary>

"We probably thought he was going to sail to his re-nomination should he decide to run, but that midterm election was crushing to him and he has not recovered from it yet.

"So there's a lot of folks who are thinking about running who would never have run against him if they perceived him to be in a position of strength, he is not there right now, he is dramatically weakened."]]></summary>

I learned that she and her family fled Kharkiv to the Kirovohrad Oblast when the war first started (her inlaws live there). 
Kirovohrad Oblast is in central Ukraine, west of the Dnipro river. 
My cousin is busy trying to find missing Ukrainian soldiers via through social media. Needless to say her list is long and heartbreaking. 
Behind every missing soldier there is a family worried sick. Desperate on finding any information on what has happened to their loved one. 
This war is hitting home right now.]]></summary>

Straits Times: TSMC founder says congratulating China’s Xi on party congress was ‘personal’ 
TAIPEI - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co founder Morris Chang said the congratulations he offered Chinese President Xi Jinping about the congress that his ruling Communist Party recently held were his own “personal” view. 
“Taiwan’s Presidential Office told me beforehand that if there was an opportunity, there was no need to avoid meeting or greeting him,” Mr Chang said on Monday at a press conference in Taipei held to brief journalists on his role as the island’s envoy to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit last week in Thailand. 
“I later congratulated Xi on the success of the 20th party congress and talked about my own health condition, which were all my personal ideas,” Mr Chang said, when asked if the government in Taipei had asked him to convey the sentiments.

Update #2: Taiwanese envoy explains why he congratulated China’s Xi (RT)   
WNU Editor: Taiwan's business elite and China's political class have always been talking and meeting each other. This is how China respects its policy of not recognizing Taiwan, but finds a way to talk to them in another way. That is why in this meeting with President Xi, Morris Chang made it very clear that this was a personal meeting, not an official one. 
I saw these type of meetings first hand numerous times in Fujian when I was working there in the 1980s. They were always talking to each other, and it was made easier not only because of business, but also due to family ties between Fujian province and Taiwan (they both face each other cross the Taiwan Strait).]]></summary>

FOX News: China increases ability to strike U.S. with sub-carried missiles  
U.S. Pacific Fleet leader says China's new missiles can reach U.S. from its own waters. 
China has a new missile loaded onto submarines that can strike the continental U.S. from the South China Sea, according to reports. 
U.S. Navy Admiral Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S. Pacific Fleet told a group of military reporters in Washington on Friday that China’s Jin-class submarines are "equipped with JL-3 intercontinental ballistic missiles," Bloomberg reported. 
"They were built to threaten the United States," the admiral said. "We keep close track of those submarines."

WNU Editor: China says US concerns are exaggerated .... US hypes China's JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile deployment 'with ulterior motives' (Global Times).
India believes this nuclear missile deployment targets them .... China’s JL-3 missile can’t cover the US mainland. But it has implications for India (The Print).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency: European Parliament to vote on resolution naming Russia ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ 
Voting will take place on Nov. 23, says EP spokesperson  European Parliament will vote on a resolution on Nov. 23 that will designate Russia a “state sponsor of terrorism,” a parliament spokesperson said Friday. 
“On Wednesday, members will be voting on a resolution dubbing Russia a country sponsor for terrorism given massive step up of Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine,” said Delphine Colard during a press briefing.

WNU Editor: The expectation is that this resolution will pass .... MEPs set to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism (News European Parliament). 
This is an incredibly dangerous development. This will kill all relations between the EU and Russia. It will also lay the groundwork for some of NATO's EU members (Poland and the Baltic states) to invoke Article 4, which Russia will regard as a step towards invoking Article 5 .... a declaration of hostilities between NATO and Russia. 
I do not think the US will join in passing such a resolution. To do so will kill all back-channels to make sure that there will be no nuclear escalation. 

To say that this crisis is continuing to escalate and spiral out of control is an understatement.

The US heating season has officially begun, and new warnings show that a quarter of all Americans could experience energy emergencies this winter if temperatures fall below average due to tight fossil fuel supplies.  
Power grids from the Great Lakes to Louisiana, New England, Carolinas, and all of Texas are the most at risk for power supply shortfalls during high-demand periods, according to Bloomberg, citing a new report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a regulatory body that manages grid stability.

On Friday, Zelenskyy told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum that Kyiv rejected Russia’s preference for a “short truce,” leaving open the question of whether Moscow made the request of the Ukrainian administration. 
Andriy Yermak, who heads the Ukrainian presidential office, stated in a virtual interview that the Kremlin did not propose such a pause to the Ukrainian government. “We have not [had] any official application from the Russian side about some conversations, some negotiations,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: For the past few months I was wondering why the Russian military had not bombed the Motor Sich plant in the city of Zaporozhye. Every other major Ukrainian factory that can help in the war effort has been destroyed, which is now why all Ukrainian military equipment that needs to be repaired is being shipped to Poland. But not the Motor Sich factory. 
It is a huge factory complex that provides parts for aircraft, and since the start of the war it was always a target because it was assembling engines for aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. There have been strikes near the factory where aircraft are being shipped, but the factory itself was not targeted. 
 It was only after I learned that the Chinese had invested an enormous amount of money into the company, and in this factory specifically, did I appreciate why it was off limits to Russian military strikes .... Chinese Intrigue Behind Ukraine’s Seizure of Aviation Firm Motor Sich (Polygraph). The Russians do not want to antagonize their good relations with Beijing. 
But it looks like that all changed when Ukrainian President Zelensky ordered the nationalization of major factories that can help in the war effort, the Motor Sich plant included .... After accusing its president of collaborating with Russia, Ukraine nationalizes Motor Sich (Aviacionline). And as for compensation, I learned through my Chinese sources that they were told by the Kyiv government to buzz-off. They were going to get nothing. 
It took only 10 days after nationalization and Chinese investors being told that they were going to get nothing, that the plant was destroyed .... Russia targets Ukrainian aircraft engine plant (RT). The timing tells me that after being told that they were not going to get compensated, Beijing signaled Moscow that they could go ahead.]]></summary>

The UN's nuclear watchdog has condemned attacks on the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, as Moscow and Kyiv traded blame. 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi on November 20 said that "powerful explosions" hit the nuclear plant on the evening of November 19 and again early on November 20, and demanded that whichever country was behind the attacks cease them immediately. 
Such attacks on Europe's largest nuclear plant, Grossi said, risked a major nuclear disaster.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: According to Russian sources. Ukraine was targeting a power line that links to the plant. 
The Ukraine government argument is that Russia is bombing the nuclear plant to make sure that there will be no electricity for Ukraine. So if Kyiv is to be believed, Russian soldiers are bombing an installation that is guarded by Russian soldiers. 
 Sighhhh .... 
The UN's nuclear watchdog has 4 personnel at the site. When this war is over is when we will learn officially on who they believed was responsible for this attack.

 “With sick, parental, and education leaves, many units reach the staffing level of only 60% of what they have on paper," German MP  stressed. 
 German armed forces are currently facing severe shortages of ammunition, the Bundestag’s commissioner for the armed forces, Eva Hoegl, revealed on Sunday. The German Army lacks certain basic personal equipment to fight a war, she shockingly noted during an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “Without munitions, it’s all nothing,” Hoegl said. Furthermore, she called on the German administration to focus on replenishing the arms depots, particularly during the heightened security risks across the European region from the ongoing Russian offensive in Ukraine.

Update: German army has €20 billion ammo shortfall – top MP (RT)   
WNU Editor: Germany has the wealth and industrial base to quickly build-up its military. And while they are spending some money now (link here), there is a lack of political will, and I also suspect most Germans feel uncomfortable to see Germany re-arming. 
But two days of ammunition?!?!?!? That is crazy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Daily Skeptic: Ukrainian Public Opinion on the War 
Because casualty figures are so uncertain, it’s unclear whether the war in Ukraine qualifies as the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II. After all, approximately 130,000 people died in the Yugoslav wars. 
What is clear is that it’s the most intense conflict. Tens of thousands of people have died in just the eight months since Russia’s invasion began. If the conflict continues, it will soon surpass the Yugoslav wars in total casualties; and it may already have done so. 
On top of all the deaths, Ukraine has seen a massive exodus of refugees, along with catastrophic damage to homes, industry and physical infrastructure. The cost of rebuilding the country has been estimated at several hundred billion dollars – similar to Ukraine’s entire GDP before the war (which may fall by more than a third this year).   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Denis Kireev was part of the Ukrainian delegation that met Russian negotiators at the beginning of the war. He was advocating compromise and finding a peaceful solution to end the conflict. When this became known by ultra-nationalists, he was labeled a Russian spy, accused of treason, and immediately executed (link here). 
Dennis Kireev is not the only one to learn first hand on what happens if you want peace through negotiation. Since the start of the war I have heard of numerous stories and reports on what happens to those who want Ukraine to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. Let us just say that the authorities will not be kind to you.

And that is why no one in Ukraine is going to publicly advocate for negotiations. And they are certainly not going to say so to a stranger who calls them on a phone.]]></summary>

Lidl is limiting customers to three boxes of eggs each, while Asda is restricting purchases to two boxes per shopper.
Tesco is also considering rationing eggs, after bird flu resulted in shortages on some supermarket shelves. Other supermarkets are sourcing eggs abroad, including Italy.

There were indications on Thursday night that Ukrainian forces were getting closer to the city of Kherson, a port at the mouth of the Dnipro River, said a Ukrainian military analyst and a media commentator.
It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

The new rule, introduced this week, further squeezes women out of an ever-shrinking public space that already sees them banned from traveling without a male escort and forced to wear a hijab or burqa whenever out of the home. 
Schools for teenage girls have also been shut for over a year across most of the country.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia ordered its troops to withdraw from the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday in a further major blow to its campaign amid a Ukrainian counter-offensive.
"Begin to pull out troops," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia's commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its "special military operation" and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow's forces since the offensive began on February 24.
Ukraine's troops have for weeks been capturing villages en route to the city near the Black Sea and Kremlin-installed leaders in Khers…]]></summary>

Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
