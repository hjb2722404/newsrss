His hosts previewed the tense visit with multiple rebukes of the United States, accusing Washington of engaging in “irresponsible bullying” and living under the “illusion” it could deal with China from a “position of strength.” 
China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Blinken that he should “show respect” during a pre-trip phone call, and made clear his view that Washington alone was responsible for the abysmal state of relations.

Kampala, Uganda CNN  — Armed rebels attacked a school in western Uganda, killing at least 41 people, mostly students, and abducting six others, Ugandan officials have said. 
Some were hacked to death with machetes while others died when their dormitories were set on fire, military spokesman Felix Kulayigye told CNN. 
About 20 members of the ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group attacked the Lhubirira secondary school late on Friday, according to Uganda’s military. 
The school is situated along Uganda’s border with Congo in the town of Kasese, and educates children between the ages of 13 and 18. Of the dead, 39 were students and two were from the local community, local officials said.

Kyiv Independent: FT: US senators to propose bill to seize and transfer Russian assets to Ukraine 
U.S. senators with bipartisan backing are reportedly planning to propose a bill that would allow President Joe Biden to seize and transfer Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on June 15. 
Western countries have frozen around $300 billion of Russia's Central Bank assets since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The bill's proponents argue that since Russia bears the blame for the destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, it should also bear the financial costs of reparations. 
They also likely aim to alleviate the burden of Ukraine's support from U.S. taxpayers and allies.

(Reuters) - African leaders hoping to mediate in the Ukraine conflict were welcomed to a government palace near St Petersburg on Saturday by Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said after meeting the leaders in Kyiv on Friday that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdrew its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. 
He added that he could not understand what could be gained from the delegation meeting Putin.
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Kyiv that the leaders had come "to share the African perspective" and saw talks with Russia as part of the mission. 
The leaders from Senegal, Egypt, Zambia, Uganda, Congo Republic and the Comoro islands as well as South Africa were meeting Putin at the government's 18th-century Konstantinovsky Palace, on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.

WNU Editor: Sorry that the audio is out of sync in the above video, but it gives a good summary on what transpired. 
I have visited the Konstantinovsky Palace where these talks are being held. It is an incredibly beautiful place. Check out this aerial picture of the palace and the properties around it (link here). 
Update: When these African leaders met Ukraine President Zelensky the meeting was short, formal, and businesslike (link here). Check out the difference in body language when these same leaders met President Putin the next day (see tweet below).

"There's probably around 20 to 30 hectares behind me, it is easily eaten in a day," cattle farmer Kari Pekonen tells AFP.
In Finland's eastern Karelia region, home to boreal forests and wetlands, climate change is pushing local farmers into conflict with wildlife.
"Many farmers in this region have completely lost faith in the fairness of society," Pekonen says.
Two decades ago, few Barnacle geese stopped in Finland to feed during their migration north across the Arctic, where they nest, from their wintering areas in the Netherlands, Germany and beyond.
But now they number hundreds of thousands in Finland.
This has led to harsh competition for…]]></summary>

He and his three siblings walk at least a mile (1.6 kilometres) and wait, sometimes for hours, hoping to fill their jerry cans and make it back in time for school.
"My arms and my back hurt from the load I carry every day," Mohammad told AFP from the family's makeshift apartment, a former grocery store, in the city of Taez.
"We wake up in the early morning and leave home with our father, sometimes even at night, to collect water," he said.
The teenager's plight is common in Yemen, which had ranked among the world's most water-stressed countries even before conflict broke out in 2015 between Iran-backed Huthi rebels and…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Vladimir Putin tells West to 'go to hell'as despot confirms that nuclear weapons have been moved to Belarus as a precaution for 'anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat' on Russia 
* Lukashenko said Belarus has started receiving Russian tactical nuclear weapons 
* It is Moscow's first move of such bombs outside Russia since fall of Soviet Union 
President Putin told the West to 'go to hell' on nuclear arms reduction as he confirmed he has moved nuclear weapons into Belarus, claiming it is a precautionary measure for 'anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat' on Russia. 
 Speaking at Russia's flagship economic forum in St Petersburg, Putin told those gathered that the first warheads had arrived in the country, but that this was only 'the first part' of the planned delivery. 
 He added: 'Just talking about this (the potential use of nuclear weapons) lowers the nuclear threshold. We have more than NATO countries and they want to reduce our numbers. Go to hell.'

WNU Editor: The Western press is saying Putin said 'go to hell'. Not really. I saw the video on what he said. He said the equivalent of 'f*** NATO' in Russian. This is the first time I have ever seen or heard Putin swear like this.

 Poland says racism was not a factor in its decision to refuse entry to South African presidential guards and media for more than 24 hours. 
The stand-off happened at Warsaw's Chopin airport. The aircraft will now be held there until Sunday, an airport spokesman told the BBC. 
About 120 people were stuck on the plane, who were all on their way to a peace summit in Ukraine. 
Some of the passengers are now disembarking and going to a hotel. 
Poland's actions have left President Cyril Ramaphosa, who travelled separately to Ukraine, without some of his security detail. 
This prompted a furious reaction from Mr Ramaphosa's head of security, Maj Gen Wally Rhoode.

Warzone/The Drive: Israel’s Merkava Tank Has Possible Export Customer In Europe

 
Israel is negotiating sales of Merkavas with two countries, including one in Europe, prompting speculation about a possible deal for Ukraine.  
The Israeli government says that it is in very active talks with two countries about what could be the first confirmed international sales of variants of the country's unique Merkava main battle tank. The identities of those nations have not been disclosed, but one of them is in Europe, which has already led to speculation that Merkavas may eventually be bound for Ukraine. 
Yair Kulas, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense's International Defense Cooperation Directorate, also known by its Hebrew acronym SIBAT, disclosed the potential foreign Merkava sales in a recent interview with the Calcalist newspaper. SIBAT work includes negotiating the sale of weapon systems and other materiel from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inventory.

 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he believes military conflict between China and Taiwan is likely if tensions continue on their current course, though he still holds out for dialogue that will lead to deescalation — as he’s been urging. 
“On the current trajectory of relations, I think some military conflict is probable,” Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, when asked about the possibility that China would invade Taiwan. “But I also think the current trajectory of relations must be altered.” 
The remarks, delivered as Kissinger looked back on his life and career soon after his 100th birthday, were some of his most downbeat about the state of relations between China and the US, which has vowed to back Taiwan in the event China attacks. Kissinger said it was up to both Washington and Beijing to step back from their standoff, which he said was at “the top of a precipice.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have agreed that the Russian leader will visit Turkey "soon", Interfax cited a Kremlin aide as saying on Friday. 
The visit would be Putin's first to a NATO country since he ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has only rarely traveled outside Russia since the beginning of full-scale hostilities. 
 "There is an invitation from the president of Turkey. Putin and Erdogan agreed that the visit will be in the near future, but we have not yet talked about a specific day, specific dates," Interfax cited Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov as saying.

"My purpose in meeting him today was an introductory meeting, just to congratulate him on being installed as minister of defence. Of course, (I) seize every opportunity to encourage him to move forward and approve the accession of Sweden," Austin told a press conference at NATO headquarters.
"But it's a very short meeting, and I don't have anything to report out from that."

* Breakthroughs in electromagnetic launch technology pave the way for a nuclear-powered warship to carry rail gun, laser and high-powered microwave: Ma Weiming

Rear Admiral Ma Weiming, who is key to the development of China's most advanced naval technologies, has revealed the conceptual blueprint of a futuristic warship which he says is unlike any ship the world had seen. 
"It will completely overturn the combat formation of naval fleets that has been in place for over a hundred years," he said in a peer-reviewed paper published in Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society journal on June 13.

The peace delegation, including leaders from South Africa, Senegal, Zambia, the Comoros and Egypt, met defence ministry representatives ahead of talks planned later on Friday with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many genetically modified foods could end up unlabelled on European supermarket shelves, according to a legislative proposal by the European Commission.
This would be the result of an unpublished draft commission regulation, seen by dpa.
The draft regulation would exempt certain genetically-modified plants from the EU's strict rules on genetic engineering.
The proposal is expected to be officially presented in July.
The planned rule changes mean that processes such as CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors would not be subject to EU genetic engineering rules if the resulting varieties could also have been created by processes such as cross breeding or natural selection.
The CRISPR/Cas9 tool allows geneticists to make precise changes in long DNA chains, to make plants more resistant to drought and pests. According to the plans, such modification would fall under the so-called category 1 of plants bred by new techniques (NGT).
Under the planned regulations the strict genetic engineering rules for organic agriculture would continue to apply.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's age of consent was raised from 13, among the world's lowest, to 16 years old on Friday as lawmakers passed key reforms to sex crime legislation.
The reforms, which also clarify rape prosecution requirements and criminalize voyeurism, cleared parliament's upper house in a unanimous vote.
Campaigners welcomed the reforms, with the Tokyo-based group Human Rights Now calling them "a big step forward".
The lifting of the age of consent in particular will "send a message to society that sexual violence by adults against children is unacceptable", the group said in a statement.
The age of consent -- below which sexual activity is considered statutory rape -- is 16 in Britain, 15 in France, and 14 in Germany and China.
Japan's had been unchanged since 1907, with children aged 13 and above …]]></summary>

Earlier this month, Wall Street's regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, pressed a raft of charges against Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and US-based Coinbase.
Both companies, along with the now defunct FTX, were key brands in the crypto industry, helping grow what began as a secretive playground for tech geeks into a new way to invest embraced by Wall Street.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: India demonstrates naval strength with dual aircraft carrier exercise, a feat China has yet to accomplish 
India’s two aircraft carriers led their battle groups in a combined operation in the Arabian Sea earlier this week, showcasing what the service calls its “formidable maritime capabilities” and ability to project power around the Indian Ocean and beyond. 
Analysts say it’s a big accomplishment and one that only the United States Navy has pulled off in recent memory. 
“This is not a small achievement and underlines that the Indian Navy is one of very few in the world that operates more than one aircraft carrier,” said Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Independent: Scholz: 'We need to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine' 
According to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to seize neighboring territories, therefore, Kyiv's partners must discuss concrete security guarantees for Ukraine, Deutsche Welle wrote on June 14. 
The chancellor added that "freezing the war" and thus legitimizing Russia's invasion is not an option, because borders cannot be moved by force.

"The Russian president wants to seize certain neighboring territories: he holds such plans for Ukraine, and it is obvious he has such plans for Belarus," Scholz said.

The consequences of NATO making these security guarantees is that it will not only confirm the Kremlin's claim that NATO is directly involved in the conflict, but NATO is now laying the groundwork for a direct conflict with Russia.

Consortium News: Suspended for Providing Balanced News on Ukraine

 
An editor at Radio New Zealand has been suspended and is under investigation for the time-honored practices of providing balanced and factual reporting, writes Tony Kevin. 
On Friday The Guardian Australia website carried a news report, with a follow-up piece on Monday, whose implications for free speech are profoundly disturbing. 
They concern a Radio New Zealand, or RNZ, broadcasting employee — unnamed, but everyone in the small New Zealand broadcasting world will soon know who it is — who has been placed on leave while their professional conduct is investigated.  Obviously, a career hangs in the balance.

WNU Editor: Radio New Zealand is not the only news media outlet making the decision to provide news on the Ukraine war from only one side. I would say most Western news agencies have made the decision to ban any news from the Russian side on what is happening in the war. And while there are rare occasions when major US outlets do provide a glimpse on what is actually happening on the front-lines, that coverage is very rare and it is often obscured with other news breaking stories.]]></summary>

Reuters: Cuba, Iran presidents meet in Havana, vow to confront 'Yankee imperialism' 
HAVANA (Reuters) -Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz-Canel on Thursday, his last stop on a three-nation Latin American tour aimed at shoring up support among Latin American allies saddled, like Iran, by U.S. sanctions. 
Raisi told reporters at a trade forum in Havana early on Thursday that Cuba and Iran would seek opportunities to work together in electricity generation, biotechnology, and mining, among other areas. 
"The conditions and circumstances in which Cuba and Iran find themselves today have many things in common," Raisi said in a conversation with Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel. "Every day our relations grow stronger."

"This is the broadest cyber espionage campaign known to be conducted by a China-nexus threat actor since the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange in early 2021," said Mandiant chief technology officer Charles Carmakal.
The cyberattackers compromised the computer defenses of hundreds of organizations, in some cases stealing "emails of prominent employees dealing in matters of interest to the Chinese government," Carmakal added.

The Indian American Muslim Council, Peace Action, Veterans for Peace and Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition plan to gather near the White House on June 22 when Modi is due to meet U.S. President Joe Biden.
Washington hopes for closer ties with the world's largest democracy, which is sees as a counterweight to China, but rights advocates worry that geopolitics will overshadow human rights concerns. The United States has said these include government targeting of religious minorities, dissidents and journalists.

Warzone/The Drive: Ukraine’s Armor Appears To Have A Russian Attack Helicopter Problem 
Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters’ presence at the front highlights the need for highly mobile and survivable short-range air defenses. 
As Ukraine presses on with its counteroffensive in the south and east, making incremental advances in the process, there is evidence that Russia may be starting to enjoy more aerial access over critical areas near the front lines. 
As Russia continues to adapt its application of air power, after a fairly dismal start to the campaign, some of its aircraft are now able to operate in a less restricted way, or at least Russia is willing to take on more risk in doing so. Either way, this will put further pressure on the Ukrainian forces, raising questions, in particular, about the availability of mobile short-range air defense systems, or SHORAD.

WNU Editor: It is telling that ten days into the counteroffensive, Ukraine has only shot down one Russian attack helicopter. This tells me two things. Ukraine is clearly lacking surface to air defense missiles, and Russia is dominating the skies along the front.]]></summary>

Jack Teixeira is accused of posting secret and sensitive military documents on social media. 
A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guard member accused of posting secret and sensitive military documents on social media, on six counts related to his retention and transmission of those documents. 
“The unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified information jeopardizes our nation’s security,” acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy said in a statement Thursday. “Individuals granted access to classified materials have a fundamental duty to safeguard the information for the safety of the United States, our active service members, its citizens and its allies. We are committed to ensuring that those entrusted with sensitive national security information adhere to the law.”

Rafael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was inspecting the state of Europe’s largest nuclear plant following last week’s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro River. He said IAEA inspectors would remain at the site.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -At least 15 people were killed in the Canadian prairie province of Manitoba on Thursday after a semi-trailer truck hit a small bus that was carrying a group of mainly elderly people, police said.
The crash is one of the most lethal road accidents in recent Canadian history.
The crash occurred at the junction of two major roads near the town of Carberry in southwestern Manitoba, 170 km (105 miles) west of Winnipeg. The bus passengers had been on their way to a casino in Carberry, CBC News reported, citing a casino spokesperson.

Washington Post: GOP senator blocks arms sale to Hungary for stalling Sweden’s NATO bid 
Sen. James E. Risch, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is halting a $735 million U.S. arms sale to Hungary as punishment for the country’s refusal to approve NATO membership for Sweden, a rare move aimed at pressuring Budapest into greenlighting the military alliance’s expansion ahead of a major summit next month. 
In a statement to The Washington Post, Risch (Idaho) said Hungary must allow Sweden into NATO if it wants the arms package, which includes 24 HIMARS rocket launcher batteries, and more than 100 rockets and pods along with associated parts and support. 
The decision to slam the brakes on new arms sales to Budapest demonstrates the growing anger toward Hungary by NATO backers like Risch, who rarely holds up arms sales to countries in any part of the world.

BBC: Sharp decline in appetite for news in recent years, Reuters Institute says 
The number of people taking a strong interest in the news has dropped by around a quarter in the last six years, a global study suggests. 
A report by Oxford University's Reuters Institute says 48% of people around the world are very or extremely interested in the news - down from 63% in 2017. 
In the UK, the proportion is lower than the global average at 43%. 
More than a third of people (36%) worldwide say they sometimes or often actively avoid the news. 
The authors of the institute's report said there was evidence that audiences "continue to selectively avoid important stories such as the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis as they cut back on depressing news and look to protect their mental health".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Family Association publicly attacked U.S. Senator Ted Cruz over the Texas Republican’s opposition to the “Kill the Gays” law in Uganda. Cruz, who is not pro-LGBTQ civil rights, called the legislation “horrific & wrong” in late May.


	AFA’s Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs Jameson Taylor told attendees at the National Association of Christian Lawmakers last week, as Right Wing Watch reports, that Cruz should think back to our nation’s founding, implying he should support the death penalty for LGBTQ people.

	Taylor did not mention that in the American colonies the death penalty was also imposed for crimes including witchcraft and adultery.

Sweden has still not won Turkey’s support to join NATO ahead of the military alliance’s summit in Vilnius next month, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Wednesday — pouring cold water on rising hopes that a deal might be near. 
“Sweden’s expectations don’t mean we’ll follow them,” Erdoğan said during a trip to Azerbaijan, according to Bloomberg and Turkish media, referring to Stockholm’s aspirations of becoming a NATO member before the alliance’s annual summit in July. 
Erdoğan’s comments were conspicuously timed, coming just as senior officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland met in Ankara to discuss Turkey’s concerns over Sweden’s NATO bid.

A day after at least 78 people died off the southern coast of Greece in one of Europe's worst migrant disasters, demonstrations were held in the capital Athens and in the port city of Thessaloniki.
"The EU is killing people," protest banners read.
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and several left-wing student and trade union organizations had called for the protests.
The bodies of 78 people have been recovered so far, but there are fears more than 500 people perished when the fishing boat capsized.
Media reports have quoted some survivors as saying that around 100 children were in the hold at the bottom of the vessel when it went down in the Mediterranean.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four Indigenous children rescued in the Colombian Amazon last week after surviving in the jungle for 40 days are in good health but still at "high risk" of infection, the military hospital treating them said Thursday.
The children's medical evaluation was "favorable," it said in a statement, and they were reacting well to a gradual increase in their food intake after weeks of surviving on just berries, fruits and roots.
Lesly (13), Soleiny (9), Tien Noriel (5) and one-year-old Cristin were the only survivors of a small plane crash in the Amazon on May 1.
All three adults on board, including their mother died.
It took nearly 200 military and Indigenous rescuers with search dogs 40 days to track down the siblings in difficult jungle conditions. They were weak and hungry when found.
"From an infection point of view, they are still considered at high risk due to their nutritional deficit," the hospital statement said.
Relatives say the children managed to survived thanks to Lesly's deep knowledge of survival in the jungle, with its many inherent dangers -- including snakes, predatory animals and armed criminal groups.
Dozens of soldiers remain on the search for Wilson, a dog that formed part of the rescue mission for the children, but went missing in the jungle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stockholm's deputy mayor donned red lipstick and bouffant hair as he glammed up in drag for a children's story hour, part of a campaign against "intolerance and populism" launched this week.
Jan Jonsson, a 45-year-old member of the center-right Liberal party, is behind the campaign.
He launched it in response to the far-right Sweden Democrats' repeated criticism of drag queens hosting children's story hours at libraries and guided tours at Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre.
"I'm using myself as a kind of canvas for the drag artists...to be able to say that we think everyone should be free to express themselves," he told AFP.
"Some political parties have tried to restrict the freedoms for others and especially drag queens.
"With this stance, I hope that more will be able to say, 'Okay, now it's enough. Sweden should be a free country'."
In a televised debate in early May, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson said it was "insane" that taxpayers' money was being used for drag queen story hours.
He took issue in particular with a drag artist known as "Shameless Winehore" but who goes by the name "Miss Shameless" for story hours.
In a video clip posted on Twitter, Jonsson is seen glammed up wearing a curly blonde wig, fake eyelashes, a sky-blue dress with red flowers and high heels.
On a chair, surrounded by children seated on the floor, Jonsson reads a passage from "The Brothers Lionheart" by famed Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren about standing up for your beliefs even if it's dangerous.
"Stories are not dangerous for kids. And drag queens aren't either. But populism and intolerance are dangerous for kids and for adults," Jonsson says in the advert.
Jonsson has previously fronted a Liberal campaign against Sweden's soaring gang crime, where the slender politician, clad in a floral shirt and blue blazer was dubbed the "gangs' worst enemy".

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>
