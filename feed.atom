Less than two years after President Biden withdrew U.S. personnel from Afghanistan, the country has become a significant coordination site for the Islamic State as the terrorist group plans attacks across Europe and Asia, and conducts “aspirational plotting” against the United States, according to a classified Pentagon assessment that portrays the threat as a growing security concern. 
The attack planning, detailed in U.S. intelligence findings leaked on the Discord messaging platform and obtained by The Washington Post, reveal specific efforts to target embassies, churches, business centers and the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, which drew more than 2 million spectators last summer in Qatar. Pentagon officials were aware in December of nine such plots coordinated by ISIS leaders in Afghanistan, and the number rose to 15 by February, says the assessment, which has not been disclosed previously.

Asia Times:  Guided and glide bombs: new feature in Ukraine war

 
Already needed are next-generation versions less vulnerable to jamming  
The Ukrainians are using US-supplied glide bombs and the Russians have their own. 
These weapons are a new feature in the Ukraine war, and so far the Russians are winning the battle of glide bombs. The Ukrainians are calling the Russian glide bombs an “extremely big threat.” 
The US has supplied Ukraine with two different types of glide bombs, the GLSDB (ground-launched small diameter bomb) produced by Boeing and Saab (Sweden), and the JDAM-ER (joint direct attack munition-extended range), manufactured by Boeing.  Over the years Boeing has produced more than 500,000 JDAMs. 
Russia has answered with two types of precision bombs, the Grom E2 and the UPAB-1500B-E. 
Surprisingly, the US-supplied weapons have not been effective and have been intercepted by the Russians. 

Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The Russian military has only recently started using guided and glide bombs, and according to all reports that I have seen, they are proving to be very effective. They are also incredibly cheap to build, and with the Russian air force dominating the skies over Ukraine, a useful, accurate, and effective weapon to use against Ukrainian positions.]]></summary>

Space Force leaders say carefully written contracts can prevent things like SpaceX’s about-face on Ukrainian satcomms.

A potential problem is illustrated by Musk’s behavior toward Ukraine. In the months that followed Russia’s invasion, SpaceX donated some 20,000 of its satellite internet terminals and millions of dollars’ worth of service to the Ukrainian military. But in October, SpaceX wrote the Pentagon that it would cease its subsidy. Three months after that, Starlink officials said they had taken steps to hinder Ukraine’s use of the terminals on the battlefield; Musk declared, in apparent contradiction of Starlink’s work for the Pentagon, that the service was “never intended to be weaponized.” Ukrainian and Pentagon officials have said they would seek alternatives to Starlink.

WNU Editor: It all comes down to cost. SpaceX has brought down the price of launching rockets by a factor of 10x. That saves the Pentagon hundreds of millions, if not billions, over the next few years.]]></summary>

The Taliban-led government of Afghanistan disclosed on 15 April that a Chinese company reached out to Kabul with a $10 billion investment proposal to mine the national lithium reserves and to provide assistance in the construction of infrastructure. 
The head of Afghanistan’s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, Shahabuddin Delawar, made the announcement following a meeting he had with representatives of the Chinese company, commonly identified as Gochin, which expressed interest in mining the national lithium reserves. 
During the meeting, the Chinese company stressed its interest in developing specific infrastructure, such as a hydroelectric dam and a new tunnel by the Salang gateway, connecting east Afghanistan with its northern gateway to Russia and China.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The U.S. military evacuated American diplomats and their families from Sudan, the country's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said early on Sunday as fighting between rival commanders that has killed hundreds of civilians continued. 
The operation, involving six aircraft, was carried out in coordination with the RSF, it said. 
Separately, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters the U.S. military had successfully evacuated U.S. embassy personnel. 
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Washington Post: Ukraine planned attacks on Russian forces in Syria, leaked document shows 
Ukraine’s military intelligence agency developed plans to conduct covert attacks on Russian forces in Syria using secret Kurdish help, according to a leaked top-secret U.S. intelligence document. 
The introduction of a new battlefield — thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine — appeared designed to impose costs and casualties on Russia and its Wagner paramilitary group, which is active in Syria, and possibly force Moscow to redeploy resources from Ukraine. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky directed a halt to the planning in December, but the leaked document, based on intelligence gathered as of Jan. 23, lays out in detail how the planning progressed and how such a campaign could proceed if Ukraine revived it.

Business Insider: Russian outlets are exaggerating that Ukrainian troops are stuck in the mud to cheer up Putin's soldiers, UK intel says 
 * Russian media is exaggerating the mud's impact on Ukrainian forces, UK intel reports. 
 * Their goal is "aimed at raising Russian morale" and "undermining Ukraine's supporters," intel says.

The document, which has not been previously reported on, says “enduring” defense shortfalls led the Canadian Armed Forces to assess in February that it “could not conduct a major operation while simultaneously maintaining its NATO battle group leadership [in Latvia] and aid to Ukraine” — and that the situation was not “likely” to change without a shift in public opinion.

* Russia's crude oil sales to China surged to its historic high in March. 
* Chinese refiners purchased discounted ESPO and Urals crudes from Russia. 
* Saudi Arabia still trails Russia in crude oil supply to China despite a 30% increase in March compared to the previous year.

Russian crude arrivals to China surged to a record high of 2.26 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, up by 50% compared to 1.50 million bpd in March 2022, per data from China’s General Administration of Customs cited by Reuters.

Reuters: Russian billionaires see wealth rise to over half a trillion dollars, Forbes Russia reports 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's richest people added $152 billion to their wealth over the past year, buoyed by high prices for natural resources and rebounding from the huge loss of fortunes they experienced just after the Ukraine war began, Forbes Russia said. 
Russia has 110 official billionaires in the list, up 22 from last year, according to Forbes' Russian edition, which said their total wealth increased to $505 billion from $353 billion when the 2022 list was announced. 
The list would have been longer had not five billionaires - DST Global founder Yuri Milner, Revolut founder Nikolay Storonsky, Freedom Finance founder Timur Turlov, and JetBrains co-founders Sergei Dmitriev and Valentin Kipyatkov - renounced their Russian citizenship, Forbes said.

Through family, friends, and the business contacts that I know in Russia, I have been told bluntly that all businesses (small, medium, and large) have mostly transitioned away from the West and are now focused on the domestic market, and to do business with the growing Asian and Middle Eastern economies.]]></summary>

The Group of Seven countries are considering banning almost all exports to Russia, in an extension of the sanctions regime against Moscow for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, a Japanese government source said Friday. 
Japan is set to host the G7 summit in May in Hiroshima, where discussions will take place on measures to expand support to Ukraine and strengthen sanctions on Russia among other key topics.

Hamada ordered the Self-Defense Forces to make necessary preparations as he could potentially "order the destruction of ballistic missiles", the Defense Ministry said in a statement. 
Preparations included making arrangements to deploy troops to the southern prefecture of Okinawa to "minimise damage should a ballistic missile fall." 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said preparations for the planned launch of the country's first spy satellite should proceed to counter perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, state media reported on Wednesday.

As it fights to defend itself in a war that has killed tens of thousands of its people and devastated the economy, the country is preparing to sell big government-run firms at distressed prices. The aim is to shore up the aid-dependent budget and end a decades-old, post-communist legacy of corruption and mismanagement that has undercut the economy.

WNU Editor: There is a reason why no one is buying these assets. The rule of law, specifically contract law, is being completely ignored in Ukraine. I see this attempt to sell these assets (at pennies on the dollar) as one last attempt by the powers that be in Kyiv to try and grab as much money as they can before this house of cards collapses. 
Update: Here is an easy prediction. If this money is transferred to Ukraine, it will disappear like everything else .... US Justice Department Seeks New Authority to Transfer Seized Russian Assets to Ukraine (VOA).]]></summary>

 * A record 69% of the public holds negative views about the economy both now and in the future, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. 
* President Joe Biden’s approval rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey. 
* Just 24% say now is a good time to invest in stocks, also the lowest reading in the survey’s 17-year history. 
Amid persistent inflation, higher interest rates and recession worries, Americans have never been more negative about the economy, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. 
A record 69% of the public holds negative views about the economy both now and in the future, the highest percentage in the survey’s 17-year history. 
The survey of 1,000 people nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-3.1%, found that about two-thirds of Americans say their wages are falling behind inflation, and two-thirds say the nation is headed for recession or already in one. 
The fallout from these negative views is hitting President Joe Biden’s approval rating. 
His overall rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey.

Summit News: GOP Lawmakers: Endless Ukraine Aid “Will Only Prolong The Conflict”

 
"There is no end in sight and no clear strategy to bring this war to a close”

Republican Senators and Representatives have penned a letter to Joe Biden demanding that aid to Ukraine be halted, charging that sending endless amounts of money and military supplies to the country without a clear strategy “will only prolong the conflict.” 
“We write to express concern regarding the U.S. response to Ukraine. Over a year ago, Russia launched an invasion that has upended decades of peace in Europe. We are deeply concerned that the trajectory of U.S. aid to the Ukrainian war effort threatens further escalation and lacks much-needed strategic clarity,” the letter signed by 19 lawmakers reads. 
It comes as the White House approved a fresh Ukraine military aid package Wednesday consisting of $325 million worth of battlefield supplies. 
“There is no end in sight and no clear strategy to bring this war to a close,” the Senators continued in the letter.

* One of the videos was recorded on Tuesday and shows high-res images 
* The two interceptions are part of a larger trend of Russian-US air conflict 
* Central Command has warned the war in Ukraine could spill into Syria 
US Central Command released videos Wednesday of Russian fighter jets intercepting American jets over Syria on two separate occasions, as tensions continue to escalate between the two nations. 
The videos show high-quality infrared views of a Russian Su-35 intercepting an American craft just a month after General Michael 'Erik' Kurilla, head of Central Command, said he's seen a spike in aggressive Russian activity. 
'We have seen a significant spike since about March 1 in Syria,' General Kurilla told the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 16.

Somehow the buried necropolis was never stumbled upon during multiple road works over the years, as well as the construction of the Port-Royal station on the historic Left Bank in the 1970s.
However, plans for a new exit for the train station prompted an archaeological excavation.
Camille Colonna, an anthropologist at France's National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP), told a press conference that there were already "strong suspicions" the site was close to Lutetia's southern necropolis.

Diaz-Canel took over the reins in 2018 as Cuba's first civilian leader after nearly 60 years of Castro brother hegemony, vowing to "always defend the party" even as he set out in pursuit of cautious economic liberalization.
In 2021, he also took over as first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) -- the country's most powerful position, long held by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and then his brother Raul.
Now 62, Diaz-Canel's first term was marked by the worst economic crisis in three decades and a widely criticized response to historic anti-government protests, which triggered a tightening…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) -The death toll rose to 29 on Wednesday from a fire at a Beijing hospital that was one of the Chinese capital's deadliest in at least two decades, killing 26 patients and wounding dozens.
Social media showed dramatic videos of people using tied bed sheets to climb down the walls to escape smoke and flames after the fire broke out at Changfeng Hospital on Tuesday.
Broken and burned out windows could be seen at the site, where there were many police officers, some in plain clothes, Reuters witnesses said.
All but three of the 29 dead were patients, officials told a media briefing on Wednesday, with the fire having been put out in half an hour.
"There was a lot of smoke, I could see it," said an elderly local resident who gave only his surname, Li. He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.
Authorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.
Initial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.
By Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.
"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening," one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.
"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification."
Early on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.

Washington (AFP) - Elon Musk promised to make Twitter the "most accurate source of information about the world," but he has repeatedly used his own account to amplify false claims from some of the most notorious disinformers on the internet, according to an AFP analysis of his online activity.
The posts show Musk drawing attention to misinformation about everything from the war in Ukraine to the attack on US Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's husband. Last week, the billionaire boosted a tweet that wrongly suggested doctors misdiagnosed flu cases as Covid-19 deaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few dozen Holocaust survivors on Tuesday led a march in southern Poland to commemorate victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau, on the eve of the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
Every year, thousands of people from around the world -- both Jewish and not -- take part in the event held at the site of the former death camp built by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland.
One million European Jews died at the camp in the city of Oswiecim between 1940 and 1945 along with around 80,000 non-Jewish Poles, 25,000 Roma and 20,000 Soviet soldiers.
The camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.
The 35th edition of the March of the Living began with the doleful sound of the shofar -- a traditional Jewish ram's horn symbolizing freedom -- at the notorious "Arbeit Macht Frei" (Work Will Set You Free) gate at Auschwitz.
The three-kilometre march was notably attended this year by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch.
On Wednesday, Warsaw will commemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which broke out 80 years ago on April 19, 1943.
The presidents of Israel and Germany will be in attendance and are expected to visit the site of the former Jewish district.
The Germans confined up to 450,000 Jews to an area of just over three square kilometers -- most of whom died of starvation or disease inside or were taken to a death camp to the east of Warsaw.

The 3.9-meter (12.8-foot) high skeleton, made up of bones from three different T-rexes estimated at 65 to 67 million years old, was sold at the Koller auction house in Zurich after being shipped from the United States in nine giant crates.
The skeleton fetched a hammer price of 4.8 million Swiss francs, rising to 5.5 million with the buyer's premium added on.
Trinity was put up for sale by an anonymous US private individual and was expected to fetch between five and eight million Swiss francs.

But I'll tell you straight up: you won't silence me.” On the night of October 16, Moreno was shot dead by two men on a motorcycle in Montelibano, a small rural town in northern Colombia’s Cordoba department, one of the most marginalised and violent parts of the country. Moreno worked there as director of online news outlet Voces de Cordoba, in which he regularly exposed corruption, embezzlement and the activities of illegal armed groups.


	Moreno was investigating the installation of a mine on property belonging to a senator; according to him, resources were being extracted from it for public construction projects.

Forbidden Stories, an international consortium of investigative journalists offering to protect the work of colleagues under threat. Moreno told the group he wanted his investigations to be pursued and published worldwide if anything happened to him.


	For six months, a group of some 30 reporters co-ordinated by Forbidden Stories have taken over Moreno’s investigations, including journalists from FRANCE 24 and its sister service Radio France International, examining hundreds of documents and emails that Rafael had not yet made public to uncover a system of wide-scale clientelism and endemic corruption.

Lula's meeting with Sergei Lavrov in Brasilia follows state visits to China and the Middle East, during which he said the United States should "stop encouraging war and start talking about peace" in Ukraine.
He also claimed that Kyiv shares the blame for the conflict, which began when Russian forces poured into Ukraine in February 2022.
Lula's remarks echoed a line frequently used by Moscow and its strategic ally Beijing, which blame the West for the war.
China seeks to position itself as neutral on the Ukraine war, but has maintained its partnership with Moscow and refrained from imposing sanctions.

KARUIZAWA, Japan (Reuters) - The Group of Seven industrial powers on Tuesday said they were more united than ever as they criticised China's added pressure on Taiwan and Russia's threat to station nuclear weapons in Belarus while it wages war in neighbouring Ukraine.
"The strength of the solidarity between the G7 foreign ministers is at a level not seen before," Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a press conference after hosting a meeting of the group in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa.
The show of unity comes after French President Emmanuel Macron this month said the European Union should reduce its dependency on the United States and cautioned against being drawn into a Taiwan crisis.

Brasília (AFP) - Russia's foreign minister met in Brazil on Monday with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as Washington criticized the South American leader's recent remarks on US defense support for Ukraine.
Lula is fresh off a trip to China and the United Arab Emirates, during which he raised eyebrows in the West by accusing the United States of "encouraging the war" in Ukraine.
He also said the United States and Europe "need to start talking about peace," and that Kyiv shares the blame for the conflict, which began in February 2022 when Russian forces poured into Ukraine in an attempt to overthrow the democ…]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
