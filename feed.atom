Temporary closure comes after Finnish intelligence suggested Russia was helping asylum seekers reach the border 
Finland has announced it is temporarily closing its entire border with Russia after weeks of tensions between the countries over asylum seekers that Helsinki has labelled a “hybrid operation” by Moscow. 
With just 24 hours’ notice, the Finnish government said on Tuesday it would close Raja-Jooseppi in Lapland, its last remaining border crossing point with Russia, on Wednesday night. 
The highly unusual move, which follows the closure of its eight other crossing points, means the entirety of the 830-mile land border between Finland and Russia will be closed until 13 December.

Even a conservative assessment of the reported Gaza casualty figures shows that the rate of death during Israel’s assault has few precedents in this century, experts say.

While wartime death tolls will never be exact, experts say that even a conservative reading of the casualty figures reported from Gaza shows that the pace of death during Israel’s campaign has few precedents in this century.

RFE: Officials Confirm Wife Of Ukrainian Military Intelligence Chief Budanov, Others Poisoned 
KYIV -- Ukrainian officials have confirmed reports that Marianna Budanova, the wife of the chief of the country's military intelligence service, had been poisoned with "heavy metals" and is in hospital for treatment, in what appears to represent the most serious targeting of a family member of Ukraine's leadership since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. 
Andriy Yusov, an official at the GUR military intelligence agency, confirmed earlier media reports on November 28 that Budanova, the wife of Kyrylo Budanov, had fallen ill and is under treatment for poisoning. 
"Marianna Budanova was indeed poisoned by heavy metals. She is now undergoing a course of treatment, which is already coming to an end," Yusov told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.

The New Voice of Ukraine: Ukraine’s foreign intel head paints harrowing picture of Russia’s plans, list’s Top 4 priorities 
The Kremlin has an aggressive plan for the future and is currently solving four tasks, Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service head, Oleksandr Lytvynenko, said in his column for Interfax-Ukraine on Nov. 22. 
Task No. 1 is to ensure internal stability, mobilize the population and economy, and increase the production of weapons and military equipment. 
 "The Kremlin has so far ensured economic stability and control over socio-political processes," Lytvynenko wrote. 
“The political field has been cleared: the liberal and far-right (so-called "turbo-patriots") opposition has been destroyed or marginalized.” 
 By 2026, Russia's military production should support large-scale high-intensity hostilities, and in 2028, the aggressor should restore the military capabilities it had as of 2022, Lytvynenko says. 
"This is what the Russian budget for 2024-2026 is designed for," he wrote.

Update: Russia believes key to victory is internal destabilisation in Ukraine, Head of Foreign Intelligence Service says (Ukrainsa Pravda)

 
WNU Editor: I agree with his first two points on what is Russia's approach towards the war. But his attempt to instill fear among Russia's neighbors that they are next is not producing the result that he is hoping for. These countries are more focused on increasing their defenses, and will not intervene directly in the current war.]]></summary>

Strategic Culture: It Pays to Be Friends With Zelensky: How $75m Yachts Reveal the Huge and Sudden Wealth of the Ukrainian Leader’s Inner Circle 
In the heart of Eastern Europe, where the tumult of war clashes with the allure of Western support, a seismic scandal unfolds, casting a long shadow over Ukraine’s leadership. President Volodymyr Zelensky, once seen as a beacon of hope against corruption, is now ensnared in a scandal involving the alleged purchase of two luxury yachts, “Lucky Me” and “My Legacy,” worth a combined $75 million. This lavish expenditure, facilitated in the opulent settings of Abu Dhabi and Antibes, starkly contrasts with Ukraine’s dire war reality and raises damning questions about the integrity and criminal liability of its leadership amidst heavy reliance on Western aid.

Two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi rebel-controlled Yemen toward a US warship in the Gulf of Aden, after the US Navy responded to a distress call from a commercial tanker that had been seized by armed individuals, the US military said Sunday.
The tanker, identified as the Central Park, had been carrying a cargo of phosphoric acid when its crew called for help that “they were under attack from an unknown entity,” the US Central Command said in a statement. 
Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday that under international maritime norms and laws, when there is a distress signal, “all vessels in the vicinity, are required to come and help and support.” Though Ryder added that there were three Chinese Navy vessels in the vicinity that “did not respond.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C. William Walldorf, Jr., Real Clear Wire: Time to Drawdown From Syria 
As part of the fallout from the war in Gaza, U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq have come under attack more than fifty times from Iranian-backed militias since early October.  At least fifty-six military personnel have been injured. In response, the U.S. launched retaliatory air strikes and has sent about 900 more troops to the region. 
This bolstering of forces is the wrong move. In fact, the U.S. is overdue to drawdown its forces from Syria. 
Why drawdown completely?  The answer is simple.  The small contingent of U.S. forces in Syria, especially, are sitting ducks for further attacks in support of missions where the costs of continuing those missions now far outstrip their strategic benefits.  Recent attacks bring this mismatch between costs and benefits into sharp relief.  These incidents should also serve as a warning for potential dangers if U.S. policy fails to change course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Irish writer Paul Lynch's Booker Prize-winning fifth novel is a timely and urgent book described as powerful, claustrophobic and horribly real, capturing the social and political anxieties of our time. The book is set in a dystopian Dublin in the grips of totalitarianism. Some of the themes of "Prophet Song" are eerily similar to the riots that broke out in Dublin last week. "Prophet Song" also echoes the violence in Palestine, Ukraine and Syria, and the experience of all those who flee from war-torn countries. The author speaks to FRANCE 24's culture editor Eve Jackson about winning the most prestigious literature prize in the English-speaking world, writing the Irish offspring of "The Handmaid's Tale" and "Nineteen Eighty-Four" – and what he's spending his prize money on.]]></summary>

Kyiv Post: Ukraine Commander Warns War Zone May Expand Amid Russian Arms Buildup
 Lieutenant General Serhii Nayev accused Russia of securing additional resources through its alliance with the "Axis of Evil" it had formed with North Korea and Iran. 
If Russia continues to increase weapons production and improve technologically with the help of its allies, the war could spread beyond the eastern and southern areas, Lieutenant General Serhii Nayev, who has responsibility for Ukraine's Northern border defense, said speaking in an interview with ABC News.
“We are getting ready for that,” he said. “We're building defenses, laying landmines, and training our forces.” 
Despite Ukraine's initial successes in preventing total Russian occupation, the counteroffensive that was launched five months ago has yielded minimal gains. This inertia underscores a noticeable shift in the nature of the war. 
The Lieutenant General bluntly acknowledged that the ongoing war has now essentially become a resource-driven war.

Washington Free Beacon: Video of Massive Terror Complex Under Al Shifa Hospital Makes Media Look Ridiculous 
The Israel Defense Forces brought cameras into the tunnels under Al Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip this week and exposed not just Hamas's sprawling operations there but also the terrorist group's enablers in the media. 
The footage, taken by Fox News as well as by the IDF itself, revealed a massive, 160-meter-long underground complex complete with bathrooms, a kitchen, and other air-conditioned rooms. It was clear evidence that Hamas hid behind the hospital's patients and staff while launching attacks against Israel—a war crime that justifies the IDF's takeover of the hospital last week, according to international law.

Business Insider: Here's what happens if Donald Trump dies while running in the 2024 presidential election 
* Donald Trump is currently the Republican frontrunner heading into the 2024 election. 
* He is 77 years old and will turn 78 in June.
* If Trump dies while running for reelection, a few different things could happen. 
Former President Donald Trump is far and away the Republican frontrunner heading into the 2024 election. 
 He is 77 years old and will be 78 in June. 
If Trump dies while seeking reelection, a few different things could happen, depending on when he dies and how close it is to Election Day. 
There's no national deadline to file to run for president of the United States. Instead, filing deadlines vary depending on the state and party.

Opinion polls suggest the result is far too close to predict, with any of four candidates -- including one from the far-right -- within striking distance of power in the EU's fifth-largest economy.
The vote is being closely watched across Europe and further afield: the Netherlands tends to punch above its weight in the EU and on the world stage, with steadfast support for Ukraine and eurozone fiscal discipline.
Polls suggested huge numbers were undecided going into election day, making the result a literal coin-toss for one voter.
"For me, this is a bit of a different election because anyone can win. In the end it came dow…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chinese government has expanded its campaign of closing mosques to regions other than Xinjiang, where for years it has been blamed for persecuting Muslim minorities, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Wednesday.
Authorities have closed mosques in the northern Ningxia region as well as Gansu province, which are home to large populations of Hui Muslims, as part of a process known officially as “consolidation,” according to the report, which draws on public documents, satellite images and witness testimonies.
Local authorities also have been removing architectural features of mosques to make them look more “Chinese," part of a campaign by the ruling Communist Party to tighten control over religion and reduce the risk of possible challenges to its rule.
President Xi Jinping in 2016 called for the “Sinicization” of religions, initiating a crackdown that has largely concentrated on the western region of Xinjiang, home to more than 11 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.
Chinese authorities have decommissioned, closed down, demolished or converted mosques for secular use in regions outside Xinjiang as part of a campaign aimed at cracking down on religious expression, according to Human Rights Watch.
Additionally, the ablution hall of one mosque was damaged inside, according to videos obtained by the group.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World leaders on Wednesday welcomed a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that agreed a four-day halt to the devastating war in Gaza, accompanied by the release of dozens of hostages held by the militant group in return for Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The agreement marks the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since Hamas’s bloody cross-border October 7 attack on southern Israel that prompted Israel to launch a bombing campaign and ground offensive in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
Israel’s government and Hamas agreed to a four-day pause in fighting to allow the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The deal, which was brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US, came after five weeks of negotiations, according to a US official.
US President Joe Biden said late Tuesday he was deeply relieved that some hostages taken when Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7 will soon go free.
Qatar on Wednesday provided more details on the deal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who was convicted in the beating of a Jewish man in New York City back in 2021 yelled out "Free Palestine" inside a courtroom during his sentencing hearing, The New York Post reported. 
Mahmoud Musa, 23, was sentenced to seven years in prison in connection to the attack on Joseph Borgen which took place during a confrontation between supporters of Israel and Palestinian. 
ALSO READ: These 10 legislators have also broken a federal disclosure law, just like George Santos
As he was being led away in handcuffs, he yelled "Free Palestine," which sparked an uproar in the court room from his supporters, with some of them calling the judge a "racist." Musa's supporters were then escorted out of the courtroom by security, according to reports.
From The New York Post: "Borgen, who was wearing a yarmulke, was pepper-sprayed by a pack of men as they hurled antisemitic slurs at him while beating him in an attack captured on video that later went viral. He said he still suffers from post-traumatic-stress-disorder and wrist pain as a result of the attack, which left him with a concussion and other injuries."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare nugget of information about the famously enigmatic street art superstar Banksy emerged Tuesday when he gave his first name as "Robbie" in an unearthed 2003 BBC interview.
In the interview, one of the few known to exist with the global art phenomenon, he is asked if his name "Robert Banks", to which he replies: "It's Robbie."
His identity has long been the source of speculation, with some claiming his name was Robin or Robert Banks.
Banksy talks about his distinctive stencilling style in the interview, a podcast bonus part of a series called "The Banksy Story".
"It's quick... I want to get it done and dusted," he is heard to say of his work.
The artist was in his 20s at the time, and was promoting the opening of his "Turf War" show in east London.
The series also contains a 2005 interview the artist purportedly gave with US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR).
In it, the host asks: "We assume that you are who you say you are, but how can we be sure?" The interviewee responds: "Oh, you have no guarantee of that at all."
Banksy, known to hail from Bristol in southwest England, boasts an A-list client list and has sold his works for tens of millions of pounds at auction since achieving notoriety in the early 2000s.]]></summary>

The 16-year-old high school student, identified only as Thomas, was stabbed at the weekend when a group of outsiders descended on a festive crowd of around 400 people gathered in Crepol, in the southwestern Drome region, for a dance party in the village hall.
He died on his way to hospital. Eight others were injured, two of them seriously.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told parliament that seven people had been arrested and investigators would now ascertain if they were behind "this odious crime".
A source close to the case, who asked not to be named, told AFP that the suspected killer…]]></summary>

The country's parole board on Monday said it would be "considering the profile of Oscar Pistorius on Friday, 24 November 2023".
But even if Pistorius's application was to be successful the ex-athlete might have to wait for weeks before being let out of prison pending an "internal process" by the Department of Correctional Services (DCS), according to the Steenkamp family lawyer, Tania Koen.
If "parole is granted, DCS follows an internal process, which is usually within a month", Koen told AFP.

North Korea's previous efforts to put a spy satellite into orbit in May and August both failed, and Seoul, Tokyo and Washington had repeatedly warned Pyongyang not to proceed with another launch, which would violate successive rounds of UN resolutions.
Seoul's military "detected at 10:43 pm (1343 GMT) one alleged military surveillance satellite launched from the Tongchang-ri area in North Pyongan province," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
The rocket and its purported satellite payload "flew to the west of Baengnyeong island", it said, referring to an island near the maritime border between the two …]]></summary>

Still wearing their helmets, the men could be seen peering at the endoscopic camera sent by rescuers down a thin pipe through which air, food and water are being sent.
"We will bring you out safely, do not worry," rescuers were heard telling the trapped men as they gathered near the camera, in video released by state authorities.

"Today I toured the main quarters. It was a spectacular city; I say 'was' because today more than half has been consumed by fire," the French emperor wrote.
In the missive, on sale for $58,300, he also remarked on the city's inventory of alcohol.

        <updated>2023-11-20T17:45:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who infamously peddled conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that were concocted by a woman who believes she can talk with the wind, is now floating wild conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19.
While there is still some debate over whether COVID-19 may have originated from a viral research lab in the city of Wuhan, Bartiromo on Monday took things several steps farther — and suggested that the virus was part of a deliberate plot to bring down former President Donald Trump.
During an interview with Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, "Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?"
In fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.
ALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.
Regardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to "disrupt" America to "get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden."
Wenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released "accidentally."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>
