        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says he hopes the comments emerging from Emmanuel Macron on the topic of Ukraine “don’t prove damaging” to trans-Atlantic relations.

“I hope the comments don’t prove damaging, they do point to attitudes and approaches that at times are of concern in terms of not realising the challenges that are faced in relation to China’s efforts over a period of time to bend and push against the rules-based order in different ways,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.

“The establishment of military operations in the South China Sea, the of course, undermining of human rights in a number of areas … trade-based economic coercion in breach of WTO rules against Australia, these are all serious issues and an important point for any leader of a democratic nation to be mindful of is the need for us all to work together in defence of our values.”]]></summary>

NYPost: US troops in Taiwan 'on the table' if China invades, Michael McCaul says

W
ASHINGTON — House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul has said the US may send troops to Taiwan should China invade the self-governed island. 
“If communist China invaded Taiwan, it would certainly be on the table and something that would be discussed by Congress and with the American people,” the Texas Republican told Fox News. 
“Are they prepared to do this? Is Taiwan worth it? I can argue for a lot of reasons why it is.” 
The potential move would represent a stark contrast to the th
e war in Ukraine, where the US has sent billions in weaponry to Kyiv but has refused to send troops. 

“[To deploy troops,] you’re talking about an authorized use of military force that would come out of my committee or a declaration of war, which we haven’t utilized since World War II,” McCaul said during a three-day trip to Taipei at the head of a congressional delegation.

Update: Conflict with China 'last resort' but Congress will authorize troops if Americans support it: McCaul (FOX News).

 
WNU Editor: I do not see the American public supporting a policy to go to war against China to defend Taiwan. But I could be wrong.

 
Update #2: House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul is correct about this .... McCaul says China could influence, take over Taiwan in next election ‘without a shot fired’ (The Hill). Taiwan President Tsai’s party suffered losses in recent local elections (link here), and my gut tells me that many Taiwanese do not want to suffer the same fate as Ukraine. That diplomacy and accommodation with China are the preferred options. 

 
Update #3: The Chinese are sending a message to Washington .... China military ‘ready to fight’ after drills near Taiwan (AP).]]></summary>

The U.S. State Department says it's "monitoring closely" a Chinese maritime operation in the Taiwan Strait this week that includes boarding and inspecting ships. 
Why it matters: Officials in Taipei believe the unprecedented action in the Taiwan Strait is in reprisal for their president's D.C. meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 
* Taiwan's Maritime and Port Bureau said it had told ship crews not to comply with Chinese maritime "boardings and inspections" requests and instead contact the island's coast guard for protection.

ABOARD COTAM UNITÉ (FRANCE’S AIR FORCE ONE) — Europe must reduce its dependency on the United States and avoid getting dragged into a confrontation between China and the U.S. over Taiwan, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview on his plane back from a three-day state visit to China. 
Speaking with POLITICO and two French journalists after spending around six hours with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip, Macron emphasized his pet theory of “strategic autonomy” for Europe, presumably led by France, to become a “third superpower.” 
He said “the great risk” Europe faces is that it “gets caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy,” while flying from Beijing to Guangzhou, in southern China, aboard COTAM Unité, France’s Air Force One.

WNU Editor: French President Macron's trip to Beijing must have been an eye--opener for him to make such a remark. Not surprising. US politicians are reacting (see below).

Funny to see how American politicians are suddenly very concerned about Europe's course towards Ukraine.
Why would Europe trust a 'partner' who destroys NordStream to sell their expensive gas?

Like the U.S. military, the PLA is working on wearable sensors and other ways to hone and maintain troops' fighting spirit. 
China’s military is increasingly at work on wearable technology and a dedicated psychological support system to win at what it views as the crucial space of cognitive warfare—manipulating enemy troops’ state of mind to shape their behavior and hardening its own forces against such efforts. 
“In future cognitive domain operations, the influence of rational factors such as science and logic on individual cognition is likely to be weakened, and cognitive confrontation may become a contest of emotions,” says one recent article in PLA Daily. 
“The rapid development of intelligent technology is changing the logic of information dissemination in an all-round way, making the impact of information on thinking and consciousness more profound and comprehensive, and human brain cognition has truly risen to an important field of military confrontation.”

China has finished three days of military drills around Taiwan, which included "sealing off" the island and simulating targeted strikes. 
Taiwan said it had detected jets to its east, while China said its Shandong aircraft carrier had taken part. 
Beijing began the exercises on Saturday after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met the US House Speaker in California. 
After the drills ended, Taiwan's defence ministry said it would not stop strengthening its combat preparedness. 
The drills have not been as big as those that followed Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taipei last August.

BBC: China simulates hitting 'key targets' on Taiwan 
China has simulated precision strikes against key targets on Taiwan and its surrounding waters during a second day of military drills. 
The drills - which Beijing has called a "stern warning" to the self-governing island - are a response to Taiwan's president visiting the US last week. 
As the Chinese military simulated an encirclement of the island, the US urged China to show restraint.

Taiwan said about 70 Chinese aircraft flew around the island on Sunday. 
Eleven Chinese ships were also spotted.

On Saturday, Taiwan said that 45 warplanes either crossed the Taiwan Strait median line - the unofficial dividing line between Taiwanese and Chinese territory - or flew into the south-western part of Taiwan's air defence identification zone. 
The operation, dubbed "Joint Sword" by Beijing, will continue until Monday. Taiwanese officials have been enraged by the operation.

“There were always sort of murmurings within the media that the relationship between the Sussexes and the Cambridges had really broken down at the time,” said writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue. 

“Clearly that relationship had broken down quite significantly already and obviously the walkabout was not her idea, it was her husband Prince William’s idea so she had to go along with it because it was seen as extending an olive branch,” Ms Krakue told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.

“But I can imagine it’s quite difficult for someone to play nice publicly with people that have had no qualms in slating you and defaming your character in the way that they have done.”]]></summary>

The visit displays progress in the Oman-mediated dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. 
Saudi and Omani delegations have held talks with Houthi officials in the Yemeni capital Sanaa as part of international efforts to find a settlement to Yemen’s nine-year conflict, Houthi-run media reported. 
The visit indicates progress in the Oman-mediated consultations between Riyadh and Sanaa, which run parallel to United Nations peace efforts. 
Negotiations also gained momentum since archrivals Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to re-establish ties in a deal brokered by China.

NYPost: Russian fighter jet nearly shot down British spy plane, according to leaked US military documents 
A Russian fighter jet nearly shot down an unarmed British reconnaissance plane over the Black Sea in September — a confrontation described in leaked US military documents as more significant than previously known, according to a report Sunday. 
UK Defense Minister Ben Wallace told the British House of Commons in October that one of the two Russian Su-27 fighters that intercepted the RC-135 surveillance plane off the coast of Crimea “released a missile” at a distance, according to the Washington Post. 
He attributed it to a “technical malfunction,” and said he’d spoken to his Russian counterparts about the incident.

But the mid-air scuffle appears to have been more serious than that, according to one of the leaked documents circulating online, the Washington Post reported. 
That document referred to the incident as a “near-shoot down of UK RJ,” which is a reference to a commonly-used nickname for the British spy plane, the report said.

Russia experts are divided on whether the FBI recruiting effort will prove successful 
The FBI has turned to social media to help it ramp up its Russian recruitment and intelligence gathering as the war in Ukraine continues to rage with no end in sight. 
It's a move receiving mixed reviews from Russia experts.

In a video posted to Facebook and Twitter, scenes from the U.S. capital and the Russian embassy are displayed as a voice speaking in Russian tells the listener that the FBI can change their future if they can provide the U.S. with intelligence. 
 The narrator says the FBI is looking for spies, expats and anyone with information on countering the Kremlin.

WNU Editor: Cannot say that I am surprised. The U.S. is in an undeclared war against Russia, and this conflict is only  growing and escalating. There are currently a few million Russian nationals living in the US, and the FBI clearly wants to watch and track who they are, and what they are doing.]]></summary>

Defense One: NATO Plans Record Air Exercise as Finland Joins Alliance

 
Air Defender 2023 exercise will include 100 U.S. aircraft, 2,000 troops, in “largest transatlantic movement” the Air National Guard has ever done. 
As NATO brings Finland into the fold, the U.S. and Germany are preparing for the largest deployment of U.S. air forces to Europe since the formation of the U.S.-led security alliance. 
The upcoming exercise, Air Defender 2023, will test the Air National Guard’s “ability to rapidly deploy and rapidly employ [forces],” similar to what the United States would have to do if the Ukraine war spreads to NATO, said Lt. Gen. Michael Loh, director of the Air National Guard. “It is the largest transatlantic movement we've done.” 
The Air National Guard, which maintains units for “prompt mobilization during war” in addition to its role in homeland defense, will send about 100 aircraft to Germany for the 10-day exercise in June, Loh said during a press conference Tuesday. The exercise will include aircraft the U.S. is about to retire, such as A-10s and F-15Cs, as well as new aircraft, such as F-35s, upgraded F-16s, and KC-46s, Loh said.

Politico: Biden’s informal review of Saudi Arabia 
The Biden administration just can’t quit Saudi Arabia.

After Riyadh-led OPEC+ cut oil production last year, a move that would bulge Russia’s wallet, the administration promised to reevaluate the state of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. 
President JOE BIDEN even threatened “consequences” for the kingdom, a signal that the decadeslong cozy relationship was poised for a downgrade. 
Many months later, there haven’t been any consequences or shifts. CIA Director WILLIAM BURNS even made an unannounced visit to Saudi this week to reaffirm close intelligence ties between Washington and Riyadh. 
The reason is that the administration never actually conducted a formal review, per multiple U.S. officials NatSec Daily spoke to. There were numerous inter-agency discussions and sensitive diplomatic conversations during the course of the normal policy making process. But there was neither a determined start to the reevaluation, nor will there be an end. It’s an ongoing, amorphous conversation.

Israeli jets hit Syrian military targets on Sunday in response to rockets launched towards Israeli controlled territory overnight, Israel’s military said, as violence flared again following cross-border exchanges of fire during the week. 
State media in Syria reported explosions in the vicinity of the capital Damascus as Israel said its forces continued to hit Syrian territory after six rockets were fired overnight towards the Golan Heights. 
Israel said artillery and drone strikes hit the rocket launchers and were followed by airstrikes against a Syrian army compound, military radar systems and artillery posts.

US show of force comes as Pentagon extends aircraft carrier deployment following last month's lethal attack by Iran-backed militias on US personnel in Syria. 
The US Navy deployed a nuclear-powered submarine capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Middle East waters via the Suez Canal, a spokesperson revealed Saturday. 
The Pentagon's rare disclosure of the location of one of its Ohio-class submarines came amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran after an American military contractor was killed by a drone attack on a US base in Syria last month. 
The USS Florida arrived in the region before transiting the canal on Friday "to help ensure regional maritime security and stability," Cdr. Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for the US Navy's 5th Fleet, told Al-Monitor via email.

Middle East Eye: US leaked documents allege Mossad urged protests against Netanyahu's reforms

 
Israel vehemently denies reports which suggest that Washington spied on its ally 
Leaked US intelligence documents allege that the Israeli spy body Mossad secretly encouraged people to join protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed judicial overhaul. 
The documents, dating back to "early to mid-February", state that Mossad's leadership had "advocated for Mossad officials and Israeli citizens to protest the new Israeli government's proposed judicial reforms including several explicit calls to action that decried the Israeli government". 
The intelligence memo does not state who made the order to encourage Mossad employees and civilians to join the protests but notes that the intelligence came from signals intelligence - meaning the US spied on its closest ally in the region.

This act of mercy is being hailed as a powerful source of inspiration and a symbol of the enduring resilience of the Yemeni people.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York Times/DNYUZ: Leaked Documents Reveal Depth of U.S. Spy Efforts and Russia’s Military Struggles 
WASHINGTON — A trove of leaked Pentagon documents reveals how deeply Russia’s security and intelligence services have been penetrated by the United States, demonstrating Washington’s ability to warn Ukraine about planned strikes and providing an assessment of the strength of Moscow’s war machine.

Politico:  Macron fails to move Xi Jinping over Russia’s war on Ukraine

 
French leader also commits diplomatic faux pas at Beijing press conference. 
BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping showed no sign of changing his position over Russia’s war on Ukraine after talks Thursday with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. 
On the second day of Macron’s state visit to China, Xi took his long-standing line on Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — saying that “all sides” have “reasonable security concerns” — and gave no hint he would use his influence to help end the conflict. 
“China is willing to jointly appeal with France to the international community to remain rational and calm,” was as far as the Chinese leader would go during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

WNU Editor: French President Macron And EU President Ursula von der Leyen belief that they could go to Beijing and change Chinese President X's mind on Russia just two weeks after President Xi told Russian President Putin that together they were going to make changes on a global level not seen in 100 years is baffling to me. 
And it gets worse from there. 
French President Macron talked more than twice as long as President Xi, and even more during the press conference. EU President Ursula von der Leyen's just issued threats .... Ursula von der Leyen warns China not to send arms to Russia (The Guardian). 
The media optics showed both European leaders doing a lot of talking, but were they listening? My gut says no. 
But what was really telling is that every-time Macron brought up Ukraine, you can tell by President Xi's sighs that he wanted to discuss other issues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a further attempt to rein in increasing numbers of women defying the compulsory dress code, Iranian authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalize unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.
After they have been identified, violators will receive “warning text messages as to the consequences”, police said in a statement.
The move is aimed at “preventing resistance against the hijab law,” said the statement, carried by the judiciary’s Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes the country’s spiritual image and spreads insecurity.
A growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in the custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the revolt.
Still, risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media.
Saturday's police statement called on owners of businesses to “seriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections”.
Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest.
Describing the veil as "one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation" and “one of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic,” an Interior Ministry statement said on March 30 that there would be no retreat on the issue.
It urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives have in past decades emboldened hardliners to attack women. Last week a viral video showed a man throwing yoghurt at two unveiled women in a shop.

"For me, it's important to call it out and bring it out and address these threats every day," Simon told AFP in a recent phone interview.
She added: "I felt that because the comments directed at me became personal and attacked my identity that it was enough to open up the conversation in Canada."
Simon, a former diplomat and native rights activist, is the first member of the country's Indigenous community to serve as the representative of the British crown and the official head of state.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine's leaders discussed ways to prevent leaks of military information on Friday after secret documents detailing U.S. and NATO efforts to help the country plan a counter-offensive against Russia's invasion reportedly appeared on social media.
The New York Times said on Thursday, citing senior U.S. officials, that classified war documents were posted this week on Twitter and Telegram, which is widely used in Russia.
A Ukrainian official told Reuters the documents contained a "very large amount of fictitious information" and the posts looked like a Russian disinformation operation to sow doubts about the offensive, which requires advanced Western weapons.

Washington (AFP) - The United States is preparing long-term assistance for the Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo as concerns rise that jihadist violence in the Sahel could spill into coastal West Africa, officials said.
Speaking to AFP, the officials said Western support was also critical to halting Russia's Wagner mercenary group which has made major inroads in violence-torn Sahel countries, including by allying with Mali's military junta.
Vice President Kamala Harris, visiting Ghana last month as part of a growing US push in Africa, promised $100 million over 10 years to reinforce resilience in coastal West Africa. State Department officials are also looking at additional funding …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, freed from a US jail last year, on Friday urged US ex-president Donald Trump to seek refuge in Russia as his life was "in peril".
Bout, also known as the "Merchant of Death", was swapped for US basketball star Britney Griner in a high-profile prisoner exchange between Moscow and Washington in December.
"I believe your life is in peril," Bout wrote in a telegram sent to Trump and shown to the press in Moscow.
"The Biden administration will not stop just by dragging you through the court/prison industrial complex," he said, referring to Trump's successor Joe Biden.
"They would sooner end your life than let you stand in their way."
Bout told Trump, whom he has long admired, that he would find a "safe haven and from here you can lead the fight for the American people."
Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in a US prison when he was swapped for Griner. He has since joined a Russian nationalist party.
Accused of arming rebels in some of the world's bloodiest conflicts, Bout was arrested in Thailand in a US sting operation in 2008, extradited to the United States and sentenced in 2012.
Washington and Moscow have in recent years held several prisoner exchanges.
There are still several Americans held in Russia.
Last week, Russia arrested US journalist Evan Gershkovich and charged him with espionage, provoking an international outcry.
Washington has called the charges against him "ridiculous."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin had an awkward moment when he finished a speech and was met by silence and no applause, Newsweek reported. 
The moment, shared online by his critics, occurred on Wednesday at the Grand Kremlin Palace during a ceremony to present diplomatic credentials to 17 newly-appointed foreign ambassadors.
"In his speech, Putin singled out the new United States and European Union ambassadors, and said they were responsible for a breakdown in relations with Russia following his decision to invade Ukraine last February," Newsweek's report stated. "Addressing new U.S. ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, Putin indicated that U.S. support for a Ukraine revolution in 2014 'ultimately led to today's Ukrainian crisis.'" 
At the end of the speech, Putin's eyes scanned the room, seemingly waiting for applause which never came.

"No one applauded Putin after he finished his speech at the ceremony of ambassadors presenting their credentials in the Kremlin," Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, wrote in a tweet that included the video. "Putin waited for applause as he finished talking but none came."
"This is a delicious moment. Putin clearly expected a polite applause, but he received none. The ambassadors—some having been scolded—expected at least a hand shake, and they got none," Swedish economist Anders Åslund wrote on Twitter. "Just shows that no need to maintain any embassies or ambassadors in Moscow. Go home!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow has formally charged US journalist Evan Gershkovich with espionage, Russian news agencies reported Friday, adding that he had denied the accusations.
The arrest of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich prompted an outcry from media outlets and rights groups, as well as government officials in Washington.
"FSB investigators charged Gershkovich with espionage in the interests of his country," Russian state-run agency TASS said, citing a law enforcement source.
"He categorically denied all accusations and stated that he was engaged in journalistic activities in Russia," TASS said.
Gershkovich's arrest is seen as a serious escalation of Moscow's crackdown on the media.
His publication, one of the most prestigious in the United States, "vehemently denies the allegations" against its "trusted and dedicated reporter".
The case has been classified as secret, limiting the amount of information available.
His arrest also comes as Moscow's relationship with Washington has been severely downgraded because of the Ukraine offensive.
Washington has long accused Moscow of arbitrarily arresting Americans in order to secure the release of detained Russians.
US President Joe Biden called for Gershkovich's release on Friday, the White House calling the accusations against him "ridiculous".
Russia said on Thursday it was "pointless" to try to pressure Moscow over the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi vowed on Friday to survive another stint in hospital, as the 86-year-old media mogul showed signs of improvement as he received treatment for leukemia and a lung infection.
The billionaire, a larger-than-life figure who has dominated Italian public life for decades, was admitted Wednesday to the intensive care cardiac unit at Milan's San Raffaele Hospital.
On Friday, the Berlusconi-owned newspaper, Il Giornale, ran a front-page photo of a younger, beaming "Cavaliere" from a past election campaign, with the headline, "I won't give in."
"It's tough, but I'll make it this time too," Berlusconi was quoted as telling the newspaper from his hospital bed.

Smoke from forest fires and farmers burning crop stubble has blanketed the popular tourist destination in recent weeks.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha held video talks with the leaders of neighboring Myanmar and Laos to discuss the problem, which affects large areas of southeast Asia every year.
Thailand has been choking on heavy air pollution since the start of the year, caused in part by seasonal agricultural burning.
Nearly two million people have needed hospital treatment for respiratory conditions caused by air pollution this year, according to the public health ministry.

Mount Everest's main expedition season is about to begin, and yet planned climbs are being undermined by delays in the transport of supplies for mountaineers.
Helicopters are currently only flying large items of equipment - such as large tents and tables - to the base camp of the world's highest mountain on the instructions of the local government.
Food, ropes, gas for cooking and medical equipment, for example, will be carried up by local porters or on animals, Tashi Lhamu Sherpa, the deputy mayor of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality, told dpa ahead of the start of climbing season in April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - U.S. agents arrested a retired Salvadoran military officer this week on charges of participating in a brutal massacre of civilians during El Salvador's grinding civil war in the 1980s, according to a statement on Thursday.
Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Roberto Garay on Tuesday in the state of New Jersey, the agency said.
Garay served as section commander of a special military unit known as the Atlacatl Battalion from 1981 to 1985.
Retired Salvadoran general Juan Rafael Bustillo acknowledged in 2020 that Atlacatl was responsible for the notorious 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which more than 1,000 villagers, mostly women and children, were slaughtered.
The battalion carried out extrajudicial executions at El Mozote, as well as in three other massacres in which "hundreds of noncombatant civilians" were killed, ICE said.
Garay then "willfully" misrepresented his involvement in the massacre from an immigration application he had submitted, according to the statement.
Reuters was not immediately able to locate Garay's lawyer.
One of several bloody Central American conflicts linked to the Cold War, El Salvador's 1980-1992 civil war pitted the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels against the army of the U.S.-backed right-wing government.
The war left some 75,000 dead and another 8,000 missing.
Touting the agency's investigation team that aims to hold accused war criminals accountable, ICE stressed that individuals like Garay must be investigated, prosecuted and expelled from the United States.
"Individuals who have committed atrocities overseas will not find safe haven in the United States," Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security John K. Tien said in the statement.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) -Israel's military hit sites in Lebanon and Gaza early on Friday, in retaliation for rocket attacks it blamed on the Islamist group Hamas, as tensions following police raids this week on the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem threatened to spiral out of control.
Loud blasts rocked different areas of Gaza, as Israel said its jets hit 10 targets including tunnels and weapons manufacturing and development sites of Hamas, which controls the blockaded southern coastal strip.
At around 4.00 a.m., the military said it had also struck three Hamas infrastructure targets in southern Lebanon, where residents around the area of the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern city of Tyre reported three loud blasts.

“Our president has become a war criminal,” he said. “It’s time to end this war and stop being silent.”
It isn't a recent defection, Karakulov fled in October 2022, and has been in hiding. Karakulov was a captain in the Federal Protection Service before defecting to the west.

        <updated>2023-04-06T17:03:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protesters started a fire at one of French President Emmanuel Macron's favorite restaurants in Paris on Thursday during clashes with riot police at the upmarket left-bank brasserie.
Staff at La Rotonde in the Montparnasse area of the city were forced to put out flames on the awning of the restaurant where Macron held a victory party during his successful 2017 election bid.
An AFP journalist saw a group of men dressed in black fire fireworks and throw stones in the direction of the eatery.
The fire was caused by a flare thrown on to the fabric awning, with firefighters needed to extinguish it.
Ranks of riot police formed to protect the business on the 11th day of national protests and strikes against Macron's widely unpopular bid to increase the retirement age to 64 from 62.
The red velour sofas and soft lighting of La Rotonde, a Belle Epoque hang-out once frequented by Picasso, have long been a favorite of Macron and his wife Brigitte.
The former investment banker held strategy meetings there as he prepared his bid for the presidency in 2017 and has been known to eat there with his wife since winning power.
In a decision criticized as elitist by his opponents at the time, Macron used La Rotonde to host staff and political allies for a party after he topped the first round of voting in 2017.
The restaurant has been targeted before because of its association with the 45-year-old president.
In 2020, during violent anti-government protests by so-called "Yellow Vests", a suspected arson attack left its entrance damaged.
"When there are marches and so on, you hear people saying 'Death to the Rotonde, Death to Macron'," Gerard Tafanel, who owns the bistro with his brother Serge, told AFP at the time.
"It happens all the time: anonymous phone calls, people who enter in the middle of the day saying 'Death to Macron'."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
