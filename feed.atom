New York CNN Business  — The Federal Reserve’s war on inflation isn’t just painful for home buyers and people with credit card debt. Uncle Sam is getting squeezed by higher borrowing costs, too. 
The cost to finance America’s growing mountain of debt is rising rapidly as the Fed scrambles to put out the inflation fire by raising interest rates and shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. 
During fiscal 2022 alone, the federal government made $475 billion in net interest payments, up from $352 billion the prior year, according to the US Treasury Department. For context, that’s more than the government spent on veterans’ benefits and transportation – combined. And it’s nearly as much as the $677 billion spent on education.

Update #1: The Government Is Set To Spend More On Debt Payments Than The Entire Defense Budget (Daily Caller) 
Update #2: Federal interest payments soar, soon will exceed cost of entire defense budget (Convention of States)   
WNU Editor: If current trends continue, one can easily see interest payments becoming the biggest expense in the US Federal budget by 2030.]]></summary>

Maria Zakharova stressed that such developments was "a deliberate pursuit of a destructive course toward escalation of tensions in the Euro-Arctic region and the final destruction of Russian-Norwegian relations" and this was not Moscow's choice 
MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. Russia perceives Norway's military preparations near its borders as a course on escalation of tensions in the region, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday. 
"Foreign military bases actually appeared in Norway on a permanent basis. The corresponding infrastructure has been modernized, modern equipment is being purchased, and Oslo is now among the most active supporters of NATO's involvement in the Arctic," she said, 
"We consider such developments near Russian borders as Oslo's deliberate pursuit of a destructive course toward escalation of tensions in the Euro-Arctic region and the final destruction of Russian-Norwegian relations."

 Joint Chiefs of Staff says flights all occurred north of Tactical Action Line as US-ROK air drills continue 
The South Korean military detected around 180 “trails” from North Korean warplanes across the country on Friday, according to Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), leading the ROK air force to scramble around 80 F-35A and other fighter jets in response in a show of its “dominant air power.” 
JCS did not specify precisely how many DPRK planes took part in the drills, which come during a week of escalating tensions on the peninsula and a day after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that reportedly failed in flight over the East Sea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: Biden shrinks Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lowest level since 1980s 
The Biden administration is on pace to dump millions of barrels of crude oil on the market, shrinking the nation's oil reserve to its low level since 1984.   
Why it matters: Biden's decision to tap into the reserve may have helped lower gasoline prices from their $5 highs in June.   
Context: The Biden administration hasn't been shy about authorizing oil releases. 
* Biden announced in mid-October that he would authorize the release of more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in December as a way to bring down gas prices. 
* He said 15 million barrels would be released as part of the 180 million barrels that had been announced earlier in 2022.

OCEANSIDE, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday vowed to "free" Iran, and said that demonstrators working against the country's government would soon succeed in freeing themselves. 
"Don't worry, we're gonna free Iran. They’re gonna free themselves pretty soon," Biden said during a wide-ranging campaign speech in California, as dozens of demonstrators gathered outside holding banners supporting Iranian protesters.

CNN: Exclusive: Iran is seeking Russia’s help to bolster its nuclear program, US intel officials believe 
Iran is seeking Russia’s help to bolster its nuclear program, US intelligence officials believe, as Tehran looks for a backup plan should a lasting nuclear deal with world powers fail to materialize. 
The intelligence suggests that Iran has been asking Russia for help acquiring additional nuclear materials and with nuclear fuel fabrication, sources briefed on the matter said. The fuel could help Iran power its nuclear reactors and could potentially further shorten Iran’s so-called “breakout time” to create a nuclear weapon. 
Experts emphasized to CNN, however, that the nuclear proliferation risk varies depending on which reactor the fuel is used for. And it is also not clear whether Russia has agreed to help – the Kremlin has long been outwardly opposed to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The venerable M1 Abrams has been America’s core main battle tank for more than 40 years, thanks to a long series of incremental upgrades that have allowed it to remain one of the world’s most fearsome pieces of armor. 
But as foreign militaries roll out next-generation smart tanks that shoot, move, and communicate on a different plane than their predecessors, General Dynamics is premiering AbramsX: an Abrams for a new era of warfighting. 
A demonstrator version of the tank made its debut on the show floor of the Association of the United States Army’s annual meeting this month. 
Painted in an eye-catching grey-and-black sawtooth color scheme, AbramsX aims to address some of the Army’s longstanding beefs with the M1, while building in cutting-edge technology and protection including AI and drone launchers.

Breaking Defense: Hypersonics too expensive, industrial base too small for services to go it alone: Admiral  
A recent test of the joint Navy-Army system that the Navy calls Conventional Prompt Strike suffered a partial failure in a June test, but that's because Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe said the service "pushed the envelope... learned a lot."  
WASHINGTON — The cost of developing hypersonic weapons combined with the relatively small industrial base means it isn’t viable for the Navy to go it alone on developing the much-sought-after capabilities, a senior officer argued Tuesday. 
Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, director of the service’s strategic systems program office, told attendees here at the Naval Submarine League one of the lessons learned from the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike program, a hypersonic weapon being developed jointly with the Army, is that such high-end weapons are too costly for one service to take the full brunt of the price.

Mish Talk: Hoot of the Day: Russian Oil Gets to US Via Sanction Loophole 
I describe the round-trip process in which Russian oil refined in Italy makes its way to to the US. It's a real hoot. 
Sanction Avoidance Process 
* US sanctions are on crude oil, not refined products. 
* Lukoil, Russia's second largest oil and gas company was not sanctioned by the US. 
* Lukoil's refinery in Sicily is the second largest in Italy and fifth largest in Europe. 
* A Lukoil refinery in Italy once processed crude from multiple countries. Now it inputs are 93 percent from Russia. 
* After refining, the country of origin is Italy, not Russia. This is due to longstanding practice of changing the country of origin to where oil is refined.

(Reuters) - A new nuclear-powered submarine that is soon set to enter service with the Russian navy has successfully fired a ballistic missile as part of final testing, the defence ministry said on Thursday.
In a statement, the ministry said the Generalissimus Suvorov had launched a Bulava intercontinental missile in the northern White Sea with a dummy payload that reached a test site in the Far East Russian region of Kamchatka.  The Bulava is designed to carry a nuclear warhead. 
The Generalissimus Suvorov is the second Borei-A class submarine to be built. Moscow says it is equipped with cutting-edge navigation, radio engineering, sonar, and missile and torpedo weaponry systems.

— Prometheus (@PrometheusNRx) November 3, 2022
    Market Watch: Hedge fund giant Elliott warns looming hyperinflation could lead to ‘global societal collapse’     
"Investors should not assume they have ‘seen everything’” 
That was from executives at leading hedge fund Elliott Management, who warned that the world is heading towards the worst financial crisis since World War II. 
In a letter sent to investors, and seen by the Financial Times, the Florida-headquartered firm told clients that they believe the global economy is in an “extremely challenging” situation which could lead to hyperinflation. Elliott did not respond to MarketWatch’s request for comment.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: Key points from the Hedge Fund Elliott are the following:   
.... the world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war 
.... hyperinflation could lead to “global societal collapse and civil or international strife” 
For the past week I have been reading doom and gloom forecasts from funds that have a lot of "skin in the game. This is just one more doom and gloom report but what makes it unique is that it is on the front page of the Financial Times!!!! And hedge Fund Elliott is a multi-billion dollar fund with a very good track record.
As to what is my take.
I do not see a "global societal collapse".  But I do see very hard times for a lot of countries around the world, and hard times for us in the West.]]></summary>

North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), prompting the United States and South Korea to extend air drills that have angered Pyongyang.
Beginning shortly before midnight on Thursday, South Korea's military said it had detected more than 80 artillery rounds fired into the sea by North Korea, in what it says is a violation of a 2018 inter-Korean agreement.
The South issued a warning communication to the North over the firing, the South Kor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UN General Assembly, shown here in October, voted overwhelmingly to condemn the US embargo of Cuba, with only the US and Israel voting against [File: David 'Dee' Delgado/Reuters]   
Axios: UN votes to condemn U.S. embargo of Cuba 
The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted 185-2 to condemn the U.S. embargo of Cuba for the 30th year in a row.   
Why it matters: Although UN resolutions are non-binding and aren't legally enforceable, they carry political weight by illustrating the isolation of the U.S. position and the heft of global opinion against it.   
State of play: Only the U.S. and Israel voted to oppose the resolution, while Brazil and Ukraine abstained, AP reported. 
* Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla addressed the UNGA ahead of the vote, calling the embargo a "deliberate act of economic warfare with the purpose of preventing financial income to the country, destroying the government's ability to meet the needs of the population, causing the economy to collapse and creating a situation of ungovernability." 
* Since 2019, the U.S. has "escalated the siege against our country to an extreme dimension, more cruel and inhumane, to deliberately inflict the greatest possible damage to Cuban families," Rodríguez added.

WNU Editor: The U.S. and Israel were the two countries that voted against this UN resolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Republicans take LEAD in deep-blue Miami in early-voting midterm stunner - as Latinos dump Democrats in droves and push DeSantis towards emphatic victory in another dire sign for Biden 
* Republicans voters in Florida are using early voting in larger numbers than Democrats, including in the deep blue city of Miami 
* It's a good sign for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term 
* Miami voting numbers also indicate Hispanics are coming out in droves for GOP 
* In Florida, 3.58 million registered voters have voted early overall, according to the United States Elections Project 
* And 44% of those have been Republican voters; 38% are  Democrats 
* In Miami-Dade, nearly 27% of GOP voters had voted by Wednesday, compared to 21% of Democrats 
Republicans voters in Florida are using early voting in larger numbers than Democrats, including in the deep blue city of Miami, a sign of high enthusiasm among the GOP and a troubling indicator for President Joe Biden's party. 
The number of registered Republicans voting early in Miami-Dade County surpassed Democrats on Wednesday – one day after Biden visited the area to campaign for his party's candidates amid concerns the GOP will win control of the House in next week's midterm election. 
It's a good sign for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term, and for GOP Senator Marco Rubio, who's also running for re-election.

WNU Editor: These early voting numbers are shocking. Miami-Dade county is a Democrat stronghold. This should not be happening. Is this poll correct? We will find out in five days.   
Update: It looks like this trip by President Biden to Florida two days has backfired .... Biden rallies Florida Democrats despite signs of red wave (Politico).]]></summary>

A surprise deal announced Wednesday promises peace but doesn’t offer much detail.
 One of the world’s current deadliest conflicts and worst humanitarian crises could be moving toward a close.
On Wednesday, the Ethiopian federal government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) came to an agreement to permanently halt hostilities in a civil war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions, pushed regions in the north to the brink of famine, and altered Ethiopia’s standing in the international community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Presidential Executive Office of Russia  
War On The Rocks: Don’t Expect Any More Russian Help on the Iran Nuclear Deal 
Russia’s position on Iran’s nuclear program has always lagged behind its confrontation with the West. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow actively supported diplomatic efforts to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. After the invasion, Russia initially disrupted these efforts, but soon reverted to a more neutral stance.

This is bad news for U.S. efforts to restore the Iran nuclear deal and bad news for the cause of global nonproliferation more broadly.

WNU Editor: Russia's focus is elsewhere. Helping put together an Iran nuclear deal is not one of them. But Russia is not alone. The U.S. is walking away from putting an Iran nuclear deal right now .... U.S. "not going to waste time" on Iran deal right now, official says (Axios). More here ....

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), prompting the United States and South Korea to extend air drills that have angered Pyongyang.

LAHORE (Reuters) -Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was shot in the shin on Thursday when his anti-government protest convoy came under attack in the east of the country in what his aides said was a clear assassination attempt by his rivals.
Khan, ousted as prime minister in a parliamentary confidence vote in April, was six days into a protest procession bound for Islamabad, standing and waving to thousands of cheering supporters from the roof of a container truck, when the shots rang out.
Several in his convoy were wounded in the attack in Wazirabad, nearly 200 km (120 miles) from the capital. Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said a suspect had been arrested.

TASS: Kiev preparing ‘dirty bomb’ with West’s participation, security chief warns 
"We express a very serious concern over this clearly dangerous situation that threatens to turn into a global disaster, if it is not stopped," Nikolay Patrushev warned 
MOSCOW, November 3. /TASS/. Kiev is putting together a ‘dirty bomb’ with the West’s participation and the situation will turn into a disaster if it is not stopped, Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Nikolay Patrushev said at a meeting of CIS security chiefs on Thursday. 
"According to the available data, Ukraine is carrying out work to create a ‘dirty’ nuclear charge. We believe that this process is taking place with the participation of Western patrons. In this regard, we express a very serious concern over this clearly dangerous situation that threatens to turn into a global catastrophe, if it is not stopped," the Russian security chief warned.

WNU Editor: Nikolay Patrushev is IMHO second to Putin on who is ruling Russia. I interpret his remarks as an indirect warning to the U.K., and to the U.S.. That if a dirty bomb is used, the Kremlin will be blaming London and Washington DC. 
He did not stop there.  Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev also made it very clear that the only country that benefited from the Nord Stream attacks was the U.S. .... Nord Stream terrorist attacks chiefly benefit US, says Russian security chief (Artsakh Press). He also gave his own reasons on why certain countries in the West are pursuing a policy of confrontation .... Global crisis sparked by West’s desire to impose its dominance, says top Russian official (TASS). More here ....

 Insider: Putin says he hasn't decided on a 2024 presidential run, a power move that a Russia expert says is how he keeps opposition 'off balance' 
* Putin still hasn't decided if he'll run for president in 2024, his spokesperson said.

* But keeping people guessing is standard practice for Putin, a Russia expert told Insider. 
President Vladimir Putin has not yet decided if he'll run in Russia's 2024 presidential election, his top spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Nothing in this world is a sure thing anymore.]]></summary>

Business Standard: As China-US ties worsen, Hong Kong bankers fear for their careers 
The defiant tone President Xi Jinping took toward the US got those hardworking financiers scared. 
It was supposed to be a big celebration for Hong Kong. This week’s Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, organized by the city’s central bank, was meant to showcase the revival of Hong Kong as Asia’s financial hub, after years of isolation that resulted from stringent Covid controls.

WNU Editor: Being one who has visited Hong Kong dozens of times since the 1980s, I know Hong Kong will always remain Hong Kong. But as a major financial hub for Asia .... under the rule of Xi I think those days are coming to an end.

What also does not help Hong Kong's future is that Beijing wants Shanghai to be the financial hub, and I think they are going to succeed at the expense of Hong Kong.]]></summary>

Gizmodo: After 3 Months in Space, China's Mysterious Spaceplane Ejects Unknown Object 
China's inaugural spaceplane mission in 2020 lasted for only two days, but this one just keeps on going. 
The saga of China’s spaceplane continues as the experimental vehicle just released a mystery object that’s now closely trailing behind in low Earth orbit. 
On Monday, the United States Space Force’s 18th Space Defense Squadron tracked an object in a similar orbit to the spaceplane, SpaceNews first reported. The object appeared to be very close to the spaceplane. So close, in fact, that the Space Force unit had to make sure it was a separate object before it was entered into the database as such. The object may have been ejected earlier from the spaceplane, perhaps between October 24 to 30, but it got added to the database on October 31, according to a tweet by Robert Christy from Orbital Focus.

Forecasters warned that the tourist-popular coast of Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula should continue monitoring the situation as the maximum sustained winds decreased to around 45 mph (75 kph).

National Interest: U.S. Forces Deployed to Ukraine to Fight Weapons Smuggling 

A “small number” of U.S. military forces are performing onsite inspections of weapons caches in Ukraine to ensure military aid to Kyiv is being properly accounted for, a senior U.S. defense official told journalists earlier this week.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russian attacks were reported across large areas of Ukraine on Thursday, with heavy shelling in numerous regions damaging infrastructure, including electricity supplies to Europe's largest nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said.
The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days' worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said.

Remix: Some weapons destined for Ukraine ending up with Finnish criminals  
Weapons sent to Ukraine are finding their way across Europe 
Organized crime is on the rise in Finland, and there’s a high demand for weapons. Criminal networks have already established weapon smuggling routes between Finland and Poland. 
Europol, the European police cooperation organization, is reported to have warned in the summer that armed criminal groups could soon start smuggling weapons from Ukraine to EU member states. 
According to Christer Ahlgren, superintendent of the Organized Crime Intelligence Unit of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (Keskusrikospoliisi, KRP), Europol’s prediction has already become a reality in Finland: 
“We are seeing signs that these weapons are already in Finland, (…) and we have already seen signs that weapons delivered to Ukraine have been found in Finland,” Ahlgren says.

My personal concern is on shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles. Even before the war Ukraine was one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Coupled with the country also being one of the poorest in Europe, especially now, the temptation for someone to sell weapons like a shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile to a terror organization for a few tens of thousands of dollars is a temptation that I am sure some would take.]]></summary>

SEOUL (Reuters) - "Dad, I'm going out" were the last words Jung Hae-moon heard his daughter utter, at the end of a chat they had on the telephone on Saturday as she turned down an invitation to dinner.
Hours later, 30-year-old Jung Joo-hee was among 156 people, most of them in their teens and twenties, killed in the South Korean capital as they celebrated Halloween free of COVID restrictions for the first time in three years.
On Thursday, the young woman's family buried her ashes in a peaceful family plot outside Seoul, with a planted sapling and bouquets by her grave stone, in a sombre ceremony of prayers and tears.
"Rest well. Mum and dad will come see you," Jung Hae-moon said as the family stood by, together with his daughter's pet poodle.

The nation's overseas spy chief has warned that Australian intelligence agencies are likely to face heavier responsibilities as Western nations grapple with an increasingly assertive and powerful China. 
The director-general of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Paul Symon, who is due to retire shortly, gave a wide-ranging speech to the National Security College in Canberra earlier this week. 
Mr Symon said that during the Cold War the "batting order" among Western intelligence agencies was clear, with the United States taking the lead, followed next by the United Kingdom, and then Canada and Australia after that.

Dan Sabbagh, The Guardian: Could Ukraine’s drone attack on Russian ships herald a new type of warfare? 
Use of boat drone appeared to demonstrate how effective these nimble and relatively cheap weapons can be  It had all the thrill of a daring commando raid, filmed live. 
But Saturday’s dawn raid on Russia’s Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol was not carried out by elite soldiers, but by 16 drones, nine in the air and seven at sea – prompting questions as to whether the attack represented a revolutionary moment in the history of warfare. 
Three years ago, it was Dominic Cummings, before his eventful tenure at Downing St, who wrote “A teenager will be able to deploy a drone from their smartphone to sink one of these multibillion-dollar platforms,” a reference to the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers, built at a total cost of £6.4bn.

The difference now is that the attack at Sevastopol shows that it can be done remotely with unmanned speedboats, and in swarms. If Sevastopol was not at a war-time footing, the damage that these suicide speedboats could have done would have been incredible. 
The big fear that I have now is that terrorist organizations are taking note. The damage that such an attack can have on a major port in the world, especially if an LNG installation is targeted, would be enormous.]]></summary>

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that he had secured Moscow’s commitment to resurrect a deal safeguarding Ukrainian grain shipments, one that has been crucial to sustaining food supplies to developing nations amid the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. 
The deal, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July to guarantee the safe passage of cargo ships to and from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports after Russia’s invasion disrupted export operations, setting off widespread worries about global food security.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland will build a razor-wire fence on its border with Russia's Kaliningrad, its defence minister said on Wednesday, amid concerns that the enclave might become a conduit for illegal migration. 
Construction of the temporary 2.5-metre (8ft) high and 3-metre deep barrier will start immediately, Mariusz Blaszczak told a news conference. 
With tensions rising due to the war in Ukraine, he cited security concerns and referred to a crisis triggered last autumn when thousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants tried to cross the Belarus border into Poland, some of whom died.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Days before the polls close in the 2022 midterm elections, actions by Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are already being seen through the prism of the expected 2024 GOP presidential nomination contest.
DeSantis is starring in a new ad for GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who is facing an uncharacteristically tough re-election in deep-red Utah as he's being challenged by independent Evan McMullin, who won Lee's vote for president in 2016.
The ad, paid for by the far-right Club for Growth, is the first out-of-state ad featuring DeSantis backing a fellow Republican, according to Breitbart News.
Trump then re-endorsed Lee in a statement posted to his Truth Social website.

One person was found with gunshot wounds and was taken to the hospital and later died. Another teen boy was taken to the hospital but his condition is not known. 
Toronto Police Service (TPS) duty inspector Lori Kranenburg said that both victims are believed to be teenagers but she could not confirm if either victim was a student at the school. 
“It appears that there were several shots fired, but I don’t have an exact number. At this time we’re reviewing video and canvassing the area,” Kranenburg said.
Video circulating online apparently shows the events that led up to the shooting. The video shows one person backing away as three people walk towards him while words are exchanged. Shots then ring out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's new prime minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday announced he will join the UN climate conference in Egypt after all, having provoked anger for refusing to attend the global event early into his tenure.
Sunak had argued that "pressing domestic commitments" would keep him away from COP27 in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh -- after inheriting an economic crisis from predecessor Liz Truss.
But that fuelled doubts about Sunak's interest in the planetary emergency, and critics said the inexperienced leader was passing up an opportunity to rub shoulders with the likes of US President Joe Biden and European peers.
"There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy without investing in renewables," Sunak wrote on Twitter.
"That is why I will attend @C…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran Israeli politician Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on the cusp of returning to power Wednesday, with initial election results showing his alliance with the extreme right taking a narrow lead.
With around 84 percent of the vote counted at 0755 GMT, according to the Central Elections Committee, Netanyahu could be set for a dramatic comeback.
"We are close to a big victory," he told supporters of his right-wing Likud party at a rally early Wednesday.
But his main rival, caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, told his own supporters in Tel Aviv that "nothing is decided", and that his centrist Yesh Atid party "will wait patiently... for the final results".
The two rivals are vying for a majority coalition in Israel’s 120-seat parliament, with initial results putting Netanyahu’s bloc ahead aft…]]></summary>

The ruins of their village of Bilozirka stretched along a rutted road beyond which lay trenches and artillery pieces locked in Ukraine's battle for Kherson.
The Russians have been firing salvos from the south end of the road ever since being routed and retreating from the village in the first month of war in March.
The Ukrainians have been trying to press a more recent counteroffensive past the Russian positions into areas around the Crimea peninsula the Kremlin seized in 2014.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro once took a stab at predicting the outcome of his 2022 re-election bid: "Prison, death or victory."
Victory it was not. Death came in the form of an end to his presidency, which he grudgingly accepted Tuesday -- two days after the election was declared for his opponent.
And prison?
"You can be sure that option... does not exist," the far-right leader told members of his crucial evangelical support base in August 2021.
Analysts, however, believe a future behind bars may be a very real prospect for the bellicose Bolsonaro, even if it may take years.
Almost from the start of his controversial mandate in 2019, Bolsonaro racked up accusations and investigations for everything from spreading disinformation to crimes against humanity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea's military said.
The launch comes after Pyongyang on Tuesday demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, calling them a provocation that may draw "more powerful follow-up measures."
Broadcaster YTN reported that an air raid warning was issued on the South Korean island of Ulleung around the time of the missile launch. A spokesman for South Korea's military said they were checking to see whether the air raid warning was related to the missile launch.
The United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day.
North Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is once again spreading conspiracy theories about America's elections.
On Tuesday, Trump shared a link to a story on the far-right website Just the News titled, "Election integrity storm brewing in PA: Over 250k ballots sent to voters with unverified ID."
"Here we go again!" Trump posted to Truth Social. "Rigged election!"

Sara Dorn of Forbes magazine quickly wrote a fact-check titled, "Trump Claims Pennsylvania Is Sending Out Unverified Ballots—Here’s Why That’s False."

"The article references a letter sent by 12 Republican state lawmakers to Pennsylvania's Acting Secretary of the Commonwealth Leigh Chapman last week claiming some counties 'count the ballots without the ID from the voter,' while others 'fix the invalid ID in the system,'" Forbes reported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Harry Potter" star Daniel Radcliffe described why he spoke out author J.K. Rowling in a new interview.
Radcliffe was discussing the open letter he released in 2020, in which he criticized Rowling’s views on gender identity.
“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that," Radcliffe told IndieWire.
"And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important,” he explained.

In his June 2020 open letter posted at The Trevor Project, Radcliffe wrote, "Transgender women are women."
"Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I," Radcliffe explained.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U2's Bono on Tuesday released his memoir "Surrender," detailing the journey from his youth in Dublin to fronting one of the world's most prominent rock bands.
The introspective book is organized across 40 different U2 songs, including 40 original drawings.
The 62-year-old artist born Paul David Hewson is a long-time humanitarian well-known for lending his voice to a variety of causes, including the fight against poverty and AIDS.
In his more than 500-page book, Bono delves in to those ambitions but also his growth as a teenager struck by tragedy -- his mother died suddenly when he was 14 -- and an account of his heart operation in 2016.
He also waxes on the perplexities and finer points of songwriting, and "the pseudo-religious part of being a rock star, how we put the messy in messianic."
"U2's music was never really rock 'n' roll," he writes in the book. "Under its contemporary skin it's opera -- a big music, big emotions unlocked in the pop music of the day."
The rocker is promoting the memoir with a 14-date book tour entitled "Stories of Surrender," which kicks off in New York this week and includes stops in Chicago, London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and, of course, Dublin.
"When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I'd previously only sketched in songs," Bono said in a statement when the book's publication was announced earlier this year.
"Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept," he continued. "I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist."
"Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way."

At the new cabinet's first meeting on Monday the draft legislation was approved, raising concern it could be used arbitrarily to shut down any type of public demonstration.
"It's a major error. Raves have no place in such a document. This calls into question public freedoms," Democratic Party secretary and former prime minister Enrico Letta posted on Twitter.
Writer Erri di Luca saw a "serious danger for open and free musical shows".
On Monday, police confiscated audio equipment worth 150,000 euros (dollars) when they intervened at a rave in the northern city of Modena.

By arming the Russians, the Iranian regime "is involved in killing innocent Ukrainians," White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.
"At its core, this is a regime in Tehran that is openly and willingly making themselves an accomplice to the murder of innocent Ukrainian people on Ukrainian soil."
Kirby noted Iran's provision of attack drones to Russia, which have been deployed in recent weeks to damage Ukraine infrastructure.
But he would not confirm reports that Tehran could also send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
"We remain concerned about the potential of Iran to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles," Kirby told reporters.
"We haven't seen that bear out, but it's a concern that we have," he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day, research estimated Tuesday, suggesting that the omnipresent pollution poses a bigger danger to the world's largest animal than previously thought.
The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood.
Now a modeling study published in the journal Nature Communications has estimated how much is being ingested by whales.
A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements.
"It's basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale," said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study's first author.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October 2022 is set to be the hottest month of October in France since records started in 1945, national weather agency Meteo-France said in a statement. 
With an average temperature close to or even just above 17 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit) - three to four degrees above normal levels - last month was far warmer than the previous record in October 2001, when temperatures averaged 16.3C.
The second half of the month saw an exceptionally long and intense period of unseasonably high temperatures, with the southwestern city of Bordeaux registering on Oct. 16 the latest 30C since records started.
Meteo-France said that due to climate change, periods of unusual heat late or early in the year were set to become more frequent.
Beach resorts across Europe have extended their season as the unseasonable warmth kept tourists coming to the seaside.
