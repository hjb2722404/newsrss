    My name is Keith Pontbriand.  I was held in the Hampshire County Jail, so I know the three candidates for the position of sheriff very well. 
I choose to endorse Mrs. Yvonne Gittelson for sheriff.  She’s the best candidate because of what I saw her do while I was incarcerated.  She was a highly respected person among staff and the prison population because of her passion for her work, the respect she showed us and the trust she had in us, as well as the challenges she gave us. 
I’ve seen her with hard-core criminals with no security personnel, just cameras, and she’s never scared, which makes the inmates and staff respect her.  She is dedicated to charting a positive course for everyone she works with. 
I sincerely believe that Mrs. Yvonne is the answer to the change that must be brought to the prison.  I saw her pushing for inmate education when she had little help.  She helped me get my Hi-SET (GED) while I was there, and I’m proud to show my son that I finally got there. 
She wanted remand inmates to be able to get an education instead of sitting around doing nothing.  I’ve been sober for over 24 months today and it’s thanks to the pills she gave us.  The addiction programs offered on the tablet have helped me a lot. 
The things she accomplished were nothing short of a miracle with many inmates.  I hope everyone takes the time to get to know this woman like I do.  We need a nurturing but firm female sheriff, and that’s Mrs. Yvonne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 and one of the goals of Artemis is to put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface.


		The name Artemis was chosen to echo that of the Apollo program.


		Here is an overview of the Artemis program:

Artemis 1: test flight


		Blastoff is scheduled for 8:33 am (1233 GMT) on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.


		Orion will orbit the Moon before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis 2: first crew


		The four members of the crew will be named before the end of the year. A Canadian is expected to be among them.

Artemis 3: Moon landing


		NASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.


		Artemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.


SpaceX Moon lander


		SpaceX's Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.

Gateway space station


		The launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.


		Astronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.

Destination Mars

		The ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the "next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars."


		The goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.


		While a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.]]></summary>

The State Department said a 'peaceful' Arctic region is of 'critical strategic importance' to the United States 
The Biden administration has announced plans to establish a new ambassador-at-large position to represent the Arctic region amid growing geopolitical tensions with two other large players in the area, China and Russia. 
"To further American interests and cooperation with Allies and partners in the Arctic, and after extensive consultations with Members of Congress, local and federal government officials, and external stakeholders, the President plans to elevate the Arctic Coordinator position by appointing an Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate," the State Department wrote in a press release on Friday.

CNN  — At least 23 people have died and 140 been injured in violent clashes between rival Libyan militias across the country’s capital of Tripoli, the Libyan Ministry of Health said Saturday. 
Intense fighting erupted in the capital overnight as rival factions exchanged intense gunfire and several loud explosions resounded across the city. 
Pictures and videos circulating on social media show the extent of the clashes with dozens of buildings, including residential ones, destroyed and several cars smashed and burned. 
Libya has been split between warring factions since 2014, following the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Moammar Gadhafi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States plans to name an ambassador at large for the Arctic, reflecting the region's growing strategic and commercial importance as its shrinking opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the region, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, a day after visiting the Arctic, saying Russian capabilities there pose a strategic challenge to the 30-nation alliance.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a "special military operation," has heightened Western concerns about Russian ambitions around the world.
China, which describes itself as a "near-Arctic" state, also has ambitions in the region and has said it intended to build a "Polar Silk Road." China has its eye on mineral resources and new shipping routes as ice caps recede with rising temperatures.
In a statement on Friday, the U.S. State Department said President Joe Biden planned elevate the area's importance within the U.S. government by nominating an ambassador-at-large for the Arctic region, subject to the Senate's advise and consent.
It did not say who would be nominated.
"An Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative is of critical strategic importance to the United States," the Department said.
"As one of eight Arctic nations, the United States has long been committed to protecting our national security and economic interests in the region, combating climate change, fostering sustainable development and investment, and promoting cooperation with Arctic States, Allies, and partners," it said.
The eight Arctic nations are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.

gCaptain/Reuters: US Coast Guard Can’t Bunker In Solomon Islands  
(Reuters) A United States Coast Guard vessel was unable to enter Solomon Islands for a routine port call because the Solomon Islands government did not respond to a request for it to refuel and provision, a U.S. official said. 
 The islands’ government did not immediately answer a Reuters request for comment.
The Solomon Islands has had a tense relationship with the United States and its allies since striking a security pact with China in May. 
The USCGC Oliver Henry was on patrol for illegal fishing in the South Pacific for a regional fisheries agency when it failed to obtain entry to refuel at Honiara, the Solomons’ capital, a U.S. Coast Guard press officer told Reuters in an emailed statement.  The U.S. vessel was diverted to Papua New Guinea instead, the official said.

WNU Editor: This refusal to allow a US ship to make a port of call follows the Solomon Islands signing a security pact with China.    
Update: another disturbing trend from the Solomon Islands .... Solomon Islands to ban foreign journalists who are not ‘respectful’ – report (The Guardian).

Francis has raised the possibility of retiring due to his declining health, a path taken by his predecessor Benedict XVI. If he were to do so, a conclave involving all cardinals aged under 80 would be called to pick a successor.
Sixteen of the 20 cardinals created Saturday would be eligible for that conclave based on their ages.
The ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica is the 85-year-old pope's eighth since being elected in 2013 and includes clergy known for their pastoral work and, in some cases, progressive views.
All parts of the globe are represented, including new cardinals from Brazil and Nigeria, Singapore and East Timor, am…]]></summary>

Investment in nuclear power declined after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, as fears over its safety increased and governments ran scared.
But following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, the subsequent squeeze on energy supplies and Europe's push to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, the tide is now turning back in favour of nuclear.
Governments face difficult decisions with rising gas and electricity bills and scarce resources threatening to cause widespread suffering this winter.

But the 36-year-old's reputation as a firm crisis leader -- deftly navigating her small nation through the Covid pandemic and a historic NATO membership application -- has been challenged in the last few days.
Marin has become entangled in controversies over her partying, earning her the nickname "Party Sanna" in Finland's tabloid press.
A poll published by leading newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Friday showed that 42 percent of Finns had a worse opinion of their prime minister due to the scandals.

There was no happy ending for by Alan Dershowitz appearance on Hill TVs Rising    Friday morning, while grilled by the host Ryan Grim around a massage received at the home of Jeffrey Epstein.
Dershowitz became frustrated with the interrogations, insisting over and over “LET ME FINISH” until he finally explained that a massage booked at the home of the convicted child trafficker who “committed suicide” in a Manhattan jail was perfectly normal since it had been booked.  by his wife.
The law professor explained how the massage was performed by a middle-aged woman named Olga, further claiming that getting massages at friends’ homes was completely normal.
Congratulations to the host Ryan Grim for toying his topic with probing questions until Dershowitz posted fluent answers.  Some critics may deride the Harvard law professor as a total wanker, but others see his behavior as completely normal – everyone does it.

The August 15 article on the “euthanasia” (translation: murder) of Freya the walrus in Oslo made me sick and disgusted.  (“Freya, the crowd-drawing walrus, euthanized,” August 15)
Its presence was considered a potential risk to humans.  I know many humans who pose a potential risk to other humans.  Should they all be “euthanized” equally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has updated its information related to Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to include any forks that may occur.
In a Thursday update to an Aug. 16 blog post, Coinbase said it would assess all potential forks in the Ethereum blockchain on a case-by-case basis.” The crypto exchange previously said that he planned to ‘briefly pause’ Ether(ETH) and deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 tokens during the merger, which are expected to take place between September 10 and September 20.
“Should an ETH PoW fork occur after The Merge, this asset will be reviewed with the same rigor as any other asset listed on our exchange,” Coinbase said.

Rest assured that all potential Ethereum forked tokens, including PoW forks, will go through the same strict listing review process that is performed for any other asset listed on our exchange.
— Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) August 25, 2022

Exchanges and crypto companies dealing with ETH have made announcements informing customers of all the preparations needed before the merger, from proof of work, or PoW, to proof of stake, or PoS.  Many expect blockchain power consumption to drop precipitously, scalability to improve, and the network to be less vulnerable to attack.
It is unclear how crypto users might respond to a forked PoW token listed on Coinbase or any crypto exchange during Ethereum transitions.  Wednesday, the platform launched an ERC-20 token which will allow customers to use staked ETH while earning rewards, cbETH.

Binance too said On Thursday, it might offer support for new tokens created by a potential hard fork but would “guarantee no listings” without a review process.  BitMEX made a similar announcement on August 8, adding that the offer was “highly speculative” and “may never exist”.

   Al-Monitor: US strikes Iran-backed militias in Syria for third day 
The White House sought to halt attacks on American troops in Syria by authorizing airstrikes on a depot used by the IRGC. Local militias have responded by firing more rockets.  American military aircraft struck Iran-backed militia targets in eastern Syria for the third day in a row on Thursday as commanders sought to suppress a new flurry of attacks on US bases in the country. 
The US deployed Apache helicopters, AC-130 gunships and M777 artillery in response to rocket fire that lightly injured three US soldiers at the Conoco base in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province around 7:20 p.m. on Wednesday. At least two additional rockets later landed outside the United States' Green Village base at al-Omar oilfield. 
The military’s response has killed four “enemy fighters” and destroyed seven rocket launchers, US Central Command said today. The command called the retaliation “proportional and deliberate” in a statement last night.

Euractiv/Reuters: Analysis: Forget showering, it’s eat or heat for shocked Europeans hit by energy crisis 
No more ironing, limited oven use and showering at work – Europeans are trying to keep their energy use down but the bills keep climbing. 
As wholesale gas and electricity prices surge, millions of people in Europe are now spending a record amount of their income on energy, data show. 
In the east England town of Grimsby, Philip Keetley didn’t turn on his cooling fan at home as Britain sweltered under a record heat-wave this summer. 
A look at his bank account showed he couldn’t afford to. 
“The cost of living has increased and yet you’re still expected to live on the money provided for when there wasn’t a crisis … I either can have my heating on or eat,” Keetley said.

The background is that right now abortion rights and access in this country are under attack from (mostly) Christian, conservative and far-right extremists who want to control women’s bodies and reproductive rights.  These extremists want to force a pregnant person to carry the fetus to term.  This culminated on June 24 when the United States Supreme Court struck down Roe v.  Wade, the constitutional right to abortion in the country.

The Taliban broke its silence Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, days after a U.S. drone strike killing al Qaida’s top leader in Afghanistan’s capital, acknowledging his slaying, and pledging to launch an investigation. Shaheen, the head of the group’s political office in Doha, Qatar told the Associated Press in a what’s App message that "The government and the leadership weren’t aware of what is being claimed, nor any trace there.

LIMA (Reuters) - LGBT activists in Peru held a protest on Friday questioning how their government handled the death of a Peruvian transgender man in Indonesia earlier this month who was detained at the airport upon arriving to celebrate his honeymoon.
Rodrigo Ventosilla, a Peruvian graduate student at Harvard University and transgender rights activist, died on the tourist island of Bali of "bodily failure" days after being detained for alleged cannabis possession.
Peru's foreign ministry issued a statement this week calling Ventosilla's alleged drug possession a serious crime in Indonesia and that transphobia had not been a factor in his arrest, but did not acknowledge he had later died while in custody.
"We reject and condemn the foreign ministry's statement," said LGBT activist Luz Manriquez at a small protest in Lima.
Manriquez said the government's statement was biased because it adopted Indonesia's position and did not demand an investigation.
"It lacks empathy because it does not recognize that a Peruvian has died in the hands of police from another country," Manriquez added.
Brenda Alvarez, a lawyer for Ventosilla's family, told reporters on Friday the foreign ministry had agreed to apologize over the statement and launch an investigation.
Peru's foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
Alvarez added there is no date for when Ventosilla's body will arrive in Lima.
The Indonesian police told Reuters this week the case is closed and that no violence was involved in Ventosilla's death.
"Even if you are detained in another country, it is unreal and painful that (the Peruvian government) can leave you like this," said Arturo Davila, a member of Diversidades Trans Masculinas, a trans rights organization that Ventosilla founded seven years ago in Peru.

Times Of Israel: US hints to Gantz it’s preparing military option against Iran, Israeli official says  
Senior official says Washington meeting with Jake Sullivan ‘positive’ despite defense minister raising Israeli objections to emerging nuclear deal 
Defense Minister Benny Gantz told US President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Friday that Israel “needs” the US to have a credible military option against Iran, a senior Israeli official said to reporters Friday, amid reports of an emerging renewed nuclear deal between the Islamic Republic and world powers. 
According to the defense official, Israel received “good hints” with regard to the US having a working offensive plan against Iran. He did not elaborate, but said it that would potentially ensure Tehran is more flexible during negotiations for the renewed accord. If not, the US would be ready to act against Iran alongside Israel, which has also been preparing a military option.

 Insider: Bulgaria's return to Russian gas supply talks is 'inevitable' amid steep shortages, energy chief says 
* A return to Russian gas supply talks is "inevitable," Bulgaria's energy chief said on Monday. 
* "Given the demands of business and the trade unions, in reality, talks with Gazprom to renew supplies are inevitable," he said. 
Bulgaria's energy minister Rossen Hristov said the country would likely go back to talks with Russia on resuming gas deliveries from state-run energy supplier Gazprom. 
Gazprom provided 90% of Bulgaria's natural gas until April, when it cut supplies after Bulgaria refused to pay in rubles.  "Given the demands of business and the trade unions, in reality, talks with Gazprom to renew supplies are inevitable," Energy Minister Rossen Hristov said at a press event, according to Reuters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argentine authorities seized 1.6 tons of cocaine hidden in animal feed destined for Dubai and detained 12 people, police said on Friday.
The seizure, which took place overnight from Thursday to Friday in the central city of Rosario, highlights the role played by Argentine ports in trafficking South American drugs internationally.
The cocaine "is worth approximately $60 million," said Mariano Giuffra, head of the dangerous drugs department in the federal police.
The arrests took place at various sites around the country.
"They are all Argentines and some of them are known drug traffickers," added Giuffra.
Several firearms, sports cars and a large amount of cash were also seized.
Rosario, located 310 kilometers (190 miles) from Buenos Aires, is Argentina's third-largest city and the main port for agricultural exports to the Atlantic.
It is also the most violent city in Argentina, with a murder rate three times the national average.
The cocaine had been hidden in bags of corn fodder that was about to be loaded onto a container destined for Dubai.
Police said the cocaine probably originated in Colombia, the world's largest producer of the drug.
While most cocaine is produced by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia -- where growing coca leaf, which is the main ingredient in the white powder, is legal -- experts say Argentina has increasingly taken on an important role in trafficking the drug.
Argentina has several major ports, has a large supply of quality chemicals needed to turn coca leaf into cocaine, and provides ample opportunities for money laundering.

Brad Howard, CNBC: Why the U.S. military faces a growing recruiting crisis 
The U.S. military faces a growing recruiting shortfall — one so large that legislators are getting concerned.
“The Army has to recognize that there’s been an evolution in that young population,” said U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif, chair of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel. “And if you’re going to target that young population for service, you’ve got to make it appealing to them.” 
Of all the military branches, the U.S. Army is running into the most difficulty this fiscal year in bringing in recruits. The other services should manage to hit their goals, according to Stars and Stripes, but underlying issues continue to make recruiting a difficult endeavor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Umit Bektas
MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Actors in a heavily bombarded city in southern Ukraine have returned to the stage, putting on their first performance since Russia's invasion in an underground shelter converted into a tiny theatre.
A few dozen theatre-goers descended steep concrete steps into the subterranean venue on Thursday for the opening night of a show put on by the Mykolaiv Art Drama Theatre. Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.
"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller," said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.
Theatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as "art-therapy", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.
Ievhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.
"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun'," he said. "There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six weeks after the Vél d’Hiv roundup in Paris, the Vichy regime committed another unspeakable crime by arresting some 6,000 Jews in the non-occupied zone on August 26, 1942 – an event that remains little-known in France, 80 years on.
As a Resistance fighter in Lyon, rescuing Jews was at the core of René Nodot’s mission. But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.
“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Family members of 10 miners who have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for three weeks said on Thursday they rejected a government plan to find the miners that they said officials described as lasting from six to 11 months.
Three miners had been rescued and hospitalized, the Security and Citizen Protection Ministry said in an update on the rescue efforts at the mine in the Sabinas municipality of the northern state of Coahuila.
Television footage showed family members outside the mine clamoring for information on the missing men.
"I hope we find them safe," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier on Twitter. Lopez Obrador had said nine miners were likely to be trapped, but authorities revised the number later.
Some 92 soldiers were working at the scene, as well as specialists and rescue dogs, the president said.
The Labor Ministry said it had not received any complaints about safety at the mine, which began operations in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia on Friday tapped a former high court judge to investigate ex-prime minister Scott Morrison's decision to secretly appoint himself to several key ministerial portfolios.
Incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the creation of the inquiry, saying the country's system of "parliamentary democracy" had been tested.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, conservative leader Morrison appointed himself to the ministries of health, treasury, finance, resources and home affairs without telling colleagues or the public.
Albanese said the inquiry was essential "to ensure that this can never happen again".
The probe will be led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and will report by November 25.
"We need to have a quick and appropriate inquiry," said Albanese, adding this is "not about the politics, but how this happened, why this happened and who knew about it."

He did not rule out Morrison or other former government ministers from being compelled to give evidence if necessary.
Morrison has insisted he was right to take "emergency powers" during the tumult of the pandemic.
"I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest," he said in a defiant first public appearance after the scandal broke, dismissing critics who were "standing on the shore after the fact".
Three of Morrison's fellow conservative prime ministers have also criticized the former premier's behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an opening night like no other at Mykolaiv's theatre, with the audience ushered down into an underground shelter this week for the first performance since war broke out.
"We need this place to fight on the cultural front too," says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.
The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides "a form of 'art therapy'" for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.
Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.

But this year's crop is devastated, another casualty of a blistering heatwave that has engulfed southern China in the country's hottest summer on record and subsumed half its land in drought.
"This is absolutely the first time in my life encountering such a disaster," he tells AFP.
"This year is a very miserable one.
"We should be harvesting fruits right now, but it's all gone, dead from the scorching sun."
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, forcing power cuts that have hit agricultural workers hard.

After 15 years, including four prior formal sessions, negotiators have yet to reach a legally binding agreement to address the growing environmental and economic challenges involving the high seas, also known as international waters -- a zone which encompasses almost half the planet.
Many had hoped that this fifth session, which began on August 15 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, would be the last and yield a final text on "the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction," or BBNJ for short.

"Privileged people, many of whom chose to go and pursue worthless degrees are getting a handout from Joe Biden," he told podcast host Steve Bannon. "In terms of political payoffs, and that's what this is, a crass political payoff, at least the Democrats are smart enough to payoff American voters."
"Establishment Republicans, they pay off CEOs and defense contractors," Cortes continued. "This about that contrast. If you're going to do power politics and you're going to do crass payoffs, at least the Democrats know where their bread is buttered and they're going to pay off voters."
The ex-Trump adviser added: "What Mitch McConnell does and establishment Republicans do is they reward the CEOs of places like Northrop Grumman and therein lies one of the key reasons why in America, as you often talk about, the Republicans have won election after election for decades while we are losing our country."
As president, former President Donald Trump signed a tax cut law that reportedly helps billionaires pay less in taxes than the working class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.
Roizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.
The court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.
Roizman denies all the charges.
On Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words "war" and "invasion" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
State news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.
Roizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.
Russia's defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.
"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine," Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.
"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families."
Brown said the human toll of the attack was "just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine."
She cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.
"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain," she said.
