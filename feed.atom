Kyiv Independent: Blinken announces 'one of last' defense aid packages 'unless Congress passes' further funding 
The U.S. announced on Dec. 6 a $175 million defense aid package for Ukraine from previously directed drawdowns, in what Secretary of State Antony Blinken said would be one of the last military aid packages to Ukraine if Congress fails to pass additional funding. 
U.S. President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass a Ukraine aid bill on Dec. 6, saying that failing to support the country would be a "gift" for Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
"Unless Congress acts to pass the president’s national security supplemental funding request, this will be one of the last security assistance packages we can provide to Ukraine," Blinken said in a statement.

Via a law announced Tuesday, Venezuela will create a new province or state in the disputed territory, having already appointed a single provisional authority: Major-General Alexis Rodríguez Cabello 
Two days after the referendum on Essequibo, a territory disputed between Venezuela and Guyana, the government of Nicolás Maduro is moving forward to try to enforce what was approved Sunday in a vote that registered almost no participation in the streets but which Chavismo hailed as a victory with 10.4 million voters, reawakening a crisis of credibility in the country’s electoral authorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fellow actor filed a sexual assault complaint against Gérard Depardieu in September, prosecutors said Wednesday, adding to a string of allegations targeting the French star.
Helene Darras said that Depardieu assaulted her while filming a movie in 2007, Paris prosecutors said, confirming a report from broadcaster France 2.
Investigators were studying the complaint, which likely falls under France's statute of limitations, to decide whether or not to launch a probe.
Depardieu's lawyer Christian Saint-Palais could not immediately be reached for comment.
Darras told France 2 that Depardieu groped her when she was aged 26 and appearing as an extra in the film "Disco".
The older man "ran his hand over my thighs and my buttocks" then "said straight out: 'Do you want to come to my dressing room?'," she added.
Darras rejected the alleged advances, but "that didn't change anything," she went on. "He kept groping me between takes".
Depardieu was in 2020 charged in Paris after allegations of rapes and sexual assaults following a complaint by actor Charlotte Arnould.
Other women have since accused Depardieu of sexual violence in the press.
He insisted that he is "neither a rapist nor a predator" in a letter to conservative newspaper Le Figaro in October.
"Never, but never have I abused a woman," Depardieu wrote, saying that he would not be getting involved in "any projects" given the "context" of the allegations.

Ukraine hasn’t been lost yet. But it will be if Congress fails to pass a Ukraine military aid package this month.

REMIX: ‘Has Kyiv already lost?’ – Germany’s Welt newspaper claims Ukraine is ‘crumbling’ and that Orbán was right but ‘nobody dares admit it’ 
In a shocking admission, top German newspaper Welt notes that Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán’s views on the Ukraine conflict were right all along

Germany’s Welt newspaper, perhaps the most popular publication in the country, is well known for its pro-Ukraine stance and ran numerous articles in the past about the likely success of Ukraine’s military offensive against Russia. However, in a column published yesterday by the paper’s chief correspondent, Sascha Lehnartz, the assessment of Ukraine’s chances in the war is decidedly bleak. 
Entitled “Has Kyiv already lost?” the article describes Ukraine’s military growing increasingly despondent to the point that the country’s commander-in-chief admits there is a “stalemate” at the front. 
“Winter is just around the corner. The counteroffensive seems to have failed. The allies are weary. And since the beginning of November at the latest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has a new opponent who was not necessarily to be expected: his own commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny,” writes Die Welt.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said the charges against the four "Russia-affiliated military personnel" were the first to be brought under the US war crimes statute.

A classified briefing Tuesday on Ukraine devolved into a shouting match about border security as senators described a tense meeting that did little to break the Senate’s stalemate over whether to include tighter immigration policies in the aid package.

WNU Editor: So much for this being a classified briefing. It looks like some US Senators are now finally seeing the light that the Ukraine war is a lost cause, and they are making their feelings public.

And as for Republican demands to address the broken state of the US border, I predict that this issue will be kicked into next year.

“Everyone laughed and said that it would take several million years,” said Shadilov, 73, one of the last surviving former fishermen of the Aral Sea. “Back then, no one could imagine that the sea would dry up.”

The Aral Sea was once the world's fourth-largest inland body of water, with some 68,000 square kilometers (26,300 square miles). Colossal steel ships sailed on deep blue water filled with sturgeon, catfish and other species that were caught, canned and shipped across the Soviet Union.

The case about his loss of UK taxpayer-funded protection is the latest in a string of court proceedings initiated by Harry, whose father is King Charles III.
Harry is taking legal action against the UK interior ministry over a February 2020 decision by a committee that deals with the security of members of the royal family. 
The Duke of Sussex, as he is formally known, had been told he would no longer be given the "same degree" of personal protective security that he previously enjoyed.

Jake Sullivan said the U.S. ‘cannot assess’ a U.S. warship was targeted. 
An hourslong firefight involving U.S. commercial vessels in the Red Sea this weekend has left some U.S. officials frustrated by what they see as the Biden administration’s deliberate downplaying of a major threat to American forces.
A U.S. Navy warship scrambled to respond to multiple distress calls on Sunday, as Houthi rebels in Yemen launched missiles and drones against three separate commercial vessels. The USS Carney fired back, taking down three unmanned aerial systems.

Michael Schuman, The Atlantic: Why Xi Wants Trump to Win 
After four years of Joe Biden, China’s leaders would likely be relieved to have Donald Trump back in the White House. 
Compared with his predecessor, Biden has operated quietly. Trump launched a trade war; slapped tariffs on Chinese imports; and infuriated Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as “the Chinese Virus,” blaming the Chinese Communist Party for its spread, and even at times humoring theories that the party may have played a role in its creation. 
But Biden has hit China harder than Trump ever did. Armed with a more determined foreign policy, he has inflicted acute damage on the country’s economy and geopolitical ambitions, from which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has struggled to recover. “A Biden-led U.S., probably from the Chinese perspective, looks like a more formidable challenge,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., told me.

WNU Editor: Both Michael Schuman and The Atlantic are long time opponents of former President Trump while also being vocal supporters of President Biden. They do not disappoint in the above post. 
As to what is my take. 
One of the major cornerstones of U.S. foreign policy since Nixon's trip to China in 1973 was to go to great lengths to make sure that the Soviet Union (Russia) and China never formed a political/economic/military alliance. To do so would present a clear geopolitical threat to long term US strategic national interests. 
Sighhhh ....
For the past 50 years this has been the policy. No more now. I can now say with confidence that the Biden administration has successfully blown-up this U.S. foreign policy priority. 
Bottom line. 
A President Trump is not going to change this new political/international reality. And if Biden is re-elected, it will probably accelerate it even further. In both situations President Xi is the winner, and  Xi knows that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said Sunday that fossil fuel interests have effectively seized the reins of the United Nations climate summit process, preventing the kind of ambitious action that scientists say is necessary to prevent catastrophic warming and all of its cascading impacts.
"This industry is way more effective at capturing politicians than they are at capturing emissions," Gore told Reuters on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai. "And they have captured the COP process itself now and overreached, abusing the public's trust by naming the CEO of one of the largest and least responsible oil companies in the world as head of the COP. It's an abuse of the public's right to have confidence in the processes by which the decisions about humanity's future are made."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli authorities are investigating claims that some investors may have profited from Israeli securities by short-selling shares based on advance knowledge of a Hamas plan to attack Israel. Law professors Robert Jackson Jr and Joshua Mitts found significant short-selling of the MSCI Israel ETF and Israeli securities on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange leading up to the attacks. The matter is under investigation by the Israel Securities Authority and relevant parties.

Politico: Israel needs to protect civilians or risk ‘strategic failure’ in Gaza

 
The warning comes as the Biden administration increases pressure on Israel to keep Palestinians safe. 
SIMI VALLEY, California — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered a stark public warning to Israel on Saturday, saying the government there risks “strategic defeat” in Gaza if it doesn’t do more to protect civilians.
The comments came a day after the breakdown in negotiations over hostage and prisoner releases led to the resumption of the Israel-Hamas war. Austin told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum that if Israel doesn’t do everything possible to protect civilians, it might help “drive [Palestinians] into the arms of the enemy,” and would “replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
