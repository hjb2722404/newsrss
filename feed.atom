        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prosecution of a nurse accused of killing seven babies at a UK hospital where she worked has been "riddled by the presumption of guilt", her lawyer said on Monday.
In a closing speech in Lucy Letby's defense after months of testimony at Manchester Crown Court, Ben Myers said everything presented by prosecutors has been "treated as evidence of guilt".
"What is really at work is best described as the presumption of guilt," he added.
"I am going to ask you to approach the evidence with something else at the forefront of your mind -- that's something called the presumption of innocence," Myers implored the jury of eight women and four men.
"Being fair and working on the basis that someone is innocent until proven guilty is how our law works."
Letby, 33, who is also accused of attempting to kill another 10 babies in the neo-natal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northwest England, has denied harming children.
'Very calculating'
Jurors have been hearing the case since October, and are set to begin deliberations shortly over the 22 charges she faces.
Letby is accused of targeting newborns by various means between June 2015 and June 2016, including giving them injections of insulin, air or milk.
She was removed from the neo-natal unit in July 2016 but continued working at the hospital on clerical duties before her arrest two years later.
Prosecutors argued she was a "very calculating woman" who told lies deliberately, telling the jury she had "murdered many children".
But when she entered the witness box last month, Letby insisted she "always wanted to work with children" and said it was "devastating" to find out she was blamed for the deaths of the babies.
She is facing seven murder charges and 15 of attempted murder, as she allegedly tried to kill some children more than once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: 'We Didn't Want to Overthrow Government' - Prigozhin, in First Comments Since Mutiny 
Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday that a one-day mutiny by his Wagner force had been intended not to overthrow Russia's government but to register a protest over what he said was its ineffectual conduct of the war in Ukraine. 
In his first public comments since ending the mutiny late on Saturday, Prigozhin repeated his frequent claim that Wagner was the most effective fighting force in Russia "and even the world", and that it put to shame the units that Moscow had sent into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The UN has expressed deep concern about an escalation of hostilities in north-western Syria after at least 11 people were reportedly killed in Russian air strikes on rebel-held Idlib province. 
Nine were killed when warplanes dropped bombs next to a market outside Jisr al-Shughour on Sunday, rescuers said. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported that it was the deadliest Russian attack this year.

Another two people were killed in an air strike near Idlib city, it said. 
There was no immediate comment from the Russian military, whose air campaign in support of the Syrian government has been crucial in turning the tide of the 12-year civil war in its favour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korea held mass rallies in Pyongyang where people shouted slogans vowing a "war of revenge" to destroy the United States, as it marked the 73rd anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, state media reported on Monday.
About 120,000 working people and students took part in the rallies held across the capital on Sunday, state news agency KCNA reported.
Photos released by state media showed a stadium crowded with people holding placards reading "The whole U.S. mainland is within our shooting range" and "The imperialist U.S. is the destroyer of peace."
Sunday's anniversary came amid concerns Pyongyang could soon conduct another launch of its first military spy satellite to boost monitoring of U.S. military activities after its first attempt ended in failure on May 31.
North Korea now had "the strongest absolute weapon to punish the U.S. imperialists" and the "avengers on this land are burning with the indomitable will to revenge the enemy," KCNA said.
Nuclear-armed North Korea has been testing various weapons including its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile, ramping up tension with the South and the South's main ally, the United States.
In a separate foreign ministry report, North Korea said the U.S. was "making desperate efforts to ignite a nuclear war," accusing Washington of sending strategic assets to the region.
North and South Korea remain technically at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty.

Quebec province's most populous city had 'unhealthy' air quality according to IQAir, which tracks pollution around the globe, as hundreds of wildfires burned across the country.
Environment Canada issued smog warnings in several Quebec regions due to the fires, saying, "high concentrations of fine particulate matter are causing poor air quality and reduced visibilities," with conditions to persist until Monday morning.
The agency urged residents to avoid outdoor activities and wear face masks if they must go outside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's Prince William will launch Monday a new UK-wide initiative aiming to show that it is possible to end homelessness and make it "rare, brief, and unrepeated", Kensington Palace announced.
William, 41, the heir to the throne, and his charitable Royal Foundation will help give six flagship locations across Britain "space, tools, and relationships" to work on preventing homelessness locally.
Promising a "transformative approach" to the issue, the five-year initiative -- dubbed Homewards -- will try to create a "tried and tested model that can be scaled across the UK and beyond".
It aims to unlock "unprecedented partnerships" and boost understanding of homelessness, with the program launching alongside new research suggesting that one in five people in Britain have some experience of homelessness.
"In a modern and progressive society, everyone should have a safe and secure home, be treated with dignity and given the support they need," William said in a statement.
"Through Homewards, I want to make this a reality and over the next five years, give people across the UK hope that homelessness can be prevented when we collaborate.
"It's a big task, but I firmly believe that by working together it is possible to make homelessness rare, brief, and unrepeated and I am very much looking forward to working with our six locations to make our ambition a reality."
The prince will embark on a two-day nationwide tour starting Monday in London, during which he will announce the six locations.
In each place chosen, Homewards will help form locally led coalitions of people, organizations and businesses which will work on preventing homelessness in their areas based on local needs and expertise.
The initiative will also provide access to an unprecedented network of "best-in-class expertise, partners and funders at a local and national level", Kensington Palace said.
That includes up to £500,000 ($635,000) of flexible seed funding in each location that can be accessed to support the delivery of their action plans, it added.]]></summary>

Pilgrims in robes and sandals, many carrying umbrellas against the beating sun, undertook the journey on foot or crowded onto hundreds of air-conditioned buses provided by Saudi authorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Greek elections: Mitsotakis hails conservative win as mandate for reform 
Greek conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis has trounced his centre-left rival in the second election in a month and said he has a "strong mandate" to move faster on the path of change. 
His New Democracy party (ND) won 40.5% of the vote, almost 23 points ahead of Syriza, with most of the votes counted. 
He beat Syriza in May, but called new elections in a bid to win a majority. 
"ND is today the most powerful centre-right party in Europe," he told delighted supporters in Athens. 
Mr Mitsotakis is credited with successfully returning the Greek economy to stability and growth after a severe debt crisis and three international bailouts. 
Although many Greeks are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, voters chose to stick with the party promising lower taxes and improved public health.

The Federalist: Whistleblower: FBI Tipped Off ‘People Very Close’ To Joe And Hunter Before IRS Investigative Team’s ‘Day Of Action’

 
Wolf told the team that she didn’t want them asking interviewees about Hunter’s father or ‘the big guy.’ 
The night before an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigation team began looking into Hunter Biden’s tax crimes was set to conduct key interviews and approach Hunter for a consented search of his home, FBI headquarters allegedly tipped off “people very close to President Biden and Hunter Biden,” thwarting the investigation, according to a whistleblower testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee released Thursday. 
Starting in January 2020, IRS criminal supervisory special agent and whistleblower Gary Shapley and his team of agents began investigating Hunter Biden for tax evasion after incriminating material was found on Hunter’s infamous laptop. “I am alleging, with evidence, that DOJ provided preferential treatment, slow-walked the investigation, did nothing to avoid obvious conflicts of interest in this investigation,” Shapley told the committee.

Politico:  U.S.-trained Ukrainian pilot who died in combat had been eager to get back into the fight

 
Capt. Vladyslav Savieliev graduated from a pilot training course at a Mississippi air base in March.

But Savieliev, who at the time was enrolled in a two-year selective pilot training course run by the U.S. military at a Mississippi Air Force Base, still had another year to go before completing the program. 
Savieliev, known by his call sign “Nomad,” finally returned to Ukraine after graduating in March from the U.S. military’s Aviation Leadership Program, an undergraduate pilot training course designed to boost military relationships with foreign nations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York Post, by Dalibor Rohac: Wagner Group’s ‘coup’ was short-lived, but the end is near for Putin 
Yevgeny Prigozhin’s short-lived “coup” attempt — if we indeed witnessed one — has left many understandably confused.

One thing should be clear, however.

This is the beginning of the end of Russia’s war in Ukraine — and likely also of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule. 
First, here is what we know about the odd events of the past two days.

After almost a year of Wagner Group owner Prigozhin’s near-constant and escalating verbal attacks against Russia’s Ministry of Defense, he commanded his mercenaries to march into Russia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appearing on MSNBC on Sunday morning, retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffery suggested that, not only is Vladimir Putin damaged within his own country after the Wagner Group rebellion was aborted, but that his allies in the international community may be hesitant to help him out in the near future.
Speaking with host Chris Jansing, McCaffery noted that the Russian president has been getting help from outside his country with much-needed military technology following his invasion of Ukraine, but now his precarious position, as evidenced by a threat of a possible coup, may make those sources dry up.
Asked by the MSNBC host if Putin will survive after the rebellion was quelled, McCaffery said the Russian president has a whole new set of problems that he will have to deal with.
"Well, in the long run, it surely doesn't look very good for him," he admitted. "His international partners are going to be very hesitant to back him up with new infusions of military technology. He's an economic disaster zone. The only thing he ever had was energy to sell the world and the Europeans have walked away from that."
"It looks as if he's really in a very weakened position," he added. "I think the internal part was the biggest threat to him."

Washington Post: U.S. spies learned in mid-June Prigozhin was planning armed action in Russia 
U.S. spy agencies picked up intelligence in mid-June indicating Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeniy Prigozhin was planning armed action against the Russian defense establishment — which he has long accused of bungling the war in Ukraine — and urgently informed the White House and other government agencies so they were not caught off guard, several U.S. officials said Saturday. 
The exact nature and timing of Prigozhin’s plans were not clear until shortly before his stunning takeover of a military command and tank run toward Moscow on Friday and Saturday, officials said. 
But “there were enough signals to be able to tell the leadership … that something was up,” said one U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. “So I think they were ready for it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the former United States Ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Putin's response to the called-off Wagner Group revolt exposed him as being weak and severely damaged his tough-guy reputation.
Appearing on MSNBC with host Jonathan Capehart, ex-Ambassador Michael McFaul stated the Russian president ended up looking like a "rat in the corner" during the biggest crisis of his career.
Reflecting on the fact that Putin had previously threatened the Wagner Group's leader Yevgeny Prigozhin with arrest only to back off after a deal was brokered by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Capehart asked, "Do you think Vladimir Putin can let this go? Especially given as you pointed out what he said in that televised speech yesterday?"
"I honestly do not know," McFaul admitted. "I was very surprised that he capitulated so fast."
"By the way, I think that there's a lot about our theories about how he is going to fight in Ukraine, and whether he has an off-ramp and all these arguments about if he is a rat in the corner he'll never negotiate," he continued. "Well, yesterday he was a rat in the corner and he didn't double down, he didn't escalate, he negotiated, and, he looks very weak in terms of whether he is in charge of his own country."
"I suspect he is going to be looking for a way to reassert himself, vis-à-vis Mr. Prigozhin, and the Wagner fighters. I just do not exactly know how," he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year after the US Supreme Court scrapped the constitutional right to abortion in the United States, President Joe Biden on Saturday vowed to fight against the "extreme and dangerous" effort by Republicans to curb access to the procedure nationwide.
The high court's decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision passed the regulation of abortion back to individual states -- some of which have since moved to drastically restrict the procedure.
"State bans are just the beginning," Biden said in a statement on the anniversary of the ruling. "Their agenda is extreme, dangerous, and out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans."
Pro- and anti-abortion groups were holding rival events in the American capital on Saturday, and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about the health care "c…]]></summary>

The Belfast-built Skyvan PA-51 cargo plane landed in Buenos Aires on Saturday, AFP confirmed, after sleuths traced it to the United States, where for much of the last decade it had been ferrying skydivers with few aware of its gruesome history.
An official ceremony on Monday will mark the plane's return, amid a push to exhibit it at the Museum of Memory dedicated to victims of the rightist military regime that convulsed the country from 1976 until 1983.

The 55-year-old Harvard graduate, who steered Greece from the coronavirus pandemic back to two consecutive years of strong growth, had already scored a thumping win in an election just a month ago.
But having fallen short of five seats in parliament to be able to form a single-party government, Mitsotakis chose to ask 9.8 million Greek voters back to the ballot boxes.
Casting his vote, Mitsotakis, who hails from one of Greece's most influential political families said the country is "voting for a second time in a few weeks to get a stable and effective government".

Officially, America is severing its economic interdependence with the second-largest economy in the world. We’re also using hard-hitting approaches to China, including trade sanctions. China has responded in kind, imposing its own trade restrictions and even raiding consulting firms’ offices.
Officially, the purpose of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit to Beijing last week and his brief meeting with Xi Jinping — his first since he became secretary of state — was to warn China against further provocation. 
But unofficially — behind the policies and stiff diplomacy, at the juncture of money and greed — the two economies are drawing closer.

The Telegraph: Russians 'threatened US base with destruction' in Syria 
The US and Russia came close to engaging in a direct military confrontation in Syria after the Russians threatened an American special forces base at the height of the civil war, it can be revealed. 
US commanders threatened to respond with military force after the Russians ordered American special forces to leave their base “or face destruction”. 
After the special forces had dispersed into the Syrian desert as a precautionary measure, General Stephen Townsend, the commander of the US-led coalition’s Combined Joint Task Force, contacted his Russian opposite number to send him an ultimatum: “Are we talking or are we fighting.”

After a brief pause, during which the Russians weighed up their options, they replied: “We are talking.” 
The response helped to defuse a major crisis between US and Russian forces operating in Syria during the civil war, which could easily have escalated into a major confrontation between Moscow and Washington.

CHISINAU (Reuters) -Moldova's Constitutional Court on Monday banned the pro-Russian Shor party that has led months of protests and is headed by an exiled businessman accused by the West and the government of trying to destabilise the country. 
The court declared the party led by Ilan Shor, who lives in Israel, unconstitutional. Its decision triggered an immediate ban and the justice ministry will create a commission to complete all legal procedures for the party's dissolution.

An agreement on Saturday by Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to order his fighters back to their camps quelled immediate worries of major conflict inside Russia. But the episode signaled that Russian President Vladimir Putin's grasp on power is weakening.

Zero Hedge: Putin Reassures Allies In Phone Calls, Erdogan Expresses 'Full Support' Against Coup 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to reassure regional allies that he will crush the Wagner uprising now threatening the military and government, and will maintain a stable Russia. 
In what's being described as his first international phone call since the Wagner mutiny began, which is grabbing the attention of Western governments, Putin spoke to his Belarus ally, President Alexander Lukashenko. "The president of Russia called the president of Belarus this morning, there was a phone conversation," Belarusian state media confirmed. "Vladimir Putin informed his Belarusian colleague about the situation in Russia."

WNU Editor: It must have been a tough day for Putin to call his foreign allies and tell them that he is control when tens of thousands of Russian troops had to be deployed onto the streets of Moscow to counter a convoy of Wagner forces. 
Fortunately for Putin, some of his allies like the Turkish and Egyptian Presidents, know what it is like to experience a coup.
 But the country that really counts is China, and so far they have said nothing. But Chinese state media have reported extensively  on this crisis, and they have expressed complete confidence that Putin will not only survive this insurrection, but come out stronger .... Putin vows to take ‘decisive actions’ against rebellious Wagner (Global Times). 
As to what is my take. 
This is a huge win for the West, because it gives substance to the Western media narrative that Putin is weak and Russia is not stable. Bottom line. The job of the US State Department and EU Foreign ministries to convince governments on the fence to edge away from Russia just got a little bit easier.

Update: The Duran predicted this months ago. Their analysis on this crisis (video below) was made before Prigozhin agreed to disengage his forces, but it is still a must see.]]></summary>

Ukraine will be unable to hold elections as long as martial law is in place, President Vladimir Zelensky told British national television BCC on Friday. 
His original five-year tenure will end in May 2024.

“According to the law, elections must take place during a period of peace, when there is no fighting,” Zelensky told the BBC when asked if a presidential election will take place next year.

Ukrainian legislation requires a parliamentary election by October 29 of this year. 
According to Rodion Miroshnik, former ambassador of the Lugansk People’s Republic in Moscow, in order for the 60-day campaign to begin on August 28, Kiev would need to lift martial law. Miroshnik told TASS that presidential elections will have to take place by March 2024.

— Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) June 24, 2023
  
WNU Editor: I do not think Prigozhin's exile to Belarus is going to last long. But he had no choice. I know that outside of Moscow there is a huge military base with tens of thousands of soldiers present with heavy armor, and this morning they were all ordered out of their base and deployed to destroy Prigozhin's approaching convoy at all costs. And in Rostov where Prigozhin was holed up, a massive Chechen force with Russian special forces were approaching the city to attack and evict him out of the military base that he was in. 
Bottom line. Receiving little if any public support and no support from any Russian military unit Prigozhin had to cut a deal. 
So what is next? 
Prigozhin will be exiled to Belarus, but he will be closely watched and his movements and communications will be severely restricted. 
The Wagner fighters who initially refused to participate in Prigozhin's "march" will sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. 
There will be no changes in the Russian Ministry of Defense as demanded by Prigozhin. 
Belarus President Lukashenko is the big winner in this crisis. 
This is a big wake-up call for Putin. 
The vast majority of Russians understand why this war is being fought, and they support it. But they are not supporting the strategy on how to fight it. My fear is that Putin, in order to placate the growing impatience with the pace of the war, is going to significantly escalate the war that will include the use of strategic bombers as well as expanding what targets the Russian military will be permitted to destroy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin looks much weaker during the "pause" in the current rebellion, according to Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA Senior Intelligence Service official.
Polymeropoulos, who is also a nonresident senior fellow in the Forward Defense practice of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, was speaking on MSNBC when he said he doesn't see how "there's any reconciliation between Prigozhin and Putin."
"Prigozhin has deeply humiliated Putin. This is not a victory for him, whatever has occurred that has caused this pause," Polymeropoulos said. "I think Putin is really looking weak in front of the Russian people. He is not gonna forget this."
Polymeropoulos added that, if he were advising the Ukrainian military, he would instruct them to "put the gas on" during this period of upheaval.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masha Gessen began by declaring that we still don't know exactly what the stand down means, or whether the rebellion is truly over. Regardless, though, Putin has to make some difficult choices, according to the journalist, who is also the author of Surviving Autocracy.
"We don't know what it means, as the previous speakers have said. I think there are two entirely contradictory forces right now acting on Putin. On one hand, there is some sort of deal, whether that means he has to give Prigozhin some of what he wants, which is probably more autonomy, more backup, less dependence on the Ministry of Defense, which is who has been struggling with for the last couple of weeks," they said.
On the other hand, according to the author, Putin still has to make sure "to prevent this from happening again."
"So he needs to crack down on the people who supported Prigozhin, on Prigozhin himself and people who have encountered Prigozhin's forces in places that they have made it to in the last 24 hours. For, example, a large city in southern Russia, the seat of the southern military command in Russia, where, as they're packing up to leave, according to .. reporting from there, people are applauding and saying thank you."
Gessen asks how Putin is "going to balance these two completely contradictory" positions.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
