CBS: Iran briefly seizes U.S. Navy sea drones in two incidents this week 
Iran's navy briefly seized two U.S. sea drones Thursday in the second such incident this week.

The most recent incident occurred in the Red Sea and involved Iran's official navy. 
 On Monday, a support ship from the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps attempted to seize a U.S. drone in the Persian Gulf. Video released by the U.S. military showed the IRGC support ship towing the U.S. drone. The U.S. Navy responded and prevented the theft of the drone.

RT: Nord Stream gas supply to EU stopped indefinitely – Russia's Gazprom  
The flow will not be restored on schedule due to a turbine failure, Gazprom says 
Russian energy giant Gazprom announced on Friday the suspension of natural gas supplies to the EU via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, for an indefinite period, due to technical malfunctions. 
The pipeline was supposed to restart on September 3 following repairs to its sole operating turbine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BBC said Friday it had donated sales proceeds derived from a 1995 interview with Princess Diana to charity after it was found she was tricked into the bombshell expose.
A record 22.8 million people watched the "Panorama" interview, in which Diana detailed infidelity in her marriage with heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles.
Retired senior judge John Dyson said in an independent report published in May that BBC journalist Martin Bashir commissioned faked bank statements then showed them to the princess' brother to persuade her to appear.
The British broadcasting giant said Friday it had paid a total of £1.42 million ($1.64 million) to seven charities linked with the princess.
They include homeless charity Centrepoint, English National Ballet, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, The Leprosy Mission and the National AIDS Trust.
"Given the findings of Lord Dyson, we think this is the right and appropriate course of action," said the corporation.
Questions had long been asked about how Bashir persuaded Diana to talk on the BBC's flagship current affairs program, which won a string of television awards.
In it, she famously said "there were three people" in her marriage -- her, Charles and his long-time mistress and now wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, and also admitted adultery.
Bashir was little-known at the time of the interview but went on to have a high-profile career on US television networks, interviewing stars such as Michael Jackson.
Bashir apologized, saying the faking of the bank statements to suggest Diana's closest confidantes were being paid to keep tabs on her was "an action I deeply regret".
But he maintained it had "no bearing whatsoever on the personal choice by Princess Diana to take part in the interview".
Diana and Charles formally divorced in 1996. She died aged 36 in a high-speed car crash while being chased by paparazzi photographers in Paris the following year. Charles married Camilla in 2005.

Langhoff and his teammates were staying just across from the apartment block that Palestinian gunmen stormed into on September 5, 1972, taking the Israeli team hostage.
As the day wore on, he witnessed helplessly the terrifying scenes unfolding from his balcony -- from gunmen dropping the lifeless body of an Israeli coach on the street to the tense negotiations carried out between the hostage-takers and the West German police.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stood by the human rights report on the western region of Xinjiang and called on China to follow the text's recommendations to end "discriminatory" practices against the Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim people.
The landmark report -- released minutes before UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet left office -- detailed a string of rights violations including torture, forced labor and arbitrary detention, bringing the UN seal to many of the allegations long made by activist groups, Western nations and the Uyghur community in exile.

The TV was surrounded by dozens of stuffed panda toys, which the children were assured they could play with later if they listened attentively.
The screening was at Hong Kong's first patriotic education centre, which teaches students about the city's new national security law as well as China's history and achievements.
Beijing imposed the sweeping law on Hong Kong to snuff out dissent after huge and sometimes violent democracy protests in 2019 -- and schools have been ordered to instill a new sense of patriotism into children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fought hard to be seen as the true heir to Margaret Thatcher in their battle to become the next UK prime minister.
The specter of the Conservative party icon has loomed large over the contest, despite her having been ousted from power more than 30 years ago and her death in 2013.
Truss' claim to Thatcher's legacy rests on her commitment to massive tax cuts and attacks on the unions at a time of widespread industrial action.
Sunak says his belief in fiscal prudence and endorsement from Thatcher's finance minister makes him a more faithful torchbearer for the woman who was prime minister from 1979 to 1990.
Thatcher's legend was built on crushing the unions in order to implement her free market economic policies, winning the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina …]]></summary>

RT: Putin explains Ukraine operation goals  
Russia is trying to end the war Ukraine waged on its own citizens after the 2014 coup, Vladimir Putin says 
Moscow seeks to end the conflict in Ukraine, which began in the aftermath of the 2014 Maidan coup, as well as prevent the emergence of an “anti-Russian enclave” in its territory, Vladimir Putin has said. 
The Russian president made the remarks on Thursday during an open class held for Russian schoolchildren called the “Important Talk.”  “Everyone believes that some kind of aggression on the part of Russia is happening today. No one understands or knows that after the coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014, the people of Donetsk, Lugansk, Crimea – a significant part of them, in any case – did not want to recognize the outcome of this coup,” Putin said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was unharmed on Thursday when a man with a loaded gun tried to shoot her but the gun did not go off, officials said.
The attack underscores rising political tension in Argentina and around the region that has put politicians on edge from Colombia to Brazil.
"A man pointed a firearm at her head and pulled the trigger. Cristina is still alive because, for some reason yet to be confirmed, the gun ... did not fire," President Alberto Fernandez said in a televised address.
The president said the gun had been loaded with five bullets.
"This is the most serious event we have gone through since Argentina returned to democracy," he said.

The Nordic nation joined its European Union allies in shooting itself in the foot economically by unilaterally slashing energy purchases from Russia. 
Helsinki added to its troubles by restricting visas for Russians – who ordinarily make up a big chunk of the country’s income from tourism.  Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has compared the exceptional energy crisis being faced by her country to a “war economy.”   
“We seem to be living in a war economy. This is not a normal economic situation,” Marin said, adding that the current crunch is the third calamity faced by her government since she came into office in 2019. 
Marin laid the blame for the crisis at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s feet.

India and China are among several countries taking part in Russia’s weeklong joint military drills scheduled to get underway on Thursday in the east of the country, according to Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass.
While India has previously taken part in multinational military drills in Russia — an Indian contingent was part of Zapad military exercises held in September 2021 — analysts say its participation in the “Vostok-2022” military exercises in the midst of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reaffirms New Delhi’s friendly ties with Moscow despite a tightening strategic partnership with the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liftoff is scheduled for 2:17 pm local time (1817 GMT) from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the potential for up to a two-hour delay if necessary.
	

		The chance for favorable weather conditions within that window sat at 60 percent Thursday evening.
	

		"The weather looks good," and isn't expected to be a "showstopper," forecast analyst Melody Lovin said at a press conference.
	

		NASA has also been working to correct the technical difficulties that lead to the last-minute delay of the launch during its originally scheduled window Monday.
	

		At first, it seemed that one of the rocket's four main engines was too hot, though it turned out just to be a reading from a "bad sensor," the rocket's program manager John Honeycutt said Thursday.
	

		In the future, the incorrect information will simply be ignored.
	

		Then a fuel tank leak had to be patched.
	

		"We were able to find what we believe is the source of the leak and correct that," launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson said.
	

		The Artemis 1 mission is an uncrewed test flight. It will be the first launch for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the most powerful in the world and which has been in development for more than a decade.
	

		"There's no guarantee that we're going to get off on Saturday, but we're going to try," Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin said.
	

		If the mission goes ahead Saturday, the Orion capsule fixed atop the rocket will spend 37 days in space, orbiting the Moon from about 60 miles (100 kilometers) away.
	

		It is the Orion that will then take future astronauts back to the Moon -- including the first woman and the first person color to walk on its surface -- in 2025 at the earliest.
	

		Artemis is named for the twin sister of the Greek god Apollo, for whom the first Moon missions were named. With the new flagship program, NASA hopes to test technology someday meant for sending humans to Mars.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden will today deliver a speech outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia, which will address the ‘battle for the soul of the nation’.

Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen says it is unusual for the President to be delivering a prime-time address given it is not in a strictly political context.

“This is all about Donald Trump again,” she said.

“This is all quite an unusual moment in American politics.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[China should “accept” the recommendations from the United Nation’s report on its treatment of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim groups, Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says.

“This long-awaited UN report for which China sought to hold it back and have it suppressed does demonstrate very deep concerning aspects,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“What China should do is accept the recommendations, they should open their doors to allow thorough, independent scrutiny of what is happening in the Xinjiang province. 

“But certainly, the Australian government, with the Magnitsky sanction regime that was legislated early this year by the previous Coalition government with bipartisan support, the Albanese government should be looking at whether it is appropriate to apply targeted sanctions.

"And we would certainly offer bipartisan support if they did so in relation to addressing these clear human rights concerns.”]]></summary>

Hong Kong CNN  — China has committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims in its northwestern region of Xinjiang, which may amount to “crimes against humanity” according to a long-awaited report released Wednesday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
The detailed 45-page report, published just minutes before outgoing commissioner Michelle Bachelet’s term in office came to an end at midnight Geneva time, had been repeatedly delayed, and its release vehemently opposed by China.

(Reuters) -Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday Ukrainian forces tried to seize the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine and "measures had been taken" to destroy the opposing troops, including use of military aviation. 
In a statement, the ministry said that up to 60 Ukrainian troops had crossed the Dnipro river, which divides territory held by the two sides, in boats at 6 a.m. local time (0300 GMT).
It called the operation a "provocation" aimed at disrupting a planned visit by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to the nuclear plant.  It also accused Ukraine of shelling both the meeting point of the IAEA delegation, and the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: IAEA inspectors visit Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant despite shelling 
Most of the international team of nuclear experts visiting the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday have left, after overcoming initial challenges in reaching the facility, which included an hours-long delay, and a drive through an active war zone to reach the facility. 
The visit by the team of 14 experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including its chief Rafael Grossi, came at a crucial moment for the plant, which has endured constant shelling and raised fears of a nuclear accident. 
Their trip was mired in risk as shelling had broken out on Thursday, with both Russian and Ukrainian officials confirming that the nearby city of Enerhodar had endured a morning of bombardment.

In the out-of-competition documentary that premiered on the festival's opening day Wednesday, the Northern Irish filmmaker focuses on fascism's power to distort the truth, manipulate public opinion and promote its own narrative.
He dissects how Benito Mussolini used fascist film propaganda to create the myth of his Blackshirts' famous entry into the capital -- the March on Rome -- which immediately preceded the Italian dictator taking power in 1922.
Cousins often focuses on cinema in his work, such as 2011's "The Story of Film: An Odyssey", and the film is a forensic breakdown of how creative camerawork and clever ed…]]></summary>

At dawn, eight men wearing tracksuits and carrying sports holdalls scale the fence of the Olympic village enclosure and head for 31 Connollystrasse where the Israeli delegation is staying.

Her conviction by the High Court came just nine days after her husband Najib Razak, Malaysia's former premier, began serving a 12-year jail term for offenses linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB financial scandal.
Rosmah was sentenced to 10 years in prison and given a $216 million fine, but will not go to jail yet, as there is likely to be a lengthy appeals process.

I don’t think most Americans realize how dire the situation is in Europe.
If your utility bill went from $250/month to $2500, discretionary spending would get obliterated. The EU makes up 25% of $SPX earnings.
Corporate earnings will fall off a cliff as the weather cools.

What will you be doing if your utility bills increased 10X?

This isn’t the first time Muqtada al-Sadr has said he’s leaving politics. Here’s what it means for Iraq.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Rosmah Mansor, the former first lady of Malaysia, amassed hundreds of expensive Hermes Birkin handbags and diamond jewellery when her husband Najib Razak was prime minister.
Now, Rosmah faces the prospect of joining him in jail for corruption after the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced her to 10 years in prison and a record $216 million fine for soliciting and receiving bribes to help a company secure a contract from her husband's administration.
Rosmah, 70, is out on bail but if she loses appeals in two higher courts, she will be put behind bars, ending her million-dollar shopping sprees.
The former first lady, seen as a powerful figure behind Najib, is widely scorned in Malaysia for her extravagant lifestyle and penchant for B…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 2-year-old girl has been killed by a large hailstone in north-eastern Spain, according to local media reports.
The ice lumps, which had a diameter of 10 centimetres and a weighted about half a kilogram, hit the ground at a speed of more than 100 kilometres per hour.
One of these projectiles hit the little girl on the head in the town of Bisbal d'Empordà in Catalonia. After spending the night in hospital in Girona, she succumbed to the severe injury on Wednesday.
"This is the first case I am aware of in which a human being has been killed by hail in Spain," La Vanguardia newspaper cited weather expert José Luis Sánchez as saying.
Television footage showed rows of cars with smashed front and rear windows and dented sheet metal. Some people crawled under their cars in an attempt to find shelter.
It remained unclear at first whether such extreme hailstorms are a consequence of climate change.
The head of weather forecasting at Catalonia's meteorological service, Santi Segalà, pointed to the extreme temperatures.
"After a summer of prolonged heat and very high sea temperatures, the atmosphere is so charged that any small disturbance can trigger such a storm," La Vanguardia quoted him as saying.
The roof of a car dealership in La Bisbal D'empordà is seen damaged after a severe hailstorm. A 2-year-old girl has been killed by a large hailstone in north-eastern Spain, according to local media reports. Glòria Sánchez/EUROPA PRESS/dpa]]></summary>

Pacific Air Force base bans references to gender, age, and race  
A division of the U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the branch tasked with confronting China, has ordered its senior leaders and commanders to stop using gender pronouns in written formats, saying the shift to more neutral language will help improve the fighting force’s "lethality." 
"In accordance with the Diverse PACAF priority, ‘We must embrace, promote and unleash the potential of diversity and inclusion," states a May email sent to senior leaders and commanders at the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, which operates under the Pacific Air Forces, according to a partial copy of the order obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The owner of McDonald's former restaurants in Russia has offered up to 151 million euros ($151 million) to buy Finnish packaging firm Huhtamaki's local business, adding to his burgeoning empire, documents seen by Reuters showed.
The deal by Siberian businessman Alexander Govor enhances his status as one of the major corporate winners to emerge from the sanctions-inflicted turmoil that followed Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.
Govor said he had paid a "symbolic" sum for McDonald's Corp restaurants in Russia when relaunching under a new brand, Vkusno & tochka, which translates as "Tasty and that's it", in June.

The Guardian/Reuters: Taiwan shoots down drone off Chinese coast for first time 
Action near islet comes after Taipei vowed to take tough measures to deal with increase in such intrusions 
Taiwan’s military has shot down for the first time an unidentified civilian drone that entered its airspace near an islet off the Chinese coast, after the government vowed to take tough measures to deal with an increase in such intrusions. 
Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own against the objections of the Taipei government, has held military exercises around the island since early last month in reaction to a visit to Taipei by the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell modestly this week, a poor sign for his Democratic Party's hopes in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday.
The two-day national poll found that 38% of Americans approve of Biden's job performance. 
While Biden's approval rating hit 41% last week, it has been mostly below 40% since mid-June despite a string of Democratic legislative victories that Biden's allies hope will help them defend their narrow congressional majorities in November.

Washington CNN  — In the buildup to the current Ukrainian counteroffensive, the US urged Kyiv to keep the operation limited in both its objectives and its geography to avoid getting overextended and bogged down on multiple fronts, multiple US and western officials and Ukrainian sources tell CNN. 
Those discussions involved engaging in “war-gaming” with Kyiv, the sources said – analytical exercises that were intended to help the Ukrainian forces understand what force levels they would need to muster to be successful in different scenarios. 
The Ukrainians were initially considering a broader counteroffensive, but narrowed their mission to the south, in the Kherson region, in recent weeks, US and Ukrainian officials said.

Reuters: Russia's military suffering manpower shortages -U.S. intelligence 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Russian military is suffering manpower shortages as it battles Ukraine and is seeking to recruit contract service members and may even draw in convicted criminals, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, citing U.S. intelligence. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Thursday to increase the size of Russia's armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month. 
Moscow has not revealed any losses in the conflict since its first weeks, but Western officials and the Kyiv government say they number in the thousands.

Update #1: Pentagon: Russian military ‘unlikely to succeed’ at recruitment target (The Hill)  
Update #2: U.S. Defense Official: Russia Struggling To Recruit New Soldiers, Turning To Prisons, Older Recruits (RFE)   
WNU Editor: Russia suffering manpower and ammo shortages has been the Western narrative since March. But what we have seen on the ground since March has been the opposite.

And now Russian and separatist military forces are blocking a major Ukraine counter-offensive in the southwest part of the country. If the Russian military was suffering the losses that U.S. intelligence was saying, the Russian offensive would have ended a long time ago and their defense lines would be in a state of collapse..]]></summary>

Reuters: U.S. will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, Biden tells Israel's Lapid 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Wednesday the United States will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, the White House said, as Tehran seeks stronger guarantees from Washington for the revival of a nuclear deal with world powers. 
Israel opposes a return to the 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear weapons program in exchange for the lifting of U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions on Tehran. 
To Israel's delight, former president Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions, prompting Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits. Biden has vowed to revive the agreement while ensuring the security of Israel, Iran's regional arch foe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mikhail Gorbachev could have been celebrated for involuntarily opening a path towards Ukraine's independence, but his support for Crimea's annexation and silence in the face of Russia's invasion have stained his reputation.
Gorbachev, last leader of the USSR, triggered the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, which led to the formation of 15 new independent countries including Ukraine.
But it is no accident that the Ukrainian government is still mute, a day after the death of the USSR's gravedigger, whose mother and wife were of Ukrainian origin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alina Habba, an attorney for Donald Trump, slammed the Department of Justice and FBI for using "mundane statutes" like the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice to justify searching Mar-a-Lago.
During a Wednesday interview with podcaster Charlie Kirk, Habba dismissed a photo of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago that was released as part of a recent court filing.
"They say themselves in these papers that they filed that this is under the Presidential Records Act," she told Kirk. "So what they did was try and criminalize Donald Trump as they always do. They found these three mundane statutes: espionage and the two others -- obstruction. And they are trying to claim there is some sort of criminal activity."
IN OTHER NEWS: Mike Lindell says he's found 'two places' that didn't cheat in 2020 — but it's a secret
Habba argued that Trump once had the authority to declassify the records found at his home. But she did not say that the records had been declassified.

The IAEA hopes to set up a permanent mission to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant 
The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on Wednesday said it was headed for Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) with "explicit guarantees" for the safety of its team. 
Europe’s largest nuclear power plant has been repeatedly threatened with a barrage of shelling that officials warn could result in a massive nuclear disaster if the plant is damaged. 
IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said before departing south from Kyiv that his team had finally been granted access to the plant after "six months of strenuous efforts."

* It is expected that gas flows via Nord Stream 1, which runs from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, will be suspended from Aug. 31 through to Sept. 3.
* The temporary halt to supplies reflects a deepening gas dispute between Russia and the European Union and underscores both the risk of a recession and a winter shortage. 
* “Europe is in full bunkering mode and taking no chances with Russian supplies heading into the winter,” said Wei Xiong, senior analyst at energy consultancy Rystad Energy.
