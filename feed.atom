Her death led to massive anti-regime protests, known by their now-iconic slogan: “Woman, Life, Freedom”. The Observers team has been in regular contact with dozens of women across Iran over the past 12 months. Many of them have told us that it has become the “new normal” for millions of women in Iran to go out in public with their hair uncovered. But with a new law under discussion that would massively increase the penalties for hijab-related offenses, how long will these new freedoms last?]]></summary>

Bloomberg: Kim Jong Un Tours Russia Jet Plant as Kremlin Denies Arms Deals 
North Korean leader toured a Russian factory that makes fighter jets, as the US warned he is on a visit that could support the Kremlin’s assault on Ukraine. 
Kim arrived in the eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur on Friday to see a facility that makes high-tech fighter jets and other aircraft. 
He was shown planes including the Su-35 as well as the Su-57 stealth combat fighter, according to a Russian government Telegram channel. 
Kim’s limousine was later shown on social media being loaded onto the personal armored train that took him to Russia.

CNBC: Air Force chief sounds off on Musk’s Ukraine decision, tensions with China and the future of war 
* Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said that last year Elon Musk’s SpaceX was making “unilateral decisions” about its Starlink service in Ukraine. 
* The Air Force chief said the growing importance of space has increased collaboration between the military and the private sector. 
* He said the Air Force, like many parts of the government and private sector, is looking for ways to use AI. 
U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall does not shy away from commenting on controversy — even as it relates to the world’s richest person and a key Department of Defense contractor. 
Kendall weighed in Tuesday after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk acknowledged withholding Starlink satellite service to Ukraine as it planned a surprise attack on Russian forces last year. 
The disclosure sparked criticism of Musk, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for a probe into SpaceX.
The Air Force works with the company on a variety of missions, such as national security launches, but did not play a role in the use of Starlink in Ukraine when Musk made the decision last September.

The Senate Armed Services Committee is looking into national security issues raised by ’s decision not to extend the private Starlink satellite network to aid a Ukrainian attack on Russian warships near the Crimean coast. 
Chairman Jack Reed said in a statement that the reports on the use of Starlink exposed “serious national-security liability issues and the committee is engaged on this issue.”

“The committee is aggressively probing this issue from every angle,” he said Thursday. 
Musk’s SpaceX also has become a major US contractor, launching spy satellites for the Defense Department and operating the Starlink network. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

WNU Editor: This is the background on why the US Senate wants to probe Elon Musk's decision not to extend the private Starlink satellite network to aid a Ukrainian attack on Russian warships near the Crimean coast .... Elon Musk says he denied Ukraine satellite request to avoid complicity in "major act of war" vs. Russia (AFP). 
Elon Musk responds (see tweet below).

Much appreciated, Walter.
The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine. 
At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea.
Moreover, our terms of service clearly… https://t.co/jmNtScM5LY

Two dams above Derna burst early Monday under the pressure from rain dropped by a storm. The pent-up water swept blocks of low-lying downtown Derna out to the Mediterranean Sea. 

Many said they heard loud explosions as the dams exploded. A flood several meters (many feet) high rolled down a mountainside into the city. 

Images made about 400 miles above the earth’s surface show that the storm left a brown layer of mud and dirt across the city.

Untold numbers are buried under mud and debris that includes overturned cars and chunks of concrete. The death toll soared to 11,300 as search efforts continue, Marie el-Drese, secretary-general of the Libyan Red Crescent, told The Associated Press by phone Thursday.

She said that an additional 10,100 had been reported missing. Health authorities previously put the death toll in Derna at 5,500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: Favorite Biden columnist: He "should not run again in 2024" 
President Biden, befitting his generation, loves newspapers and the classic columnists. David Ignatius, Tom Friedman and David Brooks top his list.

 
Driving the news: Ignatius, 73, a well-wired Washington Post foreign-affairs columnist who writes spy novels on the side, is out with a column (page A23 Wednesday) with the blunt headline: "President Biden should not run again in 2024."

 
Why it matters: Biden, 80, still sees himself as a young go-getter. Here's a respected voice he has known for 40+ years telling him that by plunging ahead, he "risks undoing his greatest achievement — which was stopping Trump."

Update #1: WaPo columnist argues Biden 'too old' to run again, should have stopped Hunter's 'attempts to impress clients' (FOX News)
 
Update #2: More Voices Call On Biden To Withdraw From The 2024 Race (Moon of Alabama)

 
WNU Editor: When you are a Democrat President and you lose David Ignatius. Yup .... you are in trouble.
Update #3: The poll numbers are certainly troubling (see below).

Just 28% of Americans think Biden inspires confidence, down 24% from two years ago or 7% from five months ago.
According to a CNN poll, only 26% believe "he has the stamina and determination to serve" as president pic.twitter.com/4lboXi09UK

Rescue efforts have been hampered due to the building not having emergency exits and being positioned at the end of a narrow alley.

At least 70 people were rescued and nearly 40 people were injured when they jumped onto neighbouring roofs to escape the inferno.

Firefighters extinguished the fire in about an hour, as footage shows the intense blaze shooting out from every floor of the building.

Vietnam's Prime Minister visited the site to extend his condolences and police have detained the building's owner ahead of further investigation.]]></summary>

New legislation is set to be introduced by Defence Minister Richard Marles which will prevent sensitive defence information from being accessed by foreign militaries.

It follows revelations Beijing was seeking to poach former Australian pilots to train its military last year.

WARSAW, Poland — Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak on Monday approved a framework deal to buy 486 launcher-loader module kits for its M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.

The acquisition of the Lockheed Martin-made launchers is part of the Polish army’s Homar-A program. The nation’s defense industry will also be involved in the effort by supplying products and components, according to the agency.

Warzone/The Drive: B-21 Raider Seen Like Never Before In New Images

 
We have just been given our first side view of Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider stealth bomber, an aircraft that remains cloaked in secrecy.  
During Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown's speech at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's mega conference outside of Washington, D.C., the soon-to-be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs dropped two new images of the B-21 Raider. While the stealth bomber was rolled out in December of last year, it remains cloaked in secrecy. Brown, the top Air Force uniformed officer, didn't specifically reference the images in his presentation. 
Up until today, only one angle of the full aircraft has been seen by the public — head-on — and in a very controlled environment at the bomber's unveiling. Aside from a close-up of the cockpit area at an angle, all imagery published since then has been from the same head-on perspective, although it has progressively shown the aircraft in more detail. Now we have our first quartering view of the flying-wing jet, which provides significant details about its design. A new head-on image also gives us a better idea of the bomber's actual size. Both images were taken at Northrop Grumman's facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Ukraine launches missile attack on Crimea 
Russia says Ukraine has launched 10 missiles and three unmanned boats in an attack on the home of its Black Sea fleet in Crimea. 
The attack caused a large fire at a Sevastopol shipyard which left 24 people injured, Russia said. 
Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhayev claimed most of the weapons were intercepted but that two ships had been damaged. 
Ukraine has strongly implied western-supplied cruise missiles were used.
Unmanned vessels, known by many different names including sea drones and drone boats, operate on or below the water. 
They usually have built-in explosives and cameras that feed directly back to the person controlling them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Boureima Balima and Abdel-Kader Mazou NIAMEY (Reuters) -Niger's junta on Tuesday rejected the latest diplomatic mission from West African countries aimed at restoring constitutional order after a July 26 coup, resisting pressure from the United States and the United Nations to come to the negotiating table. Heads of state from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are preparing for a summit on Thursday to discuss their standoff with the junta, which defied an Aug. 6 deadline to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. ECOWAS defence chiefs agreed on Friday on a possible m...]]></summary>

After achieving a degree of success with the EV6 two years ago, the Koreans have upped the ante with an imposing and well-equipped EV9, albeit it at a high price. The first lavishly equipped Launch Edition with all-wheel drive will bend your bank balance to the tune of €83,190 in Europe. Prices for the base version with no gizmos hover around €70,000. The snub-nosed EV9 is big but not brutish. It stands at 5 metres from bumper to bumper in length and is designed to lure SUV buyers as well...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London-based sex worker Marin Scarlett and right-wing populist Nigel Farage might initially appear unlikely campaigning allies, but when it comes to the pitfalls of banking in Britain they share a common cause.
"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second-ranking US diplomat met Niger's military leaders on Monday to press to reverse a coup but reported no headway a day after an ultimatum from the West African bloc ECOWAS was ignored.
Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.
A source close to ECOWAS said an immediate military intervention to restore Bazoum was n…]]></summary>

The musician's funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

Ukraine has not taken direct responsibility for the string of attacks, including on the capital Moscow, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that "war" is coming to Russia.
Polls show the former stand-up comedian's crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country's most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.
Offering a rare glimpse at Ukraine's homegrown explosive drones, Prytula recently shared images of himself with a fleet in an undisclosed location.

This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing "greater flexibility and maritime capability" to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.
The US military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
