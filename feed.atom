WASHINGTON — In the chaotic final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, U.S. military analysts observed a white Toyota Corolla stop at what they believed was an Islamic State compound. 
The Americans were already on edge. Three days earlier, a suicide bomber had killed scores of Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at a main gate of the Kabul airport. Now, officials had intelligence that there would be another attack there, and that it would involve a white Corolla.

This year, Ukraine de facto became part of NATO - Reznikov  Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that this year, Ukraine de facto became part of NATO, and this cooperation will continue. 
According to Ukrinform, Reznikov said this in a post on Facebook. 
"The year 2022 was a year of great challenges as well as great changes. I thank our soldiers who mastered four types of Western MLRS and destroy the enemy with ten types of Western artillery. They successfully defend our skies with IRIS, NASAMS [air defense systems] and proved that they will be able to effectively use the Patriots. Today, they are rewriting the textbooks on military art," Reznikov said.

Zero Hedge: White House Delays Refill Of Strategic Oil Reserve, Balks At "Too Expensive" Offers 
The Biden administration had no problems aggressively draining the SPR by 1mmb/d at market prices in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine war, in hopes of lowering the price of gasoline ahead of November's elections and avoiding an inflationary midterm rout. However, when it comes to refilling the SPR, now that US emergency inventories are down to the lowest level since November 1983 and not too far from an all time low which threatens the structural integrity of the salt caverns the oil is deposited in, the White House has "unexpectedly" gotten cold feet.

Daily Mail: 'That was easy, huh?' Kevin McCarthy's opening speech sparks uproar as he issues warning to Hakeem Jeffries after FINALLY becoming Speaker following four days of chaos, 15 ballots and a near-punch up in Congress 
* The final vote tally was 216 for McCarthy, 211 for Democrat Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and six 'present' votes  
* After the 14th ballot left McCarthy one vote short of the speakership, he immediately walked over to 'present' voters Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz 
* Rep. Mike Rogers then lunged at Gaetz and had to be held back by Rep. Richard Hudson before an all-out fist fight could break out on the House floor 
On the 15th ballot over a series of four days, Rep. Kevin McCarthy finally won the coveted title: Speaker of the House.
'That was easy, huh?' McCarthy began in his victory speech - shortly after South Carolina Representative Mike Rogers had to be held back from attacking Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. 
The two Republicans almost came to blows over Gaetz's refusal to back McCarthy during the 14th vote, costing him that contest, with the violent clash coming as tempers frayed over the mammoth voting-process.

WNU Editor: I have to give credit where credit is due. 
The "Squad" for the Democrats had the opportunity to gain real power in the last Democrat controlled Congress but folded when threatened, choosing instead to be social and main stream media distractions. 
The Republicans in the Freedom caucus wanted to be positioned to have real power and influence, did not fold, and it looks like they got it. Only time will tell if it was worth it.]]></summary>

The DeBrief: DARPA Selects Boeing’s Aurora for Potentially Game-Changing X-Plane 
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has selected Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences to design and possibly build a potentially game-changing X-plane. Part of the agency’s Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effecters (CRANE) program, the revolutionary X-plane would employ Active Flow Control (AFC) instead of conventional control surfaces to maneuver the craft at ultra-fast speeds. 
If successful, the new X-plane could completely change the way high-speed aircraft fly by combining the simplicity and stability of AFC to improve overall reliability and performance while offering a lower radar cross-section.

Defense News: Pentagon racing to restore US superiority in hypersonics 
WASHINGTON — In 1959, the U.S. Air Force and Navy partnered with NASA to fly a piloted hypersonic test aircraft, the X-15, for the first time. 
During that flight, the high-speed vehicle designed to travel at speeds of at least Mach 5 was dropped from under the wing of a B-52 bomber flying over the Mojave Desert in Southern California. Pilot Scott Crossfield carried the aircraft to an altitude of 52,341 feet and reached a peak speed of Mach 2.11. 
The flight kicked off a robust testing effort, and over the next nine years, three X-15 aircraft flew 199 times. The program eventually surpassed performance targets and achieved what is still the nation’s the fastest piloted hypersonic flight at Mach 6.72, or 4,520 miles per hour. Though it ended in 1968, discoveries from the program continue to inform the government’s hypersonic vehicle research.

WNU Editor: Currently, Russia is the indisputable leader in the hypersonic weapons race and is gaining valuable operational experience with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM), which is said to have a maximum speed of Mach 10 (link here).]]></summary>

The Telegraph: Rumours swirl on North Korea succession as Kim Jong-un tours missile factory with daughter

SCMP: Chinese navy shows new heavy-lift ship carrier, revealing future role in wartime transport and vessel rescue 
* The Yinmahu is a semi-submersible heavy-lift ship that could ferry equipment and ships, rescue damaged vessels and serve as emergency repair dock 
* While Chinese state TV showed the ship doing various manoeuvres, it did not reveal the vessel's specifications or the trial locations

The Yinmahu, bearing the hull number 834, ran ship transport trials after travelling almost 1,000 nautical miles to several undisclosed locations recently, CCTV reported on Thursday.

Reuters: Russia sends more Arctic oil to China, India after sanctions 
SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Russia is sending more crude oil produced in the Arctic region to China and India, and at steeper discounts, after Europe slammed its doors shut on Russian supplies last month, trade sources and data show. 
Arctic grades Arco, Arco/Novy Port and Varandey do not normally head East but are now finding new homes further afield after the European Union, G7 nations and Australia introduced a price cap on Russian oil in December, on top of an EU embargo on Russian crude by sea. Sellers are selling the Russian crudes at bigger discounts as they absorb higher shipping costs. 
"All these Arctic crudes usually go to the EU but now they have to go elsewhere," a Singapore-based trader said. 
Arctic crude exports to India have steadily increased since May, with a record 6.67 million barrels loaded in November and 4.1 million barrels in December, Refinitiv data showed. Most of the supplies were Arco and Arco/Novy Port produced at fields operated by Gazprom Neft.

The Taliban have branded Prince Harry a 'big mouth loser' after he revealed he killed 25 of their fighters while serving in Afghanistan in his new tell-all memoir Spare. 
Speaking to MailOnline, the militants taunted the Duke of Sussex - who wrote that he viewed their fighters as 'chess pieces' - saying they had had the last laugh over the West after recapturing the country in 2021. 
The Taliban claimed while their fighters are the ultimate victors of the conflict, Harry had 'fled to his grandmother's palace' and is now struggling to maintain a place in the Royal Family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FOX News: China COVID crisis: Beijing hospital runs out of beds, families burn bodies in streets as deaths spike 
One report claimed that hospitals told patients to bring their own bed due to shortage 
A Beijing hospital has run out of beds, forcing patients to rest on stretchers or lay on the hallway floors as COVID-19 infections run rampant in the country and stretch thin the public health sectors’ resources. 
"We have no beds, we have no oxygen, and we have a room full of sick people waiting," a health care worker in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital’s emergency room told the Financial Times ahead of Christmas. 
China has watched as cases of COVID-19 spiked following the rollback of the country’s "zero-COVID" policy as the abrupt shift occurred without any increase in vaccinations. Instead, officials tried to simply bolster hospitals in anticipation of a new COVID-19 wave by establishing hundreds of "fever clinics" to increase testing.

DW: Spike in German troop numbers asking not to be sent to war 
It's fewer than 1,000 troops, but nevertheless, the number of German Bundeswehr soldiers who asked to be exempted from serving in war zones rose markedly in 2022. This option dates back to the era of national service. 
Almost 1,000 German military personnel applied for an exemption from serving in combat zones in 2022, a sharp rise on 2021's figures, according to a report published on Friday. 
A spokesperson for the German ministry responsible for processing the applications told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland group of newspapers that 951 Bundeswehr soldiers had applied for the exemption. 
 "In 2021, 201 applications for exemption from combat service were received, in 2022 it was a total of 951 applications," the spokesperson for the Ministry for Family and Civil Affairs told the newspapers.  
The Bundeswehr has roughly 183,000 serving personnel, meaning far fewer than 1% of troops applied for the status in all.

Reuters: World food prices hit record high in 2022 
PARIS (Reuters) -A surge in the cost of most food commodities last year, as the disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of shortages, sent the U.N. food agency's average price index to the highest level on record. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 143.7 points in 2022, up 14.3% from 2021, and the highest since records started in 1990, the agency said on Friday. 
The index had already gained 28% in 2021 from the previous year as the world economy recovered from the impact of the pandemic. 
Food prices surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year on fears of disruptions to Black Sea trade. T
hey have pared some of their gains since, in part because of a U.N.-backed grain export channel from Ukraine and the prospect of improved supplies in producing countries.

In a recent interview, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence hinted at a possible end date for his country's war with Russia. 
Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, told ABC News in an interview shared by the outlet on Wednesday that he expects the "hottest" fighting between Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces to occur in March. 
Budanov added that he expects Ukraine's military to make a large push against the invading Russians in the spring. According to him, those efforts could lead to what Ukraine feels would be an end to the war. 
"This is [when we will see more] liberation of territories and dealing the final defeats to the Russian Federation," Budanov said. "This will happen throughout Ukraine, from Crimea to the Donbas."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[reported that a passenger on an Air India flight was detained after drunkenly urinating on an empty seat and another passenger's blanket.


	"Officers from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), an Indian federal police force, detained the man when the flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Fortune reported," the story continued. "The man and the other passenger discussed the incident came to an 'understanding,' an airline representative said. He gave the passenger a written apology, and she did not want the airline to file a police report. The man was then allowed to leave the airport."

similar incident happened last month, when a business class passenger urinated on an elderly woman. According to The Hindu, "The airline not only failed to hand him over to security personnel but also forced the woman to sit in the urine-soaked seat for a part of her journey."

This comes after a number of U.S. airlines went through years of elevated incidents on flights, spurred in part by passengers enraged over mask rules during the COVID-19 pandemic — something which the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately cracked down on with stiff fines, penalties, and criminal referrals in the most severe cases.
In one highly-publicized incident, an intoxicated American Airlines passenger on a flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City screamed racist threats at an Asian woman who had gotten up to stretch her back, then snarled and gnawed on his mask like an animal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Russia accuses Ukraine of shelling its positions as Putin's unilateral 36-hour 'truce' - dismissed as a sham by the West - gets underway 
* Russia's 36-hour ceasefire to allow for Orthodox Christmas celebrations was set to begin at midday, after it was ordered by Vladimir Putin on Thursday evening 
* But outgoing and incoming shelling could still be heard in eastern Ukraine 
* Ukrainian officials said the city of Kramatorsk was hit, as was Kherson 
Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its positions as Vladimir Putin's unilateral 36-hour 'truce' gets under today, with Ukraine blaming Moscow for the strikes. 
The ceasefire - proposed by the Russian despot on Thursday to run from from 12pm, January 6 to midnight on January 8 - was rejected Thursday  by Ukraine as a Moscow sham, with analysts suggesting it was an attempt to allow Putin's forces to regroup. 
Just hours after the 36-hour truce was set to begin, rockets slammed into a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk close to Bakhmut and on the eastern frontline, damaging 14 homes but with no casualties, the mayor said.

Breaking Defense: F-35 program pauses engine acceptance as crash investigation continues  
The news comes just a few days after prime contractor Lockheed Martin reached an agreement with the government on a $30 billion contract for hundreds more F-35s. 
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has temporarily stopped accepting engines for the F-35 joint strike fighter while it investigates the cause of a mid-December crash of an F-35B jet. 
“Currently, acceptance of new engines has been suspended,” JPO spokesman Chief Petty Officer Matthew Olay said in a statement. “That pause began Tuesday, Dec. 27. The length of the pause is currently to be determined, and it is hard to say how long it will last given the current investigation of what specifically would allow deliveries to resume. The root cause analysis and accident investigation need to be completed first.”

Armed men took hostages, burned vehicles and stormed an airport in northern Mexico on Thursday after federal forces captured Ovidio Guzmán, one of the world's most wanted cartel leaders and the son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. 
The 33-year-old drug boss was arrested after a predawn gunfight in a town north of the city of Culiacán, a stronghold of the Guzmáns’ Sinaloa cartel. 
Even as the cartel mounted attacks across the state, the air force was able to fly the younger Guzmán to Mexico City, said Mexican Secretary of Defense Luis Cresencio Sandoval González.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kenyan police are investigating the killing of an LGBTQ rights activist whose body was discovered stuffed in a metal trunk in a killing that has sparked national outrage.
Edwin Chiloba, a 25-year-old fashion designer and model, was found dead by the roadside Wednesday some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the Rift Valley town of Eldoret, media reports said.
Police spokesperson Resila Onyango told Kenya's The Star newspaper that the motive of the killing was still unknown.
"Experts are handling the matter," Onyango said.
Rights activists have called for speedy investigations into attacks on LGBTQ people who face a precarious existence in the predominantly conservative Christian nation.
Homosexuality is taboo in Kenya and across much of Africa, and gays often face discrimination or persecution.
Attempts to overturn British colonial-era laws banning homosexuality in Kenya have proven unsuccessful, and gay sex remains a punishable crime with penalties that include imprisonment of up to 14 years.
"It is truly worrisome that we continue to witness escalation in violence targeting LGBTQ+ Kenyans," the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Friday.
"Everyday, the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons are being violated with little consequence for perpetrators," it added, urging the police "to conduct swift investigations and ensure the killers are apprehended and prosecuted".
The Kenya LGBTQ Feminist Forum in western Kenya where Chiloba lived, said he had used "fashion to deconstruct gender and advocate for the rights of the marginalized group".
"We want to know as a community as Kenyans, what happened to Edwin, why he was murdered and who dropped his body at the scene," the group's programs director Becky Mududa said.
The death of Chiloba comes after another LGBTQ activist was found murdered in April last year.

Zero Hedge: Shots Fired In Tense Greece-Turkey Patrol Boat Ramming Incident 
Turkish media is confirming a major incident between a Turkish coast guard vessel and a Greek coast guard patrol boat on Thursday, describing that the Greek patrol was harassing Turkish fishing boats before Turkish coast guard authorities intervened. But Athens has countered that it was the Turkish side harassing Greek vessels. 
Both sides are saying warning shots were fired and are attributing acts of aggression to the other side: "A Greek coast guard patrol boat’s crew fired warning shots early Thursday to deter a Turkish coast guard vessel that was trying to ram them in the eastern Aegean Sea, authorities in Athens said, as tensions between the two neighbors remain high," the Associated Press reports.

Defense News/AP: Drone advances in Ukraine could bring new age of warfare 
KYIV, Ukraine — Drone advances in Ukraine have accelerated a long-anticipated technology trend that could soon bring the world’s first fully autonomous fighting robots to the battlefield, inaugurating a new age of warfare. 
The longer the war lasts, the more likely it becomes that drones will be used to identify, select and attack targets without help from humans, according to military analysts, combatants and artificial intelligence researchers. 
That would mark a revolution in military technology as profound as the introduction of the machine gun. Ukraine already has semi-autonomous attack drones and counter-drone weapons endowed with AI. Russia also claims to possess AI weaponry, though the claims are unproven. But there are no confirmed instances of a nation putting into combat robots that have killed entirely on their own.

Navy XQ-58As loaded with sensors and weapons will help demonstrate autonomous drone capabilities able to penetrate enemy air defenses.  
The U.S. Navy is set to become the newest operator of Kratos' XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, at least that we know about. The service recently awarded the company a contract for the purchase of two of these stealthy low-cost uncrewed aircraft as part of a previously unknown program called the Penetrating Affordable Autonomous Collaborative Killer. The U.S. Air Force, the only currently known user of the XQ-58A, has been using its Valkyries for various test purposes, including projects that are feeding into the classified Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. 
The Pentagon announced that the Navy had finalized a deal to buy the pair of XQ-58As in a daily contracting notice on December 30, 2022. The contract, which came through Naval Air Systems Command's (NAVAIR) Naval Air Warfare Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) and is valued at $15,515,343, covers the production and delivery of the drones, as well as unspecified "sensor and weapon system payloads."

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Cold War estimates of deaths in nuclear conflict 
Apprehension about Russia’s war against Ukraine has produced speculation about the possibility of limited Russian nuclear strikes against targets in that country. Especially worrisome is the danger of a local conflict escalating quickly into a major nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States and other NATO countries. However unlikely that prospect, a large-scale nuclear war involving countries with strategic nuclear forces could cause huge numbers of fatalities and injuries in addition to the losses produced by climactic impacts. A recent study in the journal Nature projects a catastrophic 5 billion deaths.

WNU Editor: Let us just say that when a nuclear conflict is finally over, hundreds of millions (if not billions) will be dead.

Reuters: Russia's Medvedev snaps back after U.S. appeal over Ukraine war 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday warned the United States that hypersonic missiles would soon be close to NATO's shores after the U.S. embassy said in a video it stood in solidarity with Russians who opposed the war in Ukraine. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the most deadly wars in Europe since World War Two and the deepest crisis in Moscow's relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. 
"The main gift for the New Year with an ammunition package of Zircon missiles left yesterday for the shores of NATO countries," Medvedev said, referring to President Vladimir Putin's deployment of a warship with hypersonic cruise missiles to the Atlantic. 
Medvedev said the missiles could be placed 100 miles (160 km) off the U.S. coast, adding: "So rejoice! It will bring to their senses anyone who poses a direct threat to Russia and our allies."

RT: Serbia issues grim prediction for 2023  
President Aleksandar Vucic has warned of food and energy shortages due to anti-Russia sanctions 
The US, EU and China face serious economic struggles in 2023, which is shaping up to be more difficult than the previous year, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic warned on Wednesday. 
Belgrade is trying to stock up on basic food supplies, as the world is likely to face shortages soon, he added.  “I expect 2023 to be much more difficult than 2022,” Vucic told reporters in Belgrade. 
The US federal reserve has raised interest rates, “China’s growth rate has slowed, the EU is approaching a recession,” he added. “We’re a part of that chain, so that will impact us as well.”
Serbia has taken precautions to stock up on natural gas and coal, and should have some left over by the spring, Vucic said, but he is working with Hungary to “secure supplies right away for the next winter, which will be worse.”

The former head of Russia’s space agency, who was hit by a French-made howitzer during a Ukrainian attack on Donetsk last month, has sent Emmanuel Macron a piece of the shrapnel that was removed from his body. 
Dmitry Rogozin, who has also served as Russia’s deputy prime minister, was injured when a Ukrainian shelling attack hit the restaurant outside Donetsk where he was celebrating his birthday, according to the independent Russian outlet SOTA. 
Mr Rogozin, 59, was visiting Ukraine and giving military advice to Russian troops in two regions that were annexed by Russia in December.

CNN: China’s new supercarrier will soon undergo first sea trials, officer says 
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — The Chinese navy’s massive new aircraft carrier, the CNS Fujian, is expected to head to sea for the first time this year, the ship’s executive officer said in an interview with state media. 
In a report on the interview published Tuesday by state-run China Daily, Senior Capt. Qian Shumin did not give an exact date for when the aircraft carrier will undergo its first sea excursions, saying only that “the trials will contribute to the realization of the centenary goals of the People’s Liberation Army.”
That centenary, which comes in 2027, was referenced by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in October as a deadline for the PLA to meet its modernization goals. 
The Fujian is the largest warship China has ever built and bringing it into operation is a key component in the PLA Navy’s objectives.

Under the terms of the deal, CAPEIC will invest $150 million per year over the next three years in Afghanistan, then $540 million per year for the next 22 years. The Taliban will carry a 20% share in the project but will have the option to increase its stake to 75%.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican security forces captured on Thursday drug cartel leader Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, ahead of a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden next week.
Coming three years after a failed operation to detain Ovidio ended in humiliation for the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the arrest triggered a wave of violence that forced authorities to shutter airports and schools in the city of Culiacan.
Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told a news conference that security forces had captured the 32-year-old senior member of the Sinaloa Cartel. Ovidio, a fugitive since the previous arrest attempt, was now being held in the capital Mexico City, Sandoval said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - "That's an attack plane, Dad," said one of David Tellez's young children as they spotted Mexican military aircraft touching down alongside their Aeromexico passenger plane early on Thursday.
Then the gunfire began.
"As we were accelerating for take-off, we heard gunshots very close to the plane, and that's when we all threw ourselves to the floor," Tellez said after the incident in the northern city of Culiacan.
Violence broke out on Thursday throughout Culiacan after the arrest of Ovidio Guzman, the son of the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo, and a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel.
Aeromexico said nobody on Tellez's flight had been hurt. The Culiacan airport closed shortly after, as security forces patrolled the city, which was strewn with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANU Political Scientist Dr Charles Miller says it is “imperative” for the US Republican Party to unite as they remain divided over Kevin McCarthy’s bid for House speaker amid his tenth ballot loss.

“The Republican party is divided between individuals like Mr McCarthy who try and talk the Trumpist populist talk, versus people like Boebert or Gatez who at least appear to be true believers in the Trumpist creed,” Dr Miller told Sky News Australia.

“If the Republicans keep behaving like this, then it will hurt them with the election, they do appear chaotic and unable to do the most basic things when they are in power.

“If things continue in this vein we could be in for a bumpy ride, especially when we’re talking about things that matter for the rest of the world.”]]></summary>

South Korean officials now admit they failed to stop a North Korean drone flying close to the presidential office in the capital.  
A North Korean drone last week entered a no-fly zone around the office of the South Korean president, military officials in Seoul have confirmed. 
The North Korean unmanned aerial vehicle was one of five that crossed the border on December 26, in the first incident of its kind in five years, which you can read about in our previous coverage here. 
While various South Korean military aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drones, none were shot down, leading to growing criticism about the ability of Seoul’s air defenses to tackle these kinds of threats.

        <updated>2023-01-06T00:12:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Thursday, part of what the U.S. military calls routine activity but which riles China.
In recent years, U.S. warships, and on occasion those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada, have sailed through the strait, drawing the ire of China, which claims Taiwan against the objections of its democratically elected government.
In a statement, the U.S. military said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Chung-Hoon carried out the transit.
"Chung-Hoon’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific," the statement added.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said the ship sailed in a northerly direction through the strait, that its forces had monitored its passage and observed nothing out of the ordinary.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People's Republic of China.
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
China has never ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.
A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.

Grey Zone Ethics: A Practitioners Guide to Making Ethically Difficult Decisions
A new book from Small Wars Journal contributor, Dan Pace.  It is a followup to his journal article "A House Divided: A Look at SOF Values"
The special operations community has an ethics problem. While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn't preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community's treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set.  Grey Zone Ethics provides an accessible and realistic solution to this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Ukraine war: Kyiv rejects Putin's 'trivial' Christmas truce 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to impose a 36-hour ceasefire on the Ukrainian frontline, beginning on Friday. 
The ceasefire, scheduled to start at 12:00 Moscow time (09:00 GMT), will coincide with the Russian Orthodox Christmas. 
Mr Putin asked Ukraine to reciprocate, but Kyiv quickly rejected the request. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the truce was an attempt to stop his country's military advances. 
The Kremlin statement appeared to stress that President Putin ordered his troops to stop fighting not because he was de-escalating - Putin never de-escalates - but because he had listened to an appeal from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
Patriarch Kirill had, earlier in the day, called for a Christmas truce to allow believers to attend church services for Orthodox Christmas.

WNU Editor: Cannot say that I am surprised by this rejection from the Ukraine government. In a way this ceasefire call was a trap. The optics of rejecting a Christmas truce is never good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Qin Gang responded to the restrictions on high-level access by relying on lower-level interactions with other foreign ambassadors and state and municipal-level officials. Elizabeth Dalziel/AP Photo   
Politico:  Why China’s new foreign minister could be a problem for Biden 
Qin Gang’s cooperation could decide the outcome of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s looming China trip. 
The Biden administration shut out outgoing Chinese ambassador Qin Gang for much of his more than 500-day tenure in Washington, D.C.  But that all changed last week when Chinese leader Xi Jinping appointed Qin as the country’s new foreign minister, creating a headache for the administration at a time of high tension between Washington and Beijing. 
The problems will be front and center in the coming weeks when Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits China as the countries clash over trade, Chinese military intimidation of Taiwan and access to technology. 
“I think that there are probably those within the administration that feel chagrined that they did not extend the courtesies [to Qin] that normally would be extended to an ambassador,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.

WNU Editor: How Chinese ambassador Qin Gang was treated by the West does not surprise me. I have seen this type of treatment directed at Chinese officials and diplomats by Western officials and politicians for decades. 
What is a shame. The Chinese look to establish long term relations, especially long term personal relationships. 
The Washington DC elite should be kicking themselves. They lost a golden opportunity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intense gunfire rocked a cartel heartland in northwestern Mexico on Thursday after security forces launched an operation in which a son of jailed drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was reportedly arrested.
Vehicles were set on fire and shooting shook several areas of Culiacan -- the state capital of the Guzmans' bastion, Sinaloa -- including the city's airport, an AFP reporter said.
A security source who did not want to be named told AFP that the violence had broken out after an operation to capture Ovidio Guzman, but did not confirm reports by Milenio TV and other media that he had been captured.
The drug lord's son has allegedly helped to run the notorious Sinaloa Cartel since his father was extradited to the United States in 2017.
His capture would be a high-profile win in the war on drugs as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to welcome US President Joe Biden next week for a North America leaders' summit.
The Sinaloa state government urged people to stay at home on Thursday as the unrest sparked panic among residents seeking shelter.
Lopez Obrador told reporters that his government would announce the result of the operation later in the day.
"El Chapo" is serving a life prison sentence in the United States for trafficking hundreds of tons of drugs into the US over the course of 25 years.
However, his cartel remains one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Ovidio Guzman was captured briefly once before in 2019, but security forces freed him after his cartel waged an all-out war in response in the streets of Culiacan.

The 38-year-old Duke of Sussex wants the world to know the "truth" about his childhood, forever marked by the death of his mother, Princess Diana.
His autobiography, titled "Spare", will detail his contempt for the British tabloids and his arguments with brother and heir to the throne Prince William.
William once threw his younger brother to the ground in a row over the latter's American wife, Meghan, according to an excerpt from Harry's autobiography reported by The Guardian newspaper.

The new campus, though, will be a first of its kind and an important addition.   It will represent the ethos, academic principles and 450-year-old tradition of excellence of Harrow School in the UK. But it will also be groundbreaking by offering an authentic Hong Kong curriculum leading to the DSE, with the option of the IB Diploma programme in the senior years.

Or they might be foreign passport holders who want their kids to experience a Hong Kong education and the all-round benefits of a boarding education in Shenzhen.   Whether enrolled as boarders or day pupils, all incoming students will enter a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Greater Vancouver Zoo is being sued after a toddler was attacked by bears into whose enclosure she had reached.
"The notice of civil claim filed in British Columbia Supreme Court by the girl’s guardian, Richard Hanson, says the August, 2019, incident left her with a fractured wrist, and one of her fingers was partially amputated," said the report. "The lawsuit filed last month alleges the zoo and K-Bros Developments Corporation, which owns the property in Langley, B.C., owed a duty of care to the child, who was two years old at the time, given their control of the premises and the bears."
"It says the girl had reached through an 'unguarded chain link fence' at the zoo’s black bear exhibit and a 'group' of the animals 'attacked and mauled' her arm," said the report. "BC Emergency Health Services issued a statement shortly after the incident, saying a patient had been airlifted from the zoo in serious condition. Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court."
The lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being "vicious", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.
"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises," said the report. "It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl."
Zoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of "petting or feeding" the animals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France should be in a strong position as Europe reels from the energy crisis, drawing on the renowned nuclear industry that supplies the lion’s share of its power. But France’s nuclear sector has been going through a tricky time, as a significant proportion of its reactors have had to close for maintenance. Analysts blame a mixture of bad luck and the consequences of a political deal from a decade ago.
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Europe’s energy crisis and climate change racks the world, you could expect France to be congratulating itself on its vast fleet of nuclear power stations. After all, nuclear energy produces barely any CO2 and does not leave countries relying on Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States plans to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela under a program paired with expulsions of people from those countries caught at the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. and Mexican officials said.
The expanded humanitarian program would build on a policy launched in October that allowed thousands of Venezuelans to enter by air if they applied from abroad and could demonstrate they had a U.S. sponsor, two U.S. and one Mexican official said on Wednesday.
The details on the planned program come as U.S. President Joe Biden plans to give a border security-themed speech on Thursday and intends to visit the U.S.-Mexico border next week, addressing an issue that has challenged the Dem…]]></summary>

By early evening, there were no reports of clashes with police, who closed off access to Congress, though transport authorities reported 35 blockade points across the country.
Almost two dozen died in protests across the country last month.
On Wednesday, protesters marched in Lima and Arequipa, many carrying the country's red-and-white flag, and demanded the resignation of current President Dina Boluarte, closure of Congress, changes to the constitution and Castillo's release.
Meanwhile, authorities said trains to the Inca citadel of Machu Picc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong residents have swamped clinics to get vaccinated against COVID-19 ahead of the expected reopening of the city's border with mainland China, which some people fear will bring a surge of infections to the financial hub.
City government centres providing shots produced by BioNTech have in recent days been mostly booked solid, some until February, in contrast with a few weeks ago when anyone seeking a vaccine could stroll into a nearly empty facility.
"After the opening of the border, I expect there will be more infected people on the streets, I want to reduce my chance of getting infected,” said a Hong Kong resident surnamed Wan, 33, who got his fourth shot this week.
Hong Kong’s government announced plans to reopen its border and resume restriction-free travel…]]></summary>

Protesters used stones and burning tires to barricade main routes in the southern regions of Puno, Cusco, Apurimac and Arequipa, as well as Junin in the center, chanting for Boluarte to leave.
She took over on December 7 as the South American country's first woman president following the impeachment and arrest of Pedro Castillo after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Castillo, a leftist former rural school teacher and union leader, faced vehement opposition from Congress during his 18 months in office, and had been the subject of numerous criminal investigations…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unknown vandals desecrated a Protestant cemetery in Jerusalem, damaging more than 30 gravestones, according to Israeli media reports.

Israeli radio reported considerable damage to the Zion cemetery on Wednesday, with gravestones damaged and crosses broken.
The Jerusalem Post, citing Jerusalem University College, reported that the perpetrators were two Jewish teenagers, saying the damage amounted to the equivalent of $99,700.
An Israeli police spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that an investigation was under way, but did not comment on the identity of the suspects.
A video shared on social media showed two figures throwing large stones at graves and overturning a cross.
The incident reportedly occurred on Sunday.
The cemetery, founded in 1848, also serves as a burial place for Jerusalem's German-speaking Protestant community. The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, spoke on Twitter of "contemptible criminal behaviour" by the perpetrators. "I hope the police will investigate, find these guys and bring them to justice."
The desecrated graves included those of three Palestinian police officers and members of various Protestant congregations, according to media reports, including bishop Samuel Gobat, Jerusalem's second Protestant bishop. He had bought the land for the cemetery.
The cemetery has been desecrated before and there have been previous incidents of hostility towards Christians in Jerusalem.
