Washington Post: Ukraine planned attacks on Russian forces in Syria, leaked document shows 
Ukraine’s military intelligence agency developed plans to conduct covert attacks on Russian forces in Syria using secret Kurdish help, according to a leaked top-secret U.S. intelligence document. 
The introduction of a new battlefield — thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine — appeared designed to impose costs and casualties on Russia and its Wagner paramilitary group, which is active in Syria, and possibly force Moscow to redeploy resources from Ukraine.

Business Insider: Russian outlets are exaggerating that Ukrainian troops are stuck in the mud to cheer up Putin's soldiers, UK intel says 
 * Russian media is exaggerating the mud's impact on Ukrainian forces, UK intel reports. 
 * Their goal is "aimed at raising Russian morale" and "undermining Ukraine's supporters," intel says. 
 * One commander told RIA Novosti that Russian forces "drowned" a German Leopard tank in a swamp. 
Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces has slowed down thanks to thick, wet mud in the region — and Russian media outlets are likely exaggerating the impact of the mud on Kyiv's troops in order to raise the morale of the Kremlin's soldiers, new UK intelligence suggests.

Russian outlets, however, appear to be "exaggerating the overall impact of mud on Ukrainian forces," UK intel said.

WNU Editor: I am not there, but I have more than my share of being stuck in the mud in both Russia and Ukraine in the past. It can get really bad, especially in the open fields. But summer is quickly approaching, and I have been told that this was an unusually mild winter. This means less moisture in the land, and the summer heat and sun will quickly dry it up.]]></summary>

The document’s anonymous authors say Canada’s “widespread” military deficiencies are harming ties with security partners and allies. 
The document, which has not been previously reported on, says “enduring” defense shortfalls led the Canadian Armed Forces to assess in February that it “could not conduct a major operation while simultaneously maintaining its NATO battle group leadership [in Latvia] and aid to Ukraine” — and that the situation was not “likely” to change without a shift in public opinion.

* Russia's crude oil sales to China surged to its historic high in March. 
* Chinese refiners purchased discounted ESPO and Urals crudes from Russia.

Russian crude arrivals to China surged to a record high of 2.26 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, up by 50% compared to 1.50 million bpd in March 2022, per data from China’s General Administration of Customs cited by Reuters.

Reuters: Russian billionaires see wealth rise to over half a trillion dollars, Forbes Russia reports 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's richest people added $152 billion to their wealth over the past year, buoyed by high prices for natural resources and rebounding from the huge loss of fortunes they experienced just after the Ukraine war began, Forbes Russia said. 
Russia has 110 official billionaires in the list, up 22 from last year, according to Forbes' Russian edition, which said their total wealth increased to $505 billion from $353 billion when the 2022 list was announced. 
The list would have been longer had not five billionaires - DST Global founder Yuri Milner, Revolut founder Nikolay Storonsky, Freedom Finance founder Timur Turlov, and JetBrains co-founders Sergei Dmitriev and Valentin Kipyatkov - renounced their Russian citizenship, Forbes said.

(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine is looking for investors brave enough to bet that it will beat back Russia’s invasion with a simple pitch: High risk can offer high reward. 
As it fights to defend itself in a war that has killed tens of thousands of its people and devastated the economy, the country is preparing to sell big government-run firms at distressed prices. The aim is to shore up the aid-dependent budget and end a decades-old, post-communist legacy of corruption and mismanagement that has undercut the economy.
If lawmakers agree on changes at a session slated for the start of May, Kyiv could earn more than $400 million in a best-case scenario by selling enterprises ranging from a fertilizer producer to utilities, smelters and an insulin maker. Another $190 million could come from leasing farmland, Rustem Umerov, the head of the State Property Fund, said in an interview.

WNU Editor: There is a reason why no one is buying these assets. The rule of law, specifically contract law, is being completely ignored in Ukraine. I see this attempt to sell these assets (at pennies on the dollar) as one last attempt by the powers that be in Kyiv to try and grab as much money as they can before this house of cards collapses. 
Update: Here is an easy prediction. If this money is transferred to Ukraine, it will disappear like everything else .... US Justice Department Seeks New Authority to Transfer Seized Russian Assets to Ukraine (VOA).]]></summary>

 * A record 69% of the public holds negative views about the economy both now and in the future, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. 
* President Joe Biden’s approval rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey. 
* Just 24% say now is a good time to invest in stocks, also the lowest reading in the survey’s 17-year history. 
Amid persistent inflation, higher interest rates and recession worries, Americans have never been more negative about the economy, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. 
A record 69% of the public holds negative views about the economy both now and in the future, the highest percentage in the survey’s 17-year history. 
The survey of 1,000 people nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-3.1%, found that about two-thirds of Americans say their wages are falling behind inflation, and two-thirds say the nation is headed for recession or already in one. 
The fallout from these negative views is hitting President Joe Biden’s approval rating. 
His overall rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey.

Summit News: GOP Lawmakers: Endless Ukraine Aid “Will Only Prolong The Conflict”

 
"There is no end in sight and no clear strategy to bring this war to a close”

Republican Senators and Representatives have penned a letter to Joe Biden demanding that aid to Ukraine be halted, charging that sending endless amounts of money and military supplies to the country without a clear strategy “will only prolong the conflict.” 
“We write to express concern regarding the U.S. response to Ukraine. Over a year ago, Russia launched an invasion that has upended decades of peace in Europe. We are deeply concerned that the trajectory of U.S. aid to the Ukrainian war effort threatens further escalation and lacks much-needed strategic clarity,” the letter signed by 19 lawmakers reads. 
It comes as the White House approved a fresh Ukraine military aid package Wednesday consisting of $325 million worth of battlefield supplies. 
“There is no end in sight and no clear strategy to bring this war to a close,” the Senators continued in the letter.

The revelation comes amid ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade and geopolitics, as concerns rise that China may try to invade Taiwan, a territory it considers its own.

The Independent: China says those who oppose its efforts to control Taiwan are ‘playing with fire’ 
China’s foreign minister on Friday ramped up threats against Taiwan and warned countries supporting the self-governed island that they were "playing with fire". 
Qin Gang made the remarks at the end of a speech espousing China's contribution to the global economy and the interests of developing nations, in which he repeatedly praised Chinese president Xi Jinping's Global Security Initiative. 
At the end of the speech in Shanghai, Mr Qin spoke about what he called the "Taiwan problem", adding that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to China.

The US will begin training Ukrainian forces on how to operate Abrams tanks next month as it seeks to get them on to the battlefield against Russia before the end of the summer.

Their exclusion from public life is having dire consequences for the entire country. We discuss the situation with Melissa Cornet, a human rights researcher who works with the NGO CARE. She notes that the lack of new female graduates means that there will soon be no more women teachers, doctors or nurses in Afghanistan. She also points out that while bans on female aid workers are having a devastating effect, many NGOs are closing not because of the bans, but due to lack of funding – with only 5 percent of Afghanistan's humanitarian needs currently being met.]]></summary>

Navy Times: Popular San Diego web cameras removed at Navy’s request 
A group that runs an array of San Diego-based web cameras that capture Navy ships coming and going is calling foul after the National Parks Service removed two cameras overlooking San Diego Bay this month at the Navy’s request. 
While Navy officials framed the recent cam removal as a matter of force protection, Barry Bahrami, a 52-year-old San Diego local who runs the volunteer San Diego Web Cam group, alleges that the cameras were removed from Cabrillo National Monument after they captured an embarrassing near-collision of two Navy ships in November. 
That close call between the guided-missile destroyer Momsen and the dock landing ship Harpers Ferry came to be known as the “warship chicken” incident after San Diego Web Cam footage of the encounter went viral. 
The parks service confirmed Friday that it had removed the two cameras at Cabrillo after the Naval Criminal Investigative Service requested they be removed “due to security concerns.” Bahrami said he was notified of the removal on April 11.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Friday that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to China, and that it is right and proper for China to uphold its sovereignty. 
Qin made the remarks at the Lanting Forum in Shanghai, where he discussed a wide range of topics from debt, the global economy, and Taiwan. 
"Recently there has been absurd rhetoric accusing China of upending the status quo, disrupting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait," Qin said. "The logic is absurd and the conclusion dangerous."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SCMP: US cannot use Philippines to store arms meant for defending Taiwan, Manila says 
* Washington has access to 9 sites near the Taiwan Strait and the disputed South China Sea, under a military defence pact with Manila 
* China has criticised the deal, accusing the US of taking advantage of the bases to interfere in the situation across the Taiwan Strait to serve its 'geopolitical goals' 
The Philippines has ruled out the United States stockpiling weapons that could be deployed to defend Taiwan on bases the security ally has access to under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). 
Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said Washington would not be permitted to conduct activities that were not stipulated in the 2014 deal.

"Our view is that EDCA is not aimed at any third country outside its meant for use for the Philippines," Manalo told a senate hearing on Wednesday.

U.S. SPR RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL FELL BY 1.58 MILLION BARRELS LAST WEEK TO 368 MILLION BARRELS, LOWEST SINCE OCT 1983
— Market Rebellion (@MarketRebels) April 17, 2023
  
Reuters: U.S. Emergency Oil Reserves Tumble to Lowest Since 1984 
HOUSTON (Reuters) -U.S. emergency crude oil stocks fell 8.4 million barrels last week to 434.1 million barrels, their lowest since October 1984, according to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) data released on Monday. 
The release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the week ended Sept. 9 was the steepest draw since May. It comprised of about 6.3 million barrels of sweet crude and around 2 million barrels of sour crude. 
President Joe Biden in March set a plan to release 1 million barrels per day over six months from the SPR to tackle high U.S. fuel prices, which have contributed to soaring inflation. 
The Biden administration is weighing the need for further SPR releases after the current program ends in October, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Reuters last week. A DOE spokesperson later said the White House at that time was not considering new releases beyond the 180 million barrels.

The Independent: China resumes construction on fifth Antarctica base, shows new satellite imagery 
China has resumed construction of its fifth research facility in Antarctica after a years-long lull, a new report has said. 
Beijing is building new support facilities and groundwork for a larger structure in Antarctica’s southern polar region, revealed a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published on Tuesday. 
The report said the new station, on Inexpressible Island near the Ross Sea, is expected to include an observatory with a satellite ground station, and should help China “fill in a major gap” in its ability to access the continent, said the report. 
The report said construction on the country’s fifth station in the southern polar region resumed for the first time since 2018.

Newsweek: Exclusive: Navy Will Spend $200 Billion—Equal to Ukraine's GDP—on Subs It Barely Uses 
The U.S. Navy plans to expand its submarine fleet at a cost of $200 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Ukraine. But as Republicans hotly debate ongoing military aid to Kiev, neither party has questioned the far more costly submarine program—allowing the Navy to conceal a startling fact about America's submarine fleet. The Navy calls its submarines "the most lethal and capable force." It is also the "silent service," shrouded in secrecy, the nature of its operations closely guarded. 
The American attack submarine force—the "fighting" submarines—exists in order to pursue enemy submarines and ships, eavesdrop on adversaries and support operations by special forces. Hollywood productions like The Hunt for Red October have created the impression of submarines tracking the enemy while moving noiselessly under the sea, operating stealthily for months on end. The reality is markedly different. The U.S. Navy can deploy barely a quarter of its attack submarine force at any one time, and last year, despite a war raging in Ukraine and China's rise as a global superpower, only 10 percent of its submarines operated stealthily by spending more than 30 days fully submerged.

The latest IMF figures reveal that BRICS nations will contribute 32.1 percent to global growth, compared to the G7's 29.9 percent. 
The member states of the BRICS group, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are expected to surpass the US-led G7 states in economic growth expectations, according to a Bloomberg report. 
 Bloomberg estimates that the BRICS nations will contribute 32.1 percent of global growth, compared to the G7’s 29.9 percent, based on the most recent IMF figures. 
According to the Bloomberg analysis, the G7 and BRICS nations each contributed equally to global economic growth in 2020. The western-led bloc’s performance, however, has since declined. The G7 is expected to make up just 27.8 percent of the global economy by 2028, while BRICS will make up 35 percent. 
“In total, 75 percent of global growth is expected to be concentrated in 20 countries and over half in the top four: China, India, the US, and Indonesia. While Group of Seven countries will comprise a smaller share, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and France are seen among the top 10 contributors,” Bloomberg reports.

"We say to them that Australian producers have used those terms for a very long time – in many cases, they have cultural connections to the use of those terms as well because, of course, as a multicultural country, we've had people bring literally their Prosecco vines from their villages in Italy.

The US military is deploying “additional capabilities” nearby Sudan to secure the US embassy in the country and assist with a potential evacuation, if the situation calls for it, the Defense Department announced on Thursday. 
That includes hundreds of Marines who are already in Camp Lemmonier in Djibouti, a US defense official told CNN, with aircraft capable of bringing in ground units to secure an embassy. 
“The Department of Defense, through U.S. Africa Command, is monitoring the situation in Sudan and conducting prudent planning for various contingencies,” a statement from Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Phil Ventura said. “As part of this, we are deploying additional capabilities nearby in the region for contingency purposes related to securing and potentially facilitating the departure of U.S. Embassy personnel from Sudan, if circumstances require it.”

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's navy forced a U.S. submarine to surface as it entered the Gulf, Iranian navy commander Shahram Irani told state television on Thursday, but the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet denied such an incident had taken place. 
 "The U.S. submarine was approaching while submerged, but the Iranian submarine Fateh detected it and carried out... manoeuvres to force it to surface as it went through the Strait (of Hormuz). It had also entered into our territorial waters but ... it corrected its course after being warned," Irani said. 
"This submarine was doing its best, using all its capacities, to pass in total silence and without being detected," Irani said. "We will certainly reflect to international bodies the fact that it had violated our border."

The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, denied what it called Iranian "disinformation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Russia expands war recruitment drive with video ad calling for 'real' men 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian military has launched a video campaign to lure more professional soldiers to fight in Ukraine which challenges those interested to show they are "a real man" and swap what it casts as hum-drum civilian life for the battlefield. 
The ad, set to stirring music, follows a report from British military intelligence and Russian media reports that suggest Moscow is seeking to recruit up to 400,000 professional soldiers - on a volunteer basis - to bolster its forces in Ukraine. 
The ad has so far been released on major Russian social networking sites.

Russia, which says it is prosecuting what it calls "a special military operation," does not disclose full casualty figures. But up to 43,000 Russians have been killed in the war so far, according to a recently leaked estimate from the U.S. Defence Intelligence Agency.

Ukraine said on April 19 that it has received its first Patriot air-defense systems, and the United States announced a package of military aid worth $325 million as Russia launched a fresh wave of drone attacks on the southern port city of Odesa.

Reznikov wrote that the Ukrainian air-defense forces have trained to master the complexities of the Patriot systems "as quickly as they could" and thanked the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands for having "kept their word" on delivering the system.

Business Insider: A weird flash lit up the sky over Kyiv. NASA denied it was a falling satellite, and experts still can't confirm what caused it. 
* A blinding flash of light over Kyiv on Wednesday remains unexplained. 
* Ukraine officials had originally blamed a satellite NASA that was falling back down to Earth. 
* But US officials have denied the satellite's involvement, saying it was still in orbit at the time. 
The mystery over what caused a blinding flash to light up the night sky over Kyiv on Wednesday remains unsolved after NASA denied involvement. 
The flash lit up the sky minutes before the air raid alarm was triggered in the city, causing concern among residents.

The visits represent an acceleration of outside support for the conflict in Ukraine ahead of a widely anticipated offensive in the coming weeks. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Thursday ahead of a summit meeting on the future of the Ukraine war – the latest in a string of officials who in recent days have tried to use their presence there to shift momentum as the conflict enters a new stage. 
Stoltenberg in a Twitter post said it was “an honor to be back in Kyiv” and to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding a particularly defiant pledge from a leader of the Cold War-era military bloc: “Ukraine’s rightful place is in NATO, and over time our support will help to make this possible.”

New York Times: As Xi Befriends World Leaders, He Hardens His Stance on the U.S. 
China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has rolled out the red carpet for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, lauding him as “an old friend of the Chinese people.” He has sipped tea in a garden with President Emmanuel Macron of France, treating him to a performance of an ancient Chinese zither. And he has talked on the phone with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, offering well wishes for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
But even as Mr. Xi has offered a glad hand to those and other world leaders in recent weeks, it has been only the cold shoulder for the United States. China has rebuffed attempts by the Biden administration to restart high-level talks and lower tensions over Taiwan. And Mr. Xi’s government has intensified a campaign of ridicule and criticism of the United States and Western democracy.

WNU Editor: For the past few weeks China has been blocking US Secretary of State Blinken's request to travel to Beijing to talk to his counterpart on US - China relations .... China stalls US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's Beijing visit over US investigation into its 'spy balloon' (ABC News Australia). The Chinese reasons why are here .... Two-faced double-dealing of US leaves little room for dialogue: China Daily editorial. 
As to what is my take. 
My Chinese contacts tell me that there is no point to talk to the Biden administration right now. They are going to wait and hope that President Biden will be defeated in the 2024 Presidential election, and a new US administration with a new policy and approach towards China takes power. When I hear this my response has always been the same .... quoting Hillary Clinton .... 'hope is not a strategy".]]></summary>

Somehow the buried necropolis was never stumbled upon during multiple road works over the years, as well as the construction of the Port-Royal station on the historic Left Bank in the 1970s.
However, plans for a new exit for the train station prompted an archaeological excavation.
Camille Colonna, an anthropologist at France's National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP), told a press conference that there were already "strong suspicions" the site was close to Lutetia's southern necropolis.

In 2021, he also took over as first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) -- the country's most powerful position, long held by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and then his brother Raul.

        <updated>2023-04-19T05:45:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) -The death toll rose to 29 on Wednesday from a fire at a Beijing hospital that was one of the Chinese capital's deadliest in at least two decades, killing 26 patients and wounding dozens.
Social media showed dramatic videos of people using tied bed sheets to climb down the walls to escape smoke and flames after the fire broke out at Changfeng Hospital on Tuesday.
Broken and burned out windows could be seen at the site, where there were many police officers, some in plain clothes, Reuters witnesses said.
All but three of the 29 dead were patients, officials told a media briefing on Wednesday, with the fire having been put out in half an hour.
"There was a lot of smoke, I could see it," said an elderly local resident who gave only his surname, Li. He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.
Authorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.
Initial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.
By Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.
"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening," one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.
"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification."
Early on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.

Washington (AFP) - Elon Musk promised to make Twitter the "most accurate source of information about the world," but he has repeatedly used his own account to amplify false claims from some of the most notorious disinformers on the internet, according to an AFP analysis of his online activity.
The posts show Musk drawing attention to misinformation about everything from the war in Ukraine to the attack on US Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's husband. Last week, the billionaire boosted a tweet that wrongly suggested doctors misdiagnosed flu cases as Covid-19 deaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few dozen Holocaust survivors on Tuesday led a march in southern Poland to commemorate victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau, on the eve of the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
Every year, thousands of people from around the world -- both Jewish and not -- take part in the event held at the site of the former death camp built by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland.
One million European Jews died at the camp in the city of Oswiecim between 1940 and 1945 along with around 80,000 non-Jewish Poles, 25,000 Roma and 20,000 Soviet soldiers.
The camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.
The 35th edition of the March of the Living began with the doleful sound of the shofar -- a traditional Jewish ram's horn symbolizing freedom -- at the notorious "Arbeit Macht Frei" (Work Will Set You Free) gate at Auschwitz.
The three-kilometre march was notably attended this year by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch.
On Wednesday, Warsaw will commemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which broke out 80 years ago on April 19, 1943.
The presidents of Israel and Germany will be in attendance and are expected to visit the site of the former Jewish district.
The Germans confined up to 450,000 Jews to an area of just over three square kilometers -- most of whom died of starvation or disease inside or were taken to a death camp to the east of Warsaw.

The 3.9-meter (12.8-foot) high skeleton, made up of bones from three different T-rexes estimated at 65 to 67 million years old, was sold at the Koller auction house in Zurich after being shipped from the United States in nine giant crates.
The skeleton fetched a hammer price of 4.8 million Swiss francs, rising to 5.5 million with the buyer's premium added on.
Trinity was put up for sale by an anonymous US private individual and was expected to fetch between five and eight million Swiss francs.
It was bought by a private European collector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before he died, Rafael Moreno said: “If you want to kill me, kill me. But I'll tell you straight up: you won't silence me.” On the night of October 16, Moreno was shot dead by two men on a motorcycle in Montelibano, a small rural town in northern Colombia’s Cordoba department, one of the most marginalised and violent parts of the country. Moreno worked there as director of online news outlet Voces de Cordoba, in which he regularly exposed corruption, embezzlement and the activities of illegal armed groups.


	Moreno was investigating the installation of a mine on property belonging to a senator; according to him, resources were being extracted from it for public construction projects.

Forbidden Stories, an international consortium of investigative journalists offering to protect the work of colleagues under threat. Moreno told the group he wanted his investigations to be pursued and published worldwide if anything happened to him.


	For six months, a group of some 30 reporters co-ordinated by Forbidden Stories have taken over Moreno’s investigations, including journalists from FRANCE 24 and its sister service Radio France International, examining hundreds of documents and emails that Rafael had not yet made public to uncover a system of wide-scale clientelism and endemic corruption.


	The Rafael Project is sending a clear message to enemies of the free press, in Colombia and elsewhere: killing a journalist won’t kill the story.]]></summary>

The Conservative government in London called on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) -- its historic ally -- to embrace "real leadership" and emulate predecessors who helped forge Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
The DUP, which supports Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK, has been boycotting the divided territory's government at Stormont over post-Brexit trading arrangements agreed with the European Union.
But ahead of fresh local elections next month, it has been coming under sustained pressure from London, Dublin, Brussels and Washington, peaking in a visit to the island last week by US…]]></summary>

Lula's meeting with Sergei Lavrov in Brasilia follows state visits to China and the Middle East, during which he said the United States should "stop encouraging war and start talking about peace" in Ukraine.
He also claimed that Kyiv shares the blame for the conflict, which began when Russian forces poured into Ukraine in February 2022.
Lula's remarks echoed a line frequently used by Moscow and its strategic ally Beijing, which blame the West for the war.
China seeks to position itself as neutral on the Ukraine war, but has maintained its partnership with Moscow and refrained from imposing sanctions.

"The strength of the solidarity between the G7 foreign ministers is at a level not seen before," Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a press conference after hosting a meeting of the group in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa.
The show of unity comes after French President Emmanuel Macron this month said the European Union should reduce its dependency on the United States and cautioned against being drawn into a Taiwan crisis.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
