House Speaker Nancy Pelosi taunted China during her visit to Taiwan's Parliament in a speech promoting 'security, economy and governance' for island nation. 
Pelosi, who met with vice president of Taiwan’s parliament Tsai Chi-Chang, Wednesday morning said the US had 'come in peace for this region' and issued 'very strong, bipartisan way, in support of Taiwan.'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby schooled Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy on Tuesday about whether the United States "owned Afghanistan."
During a White House briefing on the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri, Doocy said President Joe Biden's administration "gave a country" to terrorists.
"What did you think was going to happen?" Doocy asked.
"I would take issue with the premise that we gave a whole country to terrorist groups," Kirby replied. 
"It's harboring the world's number one terrorist, how is that not giving a country to a terrorist-sympathizing group?" Doocy pressed.
Kirby objected to Doocy's assumptions.
"I mean, Peter, the way you ask that, it makes it sound like we owned Afghanistan a year ago," the White House official remarked. "It wasn't our country. It was an independent sovereign state and the president made a bold decision to end a war that had been going on for 20 years."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington on Tuesday imposed a new round of sanctions targeting Kremlin-connected elites for their role in supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.
"As innocent people suffer from Russia's illegal war of aggression, Putin's allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
The financial sanctions hit Putin-associate and billionaire Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, who owns the Witanhurst estate, the second-largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace. They also targeted Guryev's son and Caribbean-based yacht Alfa Nero.
Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov, one of Russia's largest taxpayers, and two subsidiaries of his MMK, which is among the world's largest steel producers, also were slapped with sanctions, as well as two other Russian elites: Alina Maratovna Kabaeva and Natalya Valeryevna Popova, the statement said.
"The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin's enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives," Yellen said, adding that the goal is "to choke off revenue and equipment underpinning Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine."
In a joint action, the State Department imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions, on oligarchs "running massive revenue-generating companies," including Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko and Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko, as well as nearly 900 officials, and a series of defense- and technology-related firms aiding "Russia's war machine."
The Treasury sanctions seize any US-based funds or property owned by the individuals or organizations, and prohibit American-based firms from having any financial dealings with them, although investors will have a few weeks to wind down transactions with MMK.]]></summary>

Pelosi landed in Taiwan a little after 10 p.m. local time amid China's threats that they'd conduct military exercises around the island while she is there. 
Sullivan explained that he was among the group of Republicans who went to Taiwan in 2021 as China was withholding vaccinations to the island. Sullivan was joined by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) and too faced threats from China as they delivered vaccines. China told the 2021 group to reconsider their trip as well, but it was ignored.

The Egyptian jihadist, who the United States says has been killed in a hideout in the Afghan capital Kabul, never even attempted to replicate the charisma and influence of his predecessor Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States.
But after US special forces killed bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, he played a key role in encouraging a decentralization of the group, which resulted in Al-Qaeda franchises emerging all over the planet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) used her congressional Twitter account to claim that Democrats engaged in a conspiracy to claim terrorist mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed to boost their midterm fortunes.
In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Greene suggested that Democrats were taking action because President Joe Biden had not gotten a boost from Russia's war on Ukraine. 
"November is coming and proxy war with Russia, killing more people and grinding Ukraine to a stump, is not as popular with voters as the admin thought it would be," she opined. "The [White House] admin looks extremely weak & controlled by Zelensky and the Global World Order, but don’t be fooled."
Greene said that Democrats "are not done with weapon sales and money laundering in the form of 'humanitarian aid' in Ukraine."

She argued that there was a conspiracy to kill al-Zawahiri because Ukraine was "causing problems for weak Dems upcoming re-elections."
"They even pivoted back to killing an old Al Qaeda terrorist so Biden could murmur his tough guy talk claiming he led the killing of Zawahiri," the lawmaker wrote. "Biden should be impeached NOT taking credit!"
Greene said that there were many "good questions" about the killing.
"If we were in Afghanistan for so many years, why is it we just found out where Zawahiri is and finally killed him?" she asked. "What trade was made for that Intel?"
"Is there proof he was killed?" Greene continued. "It was recently reported he was sick and dying."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in Taiwan late on Tuesday, starting a visit that Beijing had warned her against taking, saying it would undermine Sino-US relations.
Live television images showed the 82-year-old lawmaker, who flew on a US military aircraft into Taipei's Songshan Airport, being greeted on arrival by Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
"Our congressional delegation’s visit to Taiwan honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant Democracy," Pelosi said in a statement shortly after landing.
"America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy."
China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, and a foreign ministry spokesman said earlier this week that any visit by Pelosi would be "a gross interference in China's internal affairs" and warned that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army will never sit idly by".
Pelosi was on a tour of Asia that includes announced visits to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign minister Liz Truss, the frontrunner to replace British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has a smaller lead over her rival Rishi Sunak than previously thought, according to a poll of party members.
Truss is backed by 48% of Conservative Party members compared with 43% for former finance minister Sunak, according to the poll of 807 people by Italian data company Techne, carried out July 19-27.
This suggests a much tighter race than a previous poll of Conservative members carried out by YouGov on July 20-21 that showed Truss with a 24-point lead over Sunak.
Sunak and Truss are competing in a summer tour of hustings around Britain for the votes of about 200,000 Conservative members, who will select the next prime minister with the winner announced Sept. 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - The Kremlin warned the United States on Tuesday that an expected visit to Taiwan by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi would put it on a collision course with China and provoke tensions in the region.
"We cannot say for sure right now whether she will or will not get there, but everything about this tour and the possible visit to Taiwan is purely provocative," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
China has repeatedly warned Pelosi against going to Taiwan, which it claims as its own. Beijing says a Pelosi visit would contravene the one-China principle that Washington has vowed to abide by.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A land iguana that disappeared more than a century ago from one of the Galapagos Islands is reproducing naturally following its reintroduction there, Ecuador's environment ministry announced Monday.
The reptile from the Conolophus subcristatus species, one of three land iguanas living on the archipelago, disappeared from Santiago Island in the early part of the 20th century according to a 1903-06 expedition there by the California Academy of Sciences, the ministry said.
In 2019, the Galapagos National Park (PNG) authority reintroduced more than 3,000 iguanas from a nearby island to restore the natural ecosystem of Santiago, which lies at the center of the Pacific archipelago.
The remote island chain was made famous by British geologist and naturalist Charles Darwin's observations on evolution there.
In 1835, Darwin recorded a huge number of iguanas of all ages on Santiago.
PNG director Danny Rueda said "187 years later we are once again seeing a healthy population of land iguanas with adults, juveniles and newborns.
"It's a great conservation achievement and strengthens our hopes of restoration on the islands that have been severely affected by introduced species."
Located close to 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos islands are home to unique flora and fauna and are a Natural World Heritage site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pictured in just one of three published photos, al-Adel is the likely successor to the al-Qaeda throne. He is credited with masterminding the bombings of three US embassies in 1998 as well as playing a key role in the notorious 'Black Hawk Down' plot   
Daily Mail: Is this Al-Qaeda's next terror chief? Secretive heir apparent who 'oversaw Black Hawk Down operation' and helped carry out 9/11 attacks is poised to take over after Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in Afghanistan 
* Terror leader who named himself 'Sword of Justice' now thought al-Qaeda chief 
* Relatively young Islamist security leader known for shrewdness and poker face 
* He oversaw notorious 1993 'Black Hawk Down' operation which killed US troops 
* Al-Adel is a mainstay of the FBI Most Wanted list, with a $10million info reward 
The heir apparent to the al-Qaeda throne after tonight's confirmed death of Ayman al-Zawahiri is a canny, military-trained operative with experience killing British and American soldiers. 
Egyptian ex-army officer Saif al-Adel was a founding member of al-Qaeda, having joined pre-cursor terrorist group Maktab al-Khidamat in the late-1980s. 
 There he met future allies Osama bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, whose separate group Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) he would soon join.

WNU Editor: I concur with the above analysis. Saif al-Adel will be (if not already) Al Qaeda's next leader.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. killed top al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who served as Osama bin Laden's No. 2 in the ongoing attacks on the United States. But according to an NBC report from 2020, former President Donald Trump had an opportunity to do the same, but refused because he didn't recognize al-Zawahiri's name. 
Reporting in early 2020, NBC News reported that intelligence officials briefed then-President Trump many times about the most worrisome terrorist threats, specifically mentioning al-Zawahri.
Trump would ultimately agree to take out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Yemeni al Qaeda chief Qasim al-Rimi. But other of the significant names on the CIA's list were ignored.  
Trump "was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name," the report said at the time. 

"He would say, 'I've never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?'" the former official told NBC.
A Pentagon official agreed, noting, "That was the only name he knew." 
By contrast, Biden explained that after "relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family."
"This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians, and one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success," Biden also said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday's edition of CNN's "The Situation Room," retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling broke down the significance of the successful U.S. strike that took out Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda who took over from Osama bin Laden.
Zawahiri, noted Hertling, has been sought by the U.S. for decades — and was a critical piece of the terrorist operation.
"How significant is this strike killing the al-Qaeda leader?" asked anchor Wolf Blitzer.
"This is a target the U.S. has been going after for three decades, even before the 9/11 strike," said Hertling. "He leads al-Qaeda with various networks around the globe. Central places in control. These areas, we're talking about an individual who is the CEO of this organization. You can debate how powerful he is, compared to bin Laden, but it's a big deal."
Another important aspect, said Hertling, is how the U.S. was able to take him out despite no longer having on-the-ground intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, having withdrawn U.S. forces last year.
"This is more than likely a drone strike. I would give that a 70 percent possibility," said Hertling. "I would not rule out a hand strike on this individual, either. What you are talking about, the kinds of things we were talking about when we withdrew from Afghanistan, this will be an over-the-horizon strike with very little capability for collecting intelligence within Afghanistan. This was a significant hit by both the intelligence community and anyone who pulled off the operation."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed over the weekend in Afghanistan while hiding out at the home of an Afghan government official and Taliban member, the New York Times reported. 
According to reports, President Joe Biden, who was isolated with a rebound infection of COVID-19, authorized the strike against al-Zawahiri. Biden will address the nation at 7:30 p.m. EST Monday evening. 
He is among the most pursued terrorists in the world after the slaying of Osama bin Laden, MSNBC reported. 
The Times also reported that the operation was not a military one, and instead was conducted through the CIA. The government won't respond to questions about it, however. 
Al-Zawahiri was among the top organizers of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Towers, the Washington Post described. 
"Zawahiri was a senior adviser to bin Laden at the time of al-Qaeda’s first high-profile terrorist attacks, the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds of people," said the report. "Three years later, working from al-Qaeda’s base in Afghanistan, he helped oversee the planning of what would become one of history’s most audacious terrorist attacks: the Sept. 11 strikes in New York and Washington."
Sept. 11 hijackers were sent to begin training in the U.S. while Zawahiri was in charge of following up on other terrorist attacks that aimed to weaken the U.S. economy. 
"He launched an ambitious biological weapons program, establishing a laboratory in Afghanistan and dispatching disciples to search for sympathetic scientists as well as lethal strains of anthrax bacteria," said the Post.]]></summary>

Access the article HERE.

Excerpt:

I have been waiting my whole career for authorities to focus on north Korea. We will get permissions though?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[QAnon influencers and anti-vaxxers are spreading an antisemitic conspiracy theory about the global food crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Conspiracy theorist Twitter accounts have started pushing disinformation blaming Jewish people for the interruption of grain exports from Ukraine, echoing claims by the Russian government -- which has blamed western sanctions on the disruption, according to research by the Network Contagion Research Institute that was reported by The Guardian.
"According to NCRI, the accounts frequently link rising food insecurity to a 'cabal of shadowy, and often Jewish elites, for bringing about the New World Order,' rather than to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine," the newspaper reported.
Russia has blocked Ukraine's shipping ports, which puts millions of people in Africa and elsewhere at risk of starvation, but antisemitic social media users are making up claims about Jewish manipulation of the food supply.

“Never believe for one moment there’s a shortage of anything. Food. Water. Oil. They create and manufacture these shortages. These aren’t naturally occurring whatsoever," claimed QAnon influencer GhostEzra.
The NCRI and the Rutgers Miller Center conducted open-source analysis of Russian disinformation websites and individuals, and then analyzed the use of terms around food security on Twitter and Telegram, and detected the pattern of disinformation flowing from Kremlin-linked media and QAnon influencers and other conspiracy theorists.
“There is a significant overlap between QAnon and other anti-vax and online conspiracy communities,” said Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst at the NCRI and a research fellow at the Rutgers Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience. “Some of the more colorful food-mandate conspiracies intermingle with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”]]></summary>

Haggis, 69, was arrested in June after being accused of a non-consensual, two-day sexual encounter with a 28-year-old woman, but an Italian court said late last week that there aren’t grounds for an investigation to move forward, Variety reported over the weekend, citing Italian media. “After viewing the evidence and hearing arguments from both sides, the District Court of Lecce, an appellate court with three judges, unanimously rejected a prosecutor’s appeal to have Ha...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a wide-ranging interview on the Australian radio's The Kyle and Jackie O Show, the father of billionaire industrialist and constant media obsession Elon Musk played down his son's accomplishments before discussing his recent weight gain.
During the over-the-top discussion, Errol Musk claimed that other members of his family have substantial accomplishments, telling the hosts, "You know, we are a family that have been doing a lot of things for a long time. It's not as if we suddenly started doing something."
He also added that rival son Kimbal is his actual "pride and joy," adding that that Elon's brother is also a "billionaire" -- albeit a single-billion billionaire.
Pressed on photos of a pale and fleshy Elon that have popped up in the tabloids recently, Errol told the hosts, "Elon is very strongly built but he's been eating badly," and stated he has been urging his son to use a supplement called garcinia cambogia to help with his weight gain.

Towards the end of the 20-minute interview, he was asked by the laughing hosts if his son is circumcised, and he joked it off by claiming he would send them a picture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced "a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War" and was just "one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation."
"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict," Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation," he said, calling on nations to "put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons."
Guterres's comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The meeting, held at the UN's headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.
Guterres said the conference was "a chance to strengthen" the treaty and "make it fit for the worrying world around us," citing Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.
"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used," the secretary-general implored, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of the August 6, 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city by the United States.
"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening," Guterres added.
In January, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- had pledged to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons.
At the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach agreement on substantive issues.

US policy toward Taiwan is all about “strategic ambiguity.” That means every trip and remark has to be just right.
 How reckless can a trip to Taiwan be? 
For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, potential travel plans have already caused a domestic political debate and a minor foreign policy fracas.
Pelosi began a multi-stop tour of Asia Monday with a visit to Singapore.

According to attorney Steve Zissou, Viktor Bout, who was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison after his conviction in 2011 for conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and supplying terrorist groups with weapons should be a serious candidate in the swap negotiations which led the CNN host to bring up Bout's criminal past.

President Joe Biden called Monday on Russia and China to enter nuclear arms control talks, saying that Moscow in particular has a duty to show responsibility after its invasion of Ukraine.
In a statement, the U.S. leader reiterated that his administration is ready to "expeditiously negotiate" a replacement to New START, the treaty capping intercontinental nuclear forces in the United States and Russia, which is set to expire in 2026. 
 "Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control," Biden said.

Update: Biden offers talks with Russia (RT) 
WNU Editor: The White House statement is here .... President Biden Statement Ahead of the 10th Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (White House). 
My prediction is that these talks are not going to happen.  The U.S. is currently involved in an indirect war with Russia over Ukraine, and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is about to land in Taiwan thereby breaking the U.S. commitment to a one China policy. Arms control talks are not on Beijing's and Moscow's agenda right now.
 Update #2: Puzzlement is not the word that I would use .... Russia puzzled by Biden proposal to replace nuclear arms treaty (Reuters). From what I am seeing, reading, and hearing on Russian media, they are treating this proposal as a joke.]]></summary>

 Nikkei: U.S. deploys ships and planes near Taiwan as Pelosi eyes visit 
TOKYO -- The U.S. military is moving assets, including aircraft carriers and large planes, closer to Taiwan ahead of an anticipated but unconfirmed visit to the island by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
The military was initially opposed to the speaker's visit but now looks to be creating a buffer zone for Pelosi's plane, in case she decides to go ahead with the controversial stop. 
But with China declaring that it would "never sit idly by" if she were to visit the island, tensions in East Asia have quickly escalated, perhaps against the will of both U.S. President Joe Biden, who was seeking to remove some tariffs on Chinese goods to counter inflation, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who faces a sensitive political season at home with his rule extension on the line.
A reporter for local network TVBS tweeted that the speaker is expected to arrive in Taiwan on Tuesday evening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong has tipped back into a technical recession, new government figures showed Monday, weighed down by mounting interest rates, weakened global trade and the city's continued adherence to strict coronavirus controls.
Following a year-on-year decrease of 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the city's GDP again reported decline in the second quarter on Monday -- but with a narrower margin of 1.4 percent -- according to advance estimates released by the Census and Statistics Department.
The downturn is reversing last year's recovery when the economy enjoyed a 6.3 percent annual growth after the slowdown in 2019 and 2020, when the city was first upended by months of huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, and then the pandemic.

"This is the legacy of our ancestors... We are fighting to preserve it every day".
Located about three kilometers (less than two miles) off the coast, Arwad is Syria's only inhabited island and a haven of peace in a country torn by 11 years of war.
Hundreds of workers, residents and visitors commute to and from there every day in wooden boats, mostly built by the Bahlawan family.

The 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- which has spearheaded so far fruitless diplomatic efforts to restore peace -- last week condemned the junta's execution of four prisoners.
Myanmar has been in chaos since a putsch in February last year and the death toll from the military's brutal crackdown on dissent has passed 2,100, according to a local monitoring group.
Ministers meeting in Phnom Penh from Wednesday are expected to lament the lack of progress on ASEAN's "five-point consensus" plan, agreed to in April last year, which called for an immediate end to violence and dialog…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“When Mrs. Carroll makes her first entrance,” wrote Frank Rich in The Times, “a nervous silence descends on the audience of the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger here, as hundreds of eyes search for a trace of the woman whom they’ve seen in a thousand TV reruns. What they find instead is a Falstaff who might have come out of a formal painted portrait: a balding, elderly knight with tufts of silver hair and mustaches. sparse, a huge belly, rosy cheeks and squinting frog eyes peering through boozy mists.The sight is so eerie that you cling to your seat.
“You realize,” Mr. Rich continued, “that it is the character of Shakespeare, and not a parody of camp, that is being served.”
Patricia Ann Carroll was born May 5, 1927 in Shreveport, Louisiana and grew up in Los Angeles.  Her father, Maurice, worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Electricity;  his mother, Kathryn (Meagher) Carroll, worked in real estate and office management.
Ms Carroll attended the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles on an English scholarship, but left before she graduated.  “I realized what I was learning wasn’t going to advance what I wanted to do,” she said in 2011. “I always thought experience was the best preparation.”
In 1947, Ms. Carroll left Los Angeles for Plymouth, Mass., where she worked at the Priscilla Beach Theater and, she said, ate, drank and breathed the theater.  She made her professional stage debut there that year in “A Goose for the Gander”, with Gloria Swanson.  Soon after, she traveled to New York, where, among other odd jobs, she shined shoes.
