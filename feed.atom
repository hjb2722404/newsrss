        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France 24: Ukraine confirms withdrawal of troops from battleground town of Soledar 
Ukraine confirmed on Wednesday its troops had withdrawn from Soledar in eastern Ukraine, almost two weeks after Russian troops said they had captured the small salt-mining town. 
"In order to preserve the lives of service personnel, the Defence Forces withdrew from Soledar," military spokesman Serhiy Cherevatyi was quoted as saying by state broadcaster Suspilne. 
His remarks were the first Ukrainian confirmation that Russian forces have captured Soledar, which is in the Donetsk region. 
"(Our forces) fulfilled their main task: not allowing the enemy to systematically break through in the Donetsk direction," Cherevatyi was quoted as saying.

WNU Editor: Russian forces actually seized Soledar 12 days ago (link here). The announcement is being made now by Kyiv after videos begin to emerge over the weekend of half a dozen Russian trucks filled with the coffins of killed Ukrainian soldiers being prepared to be repatriated to the Ukrainian side. 
One of the constant criticisms and anger that I am constantly hearing from my Ukrainian friends and family members is the complete lack of information from the Ukrianian government on missing Ukrainian soldiers. My Ukrainian cousin manages a Facebook page for families of missing Ukrainian soldiers, and she estimates that there are anywhere from 35,000 to 50,000 soldiers that are now listed as missing. 
Sighhh .... thousands killed on both sides and for what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Doomsday Clock signals highest ever peril level 
The symbolic Doomsday Clock has moved closer than ever to midnight, declaring humanity perilously close to catastrophe. 
The clock, set to 90 seconds to midnight, marks how close our planet is to complete annihilation because of man made actions.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) said the clock moved, in large part, because of the war in Ukraine.  The idea began in 1947 to warn humanity of the dangers of nuclear war. 
The hands of the clock are moved closer to or further away from midnight based on the scientists' reading of existential threats at a particular time. Midnight marks the theoretical point of annihilation. 
The decision is made by the BAS science and security board, which includes 13 Nobel Laureates. 
This year the announcement was made available in Ukrainian and Russian as well as English, due to the war in Ukraine.

Estonia, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), is considering the possibility of effectively blocking the passage of Russian ships through the Baltic Sea.

Update #2: Estonia plays on Russia's nerves by closing the Gulf of Finland (Pravda.ru)

After months of reluctance, the US and Germany reportedly plan to send tanks to Ukraine, in what Kyiv hopes will be a game-changer on the battlefield.  US President Joe Biden's administration is expected to announce plans to send at least 30 M1 Abrams tanks. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also reportedly decided to send at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks. 
Russia's ambassador to the US blasted the news as "another blatant provocation". 
Ukrainian officials have said such shipments could help its forces seize back territory from the Russians. 
Until now, the US and Germany have resisted internal and external pressure to send their tanks to Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The last time German tanks were used in this part of the world it ended very badly for Europe as a whole. My cousin in Moscow called these reports of the US and Germany planning to send tanks to Ukraine "Operation Barbarasso 2". 
Sighhh .... Russians are about to see German tanks gunning for them over the horizon. Westerners have no idea on what passions this will raise in Russia. 
This is really bad. Everyone I know in Russia is now convinced that NATO is about to engage in a hot war with Russia. 
I have also been told that Moscow bluntly told Germany that this crosses a red-line. That once German Leopard tanks are engaged against Russian forces, President Putin will announce a General Mobilization. He will state that this deployment has broken treaties with Russia on the use and deployment of German military assets, and Russia must respond.

 (Bloomberg) -- Finland for the first time opened the door to potentially decoupling its NATO application from that of Sweden, after its neighbor encountered fresh resistance from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
The path floated by Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, if it becomes more serious, would mark a significant shift in Finnish policy since the Nordic nations jointly applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May. 
Faced with continued objections from Turkey — mostly to what it sees as inadequate crackdown on Kurds in Sweden — the two Nordic countries had up to now insisted their applications be considered together.  It’s still unclear how much Finland will shift its approach. 
The stance remains for the two countries to enter NATO simultaneously, given security considerations, Haavisto told reporters in Helsinki on Tuesday, softening comments from earlier in the day, when he’d said Finland may need to prepare going it alone.

Top officials are ousted or resign in the biggest reshuffle since the start of the Russian invasion. 
 A corruption scandal is shaking up the Ukrainian government, with top officials stepping aside as Kyiv seems eager to assure Western partners of their responsible stewardship of billions in military and economic aid. 
Among the high-profile exits are Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head in the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and a deputy in the ministry of defense, Vyacheslav…]]></summary>

The Hill: Study: Defense industry unprepared for war with China 
The U.S. defense industry is “not adequately prepared” for “a protracted conventional war” with an enemy such as China, according to a think tank study published Monday. 
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ran a war games simulation that found that the U.S. would likely be depleted of some of its munitions, including long-range, precision-guided ones, in less than a week of war with China in the Taiwan Strait.

* The major stocks impacted included Morgan Stanley, Verizon, AT&T, Nike and McDonald’s, according to the NYSE’s website. 
* Many stocks were shown to have abnormally large moves when the market opened, which may have triggered volatility halts. 
* The NYSE said at roughly 9:50 a.m. that all of its systems were operational. 
Trading in dozens of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted shortly after the market opened Tuesday due to an apparent technical issue. 
The major stocks impacted included Morgan Stanley, Verizon, AT&T, Nike and McDonald’s, according to the NYSE’s website. Many stocks were shown to have abnormally large moves when the market opened, which may have triggered volatility halts. 
CNBC’s Bob Pisani said on “Squawk on the Street” that the issue appears to be a technical one and not something that happened on the trading floor.  Many of the companies impacted resumed trading before 9:45 a.m. ET. 
The NYSE said at roughly 9:50 a.m. that all of its systems were operational. CNBC has reached out to the NYSE for more details about the issue.

KYIV, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Ukraine dismissed more than a dozen senior officials including governors of several major battlefield provinces on Tuesday in the biggest shake-up of its wartime leadership since Russia's invasion last year. 
Separately on Tuesday, a long-awaited decision on whether allies could send German-made heavy tanks to Ukraine finally confronted Berlin, after Poland said it had formally sent its request to the German government. 
Among Ukrainian officials who resigned or were dismissed on Tuesday were the governors of the Kyiv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and adjacent Dnipropetrovsk are frontline provinces now; Kyiv and Sumy were major battlefields e…]]></summary>

When will we finally see the HQ-26 missile? 
Last Christmas, the PLA Navy received a long-awaited gift when its seventh and eighth Type 055 destroyers entered service, completing delivery of its first batch of its lethal new class of warship. At roughly 13,000 tons, the Type 055s are Asia's biggest surface warships since World War II; the U.S. Navy classifies them as cruisers. However, despite impressive armaments, advanced radar systems, and other impressive capabilities, initial reporting indicates that the Type 055s appear to be missing a key weapon: t…]]></summary>

RT:  Ex-Russian president predicts new anti-US military alliance 
The Ukraine crisis may lead to the founding of a bloc of countries “fed up” with Washington, Dmitry Medvedev says  
The continuous flow of military aid to Kiev clearly shows that the collective West is seeking to “wear out or, preferably, destroy” Russia, the country’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, remarked on Sunday. The effort, however, may ultimately backfire for the US and its allies, he believes. 
Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, made the comments in a social media post, days after a meeting at the US Ramstein air base in Germany at which Western powers pledged to continue supporting Kiev. 
“The meeting at Ramstein and the allocation of heavy weaponry to Kiev leave no doubt that our enemies will be trying to wear us out for an indefinite period of time, or, preferably, to destroy us,” the ex-president wrote. 
However, the prolongation of the hostilities in Ukraine may ultimately lead to the emergence of a new military bloc that brings together nations “fed up with the Americans,” Medvedev suggested.

Moscow's adversaries have long aimed to destroy everything Russian, the FM has said  
The current situation in Ukraine demonstrates that the conflict between Russia and the West can no longer be defined as a “hybrid war” but is instead approaching becoming a real one, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. 
Speaking at a press conference following a meeting with his South African counterpart, Naledi Pandor, Lavrov also noted that this “almost real” war was something that the West “has been preparing for a long time against Russia.” The minister claimed that Western powers are seeking to destroy everything Russian, from the language to the culture that had existed in Ukraine for centuries, even forbidding people from speaking their native language.

EurAsian Times: Rival Or Copy Of NGAD? China’s Mysterious ‘Stealth Fighter’ Spotted On Screen That Looks Quite Similar To US 6th-Gen Design 
Once again, a very interesting image that points towards China developing a fixed-wing, sixth-generation fighter jet has gone viral on social media. 
Earlier this week, a mysterious stealth fighter was spotted on the computer screen at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). 
The photo was taken by an anonymous user and initially posted to the Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo with little to no additional details. 
From the look, the fighter-sized aircraft concept appears to be a tailless, twin-engine, flying wing design similar to the sixth-generation fighter concepts like the American NGAD or the British Tempest sixth-generation fighter jet. 
Even though the photo’s veracity could not be independently established, it is in line with the assumption and the evidence that suggests China is indeed focusing on a tailless configuration for its sixth-generation fighter jet.

The Guardian: German tank manufacturer’s warning puts pressure on Ukraine’s allies  
Defence firm dampens Kyiv hopes other European allies will follow UK’s lead in supplying heavy armour 
Battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024, the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has warned, increasing pressure on Nato allies to support Ukraine with armoured vehicles in active service instead, ahead of a key meeting this week. 
“Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 
Rheinmetall, which manufactures the battle vehicle’s gun, has 22 Leopard 2 and 88 older Leopard 1 tanks in its stocks. Getting the Leopard tanks ready for battle, however, would take several months and cost hundreds of millions of euros the company could not put up until the order was confirmed, Papperger said.

BBC: Al-Shabab: US air strike in Somalia 'kills 30 militants' 
A US air strike assisting government troops in Somalia has killed about 30 Islamist al-Shabab militants, the US military says. 
The operation happened near the town of Galcad, about 260km (162 miles) northeast of the capital Mogadishu. 
Over the past few days, the Somali army and al-Shabab militants have fought for control of the town. 
Friday's air strike came as the army was being attacked by more than 100 militants, the US Africa Command says. 
Earlier the Islamists killed seven soldiers after storming a military base in Galcad. Somalia's Information Ministry said dozens of the militants were killed.

The demonstrators—who include Aymara and Quecha people from Andean regions, trade unionists, and other activists—traveled to the coastal capital in caravans during the second week of a general strike as part of a new "March from the Four Corners." The first such march took place in 2000 against then-President Alberto Fujimori, a U.S.-backed right-wing autocrat.

In 2009, Miss California, Carrie Prejean, gained national attention for her response to a question by a gay blogger at the Miss USA Pageant about same-sex marriage.
What followed were repeated efforts to capitalize on her anti-LGBTQ fame, including a short stint as a spokesperson for NOM, the National Organization For Marriage, an anti-LGBTQ organization that aggressively attempted to prevent same-sex couples from gaining the legal right to marriage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The streets of France filled with outraged workers on Thursday as rail employees, teachers, and others walked off the job to protest President Emmanuel Macron's deeply unpopular plan to overhaul the nation's pension system by raising the official retirement age from 62 to 64.
The union-led demonstrations—which ground significant portions of the country, including many schools and transportation systems, to a halt—come as Macron is attempting to steamroll far-reaching opposition to his pension overhaul, declaring that "we must work longer."
Macron's government formally presented its draft law last week, the first step in the process of enacting a reform that would force French citizens to work longer to qualify for a full pension.

"I had no food. There was only a bottle of ketchup that was on the boat, garlic powder and (bouillon cubes) Maggi. So I mixed it up with some water for me to survive 24 days in the sea," Elvis Francois, 47, said in English in a video released by the Colombian Navy.
The islander had the word "help" carved on the hull of the boat when he was found 120 nautical miles northwest of Puerto Bolivar in the northern department of La Guajira.
Francois said he saw other boats pass by and tried to flag them down, even lighting a fire on his vessel, but they did not see him.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thursday's shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world's youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the punishing demands faced by women in power.
Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old politician said she had next to nothing left "in the tank" and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office.
"Politicians are human," she said. "We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it's time. And for me, it's time."
But the remarks that followed were more revealing, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand's University of Canterbury.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday made a shock announcement she had "no more in the tank" to continue leading the country and would step down no later than early February and not seek re-election.
Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside.
"This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term - because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that," Ardern, 42, told a news conference.

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Messina Denaro, a brutal Sicilian Mafia boss who was Italy's most wanted criminal before his capture on Monday, had been on the run for 30 years. Here are some key facts about his arrest and what it means:
WHY IS THE ARREST SO IMPORTANT?
Messina Denaro, 60, was the last runaway member of a generation of mobsters who masterminded a string of bombings and murders that terrorised Italy in the early 1990s.
His arrest finally brings closure to that dark era, shatters a symbol of resistance to the Italian state and could reveal Mafia secrets in the unlikely event that Messina Denaro agrees to talk to investigators.
He was involved in dozens of killings, including of top prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the adolescent son of a Mafia…]]></summary>

Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for modern Western tanks to help battle Russia's invasion, and Germany has reportedly linked its decision on whether to do so to Washington's willingness to provide Abrams.
"I just don't think we're there yet," US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told journalists when asked about providing Abrams to Ukraine, though he did not completely close the door on a shift in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.
Just days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.
He ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was "convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors."
In a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil's presidents live.
Leftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.
As he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.

The president said last week that any "radical bolsonarista" found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.
"How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?" asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.
Bolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula's inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.
He has denied any link to the riots.
In a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed "regret" over the events, which he described as "unbelievable".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notorious drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman has appealed to Mexico's president for help due to alleged "psychological torment" he is suffering in a US prison, his lawyer said Tuesday.
"In the six years that Joaquin has been in the United States, he has not seen the sun," said Jose Refugio Rodriguez, a Mexico-based legal representative of the Sinaloa cartel founder.
The message, described as "an SOS," was transmitted via one of Guzman's lawyers in the United States as well as his family, Rodriguez said.
Guzman is only allowed outside three times a week to a small area where he "doesn't get the sun," and has fewer visits or phone calls than other inmates, the lawyer said in an interview with Radio Formula.
"He is suffering psychological torment," he said, adding that the lack of sunshine was also bad for the convicted drug trafficker's physical health.
Guzman wants President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address alleged procedural violations during his extradition in 2017 under the former government, Rodriguez added.
The Mexican embassy in Washington confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that it received an email from Rodríguez on January 10. 
Without referring to the content of the email, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard downplayed the chance of any government intercession in favor of the notorious drug trafficker. 
"He is serving a sentence there, he has a sentence," he told journalists. "So, frankly I don't see any possibilities for him, but I'm going to review it with the prosecutor's office." 
El Chapo is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in 2019 of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.
One of his sons, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested by Mexican security forces this month in an operation that left 29 people dead and sparked a dramatic shootout at an airport in the city of Culiacan.

The helicopter slammed down next to the kindergarten and a residential building in Brovary, a commuter town for the capital Kyiv that was the scene of fierce fighting early in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When dozens of defense ministers meet at an airbase in Germany on Friday, all eyes will be set on what Berlin is - and is not - willing to provide Ukraine.
Defense leaders from roughly 50 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will confer at Ramstein Air Base, the latest in a series of meetings since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago.
The focus is expected to be not on what the United States will provide, but on whether Germany will send its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve their transfer from third countries.
"The U.S. is expecting Europeans to take the lead," said Rachel Rizzo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council. "I would expect the U.S. to be rightly privately pushing the Europeans to dedicate more of their re…]]></summary>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Katherine Swidan, whose son Mark has been imprisoned in China for over 10 years, has not seen even a photograph of him over the last decade. The last time she heard his voice was in 2018.
She and the families of other Americans, who according to the U.S. government are wrongfully held in China, are hoping that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken can push the Chinese authorities for the release of their loved ones as he visits Beijing next month.
"My message for Blinken is: say their names," said Katherine Swidan in a phone interview from her home in Luling, Texas. "They're American citizens. They've been wrongfully detained. Enough is enough."
Mark Swidan, a Texas-based businessman, was convicted by a Chinese court on drug-…]]></summary>

Thunberg has been in Germany for several days to support protests against the demolition of Luetzerath, which have become a symbol of resistance against fossil fuels.
Images showed the activist, dressed in black, being picked up by police officers wearing helmets and then escorted to a waiting bus.
A police spokeswoman said a group of activists were in custody after having "broken away from the demonstration", and run towards the edge of an open pit.
Officials were working to identify the protesters in custody, and a decision would be made later about what further action to take, she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.
The suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.
The industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France's unions are united.
"It'll be a hellish Thursday," Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.
Paris public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.
Services would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.
Elsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.
Most slow trains between cities would be halted.
Up to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.
Opinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron's last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.
The 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.

And the decline is set to continue as factors including rising living costs, more women entering the workforce and having children later mean people in some countries are having fewer babies.
China's population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, official data showed Tuesday, and it is expected to be overtaken by India this year as the most populous nation.
Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to UN figures published last July which forecast how the world's population will develop between now and 2100.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italy's National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.
Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum "for having had 'le palle' (the balls) to invite me tonight", according to Deadline and Variety reports.
The museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as "unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation".
Its "Stella della Mole" award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film "American Beauty" and drama series "House of Cards" -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.
Spacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
His stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.
The actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.
Last summer he appeared at London's Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.
Now on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, "deepfake" video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.
Cave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.
The chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.
The Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave's website, asked the tool to produce a song "in the style of Nick Cave".
One of the AI-created verses runs: "I'm the king of the abyss, I'm the ruler of the dark / I'm the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark."
"This song sucks," wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT's work "replication as travesty".
He followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn't, describing the process of writing as "an act of self-murder".
"Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don't feel," he wrote.
He added: "Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit."
Cave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- "I've got the fire of hell in my eyes."
"I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it's ChatGPT," he concluded.
