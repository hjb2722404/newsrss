The double defeat showed a big slump in support for the governing Conservatives, who have won the last four national votes, and suggests Labour is on course to win power for the first time since 2010 at an election expected next year. While so-called by-elections are often lost by the governing party, the scale of the defeat in two parliamentary seats the Conservatives have held for years piles pressure on Sunak.]]></summary>

Astronomers Spot Most Distant Fast Radio Burst Ever Detected
Astronomers have observed an extraordinarily distant and powerful fast radio burst (FRB) that released a massive burst of energy in a fraction of a second. FRBs are intense, millisecond-long radio wave flashes with unknown cosmic origins. Since the first detection in 2007, hundreds have been spotted flickering from distant points in space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Relief Web: Israel destroys a quarter of northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian death toll exceeds 4,000 
Geneva – Israel is conducting the largest campaign of destruction of buildings and residential houses in the Gaza Strip in modern history, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor stated, as part of a wide-scale military attack ongoing since the seventh of this month. 
Euro-Med Monitor emphasised that Israel is focusing its attacks on the Gaza and North Gaza governorates through a systematic destruction campaign, aiming to force displacement and population transfer against the residents of these governorates. 
The Israeli army has warned the residents of both governorates, which are home to nearly a million people, to evacuate the areas and move to the central and southern sections of the Strip, a measure that raises serious legal and humanitarian concerns as it endangers the safety of civilians.

Update #1: Gaza war death toll rises to 4,137 (Economic Times)
 
Update #2: UN says 4,200 people killed in Israel, Gaza conflict in 10 days (Anadolu Agency)

 
WNU Editor: The numbers are horrifying. As of yesterday (link here), just in Gaza alone 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since Oct.7. Of this 3,785 total, 1,524 were children and 1,000 were women. 

 
Update #3: These shortages have the potential to be just as destructive as bombs if not alleviated soon .... Gaza conditions worsen amid warnings that shortages could ‘kill many, many people’ (CNN).]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Ready for war: Satellite images show hundreds of Israeli tanks gathered in fields four miles north of Gaza as IDF prepares to send tens of thousands of soldiers in to war-torn strip to destroy Hamas 
* Satellite images have shown how Israeli forces are gearing up on the northern border of Gaza, as they prepare for ground invasion 
* Pictures have shown hundreds of armored vehicles including tanks, personnel carriers and bulldozers 
* The Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has told soldiers at the border to 'get organized, be ready' for their move into Palestinian territory 
Satellite imagery has revealed where Israel has deployed hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles, as it prepares to invade Gaza. 
The military buildup seen in satellite images is some four miles north of the Erez Crossing, a primary entry point on Gaza's northern border. 
Tanks and other armored vehicles are seen in the pictures, which were taken at the end of last week by Planet Labs.

The State Department on Thursday urged Americans to make plans to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible,” elevating an earlier security warning that advised Americans not to travel to the country. 
“The U.S. Embassy is closely monitoring the security situation in Lebanon,” the Thursday advisory read. 
“The Department of State urges U.S. citizens in Lebanon to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available.”

Update #2: US embassy urges its citizens in Lebanon to leave 'ASAP' (Jerusalem Post)

Saudi Urges Citizens To Depart Lebanon 'Immediately' (AFP).

This offensive will probably result in a reaction from Hezbollah, and the real possibility of a second front in this war along the Lebanese border.]]></summary>

DOD has launched a new task force to rush weapons to the Middle East. 
The U.S. has launched a new effort to quickly find more precision weapons and artillery shells to rush to Israel as the Middle Eastern country conducts hundreds of strikes a day against Hamas targets in Gaza. 
A newly formed team inside the Pentagon has been tasked with scouring U.S. stockpiles, searching for ammunition to resupply Israel as it fires off munitions at a frantic pace, according to three people familiar with the effort. 
The move comes as the defense industry and the Pentagon scramble to send weapons to Ukraine and keep U.S. shelves stocked.

The Pentagon plans to send Israel tens of thousands of 155mm artillery shells that had been destined for Ukraine from U.S. emergency stocks several months ago, three Israeli officials with knowledge of the situation tell Axios.

 
Why it matters: The Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli Ministry of Defense told their U.S. counterparts they urgently need artillery shells to prepare for a ground invasion in Gaza — and a potential escalation of the war by Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border, Israeli officials say. 
 * U.S. officials have suggested that diverting the shells from Ukraine to Israel would have no immediate impact on Ukraine's ability to fight against Russian troops. 
* Less clear is whether U.S. military supplies to Ukraine could be stretched if the Israel-Hamas war becomes a broader regional conflict, but the Pentagon played down such concerns Thursday.

Daily Mail: White House apologizes for glaring national security blunder after publishing photo showing faces of US Special Forces as they met Joe Biden in Israel 
 * Republicans slammed 'gross incompetence' by the White House 
 * The picture was on the White House Instagram page for hours 
 * The White House eventually deleted it and apologized 
The White House has been forced to delete a photo of President Joe Biden meeting U.S. special forces in Israel - which showed their faces and could have revealed their identities.
It was already known that a small group of U.S. special forces are in Israel advising on how to potentially rescue scores of hostages, including Americans, held by terror group Hamas in Gaza. 
The image of Biden shaking hands with them during his visit to Israel on Wednesday was published on the official White House Instagram page for hours and garnered thousands of likes and comments.

Israel continued its airstrikes on the Gaza Strip early Thursday, as it prepares troops and lays the groundwork for a possible invasion of the enclave. 
For nearly two weeks, Israel has been readying for a possible invasion of Gaza by carrying out thousands of airstrikes on the enclave, targeting Hamas’s leaders, its special forces and strategic assets, including intelligence posts and an underground tunnel network, as it seeks to weaken the group before sending in the thousands of Israeli soldiers massed at the border.

CNEWA: Orthodox Church Building in Gaza Collapses 
A multipurpose building of the Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrios in Gaza collapsed on 19 October after it was struck by a warhead. Hours after the attack, officials did not know the number of casualties, but dozens are feared dead beneath the rubble. The parish church, its school and adjacent church buildings had been sheltering up to 1,000 people, including the parents of a CNEWA staff member and on-the-ground partners, many of whom are parishioners. 
CNEWA learned of the building collapse from Joseph Hazboun, the regional director of CNEWA’s Jerusalem office. 
Mr. Hazboun said people have gathered at the bomb site to search for survivors, adding they are “in shock, trying hard to help as much as possible.”

“We are all in tears.”

Euronews: Kyiv a step closer to banning Ukrainian Orthodox Church  
Ukrainian lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday that would ban religious organisations and churches with alleged ties to Moscow. 
Ukraine’s lower house of parliament has passed a bill in the first of two required readings that would ban religious organisations and churches with alleged ties to Russia or in favour of its invasion of Ukraine. 
Kyiv accuses the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) specifically of collaborating with Russia after its invasion of the country in 2022. 
The bill was backed by 267 deputies and opposed by 15. It will become law if it passes a second reading and is signed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Yonhap News Agency: N. Korea warns U.S. strategic assets will be '1st targets of destruction' 
SEOUL, Oct. 20 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Friday condemned the arrival of a U.S. B-52 bomber in South Korea, threatening that U.S. strategic assets deployed on the Korean Peninsula will become the "first targets of destruction." 
Pyongyang's criticism came in response to the landing of the nuclear-capable bomber, a key U.S. strategic asset, at an air base in South Korea on Tuesday in its first known arrival in the South in a show of force against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. 
"The U.S. would be well aware that the Korean Peninsula is in a state of war by law and its strategic assets deploying in the puppet region are the first targets of destruction," the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in an English-language statement.

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly confirmed Thursday that 41 Canadian diplomats have left India after New Delhi threatened to revoke their diplomatic immunity. CBC News reported earlier that a large number of them had departed the country overnight.

The departures followed two weeks of negotiations between India and Canada after India issued a demand for "parity" in the number of diplomats present in the two countries, a source with knowledge of the situation told CBC News.

USS Carney (DDG-64) “shot down” the three missiles and a number of drones from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, according to Pentagon officials.

“This action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we have built in the Middle East and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests in this important region.

The Biden administration on Wednesday eased oil, gas and gold sanctions against Venezuela a day after the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the U.S.-backed opposition agreed to terms for a competitive presidential election next year. 
The Treasury Department issued a general license authorizing U.S. companies to engage in long-barred transactions primarily in the state-controlled energy sector.
 It said the license is to be valid for six months, to be renewed only if the authoritarian socialist government “meets its commitments” for elections and “with respect to those who are wrongfully detained.”

WNU Editor: This deal is a joke. There will be no free elections in Venezuela next year. This US decision to ease sanctions has more to do with fears of a wider war in the Middle East, and disruption in oil supplies that will result in massive price increases.

Zero Hedge: US Lawmakers Demand Biden Declassify Intelligence On Gaza Hospital Disaster 
During his Tel Aviv visit on Wednesday, President Biden had been pressed by reporters as to what convinced him to side with Israel's denial that it didn't strike Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza, killing up to 200-300 people, according to local health officials. Biden had said that data from his Defense Department showed the explosion was unlikely to have been an Israeli airstrike. But it's not just journalists that want more, US lawmakers are also demanding clearer answers. 
A group of Progressive Democrats in Congress are now pushing the Biden White House to publicly declassify the intelligence that the US has on the hospital bombing.

OPEC plans to ignore Iran's demands, reports say

Iran called on its Arab-majority neighbors to impose an oil embargo on Israel as the Jewish state wages its war against Hamas. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian on Wednesday called for the embargo and for nations within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to expel all Israeli ambassadors. 
OPEC, the organization of largely Arab nations that overseas oil production in the Middle East, has no plans to impose such an embargo, Reuters reported Wednesday. The organization has no special or emergency meetings planned to discuss such a move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne avoided parliamentary censure in an early morning vote on Saturday after she forced the government's budget plan through the National Assembly without a vote. 
The motion to censure Borne – the 18th levelled at her since she assumed the office – was brought by the left-wing Nupes alliance after the prime minister activated Article 49.3 to adopt the public finance bill without a vote.
The motion received just 193 of the 289 votes needed to succeed, an unsurprising outcome in light of the lack of support from the centre-right.
Its rejection constitutes the adoption of the 2023-2027 budget program, which now moves to the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament.
The speaker for Nupes, socialist Philippe Brun, accused the government of "favouring with the greatest servility a very well-endowed minority of the French" despite "an immense inflationary crisis".
President Emmanuel Macron had "tried to make parliament disappear with his repeated (use of) 49.3", Brun added.
The far right had supported the left's motion of censure, accusing Borne of the "repeated and abusive use of 49.3".
Borne, for her part, hit back at both factions, saying "demagoguery is your only budgetary course".
The government also resorted to Article 49.3 earlier this year to push through unpopular pension reforms, sparking violent protests.

Musk, who was born in South Africa, has Canadian nationality and lives in the United States, shared a post calling for a victory of the far-right party AfD a week before regional elections in two major German states.
Berlin is locked a row with Italy over the NGO sea operations, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgio Meloni on Friday demanding that charity ships disembark the rescued migrants in their own countries.
Musk shared a post on X by a user identified as "Radio Genoa" that blasted German NGO operations in the Mediterranean and expressed hope that "AfD wins th…]]></summary>

At a ceremony in St. Peter's Square known as a consistory, Francis "created" 21 new cardinals, the red-hatted "princes of the Church" who are his closest advisers at the Vatican and around the world. There are now 137 cardinal electors, about 73 percent of them chosen by Francis. This increases - but does not guarantee - the possib...]]></summary>

The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also urged the Mexican government to avoid a repeat of the tragedy last year when 40 migrants died in a fire while behind bars. More than 240,000 undocumented migrants and asylum seekers were detained in Mexico in the first half of 2023, including many children, the experts said at the conclusion of a 12-day visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The head of Italy's rhythmic gymnastics national team, suspended after a group of former athletes made allegations of bullying over their weight and diets, received a simple warning on Friday.
Emanuela Maccarani had been relieved of her role within the Italian gymnastics federation (FGI) pending investigations into her behaviour.
On Friday, the FGI disciplinary commission, followed recommendations of the body's federal prosecutor Michele Rossetti that "there was no evidence of intentionally or excessively vexatious behavior in relations with the gymnasts".
"There was no relentless effort to obtain an additional medal," he added.
Maccarani's assistant Olga Tishina was cleared of any fault.
In late October, three former rhythmic gymnastics, including two double world champions, made claims of abuse in a series of interviews with daily La Repubblica.
One of the gymnasts, Anna Basta, said she had twice thought about killing herself, while 19-year-old Nina Corradini quit the national set-up in 2021 after spending "every minute of the previous few months wishing I could escape".
Giulia Galtarossa, a world champion in 2009 and 2010 who is and now 31, said she was berated by a coaching assistant for eating a pear, and handed her diet sheet with the message "we have a little piggy in the squad".
Maccarani had held the position of Italy's rhythmic gymnastics team's technical director since 2018. She was also the team's long-time head coach.
She had denied claims of psychological abuse, saying the accusations came from disgruntled gymnasts who were not selected for Olympic squads.
Parents of gymnasts training at the national centre in Desio wrote a letter to the head of Italy's Olympic Committee in support of the 57-year-old, who has won a raft of medals for Italy since taking charge in 1996.

Yousofi, who resettled in Australia last year after fleeing persecution in her homeland, is one of 14 women athletes listed in Afghanistan's team in Hangzhou.
"The most important thing for me is to represent our girls in Afghanistan," she said.
The other Afghan women are competing in volleyball and cycling, and like Yousofi have built new lives for themselves around the world.
Women's sport in Afghanistan was effectively banned by the Taliban when they returned to power in 2021.
That meant no women traveling from Afghanistan in the delegation of more than 120 competitors, coaches and supervisors.

Two months after an inconclusive general election resulted in a hung parliament, Spain’s protracted political horse-trading has delivered a first, highly expected verdict: there will be no conservative government led by Alberto Nunez-Feijoo – at least not in this legislature.
On Friday, the leader of the right-wing Popular Party (PP) conceded defeat in his second attempt to win the backing of Spain’s Congress of Deputies, the lower house of parliament, falling short of the 176 seats required for a majority…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Relatives of Saudis facing heavy sentences for social media posts are calling on the kingdom's de facto ruler to take action after he voiced shame over their cases.
In a rare interview with Fox News last week, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was asked about Mohammed al-Ghamdi, a retired school teacher sentenced to death in July for posts on X, formerly Twitter, where he had around 10 followers.
Prince Mohammed acknowledged that details of the case described in media reports were "true" and said he disapproved of the judgement.
"We are not happy with that. We are ashamed of that," he said, blaming "bad laws" he had so far been unable to change.
He also raised the possibility that Ghamdi might be spared death.
"I'm hoping that in the next phase of trials, the judge there is more experienced…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump Thursday night took a swipe at Fox News and the GOP debates, calling on an end to the primary and on those in the media to "stop with the bad debates and negative ads."
Trump on Thursday suggested that some of the GOP candidates did better than others at the recent Republican debate, even giving a report card for his rivals.

After that, he called for an end to the debates altogether.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Trump, who has skipped the first two debates and said he plans to avoid them all, had this to say late Thursday.

"The second Republican Primary Debate on FoxNews had the Lowest Viewership since 2016. Their overall Ratings are down 30%," he added. "FOX NEEDS MAGA, THEY JUST DON’T KNOW IT YET. STOP WITH THE BAD DEBATES & NEGATIVE ADS, NO MORE. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE! DJT."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six female migrants trapped inside a refrigerated food truck were rescued by French police after one of the women made a distress call to a reporter, the BBC and French authorities said Thursday.
The women — four Vietnamese and two Iraqis — hid for hours in a truck loaded with boxes of bananas in northern France, believing the vehicle was on its way to the U.K. or Ireland.
When they realized that the truck was going the opposite way, they started to panic in the cold and cramped, dark space. One of them managed to reach a BBC reporter in London, who then helped the women alert French police Wednesday.
French prosecutor Laetitia Francart said the truck driver, who was in fact heading for Italy, was not at fault. The women told investigators that the driver wasn’t involved, “saying that they…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twin shootings in Rotterdam on Thursday have resulted in an unknown number of fatalities, police said.
A gunman dressed in combat gear opened fire in a flat in the Dutch city then burst into a nearby medical centre. Fires broke out in both places but were later extinguished.
“The two shooting incidents in Rotterdam have resulted in fatalities. We will first inform family and relatives and will explain more later,” the city police said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.
Elite police units had burst into the hospital in the Dutch city searching for the suspect, who was armed with a handgun, authorities said.
The suspect is 32 and the motive for the attack is unknown, local news agency ANP said, citing police. He is suspected of carrying out both shootings and there is not a second shooter, police said.
Pictures from the scene showed people streaming out of the hospital, including medics and patients, as police in body armour moved in. Police helicopters buzzed overhead.
Medics in white coats wheeled patients out on stretchers and wheelchairs
Police had earlier said the suspect was wearing “combat-style” clothes, was tall, with black hair and carrying a backpack.
“First there was a shooting on the fourth floor. Four or five shots were fired. Then a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the education centre,” said a medical student cited by RTL Nieuws, who did not give his name.
“There was a lot of panic and screaming... I didn’t hear any shots, just the panic and that’s what I started to act on,” public broadcaster NOS cited another eyewitness as saying.
Rotterdam is often the scene of shootings, usually attributed to score settling by rival drug gangs.
Authorities were expected to hold a news conference shortly to give more details.
In 2019, three people were shot dead on a tram in Utrecht, sparking a huge manhunt.
And in 2011, the country was left shocked when 24-year Tristan van der Vlis killed six people and wounded 10 others in a rampage at a packed shopping mall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran actor Michael Gambon, who was known to many for his portrayal of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in six of the eight “Harry Potter” films, has died, his publicist said Thursday. He was 82.
A statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following “a bout of pneumonia.”
“We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside,” his family said.
No matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice. He was cast as the much-loved Dumbledore after the death of his predecessor, Richard Harris, in 2002.
He once acknowledged not having read a…]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
