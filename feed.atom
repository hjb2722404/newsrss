        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Romanian police have arrested the leader of an American white supremacist group wanted in the United States in connection with rioting, they said Friday.
The 33-year-old was arrested on Wednesday in Bucharest, police said without identifying him.
Local media named him as Robert Rundo, who co-founded and led the Rise Above Movement.
Rundo, together with several others of the California-based group, has been accused of inciting riots at far-right political rallies, including the deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
A Bucharest court on Thursday ordered the detention of the arrested man, who faces extradition, the police statement said.
The American is "wanted by the US justice for having committed crimes of conspiracy to riot and rioting activities," it added.
He "allegedly conspired with other people to go to rallies of a political nature and use combative tactics and commit physical violence against individuals and groups who did not support their ideology", it said.
Romania and the United States have a reciprocal extradition treaty since 2008.
The "Unite the Right" march in mid-August 2017 in Charlottesville culminated in a man driving a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring 19 others.
Then president Donald Trump infamously took 48 hours to respond only to blame "both sides" despite overwhelming evidence that neo-Nazis were the principal source of violence.

Dozens of worshippers celebrating a major religious holiday on Thursday plunged into the stepwell — a stair-lined communal water source — after the floor covering it collapsed in the central city of Indore.
"Thirty-five people are dead. One person is still missing. Rescue operations are on," Indore district magistrate Ilayaraja T. told AFP by phone.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday he was "extremely pained" by news of the accident. 
"The state government is spearheading rescue and relief work at a quick pace," he added. "My prayers with all those affected and their families."

"At least I've succeeded in winning over my political opponents," she told AFP with a smile during an interview last week. "They seem to spend their lives telling everyone that I will be the next president.
"Now it's up to me to convince a majority of the country."
President Emmanuel Macron's proposal to raise the minimum retirement age to 64 has triggered the biggest demonstrations in a generation and a fierce backlash against the government and politicians in general.

EurAsian Times: Russia To Deploy S-500 ‘Prometheus’ Air Defense Missiles To Defend Moscow As Ukrainian Strikes Become Frequent 
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced earlier this month that the country would finish modernizing the missile defense systems pressed into duty to protect the capital, Moscow, by the end of this year. 
The nation will establish an air defense division and brigade, a special-purpose air and missile defense brigade, an anti-aircraft regiment with the S-350 surface-to-air missile complex, a space monitoring radar station Razvyazka and a special operations brigade for air and missile defense by 2023 end, Shoigu said. 
Starting in 2020, a significant part of Russia’s State Armament Program has focused on developing aerospace defense capabilities. Over 3.4 trillion Rubles (roughly US$44.3 billion) have been invested in the initiative since it began in 2011, with the air defense upgrade making up about 17.5% of that total.

Asia Times:  Russia to power China’s nuclear weapon ambitions

 
‘No limits’ partnership means Russia will provide China the tech and fuel it needs to tip the prevailing global nuclear bomb balance 
Russia plans to provide fast breeder nuclear reactor technology to China, an agreement that could allow Beijing to significantly grow its nuclear arsenal and tip the prevailing global balance of nuclear weapons. 
This month, Bloomberg reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping announced a long-term agreement to continue developing fast breeder nuclear reactors optimized for plutonium production for nuclear weapons. 
The report notes that in December 2022, Russia’s-state owned Rosatom nuclear power company finished transferring 25 tons of highly-enriched uranium to China’s CFR-600 nuclear reactor, which analysts say has the capacity to produce 50 nuclear warheads a year.

FOX News: Brazil, China strike trade deal agreement to ditch US dollar 
Brazil and China have reportedly struck a deal to ditch the U.S. dollar in favor of their own currencies in trade transactions. 
The deal, announced Wednesday, will enable China and Brazil to carry out trade and financial transactions directly, exchanging yuan for reais – or vice versa – rather than first converting their currencies to the U.S. dollar. 
Brazil-China

The Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil) said the new arrangement is expected to "reduce costs" and "promote even greater bilateral trade and facilitate investment."

 Foreign Affairs: Xi Jinping Says He Is Preparing China for War

 
The World Should Take Him Seriously 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping says he is preparing for war. At the annual meeting of China’s parliament and its top political advisory body in March, Xi wove the theme of war readiness through four separate speeches, in one instance telling his generals to “dare to fight.” His government also announced a 7.2 percent increase in China’s defense budget, which has doubled over the last decade, as well as plans to make the country less dependent on foreign grain imports. And in recent months, Beijing has unveiled new military readiness laws, new air-raid shelters in cities across the strait from Taiwan, and new “National Defense Mobilization” offices countrywide. 
It is too early to say for certain what these developments mean. Conflict is not certain or imminent. But something has changed in Beijing that policymakers and business leaders worldwide cannot afford to ignore. If Xi says he is readying for war, it would be foolish not to take him at his word.

WNU Editor: To be fair. Chinese President Xi has been telling China to prepare for war for a very long time. From 2021 .... Xi Jinping orders China’s military to be ready for war ‘at any time’ (American Military News). 
But the mood in China is different this time. The U.S. and China have always had their differences, but House Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan last year was IMHO the straw that "broke the camel's back". And what is worse is that I sense the lines of communication between Beijing and Washington are now being shut down, and the rhetoric only becoming more hostile and confrontational.]]></summary>

Tsai arrived in New York on Wednesday on her way to Central America, and on her way back to Taipei next week will stop in Los Angeles where she is expected to meet U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, an interaction China has warned could lead to a "serious confrontation" in U.S.-China relations.

More than 20 far-right Austrian MPs walked out of parliament during a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
The politicians from the Freedom Party (FPO) argued Mr Zelensky's speech violated Austria's neutrality. 
They warned ahead of the speech they would hold some form of protest against the address. 
Austria has previously said it cannot help Ukraine's defence militarily, but does support Kyiv politically. 
In a video address, Mr Zelensky thanked Austria for its humanitarian assistance and help clearing land mines. 
He was speaking on the 400th day of Russian invasion.

He also invited MPs to travel to Ukraine for themselves and see the destruction caused.

"Any U.S. citizen residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately as stated in our latest travel advisory. Those who require assistance in departing Russia should contact the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for assistance." 
A Moscow court ruled that U.S. national, and journalist for the Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich should be detained for nearly two months on suspicion of spying. 
It is believed to be the first criminal case for espionage against a foreign journalist in post-Soviet Russia, a crime punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment.

BBC: Turkey approves Finland Nato membership bid 
Finland will become the 31st member of Nato after Turkey's parliament voted to approve its application. 
Turkey had delayed Finland's bid to join the West's defensive alliance for months - complaining the Nordic nation was supporting "terrorists". 
Sweden, which applied to join Nato at the same time last year, is still being blocked by Ankara over similar complaints. 
Any Nato expansion needs the support of all its members. 
Finland will now be formally admitted into Nato at its next summit, taking place in July in Lithuania. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave his approval to Finland's bid earlier in March, praising the country's "authentic and concrete steps" on Turkish security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Trump hit with criminal charges in New York, a first for a US ex-president -New York Times 
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury after a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, becoming the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges even as he makes another run for the White House, a law enforcement source said on Thursday. 
The charges, arising from an investigation led by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, could reshape the 2024 presidential race. 
Trump previously said he would continue campaigning for the Republican Party's nomination if charged with a crime. 
The specific charges are not yet known and the indictment will likely be announced in the coming days, the New York Times reported. Trump will have to travel to Manhattan for fingerprinting and other processing at that point.

Donald Trump has doubled his lead in the Republican presidential primary amid reports he'll be indicted by the Manhattan district attorney's office, a new poll finds. 
Voters see the case as politically motivating, pollster Daron Shaw said, and it's bringing them back to Trump's corner. 
The Fox News poll found Trump has doubled his lead since February and is up by 30 points over Ron DeSantis, 54% to the Florida governor's 24%.  Last month, Trump led DeSantis by 15 points: 43% to 28%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Bakhmut is 'a slaughter-fest for the Russians' who are 'getting hammered' by Ukrainian forces in the area and 'not making any progress whatsoever' 
* US General Mark Milley said late last night that Russia was suffering major losses 
 * Hard fighting in and around Bakhmut has inflicted huge casualties on both sides 
Russian forces are 'getting hammered' in the battle for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in fighting described as a 'slaughter-fest' by senior US officials. 
Chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley told lawmakers late last night: 'The Russians have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut. 
'It's a slaughter-fest for the Russians. They're getting hammered in the vicinity of Bakhmut and the Ukrainians have fought very very well.'

WNU Editor: The media narrative from the West continues to stay same. The battle for Bakhmut is going their way, and Russian forces are getting slaughtered .... Ukrainians in a Hidden Command Post See Bakhmut Going Their Way (DNYUZ/New York Times). But the problem with this narrative is that if the Russian forces are facing massive losses that would cripple any army, how come they continue to advance and seize more territory .... Ukraine controls a third of Bakhmut, says presidential adviser (Straits Times).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[new video posted to his Truth Social platform on Thursday, former President Donald Trump went after Gov. Ron DeSantis for being purportedly disrespectful to Russian despot Vladimir Putin.
"Calling Russia 'a gas station with a bunch of nuclear weapons' or calling Putin a, quote, 'authoritarian gas station attendant with some legacy of nuclear weapons from the old Soviet Union' is exactly the kind of simple-minded thinking that has produced decades of failed diplomacy and war," said Trump. "Where is that war going? Those such as Mitt Romney and Ron DeSantis ... who insist on arrogantly treating Russia as deeply inferior to the other nations of the world, with no history or culture or pride, are not only ignorant and foolish, but that attitude makes it impossible to negotiate peace, absolutely impossible."
Trump went on to accuse DeSantis of "rude" treatment of Putin, even while claiming that his administration was "tougher on Russia than any administration before."
"This kind of neocon rhetoric mocking Russia's nuclear weapons, along with implying that Putin must be tried and presumably executed as a war criminal, only increases the risk of deadly, nuclear escalation," said Trump, parroting a frequent Kremlin talking point.

In fact, it is Russia that has made unprovoked threats of nuclear war, in response to the lack of progress in their assault on Ukraine.
This comes after DeSantis, who came under fire from fellow Florida Republicans for dismissing the Ukraine invasion as a "territorial dispute" the United States can't be perpetually involved in, backpedaled and put out a statement fiercely criticizing Putin.]]></summary>

Al Jazeera: Colombian rebels kill nine soldiers in blow to peace talks  
Preliminary military assessment has identified the left-wing ELN as responsible for the attack in a northern province. 
An attack by the Colombian rebel group known as the National Liberation Army (ELN) has allegedly killed nine government soldiers, in a blow to the government’s efforts to negotiate a truce with armed groups and curb violence in the country. 
The attack, one of the deadliest to occur in the last several months, took place on Wednesday in the rural state of Norte de Santander, near the border with Venezuela. It came more than two weeks after the government and the ELN held a second round of ceasefire negotiations in Mexico City.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon will testify about his bank allegedly profiting from Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, Law&Crime reported. 
According to the Virgin Islands government, Dimon knew about Epstein’s crimes by at least 2008, which was the year Epstein was convicted. JPMorgan has insisted that Dimon is “not relevant” to the lawsuit, saying that he wasn’t involved in any decisions related to Epstein’s account.
Senior U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has denied the bank's motions to dismiss the case, saying there's sufficient evidence that JPMorgan knew Epstein was sex trafficking minors while they were doing business with him.
"Since being sued, JPMorgan filed a third-party lawsuit against their former senior executive Jes Staley, who later became the CEO of Barclays Bank. Staley has been under pressure after British regulators scrutinized the 1,200 emails that were exchanged with Epstein from 2008 through 2012," Law&Crime's report stated. "The communications showed that Staley appeared to visit Epstein’s island Little St. James, while Epstein was still incarcerated. Epstein sent Staley multiple emails with photographs of a young woman, and regulators say he sent transfers of money to women with Eastern European surnames timed around Staley’s visits to his properties."

The Virgin Islands government argues that JPMorgan can’t make Staley the scapegoat for everything. 
“If Staley is a rogue employee, why isn’t Jamie Dimon?” Virgin Islands attorney general’s private counsel Mimi Liu asked on March 16, saying the key question in the litigation isn’t “whether or not Mr. Staley raped any young women in the Virgin Islands.”
“The question is: What did he know?” Liu continued. “And Jamie Dimon knew in 2008 that his billionaire client was a child sex trafficker. Staley knew, Dimon knew, JPMorgan knew.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: 9 soldiers killed after 2 Black Hawk helicopters crash in Kentucky during training mission, Army says  
Nine US service members were killed after two helicopters with the 101st Airborne Division crashed late Wednesday in southwestern Kentucky, officials said. There were no survivors. 
The two HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters crashed around 10 p.m. in Trigg County near the Tennessee border, officials at nearby Fort Campbell said early Thursday. They were taking part “in a routine training mission when the incident occurred,” the base said in a statement on Facebook. 
The helicopters were medical evacuation aircraft, and it’s believed the crash happened while they were flying and not during a medical evacuation drill, Brig. Gen. John Lubas, deputy commander of the 101st Airborne Division, said during a Thursday morning news conference at Fort Campbell.

Now he is being asked to do it all over again.
Ermotti was originally propelled into the role of chief executive at UBS Group AG in 2011 by a rogue trader scandal. He helped rehabilitate the bank before leaving nine years later.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has a respiratory infection and will need to spend "a few days" in hospital for treatment, the Vatican said in a statement on Wednesday, amid concern for the 86-year-old's condition.
The 86-year-old pontiff was taken to Rome's Gemelli hospital after complaining of breathing difficulties over the past few days, the statement said. Tests showed he had the infection but did not have COVID-19, it said.
"Pope Francis is touched by the many messages received and expresses his gratitude for the closeness and prayer," the Vatican said.
Francis, who this month marked 10 years as pope, is sometimes short of breath and generally more exposed to respiratory problems. He had part of one lung removed in his early 20s when trai…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Number of usable nuclear warheads increased in 2022 — report  
The world's stockpile of usable nuclear warheads increased by over 130 in 2022, Norwegian People's Aid has reported. The authors have warned of the risk that nuclear weapons pose to humanity. 
The number of nuclear warheads that states could deploy reached a total of 9,576 at the beginning of 2023, up from 9,440 the previous year, according to a report published by the NGO Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) on Wednesday. 
The Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor report said that the weaponized nuclear power amounted to a "collective destructive power of more than 135,000 Hiroshima bombs."
The issue of nuclear weapons has become its most prominent since the end of the Cold War thanks in part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent aggressive rhetoric, as well as fears over Iran's nuclear program and North Korea's renewed missile tests.

WASHINGTON: The United States has told Russia it will cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces following Moscow's refusal to do so, the White House said on Tuesday (Mar 28), calling this a response to Russia's suspending participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty. 
While Russian President Vladimir Putin has not formally withdrawn from the treaty, which limits the two sides' deployed strategic nuclear arsenals, his Feb 21 suspension imperils the last pillar of US-Russian arms control. 
Between the two of them, the United States and Russia hold nearly 90 per cent of the world's nuclear warheads - enough to destroy the planet many times over.  "Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia's breaches of the New START Treaty by taking proportionate and reversible countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations," a spokesperson for the National Security Council said.

        <updated>2023-03-29T23:07:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[United States Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) published an editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal on Wednesday in which he voiced opposition to a ban on the popular app TikTok that passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently being debated in the Senate.
Paul, a libertarian conservative, attacked the proposal as a surefire way to alienate young voters and assailed it as an affront to Republicans' supposed aversion to censorship.
"This GOP strategy comes while polls indicate that 71% of young women and 53% of young men voted for a Democrat candidate for Congress. Now admittedly, many Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for this ban but like most such issues, the blame will stick to Republicans more," Paul wrote. "The banning TikTok strategy also comes while the GOP simultaneously complains of liberal U.S. social media companies canceling and censoring conservatives. So, without a hint of irony, many of these same 'conservatives' now agitate to ban a platform owned by an international group that includes several American investors."
Paul warned that prohibiting Americans from accessing Tiktok means that the US may "emulate China’s speech bans," noting that the app is already banned in China.
Paul also wondered, "does TikTok do the Chinese government’s bidding?" noting that "videos are all over TikTok that are critical of official Chinese positions."
After reiterating his fear of censorship, Paul concluded that "if you don't like TikTok or Facebook or YouTube, don't use them. But don't think any interpretation of the Constitution gives you the right to ban them."]]></summary>

Milley testifies before the House Appropriations Committee-Defense on the 2024 DoD Budget in the Rayburn House Office Building, March 23, 2023, in Washington D.C. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Alexander Kubitza)   
Military.com: Not Stopping Russia in Ukraine Would Force 'Doubling' of US Defense Budget, Milley Says 
The top general in the U.S. military warned Thursday that not supporting Ukraine now would lead to a massive increase in future defense budgets -- and global conflict that has been avoided since World War II ended. 
 "If that rules-based order, which is in its 80th year, if that goes out the window, then be very careful," Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley testified to Congress on Thursday. "We'll be doubling our defense budgets at that point because that will introduce not an era of great power competition. That'll begin an era of great power conflict. And that'll be extraordinarily dangerous for the whole world." 
Milley's remark at a House Appropriations Committee defense subcommittee hearing comes amid growing skepticism from Republicans about the price tag of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Milley was testifying alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about the Biden administration's $842 billion request for Pentagon spending for fiscal 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The public face of Pope Francis' efforts to root out child sex abuse in the Catholic Church has quit his position after growing "increasingly concerned" over how the papal advisory body works, Agence France Presse reported.
Hans Zollner's resignation from the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors comes as the agency continued to be dogged by controversy. 
“The protection of children and vulnerable persons must be at the heart of the Catholic Church’s mission,” he wrote in a statement. “Over the last few years, I have grown increasingly concerned with how the commission, in my perception, has gone about achieving that goal, particularly in the areas of responsibility, compliance, accountability and transparency.”
Contradicting Zollner's statement, Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors head Cardinal Sean O’Malley claimed that Zollner resigned because of his busy workload. 
"Zollner was the last remaining founding member of the group, which was set up by Pope Francis in 2014 as he strove to rid the Catholic Church of the scourge of sex abuse by clerics," AFP's report states. "Problems emerged as early as 2017, when abuse survivor Marie Collins resigned as a member of the commission, saying the body was under-resourced and faced fierce resistance within high echelons of the church. Fellow commission member and survivor Peter Saunders also quit later that year."]]></summary>

The Guardian: ‘This is very bad for them’: months of leaks rattle Canada’s low-profile spy agency  
Allegations of attempted meddling by China put uncomfortable spotlight on publicity-shy CSIS 
Most Canadians have no idea where the country’s spy agency is located, nor do they know much about its daily operations. This is not because the Canadian Security Intelligence Service operates in a particularly clandestine fashion, it’s because most Canadians don’t care. 
The CSIS, a civilian-run organisation based in a triangular structure of concrete and glass on the outskirts of Ottawa, lacks the intrigue of Britain’s MI5 and the notoriety of America’s Central Intelligence Agency. 
“I look nothing like Daniel Craig, and I did not arrive here in an Aston Martin. I’m just as disappointed as you are – on both fronts,” its director, David Vigneault, said in a speech in 2018, poking fun at the service’s largely uncharismatic reputation. “Most of you remember the movie Fight Club. And you will know that the first rule of Fight Club is ‘don’t talk about Fight Club’. Well, the first rule of CSIS has always been ‘don’t talk’. Period.”

WNU Editor: No one really knows where these leaks are coming from. But it is clear that there is at least one person in the national security bureaucracy who is not satisfied with the complete lack of response from the Canadian government on intelligence reports that China is interfering in Canada's elections.]]></summary>

'We are ready to see him here,’ Ukrainian president says. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to Ukraine, for what would be the first direct communication between the two leaders since the beginning of Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. 
“We are ready to see [Xi] here,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with the Associated Press, a U.S. newswire, on a train to Kyiv, adding, “I want to speak with him.”  “I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have [contact],” Zelenskyy said.

Update #1: Zelensky invites China’s Xi to visit Ukraine (The Hill)  
Update #2: Zelensky invites Xi Jinping to Ukraine (Ukrinform)   
WNU editor: I personally would not mind if Chinese President Xi goes to Kyiv. Anything to get the peace process moving forward should be supported. But I also know the Chinese do not operate like this. The will want Zelensky to first fly to Beijing to meet Xi. I also know the Chinese will first want to enter into talks before any official announcement is made. 
Beijing will not want President Xi to fly to Ukraine, or President Zelensky flying to Beijing, just for a photo-op. Beijing will want something concrete in return, but the problem is that I do not see Ukraine President Zelensky willing to compromise on anything right now.   
Update #3: This is not a good sign. The Chinese Foreign ministry does not know what the Ukraine President is talking about .... China’s MFA has no information about possible Zelensky–Xi meeting (Ukrinform).]]></summary>

RFE: Bulgaria's Pro-Kremlin Leader Refuses To Send Soviet-Era Fighter Jets And Tanks To Ukraine  
With its stockpile of Soviet-era weapons, Bulgaria, home to a thriving arms industry, could be a key ally of Ukraine, which is trained on and equipped with such arms, in its war against invading Russian forces. 
But with parliament now dissolved ahead of elections on April 2, the fifth snap poll in two years amid political uncertainty, the caretaking government is in no mood to provide lethal aid to Kyiv, appointed as it was by President Rumen Radev, who is known for his pro-Kremlin leanings.

Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam Museum, in eastern England, is acting on the advice of a government-appointed expert panel, which investigates claims for Nazi loot.
For more than a year, the panel probed the history of "La Ronde Enfantine", an oil landscape dating from about 1862 that has been lying in the museum's storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A woman in northern France is to be put on trial on charges of insulting President Emmanuel Macron after describing him as 'filth' in a Facebook post, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.
The woman, risks a fine of 12,000 euros but not prison if convicted at the trial due to be held in June.
She was arrested on Friday and held in custody for questioning after the state's local administrative office filed a complaint over her Facebook post, the prosecutor in the northern town of Saint Omer, Mehdi Benbouzid, told AFP.
The complaint focused on a post on her Facebook page made on March 21, the day before Macron gave a lunchtime interview to TF1 television to defend his controversial pension reforms that have sparked nationwide protests.
"This piece of filth is going to address you at 1:00 pm... it's always on television that we see this filth," she wrote.
The woman, in her 50s, had been a supporter of the 2018-2019 "Yellow Vest" protests that shook Macron during his first mandate.
She stands accused of "insulting the president of the republic" and will stand trial on June 20 in Saint Omer, the prosecutor said.
"They want to make an example of me," the woman told La Voix du Nord regional newspaper which first reported the accusations.
The woman, named by the paper as Valerie, said she was astonished when she answered the knock on the door on Friday morning to find police had come to arrest her.
"I asked them if it was a joke, I had never been arrested," she said. "I am not public enemy number one."
The months-long protest movement against the pension reform has sent social tensions spiraling in France and Macron and his government refuse to give way.
New clashes between police and protesters erupted Tuesday and unions have announced a new day of strikes and protests on April 6.

"The Holy Father has been at Gemelli (Hospital) since this afternoon for some previously scheduled checks," wrote Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni in a one-sentence statement.
The pontiff, who earlier this month marked 10 years as head of the Catholic Church, had earlier appeared in good spirits at his weekly audience at the Vatican, smiling as he greeted the faithful from his "popemobile".
However, he was seen grimacing as he was helped getting into the vehicle.
Pope Francis suffers from chronic knee pain that has forced him to rely on a wheelchair in recent months.

ABC News: Russian jets of newer generation increase 'dominance' in combat zone, Ukrainian official says   

Ukrainian officials said Russia has replaced ageing jets with updated Su-35s.  
Newer generation fighter jets are giving Russia "increasing dominance" in the skies over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, according to a senior Ukrainian official. 
It is a potentially worrying shift for the United States and its allies because Russia’s inability to achieve total air superiority throughout the course of the war has been key to Ukrainian successes on the battlefield. 
In a briefing last week with journalists, a Western official downplayed the concern, stating that Russia’s ability to control the skies has been limited by air defense and surface-to-air missiles. 
"We’re not seeing a huge change in that situation," the official said. 
The senior official in Kyiv, who spoke exclusively to ABC News, said Russia had replaced older models of aircraft with its more modern Su-35.

Politico:  Russia removes submarines from Crimea to avoid Ukraine’s firepower, UK says 
British intelligence says relocation is highly likely due to ‘a change in local security threat.’  Russia has “almost certainly” removed its submarines from Crimea, British intelligence said Tuesday. 
The Kremlin’s move comes as a reaction to Ukraine’s new “long-strike range capability” and repeated attacks on the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula, from where the Russian Black Sea fleet has now “almost certainly relocated its KILO-class submarines” to Novorossiysk in southern Russia, the U.K. said. 
In a statement, the British defense ministry said that the submarine relocation is “highly likely” due to the “change in local security threat level,” after the fleet headquarters and main naval aviation field were attacked in recent months.

WNU Editor: This UK report makes sense. The expectation in Moscow is that NATO will soon be transporting even longer range weapon missile and drone systems to Ukraine. It is why anti-air platforms are being installed around Moscow, and why assets like Russia's strategic bomber fleet are being moved farther away from Ukraine. I guess submarines are now being included on the list.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
