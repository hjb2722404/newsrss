        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian nuclear warfare is becoming a serious concern, following threats made by Russian President Vladimir Putin as Ukraine continues to hold its ground. 

Australian Financial Review Special Correspondent Misha Zelinsky says “if Putin escalates to nuclear warfare, all bets would be off at that point”.

“As he gets increasingly cornered, as he continues to lose ground, it is certainly something that he may be contemplating,” he told Sky News Australia.

“People inside Russia around Putin know that’s insane, so to be launching nuclear weapons is unthinkable.”]]></summary>

"So, we're very, very close."

Professor Siracusa went on to note the "chances of war ... between Putin and Biden are about 10 per cent if given their own ability to do so". 

"The chances of an accidental war right now are about 90 per cent because there are no guardrails anywhere and theatre commanders can do what they want," Professor Siracusa said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stock market movements over the next few weeks will be key in determining whether we are heading into a short-term or long-term recession, according to forex trader and crypto analyst Alessio Rastani.
During the period October-December 2022, the analyst expects to see the S&P recover.  “If this bounces back or the rally fails and comes back down, then most likely we are entering a long-term recession and something very close to similar to 2008,” Rastani said in the latest Cointelegraph interview. 
According to the analyst, such a recession could last until 2024 and would inevitably negatively impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC). 
Speaking about the latest pound crisis, Rastani believed that its main cause is the rally in the US dollar, which is putting pressure on most other fiat currencies, including the yen and the euro.  However, according to Rastani, the US dollar is approaching the top. 
“Once we see a clear break, a sustained break of the 111.5 and 110 levels on the dollar index, then I think the dollar is at the top. And then I’m looking for a multi-month decline in the dollar at 104 at the 100 level on the dollar index,” he explained.

It was the first time an Indian, or, for that matter, an Asian, had enjoyed such a distinction. South Asians in my circle of family and friends felt excited at the prospect that a man who looked like us had entered such rarefied ranks.

Reuters: U.S. lawmakers promise more money, weapons as Ukraine faces 'Hurricane Putin' 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday they wanted to continue the flow of money and weapons for Ukraine's battle against Russia's invasion, denouncing Moscow's plan to annex four Ukrainian regions. 
"We have not won this yet. We need to continue to support the Ukrainians," Democrat Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters after a classified briefing on the conflict. 
The Senate passed a bill funding the federal government through Dec. 16, and sending $12.3 billion in military and economic assistance to Ukraine. The bill, which the House of Representatives is set to pass on Friday, also authorizes President Joe Biden to direct the drawdown of up to $3.7 billion for the transfer to Ukraine of weapons from U.S. stocks.

Less than a month into the job, the new Tory leader will sit down with the BBC in Birmingham, where the party is kicking off its four-day gathering, and is expected to again defend her controversial economic plans.
Opposition parties, much of the public and even Conservative MPs -- notably backers of her defeated leadership rival Rishi Sunak -- are aghast at the debt-fueled proposals to cut taxes unveiled by Truss and finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng.
Markets tanked in response to the package, and the Bank of England staged an emergency intervention to bail out embattled pension funds, setting t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hundreds of thousands people marched and rallied Saturday in over 50 towns and cities across the UK on a National Day of Action protesting the cost of living crisis in the largest wave of simultaneous protests seen in Britain for many years.
The organizers of the 'Enough is Enough' campaign lists their five demands as:

A real pay rise
Slash energy bills
End food poverty
Decent homes for all
Tax the rich

"The people need to be out in the streets and demanding change from this government, and if necessary, a change of government entirely," said Mick Lynch, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime, and Transport Workers (RMT), in a TV interview Friday, as he noted that top executives in the rail industry are expected to gain up to £60,000 ($67,000) from the "mini-budget" introduced by the Conservative government last week.
At King’s Cross rail station in central London, activists supported striking rail workers by rallying outside.
MP Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, spoke to the large crowd in London denouncing the new government’s plans to cut taxes for the richest and benefits for the poorest.
“Our strength is our organization, our strength is our unity,” Corbyn said. “So let’s stand up for what we believe in.”

Don't Pay, a campaign to encourage people to not pay their energy bills, also joined Saturday's rallies.

Nelson's body was found on the slopes of the world's eighth highest mountain on Wednesday, two days after she disappeared as she was skiing down from its summit.
Monks chanted prayers and played traditional drums as her family and fellow climbers offered flowers and traditional Buddhist scarves on her body.
"The cremation was done today, attended by her brother, other climbers and officials," Jiban Ghimire of Shangri-La Nepal Trek, which organized the expedition, told AFP.
Orange marigolds decorated the cremation area at the foothills of Swayambhu Nath stupa, one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine said Saturday its forces had begun moving into the key eastern town of Lyman, located in one of the four Ukrainian regions that Russia annexed, with President Volodymyr Zelensky pledging more areas would follow within the week.
The latest development -- a feature of Kyiv's weeks-long counter-offensive against Moscow's invasion -- comes as Germany's defense minister made a surprise visit to Ukraine, but also amid accusations Russia killed 24 civilians in the eastern Kharkiv region.
The recapture of Lyman -- which Moscow's forces pummeled for weeks to control this spring -- would mark the first Ukrainian military victory in territory that the Kremlin has claimed as its own and has vowed to defend by all possible means.

A wave of street violence has rocked Iran since Amini, 22, died days after her arrest for allegedly failing to observe the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.
Protests were held across the country for a 15th consecutive night on Friday despite a bloody crackdown that rights groups said has left more than 75 people dead.
Tens of thousands have also come out for solidarity rallies in several Canadian cities, including Vancouver, Toronto and the capital Ottawa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis made an impassioned appeal on Sunday to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop "this spiral of violence and death" in Ukraine, saying the crisis there was risking a nuclear escalation with uncontrollable global consequences.
In an address dedicated to Ukraine and made to thousands of people in St. Peter's Square, Francis also appealed to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be open to any "serious peace proposal".
Francis said he was making an urgent appeal "in the name of God" for an end to the conflict and said it was "absurd" that the world was risking a nuclear conflict.
Speaking two days after Putin proclaimed the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine and placed the regions under Russia's nuclear umbrella, Francis also defended all countries' right to "sovereign and territorial integrity".
"My appeal goes above all to the president of the Russian Federation, begging him to stop this spiral of violence and death, even out of love for his own people," Francis said.
"On the other side, pained by the enormous suffering of the Ukrainian population following the aggression it suffered, I address an equally hopeful appeal to the president of Ukraine to be open to a serious peace proposal," he said.
Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned Putin's annexations as illegal, and Zelenskiy has said his forces will continue their fight to recapture all Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This company tries to give reality a run for its money. 
New updates introduced by tech giant Google bring more social media-like capabilities to the platform, while putting it in direct competition with physical existence itself. 
At an event in San Jose, California this week called Search On, the company announced the rollout of various new tools to Google Maps, including the ability to use AI and stranger accounts to attempt assess the present and predict the future.  to find out which attractions are busy at certain times, for example – as well as another way to explore the world without leaving your bed. 
The first of these updates allows users to “check the vibe before visiting” a new area by identifying the most popular locations, using AI-collected insights and over 20 million user contributions around the world that feed Google Maps daily. 
“Let’s say you’re on a trip to Paris – you can quickly tell if a neighborhood is artsy or has an exciting food scene so you can make an informed decision on how to spend your time,” reads a blog post on the new “neighborhood ambience function.
“To determine the vibe of a neighborhood, we combine AI with local knowledge from Google Maps users who add more than 20 million contributions to the map every day,” Google wrote in its announcement blog post.Google
Savvy users have long been able to glean this information from Google Maps by providing a visual overview of a location, but now there’s an easier way to do this that’s rolling out to mobile devices. 
The other buzzy Maps update is the addition of an “immersive view”, a long time job an addition that uses predictive modeling to learn about a place’s historical trends and, based on these, “determine what an area will look like tomorrow, next week, and even next month,” the blog announced. 
“Need to find a bite after the game?  We make it easy to experience nearby restaurants with the ability to slide down to street level, peek inside and know how crowded it will be,” the blog post offers. for exemple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uber is a must in the gig economy, for better or worse, and a disruptor that once sent shockwaves throughout the mobility space.  Now, however, Uber is being taken for a ride.  The company is handling a cybersecurity breach that is believed to be far-reaching.  According to the ride-sharing giant, the attacker was unable to access sensitive user data, or at least there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.  Whether sensitive user data was exposed or not, this case indicates a persistent problem with today’s applications.  Can we continue to sacrifice our data – and therefore our privacy and security – for convenience?
Web2, the land of hackable honeypots
Uber’s data breach record isn’t exactly spotless.  In July alone, the ride-hailing giant admitted to covering up a massive breach in 2016 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a speech Wednesday on hunger, nutrition and health, the President Joe Biden called and looked for the late rep. Jackie Walorski (R-IN) who, along with two other people, died in a car accident last month.
“Jacky, are you there?  Where is Jackie? asked Biden.  “I didn’t think she would be here.”
MSNBC did not cover this inexcusable and embarrassing gaffe, while CNN only had two pieces on its website, as opposed to its airwaves.
Give credit where it’s due, CNN’s online report about the mortifying error was solid because it was just the facts, as it should be when reporting.  The Other Room, An Analysis by the Editor Chris Cillizza, declared that while it was “a pretty big mistake to make,” the gaffe “plays in a cartoon that Republicans — led by the former president donald trump – have …]]></summary>

That’s all the three Aurora, Colorado police officers got the day they encountered the 23-year-old.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Danish Energy Agency says that one of the two ruptured gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea    seems to have stopped leaking natural gas.  The agency said on Twitter on Saturday that it was told by the company that operates the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that pressure appears to have stabilized in the pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany.
“This indicates that the gas leak in this pipeline has ceased,” the Danish Energy Agency said.
Underwater explosions that damaged the Nord Stream I and 2 pipelines this week led to large methane leaks.  Nordic investigators said the explosions involved several hundred kilograms of explosives.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused the West of sabotaging Russian-built pipelines, a charge vehemently denied by the United States and its allies.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Euronews/Reuters: Latvia prime minister's New Unity party wins general election — early results 
RIGA (Reuters) -The centre-right New Unity party of Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins won Saturday's election, according to provisional results, with its 19% of the vote putting him in a position to head another coalition government. 
The results - with 96% of districts counted - mean Latvia should remain a leading voice alongside its Baltic neighbours Lithuania and Estonia in pushing the European Union for a decisive stance against Russia. 
Karins' party was again the party with the most support following the election. Members of the current coalition were on track to receive 42 seats in the 100-seat parliament, so Karins needs to draft additional allies to stay as a prime minister.  As many as nine parties could win sufficient votes to secure seats in parliament.

Update: Latvian premier's party emerges on top in general election (AP)   
WNU Editor: Even though he won about 20% of the vote, being the party that won the most votes means that he will receive 42 seats in the 100-seat parliament. A coalition will need to be formed with other parties. The energy crisis and high inflation will be the first issues the new government will need to face.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Navy recruit, 21, is found NOT GUILTY of 2020 arson that gutted USS Bonhomme Richard and caused $1.2B in damage - as it's revealed there was a SECOND suspect who was kicked out of service 
 * Seaman Recruit Ryan Mays was found not guilty of setting the fire that destroyed USS Bonhomme Richard in July 2020

 * The ship burned for more than four days and caused an estimated $1.2 billion in damages 
 * Mays' defense introduced information that the Navy had another suspect they gave up on after the sailor was kicked out of the service 
A 21-year-old Navy recruit was found not guilty of arson in the fire that destroyed the USS Bonhomme Richard in July 2020.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops said they had taken the key bastion of Lyman in occupied eastern Ukraine, a stinging defeat that prompted a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin to call for the possible use of low-grade nuclear weapons.
The capture on Saturday came just a day after Putin proclaimed the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is located - and placed the regions under Russia's nuclear umbrella. Kyiv and the West condemned the ornate ceremony as an illegitimate farce.
Ukrainian soldiers announced the capture in a video recorded outside the town council building in the centre of Lyman and posted on social media by Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) -Armed soldiers in fatigues and masks appeared on television in Burkina Faso on Friday night to confirm the ouster of President Paul-Henri Damiba, the second coup in the troubled West African country this year.
The announcement capped a day that began with gunfire near a military camp in the capital Ouagadougou, an explosion near the presidential palace, and interruptions to state television programming.
It is a pattern that has become increasingly familiar in West and Central Africa in the past two years as Islamist insurgents wreak havoc across the arid expanses of the Sahel region, killing thousands and eroding faith in weak governments that have not found a way to beat them back.

        <updated>2022-10-02T00:31:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indonesian police said on Sunday that 127 people had died and 180 were injured after a stampede following crowd trouble at a football match in the province of East Java overnight.
After the match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya had ended, supporters from the losing team had invaded the pitch and police had fired tear gas, triggering a stampede and cases of suffocation, East Java police chief Nico Afinta told reporters.
Video footage from local news channels showed people rushing onto the pitch in the stadium in Malang and images of body bags.
The Indonesian top league BRI Liga 1 has suspended games for a week following the match that Persebaya won 3-2 and an investigation had been launched, the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) said.
There have been previous outbreaks of trouble at matches in Indonesia, with a strong rivalry between clubs sometimes leading to violence among supporters.

The underdog made a comeback. Now, here’s what Ukraine needs to sustain its victories.

But there are still big questions about where the war goes from here a…]]></summary>

Everyone is still going maskless inside and out. It's been this way all summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 24-hour walkout by railway staff in Britain on Saturday was set to create severe disruption as strikes resumed following the mourning period for Queen Elizabeth II.
Members of four trade unions kicked off the action after workers halted work stoppages following the death of the queen on September 8.
It is the latest industrial action by rail workers demanding wage increases to keep pace with decades-high inflation amid a cost-of-living crisis.
Tens of thousands of staff in various industries — from the postal and legal systems to ports and telecommunications — have also gone on strike across Britain since the summer.
Workers at Britain's largest container port, Felixstowe in eastern England, are currently conducting a second eight-day walkout over pay and conditions that is only set to end on Wednesday.
But it is the rail sector that has been spearheading the industrial unrest, carrying out its biggest stoppages in decades.
The latest had been planned for the week after the queen's death, but was then postponed. Many rail workers are also set to strike again on Wednesday, and on other potential dates later in the month.
This weekend's walkout coincides with preparations for Sunday's London Marathon, leaving participants struggling to reach the capital, as well as the ruling Conservatives' annual conference in Birmingham also starting Sunday.
Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, apologized to people impacted but blamed the government.
"The government has brought this dispute on," he told the BBC, as he joined other striking staff on picket lines across the country.
"They (put) the challenges down to us, to cut our jobs, to cut our pensions and to cut our wages against inflation."
But Tim Shoveller of Network Rail, which owns and manages Britain's railway infrastructure, described the strikes as a "huge own goal" leading to "less money to spend improving the railway".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Abdiqani Hassani
BOSASO, Somalia (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland have extended President Muse Bihi Abdi's current term of office by two years ahead of its expiry in November, the senate chairman said on Saturday.
The region's electoral body said last month it had postponed a presidential election due in November to 2023 because of time and financial constraints, among other reasons.
It was unclear whether that poll has now been scrapped.
Saleeban Mahmoud Aden, Somalialand's senate chairman, said 72 members of parliament voted on Saturday to extend Abdi's term by a "two-year period." One MP objected.
In August, deadly protests by opposition supporters broke out in the region with demonstrators demanding elections be held in November amid suspicions the president wanted to delay the poll and extend his term.
There was no immediate reaction from the opposition to the parliament's extension of the president's term.
Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 but has not gained widespread international recognition for its independence. The region has been mostly peaceful while Somalia has grappled with three decades of civil war.

Kelsey Plum added 17 points and Jewell Loyd 11 as the Chinese were overpowered by a formidable team that stretched their unbeaten streak in the competition to 30 games.
The US went to half-time with a 43-33 lead and there was no stopping them in front of 15,895 fans at Sydney SuperDome -- the biggest-ever crowd for a women's basketball match in Australia.
In front of the watching Chinese basketball legend Yao Ming, the odds were heavily stacked against China, who were led by Li Yueru with 19 points and took home their first medal since 1994.

The European Commission on Thursday took Malta to the European Union's highest court over its "golden passport" scheme that allows wealthy investors to buy Maltese – and therefore EU – citizenship, without having to live in the country. 
Despite repeated calls to end the scheme, Malta has raised €1.1 billion since 2013 through offering passports in exchange for investments, with most investors coming from the Gulf, Asia and Russia. 
Under pressure from the EU, Cyprus and Bulgaria have recently stopped offering similar schemes. Yet the only conces…]]></summary>

Putin staged a grand ceremony in the Kremlin on Friday to celebrate the annexation, hours after shelling killed 30 people in Ukraine's southern region of Zaporizhzhia.
"I want to say this to the Kyiv regime and its masters in the West: People living in Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens forever," Putin said.
Washington announced "severe" new sanctions against Russian officials and the defence industry, and said G7 allies support imposing "costs" on any nation that backs the annexation.

The proposed sale of the MySky yacht, which was disclosed in an advertisement emailed from the brokerage firm to undisclosed recipients on Sept. 14, comes amid concerns from Western governments and campaigners that billionaires like Kesaev have been able to work around a patchwork of international sanctions targeting their luxury assets such as yachts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons if Russia's "territorial integrity" or existence is threatened.


		Should such an escalation materialize, it would probably be in the form of a smaller tactical nuclear weapon, likely launched on a short-range Iskander ballistic missile, according to experts.


Where are the bombs?


		A 2017 report by the institute maps out 47 nuclear storage sites across Russia -- 12 national-level facilities and 35 base facilities.


		They can even be watched closely by commercial satellites, as shown by the widespread, regularly updated imagery of activities at North Korean nuclear facilities.


		But its non-strategic or tactical nuclear weapons, which number as many as 2,000, are stored and not installed on delivery vehicles like the Iskander, according to Podvig.


How would we know?


		"The weapons need to come out of storage, the units involved need to be alerted, and the Russians might also alert their strategic nuclear forces," Cancian, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told AFP.


		"All of this would be visible," he noted.


		"We can be quite certain that there are no hidden facilities," he said.


		"Technically you could probably smuggle a couple of bombs out of a storage sight undetected," he said.


		"The Russians will never be certain that it is undetected. That would be a gamble," said Podvig.


		"It would be the kind of escalatory step (and) Russia would want that to be visible," Podvig said.

Warning the world

		The United States warned for weeks before the February 24 invasion that Russia intended to attack Ukraine, seeking to prepare Kyiv and allies -- and possibly deter Moscow from acting.


		Such alarm could go global if people expected an escalation to transcontinental nuclear war.


		But Washington would likely see issuing public warnings as useful in adding to pressure on Russia, according to Podvig.


		"That message might have deterrence value."]]></summary>

I also have no information on what will be said. 
My friend thinks it will be an acceptance of Ukraine's application to quickly join NATO. 
I doubt it. 
But if it happens a joint statement from the heads of NATO and the UN on a Friday evening is unprecedented. And if it is support of Ukraine's fast track application to join NATO, war tensions are going to escalate.

I am about to give a presentation to a business group on the current geopolitical situation in the world, and what I see trending in 2023. I will not be in front of a computer until later this evening. 
If this joint statement does come out later today, I will (of course) post and analyze it. If this is all a false alarm. I will be relieved, and will sleep easier tonight.]]></summary>

KYIV (Reuters) -President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced a surprise bid for fast-track membership of the NATO military alliance on Friday and ruled out talks with President Vladimir Putin, striking back at Moscow after it said it had annexed four Ukrainian regions. 
Zelenskiy signed the NATO application papers in an online video clearly intended as a forceful rebuttal to the Kremlin after Putin held a ceremony in Moscow to proclaim the four partially occupied regions as annexed Russian land. 
"We are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to NATO," Zelenskiy said in the video on the Telegram app.
