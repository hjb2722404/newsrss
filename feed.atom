“The Committee is made up entirely of Democrats then two Republicans who really don’t like the former president.

“It was, in my mind, a foregone conclusion there would be a criminal referral on something.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reason.com: The Army Thinks Printers Cost Over $1 Million 
Poor accounting practices mean the Department of Defense can't even tell how much money or equipment it has lost. 
The Army failed to properly account for tens of millions of dollars' worth of equipment, according to the Department of Defense's (DOD) internal watchdog. 
A report released last week by the DOD Office of the Inspector General detailed the results of a recent audit of military bases in Kuwait. Specifically, the audit intended "to determine whether the Army effectively accounted for Government-furnished property (GFP)." 
The audit focused on two bases, Camp Arifjan and Camp Buehring. In 2010, a contractor (not named in the report) was awarded a $75 million contract to provide operations and security support to both bases, including "food and housing, payroll support, fire protection, security protection, law enforcement, and transportation." The contract was extended multiple times, totaling more than $5 billion over more than a decade.

Insider: Germany's second-largest city is preparing to ration hot water as the Russia energy crisis escalates 
* Hamburg's environment senator said the city could set limits on when people can use hot water. 
* Jens Kerstan told Welt am Sonntag that this could happened in the case of an "acute gas shortage." 
* Germany is scrambling to plug the gap in energy supplies after cutting its dependence on Russian gas. 
Hamburg, the largest non-capital city in the European Union, has warned that it could ration be forced to hot water as the Russian energy crisis causes chaos. 
Jens Kerstan, environment senator for Germany's second biggest city, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on Saturday that Hamburg could restrict availability of hot water to certain times of days "in an acute gas shortage." 
"We are in a much worse crisis than most people realize," Kerstan said in a separate interview with the Hamburger Abendblatt on Sunday. 
He urged people to take shorter showers, avoid full baths, and install modern thermostats and water-saving shower heads.

   Washington Examiner: White House Report Card: Zogby says Biden ‘in real trouble’ 
This week’s White House Report Card finds President Joe Biden ending another horror week, whipped repeatedly by the Supreme Court and approval polls and facing a growing fall election disaster if he doesn’t pull up soon. 
Democratic pollster and grader John Zogby, who likes the president, gave another subpar grade to Biden and warned of rocky shores ahead. 
“The president is in real trouble,” Zogby said in grading a “D.” And he added that approval polls of Biden and his handling of the economy are “showing real dangers for him among Democratic bastions as well as independents.”

WNU Editor: Zogby is not the only pollster giving a heads-up on what is the public support for President Biden (see below): 

"President Biden has blamed major oil companies and Russian President Putin for higher fuel prices. Critics say Biden’s energy policies are mainly to blame. Who bears most responsibility for higher fuel prices?"
26% Big Oil
15% Putin
51% Biden
8% Not Surehttps://t.co/24DWMNhds2

Since then, the city's firefighters have been bringing water to Sloviansk's dwindling and beleaguered population, in an already dangerous environment.

The Sloviank authorities make sure the firefighters know what's needed and where. Queues gather every day, but impatience is growing after a month in this situation. "Tell the mayor we need two trucks for each building," said one resident. "It's not enough; I have to come so far every day to get water."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]  Twenty-five years since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, The Hong Kong Jockey Club has remained committed to giving back to society and promoting community development. Not only does the Club support charities, but it also organises a wide range of fun activities for children and the young at heart, the latest of which is the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour.   Inspired by the ancient Chinese mythical animal ‘Dragon Horse’, Drago Cavallo is a contemporary expression of Chinese culture and a symbol of inspiration, which will lead a trail of positivity around Hong Kong. The adorable creature is designed by renowned artist Simon Ma.    On July 3, Club Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, Simon Ma, Po Leung Kuk Chairman Dr Daniel Chan, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Chairman Philip Ma and the talented students whose artwork adorns the special anniversary Drago Cavallo sculptures, took part in the opening ceremony of the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour in Tai Kwun.     The exhibition showcases 43 exhibits from the Drago Cavallo collection until July 10. Visitors can also experience the AR scavenger hunt and other immersive digital experiences on the spot. The roving exhibition will then be held in the East Coast Park Precinct, Sha Tin Town Hall Plaza, the Hong Kong Museum of Art and other surprising locations until November.     “Drago Cavallo is a wonderful initiative for our younger generation, providing them with a platform to express themselves and showcase their creativity. I would like to thank Simon Ma for initiating this meaningful programme and all partners for their collaboration. Creativity is key to innovation, and innovation is vital to maintaining Hong Kong’s competitive edge. This is why continuous development is one of the Club’s core values,” said Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges.   “This art showcase is just one of many programmes the Club is proud to support through its ‘With You. Now. Always.’…]]></summary>

VOA/Reuters: Minister: Sri Lanka Struggling to Pay for Fuel Shipments  
Colombo — Sri Lanka is struggling to raise $587 million to pay for about half a dozen fuel shipments, a top minister said Sunday as the cash-strapped country tries to cope with its worst financial crisis in decades. 
The country of 22 million people is unable to pay for essential imports of food items, fertilizer, medicines and fuel — due to a severe dollar crunch. 
Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said new fuel shipments were being lined up, but the country is struggling to raise enough funds to pay as the central bank can supply only about $125 million. 
Sri Lanka only has 12,774 tons of diesel and 4,061 tons of petrol left in its government reserves, he told reporters in Colombo, the commercial center of the island nation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good look at USS Green Bay's flight deck. Via Seaforces.org 
Daily Mail: Disturbing new footage shows moment US Osprey helicopter crashed into USS Green Bay in 2017, killing three young Marines after suffering fatal technical issue 
* Footage released this weekend showed the horrific August 2017 Osprey smash that killed three Marines 
* It was completing a day of practice missions in Australia when it struck the deck of the USS Green Bay and plunged 30 feet into the Pacific 
* The chopper's co-pilot, 1st Lt. Benjamin Cross, died in the subsequent crash, as did Pfc Ruben Velasco, 19, and Cpl Nathaniel Ordway, 26 
* Another 23 Marines who were on board the chopper at the time of the smash were rescued 
* A subsequent investigation cleared Cross and his unnamed co-pilot of any wrongdoing, and said technical issues had caused the crash 
* Last month, five decorated Marines were killed in an Osprey crash in California, with some branding the accident-plagued choppers flying death-traps 
Newly-unearthed footage shows the moment a MV-22 Osprey helicopter crashed over the side of a US warship in 2017, killing three Marines who were on board. 
The clip, first posted online Saturday, shows the sophisticated helicopter - which can fly like a plane and hover like a chopper -  trying to land on the deck of the US Green Bay of the coast of Queensland, Australia, on August 5, 2017. 
But the chopper - which has been plagued by fatal accidents that have killed 51 service personnel since its first flight in 1989 - suddenly drops unexpectedly.

(Bloomberg) -- Global oil prices could reach a “stratospheric” $380 a barrel if US and European penalties prompt Russia to inflict retaliatory crude-output cuts, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts warned. 
The Group of Seven nations are hammering out a complicated mechanism to cap the price fetched by Russian oil in a bid to tighten the screws on Vladimir Putin’s war machine in Ukraine. 
But given Moscow’s robust fiscal position, the nation can afford to slash daily crude production by 5 million barrels without excessively damaging the economy, JPMorgan analysts including Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note to clients. 
 For much of the rest of the world, however, the results could be disastrous. 
A 3 million-barrel cut to daily supplies would push benchmark London crude prices to $190, while the worst-case scenario of 5 million could mean “stratospheric” $380 crude, the analysts wrote.

Fortune: ‘From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU’: Lavrov says a new Iron Curtain is coming down between Russia and the West 
Back to the Cold War it is, then.  A new Iron Curtain is descending between Russia and the West, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday. 
“From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU,” Lavrov said at a press conference after talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Vladimir Makei. 
“We will do everything necessary not to depend on them in critically important industries.”  Lavrov was concurring with comments made by Makei, regarding the appearance of a new Iron Curtain that was “being erected by Westerners themselves.” In echoing the Belarusian diplomat, Lavrov warned Western countries to “behave carefully.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Belarus claims to have shot down Ukrainian missiles  
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has accused Ukraine of firing missiles at military facilities on his country’s territory. 
He said the missiles were intercepted by Belarusian air defense systems earlier this week. 
Without providing any evidence of the alleged attack, Lukashenko – a close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin – called the act a “provocation”. 
“Thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Lukashenko said in comments that appeared on his presidential website on Saturday and were also published by state-run news agency Belta. 
He added that there were no soldiers from Belarus currently fighting in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Lukashenko’s claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LVIV, Ukraine – Some information is so dark and absurd that it seems to have been conceived in the distorted imagination of bored satirists.  Like the headline from Belarus a few weeks ago, reporting that 10th graders were learning to aim rifles – using shovels.
“What do you think of that?”  asks comedian Vadym Dziunko.
Dziunko is on stage with two other actors and a well-known singer.  All are seated and holding microphones, valiantly trying to find humor in a place and time where the tragic outweighs the funny by a dramatic margin.
It’s a recent Saturday night at Cult Comedy Hall, a comedy club in downtown Lviv, near Ukraine’s relatively peaceful western border.  About 100 people spent about $13 each to eat, drink and listen to comics telling whatever came to mind, which is often the lat…]]></summary>

But the biggest problem still seems to be making enough cars.
General Motors said Friday its second-quarter U.S. new-vehicle shipments were down 15% from a year earlier, while Toyota Motor reported a 23% drop in U.S. sales.  The obstacle continues to be the inability to obtain enough computer chips to complete the vehicles.
For now, at least, consumers are still eager to buy.  Manufacturers are selling virtually every car or truck they make and have seen no signs of inventory building up at dealerships, even as new vehicle prices hit record highs.


“It tells me that vehicles are always on the move, and that’s probably the number 1 thing I look at,” Paul Jacobson, Gener…]]></summary>

As of Saturday evening, nearly 650 flights in the United States had been canceled and more than 5,200 flights within, to or from the country had been delayed, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.
While the number of problem flights was higher than on a typical travel day, travel demand was also higher. According to the Transportation Security Administration, the number of travelers over the July 4 holiday weekend had reached pre-pandemic levels.  Demand for travel over the same holiday weekend last year had recovered significantly from pandemic lows, but was still below this year’s levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“In low-wage sectors, this is going to become one of those issues where people leave low-paying jobs for slightly better-paying jobs,” said Bianca Agustin, director of corporate accountability for United for Respect, a non-profit labor rights group.  .  “Given the proliferation of companies that have public commitments, I imagine there will be some movement on this.”
Walmart, Darden Restaurants, McDonald’s, Home Depot, Hilton, Dollar General and FedEx, which together employ millions of people across the country, did not say whether they would cover travel for abortions outside of the country. State.  A spokeswoman for Walmart, which has 1.7 million employees in the United States, said the company regularly reviews its benefits based on employee demand, and that the company is “now reviewing the evolution federal and state landscape” when considering its offerings.  The rest of the companies listed did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“We are working thoughtfully and diligently to find the best path forward, guided by our desire to support our associates, all of our associates,” Doug McMillon, Walmart chief executive, wrote in a memo to staff Friday.
Amazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer after Walmart, said it would cover out-of-state abortion travel for its employees, most of whom are hourly workers.  But that perk applies to employees of its healthcare plan, not the contractors who make up a substantial part of its workforce, like its vast network of delivery drivers.
As the list of companies covering abortion-related travel grows, some workers wonder why their employers won’t do the same.  Isabela Burrows, 19, who works at a PetSmart in Howell, Michigan, learned that Roe v.  Wade had been knocked down by a client last week and was frustrated that her company had said nothing.  Michigan has an abortion ban that has been blocked in court and which Democratic leaders have said they will not enforce.

Mr Lloyd said Australia is “fully engaged” and recognises the impact of the Ukraine conflict on Europe and Africa.

					Suriname might be the smallest and least populated country in South America, but it is also one of the greenest. Considered a global leader in biodiversity conservation, with more than 90 per cent of its land surface covered by native forests, the nation’s unrivaled natural resources more than make up for its size.

I have to believe that mine is not an uncommon situation.  What other ways can I prove to a future landlord that I can pay the rent?
A: Landlords have enormous discretion when choosing tenants, as long as they don’t discriminate.  In a competitive rental market like this, tenants with non-traditional assets — including retirees, recent graduates, students, and the self-employed — are at a disadvantage simply because the vetting process is more competitive.
The open days are full and bidding wars are rampant.  Some would-be tenants are even bribing brokers and land…]]></summary>

Tesla sells more electric cars than any other company and until recently was growing rapidly in China, Europe and the United States as rising gas prices increased battery appeal.  The company continues to weather supply chain turmoil better than competitors like General Motors and Toyotaboth of which reported a sharp drop in sales on Friday.
Demand for cars, especially electric cars, is plentiful, but shortages of semiconductors and other key components are forcing buyers to wait several months for deliveries.

Military says one UAV downed by F16 fighter jet, the other two by missiles launched from ship; terror group has warned it will attack site; Lebanon claims field is disputed  The Israel Defenses Forces said Saturday it successfully intercepted three drones flown by the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group that were heading for the Karish gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast.  Tensions have risen over the site in recent weeks, after a gas production vessel arrived in Israel to launch extraction operations in the offshore field, drawing condemnation from Lebanon, which had laid claim to parts of it. Israel says Karish is in part of its UN-recognized exclusive economic zone.

He was scratching a frozen wall of earth.  Suddenly a big chunk came out.  With him was the body of a baby woolly mammoth, frozen and preserved with its hair and skin.
“I thought it was a baby buffalo at first,” said Mudry, 31, from Alberta.  “And then I came out, and I was inspecting it, and there was a trunk, so I had no words.”


The mammoth was dark and shiny, Mr. Mudry said, with short legs and deep, pronounced eye sockets.  It had a lean, wrinkled trunk and a stub of tail.  He quickly waved to a colleague and called his boss, Brian McCaughan, the co-founder of a family-owned gold mining business called T…]]></summary>

Astronomers hope the James Webb Space Telescope will reveal whether any of these planets harbor atmospheres that could support life.
Identifying an atmosphere in another solar system would be quite remarkable.  But there’s even a chance, albeit a tiny one, that one of these atmospheres offers what’s called a biosignature: a signal from life itself.
“I think we can find planets that we think are interesting – you know, good possibilities for life,” said Megan Mansfield, an astronomer at the University of Arizona.  “But we won’t necessarily be able to identify life immediately.”

The meeting in the Portuguese capital -- attended by government officials, experts and advocates from 140 countries -- is not a negotiating forum.
But it sets the agenda for final international negotiations in August on a treaty to protect the high seas -- those international waters beyond national jurisdiction.

The quakes, including two of magnitude 6.0, struck west of the major port city of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan province, the US Geological Survey said.
The first rattled an area north of the town of Dezhgan shortly after 2:00 am (2130 GMT), before a 5.7 tremor hit two hours later followed quickly by the second 6.0 magnitude quake, said the USGS.
Hormozgan governor Mehdi Dousti said five people were killed, as cited by the official news agency IRNA.
Dousti said most of the damage occurred in the village of Sayeh Khosh, close to the epicenter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon reached a record level during the first half of 2022, the INPE national space agency said Friday.
The world's largest tropical rainforest lost 3,750 square kilometers (1,450 square miles) of jungle since the beginning of the year, the worst numbers for that period since record-keeping began in 2016.
The previous worst figure of 3,605 square kilometers was set last year.
The new figure does not even include the final six days of June.
This year has seen the worst June in 15 years for forest fires.
Monthly records were also beaten in January and February, when deforestation is usually lower, and in April.
INPE satellites identified more than 2,500 fires in the Amazon last month, the largest number since more than 3,500 were recorded in June 2007, and an 11 percent increase over June 2021.
More than 7,500 fires have been recorded since the start of the year, another 17 percent increase on 2021 and the worst numbers since 2010.
"The dry season has barely begun in the Amazon and already we're beating environmental destruction records," said Cristiane Mazzetti, from Greenpeace Brazil.
Environmentalists and opposition figures accuse the government of President Jair Bolsonaro of implementing policies that encourage big businesses to damage the environment.
"The impact of this negligence will be the increasing loss of the resilience of these surroundings, not to mention the damage done to local communities and health," said Mariana Napolitano, of the Brazilian World Wildlife Fund.
Bolsonaro has encouraged mining and farming activity in protected areas.
Critics also accuse him of supporting impunity for gold prospectors, farmers and logging traffickers involved in illegal deforestation.
Last year, the main government environmental protection body spent only 41 percent of its surveillance budget, according to the Climate Observatory NGO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Tropical storm Bonnie made landfall near the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border on Friday evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Heavy rainfall is expected across Nicaragua and Costa Rica
through Saturday, along with life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, the center added.
The storm is likely to weaken as it crosses land, only to re-intensify over the eastern Pacific on Saturday night and Sunday, the center added.
The storm packed maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts before it made landfall, the NHC said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuesday's breathtaking testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson before the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol is a turning point in how Donald Trump is viewed by Republicans, a former GOP governor explained on CNN.
Wolf Blitzer interviewed former two-term Ohio Gov. John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Kasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.
"Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?" Blitzer asked.
 "Oh yeah. he's taking on water," Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.
"And he's shrinking," he continued. "You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting."
"And I feel that he's melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, 'You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.' The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman's testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath," he said. "If they don't agree with her story, with what she's been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath."
"The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It's hard for me to believe in our country we would've had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much. I never felt he was fit for the office and it's all proven out to be true, unfortunately," he said.

The movement is anti-government in nature, and its followers believe they’re immune from the laws of their government. They also have a proclivity for violence, as demonstrated by a number of high-profile incidents, including an armed standoff in Massachusetts in July 2021.
As a behavioural scientist and researcher of this movement, I have been monitoring Romana Didulo, a conspiracy influencer based in British Columbia, who has proclaimed herself “Queen of Canada,” “commander-in-chief,” “Head of State and Government” and “president and national Indigenous chief of the Kingdom of Canada.” 
Recently, Didulo has promoted herself to “Queen of the World.”

Located at the confluence of Hellenistic and Indian cultures, Mes Aynak -- believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old -- was once a vast city organised around the extraction and trade of copper.
Archaeologists have uncovered Buddhist monasteries, stupas, fortresses, administrative buildings and dwellings, while hundreds of statues, frescoes, ceramics, coins and manuscripts have also been unearthed.
Despite looting at the beginning of the century, Mes Aynak is "one of the most beautiful archaeological sites" in the world, says Bastien Varoutsikos, an archaeologist for the French company Iconem,…]]></summary>

Beneath a sparkling chandelier in a mirrored salon, and with a dozen or so close friends and family in attendance, the couple exchanged touching words recalling their years together and love for each other.
"You are a wonderful person," said Aline, looking into Laure's eyes.
"I still want to spend the rest of my life with you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States, as supporters denounced the British government.
Assange, who turns 51 on Sunday, has been held in a high-security prison since 2019.
On Friday his wife Stella was among dozens of people who demonstrated outside Britain's interior ministry to demand his release.
Home Secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition last month, but court officials confirmed to AFP an application to appeal had been received on Friday.
"We're not at the end of the road here," Stella Assange, who married the Australian publisher earlier this year, told reporters when Patel announced her decision.
"We're going to fight this. We're going to use every appeal avenue." 
Assange is wanted to face trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010, related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could face decades in jail if found guilty, but supporters portray him as a martyr to press freedom after he was taken into UK custody following a years-long stay in Ecuador's embassy.
"He's been in prison for telling the truth," supporter Gloria Wildman, 79, told AFP at Friday's protest.
"If Julian Assange is not free, neither are we, none of us is free," she said.]]></summary>

Ukraine prizes borscht , a nourishing soup with beetroot as its base, as a national dish even though it is also widely enjoyed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland.
The Ukrainian culture of borscht  cooking "was today inscribed on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding," by a UNESCO committee, it said.
The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the "negative impact on this tradition" caused by the war, the agency said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trial of US basketball star Brittney Griner, detained in Russia since February, opened on Friday as tensions rage over Moscow's offensive in Ukraine.
"The trial has started," Polina Vdovtsova, the spokeswoman for the court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow, told reporters.
Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist and WNBA champion, faces up to 10 years in prison on charges of drug smuggling. 
The trial was partially closed, with a limited media presence, which Vdovtsova said was "on the request of the defence, the request of Griner herself".
The six-foot-nine star was brought into court in handcuffs. She wore a white T-shirt with US music icon Jimi Hendrix on it.
The 31-year-old came to Russia in February to play there during the US off-season, and was detained at a Moscow airport …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Chinese leader Xi Jinping left Hong Kong Friday after a rare visit to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the city's handover from Britain, reactions to his speech ranged from deeming it "reassuring" to terming his stance "delusional".
The Chinese Communist Party places great importance on anniversaries, and the trip presented Xi with an opportunity to emphasize China's authority over Hong Kong after three years of political upheaval there.
"Xi's speech and language reiterated the political message to Hong Kong since the national security law," political scientist Kenneth Chan from Hong Kong Baptist University told AFP.
"Beijing now exercises total control over the city through the loyalists."

Bachman, who wrote the original "American Woman" with his band The Guess Who, was in Tokyo for the emotional handover on Friday -- 46 years after his cherished orange Gretsch was snatched from a Toronto hotel.
"Wow," a stunned Bachman said, holding the guitar lovingly and tuning it up on stage before playing in a special concert at the Canadian Embassy.
The 78-year-old told AFP he had been "pretty much devastated" by the theft.
"With that guitar, I wrote many million-selling songs... it was like my magical guitar. And then when it's suddenly gone, the magic i…]]></summary>
