        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US State Department announced a new unit Tuesday to research, document and publicize alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine.
The Conflict Observatory will "capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine," the department said.
The Observatory will collect publicly and commercially available information, including what is seen on social media and commercial satellite imagery, for use in current and future civil and criminal legal processes.
Nearly three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv says it has identified thousands of suspected war crimes cases.
Most notorious have been the allegations of wanton murder of scores of civilians in Bucha, just outside Kyiv.
The Observatory will create an online platform "to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses," the department said.
The Observatory will be a joint effort by the department; Esri, a mapping software company; Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab; the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai, which combines artificial intelligence-based analysis with satellite imagery and other data.]]></summary>

Anti-war.com: The Leaders of France, Germany, and Italy Favor Negotiations to End Ukraine War  
The US, Britain, and other NATO countries don't hold the same view 
In recent weeks, the leaders of the three largest EU countries by population — France, Germany, and Italy — have all come out in favor of negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow as a way to end the fighting in Ukraine.
Unlike President Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi have all spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. 
The three European leaders have all signed off on sending weapons to the Ukrainians but have also been calling for a ceasefire. After speaking with Putin by phone on Friday, Scholz wrote on Twitter: “There must be a ceasefire in Ukraine as quickly as possible.”

WNU Editor: I do not see peace talks happening any time soon. 
Ukraine and most NATO countries have made it very clear that they are only focused on a military solution to the war. A war that will only end with the complete defeat of Russia and maybe regime change in Moscow. 
The Kremlin's conditions to end the war also remain the same, conditions that Kyiv has said more than once are completely unacceptable.
 Update: Western allies diverge over Ukraine war aims (Politico).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US investigators believe someone on board deliberately crashed a China Eastern flight in March, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, in what was China's deadliest air disaster in decades.
China Eastern flight MU5375 was travelling from Kunming to Guangzhou on March 21 when it inexplicably plunged from an altitude of 29,000 feet into a mountainside, killing all 132 people on board.
So-called black box flight data recorders recovered from the site were sent to the United States for analysis.
That data shows that someone -- possibly a pilot or someone who had forced their way into the cockpit -- input orders to send the Boeing 737-800 into a nosedive, according to Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the probe.
"The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cock…]]></summary>

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the two countries to abandon their military neutrality for NATO.
 Finland and Sweden are seeking membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a historic shift for two traditionally non-aligned countries and a major expansion of the Western alliance as war continues in Europe.
Leaders from Sweden and Finland said Tuesday they will officially turn in their NATO applications together on Wednesday. They will then head to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden, as the US makes a show of support for their bids.

DW: German state election leaves Chancellor Scholz reeling 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz is digesting a major defeat after his Social Democrats were comfortably beaten into second place in North Rhine-Westphalia. He now needs a favor from the surging Green Party. 
Sunday night's election victory in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) must have tasted extra sweet for the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU). As in the federal election, the vote in Germany's most-populous state was long described as a neck-and-neck race between the CDU and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), only for a previously unheralded candidate to score a clear victory.

WNU Editor: I have been told that the high cost of living is what was/is on the minds of many Germans. And justifiably so. The Russian - Ukraine war is impacting Germany's energy supplies/prices, and in turn the economy. But while this was a major election loss for the SPD in one of their long held strongholds, it will not impact current German policy towards the war .... Scholz’s party keeps Ukraine policy despite state vote loss (AP).

“The story of a city that would not fall despite being destroyed.”
 Ukrainian soldiers at a steel plant in Mariupol have surrendered. It’s the symbolic seal on Russia’s control, after weeks of a punishing assault against the strategic port city — but it is a victory that comes at a stunning cost.
On Monday, more than 260 Ukrainian fighters, including 53 seriously wounded soldiers, were evacuated from Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, Ukrainian officials said. They had been holed up there for weeks, the city’s last line of defense against Russian bombardment.

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN)The Iran-backed political and militant group Hezbollah has lost its parliamentary coalition majority in a Lebanese election that delivered significant gains to its rivals as well as to a protest movement that swept the country in a 2019 uprising, final results showed Tuesday. 
Reformist political groups that sprung out of the nationwide demonstrations have won around 10% of the country's parliamentary seats, according to a CNN tally, in a sign of growing discontent with a ruling elite widely blamed for the country's economic collapse. Reformist parties won only one seat in the previous election cycle in 2018.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed guests at the Cannes Film Festival via video link on Tuesday as the annual event got under way.
Speaking during the opening ceremony, Zelensky drew a comparison to Charlie Chaplin's film "The Great Dictator" as he called on world cinema not to "remain silent" in the face of Russia's attack on Ukraine.
"Hundreds of people are dying every day," he said. "They will not get up after the final applause."
Afterwards, actress Julianne Moore officially opened the film festival, and the first film "Coupez!" (Final Cut) was screened.
The film by Michel Hazanavicius is a comedy set in a disused factory where the filming of a low-budget zombie film gets a little out of hand.
US Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, 60, also received a honorary Palme d'Or at the opening ceremony. Whitaker will present his film "For the Sake of Peace" in the French resort. It is about people who are working for peace in South Sudan.
The walls of shops and streets in Cannes are lined with film posters and a large "Top Gun" installation has been set up in front of the Grand Hôtel.
A giant pilot helmet points to one of the most anticipated screenings at the festival.
On Wednesday, Tom Cruise is scheduled to present "Top Gun: Maverick" - the sequel to the cult film from 1986.
The official poster for the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, which was designed as a homage to The Truman Show, is seen on the facade of the Palais des Festivals. The festival will take place from 17 to 28 May 2022. Frederick Injimbert/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa]]></summary>

Trump’s decision to withdraw the quasi- all of the 700 ground troops stationed there, according to four officials familiar with the matter.
In addition, Mr. Biden has approved a request from the Pentagon for permanent authorization to target a dozen suspected leaders of Al Shabab, the Somali terror group affiliated with al-Qaeda, three of the officials said.  Since Mr. Biden took office, airstrikes have largely been limited to those intended to defend partner forces facing an immediate threat.
Together, Mr. Biden’s decisions, described by the officials on condition of anonymity, will reinvigorate an open-ended U.S…]]></summary>

For months, the health worker, Bhanwar Bai Jadoun, had advised the woman to give birth in the hospital.  But the woman’s mother-in-law insisted on giving birth at home with the help of a local midwife.
Now complications had set in.  Mrs. Jadoun suggested taking the woman urgently to a hospital 10 miles from the village, Bagdoli;  she would notify the doctors there.  An auto rickshaw was arranged.  Both mother and baby were saved.
“When people see me every day, they know they can trust me,” Ms Jadoun said.  “They see me as their guide to healthy living.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power, air conditioning and railway service: such are the amenities of a sophisticated tunnel the length of five football fields, used to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the United States, said officials who made the shock discovery.
Federal authorities in California discovered the underground passageway last Friday as part of an investigation that led to the arrest and charging of six people, according to a Department of Justice criminal complaint.
Stretching from Tijuana, Mexico to a warehouse in Otay Mesa, south of San Diego, it is thought to be 1,744 feet (530 meters) long, 61 feet deep and four feet in diameter, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California said in a statement Monday.
Underground, officials found "reinforced walls, a rail system, electricity and a ventilation system."
Six people were charged with conspiring to distribute 1,762 pounds (800 kilograms) of cocaine, and officials also seized 164 pounds of methamphetamine and 3.5 pounds of heroin.
US Department of Homeland Security agents conducting surveillance on a suburban San Diego home tracked suspects to a stash location some 300 feet from the border. While inspecting the building, the agents discovered the tunnel access point, dug right out of the cement floor.
"There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel," US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a the statement. 
"We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities."
Cross-border tunnels are frequently used by traffickers who smuggle migrants lured by the "American dream," or drugs, into the United States, the world's largest consumer of South American cocaine. 
According to US figures, more than 90 tunnels have been discovered in southern California alone since 1993, including another "sophisticated" underground passageway located in March 2020.]]></summary>

 DW: Mexico's number of 'disappeared' people rises above 100,000 
There are now over 100,000 people in Mexico's national register of the "disappeared." The UN says organized crime is among the leading causes of missing people in the country. 
Mexico's official figure of missing people on Monday surpassed 100,000 for the first time as families pushed authorities to do more to find victims of violence linked to organized crime. 
The interior ministry compiles a national register of the "desaparecidos" — Spanish for missing people —  which is periodically updated. 
In the last two years the numbers have spiked from about 73,000 people to more than 100,000 — mostly men.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Moscow now considers the United States and its European allies "hostile states" as Western governments continue to pour heavy weaponry into Ukraine, which is attempting to beat back Russia's deadly invasion.

The first successful test of a prototype AGM-183A ARRW comes as the program’s future is increasingly uncertain. 
The Air Force says that it has finally successfully test-launched a prototype of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW. This follows three failed launch attempts last year and comes as the service is reassessing the future of the program. 
The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force announced the successful AGM-183A test flight late on May 16, 2022. The test itself had taken place on May 14. As had been the plan from the beginning, a B-52H Stratofortress from the 419th Flight Test Squadron launched the missile over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California.

The landslide victory of Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the country’s longtime dictator, has exposed one of liberal democracy’s greatest vulnerabilities.
 Last week, voters in the Philippines went to the polls — and, by an overwhelming margin, chose the son of the country’s deposed dictator as their next president.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr., widely referred to by his nickname, Bongbong, ran on a ticket with Vice President-elect Sara Duterte — the daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, a populist most famous for his policy of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers, who pushed the Philippines toward au…]]></summary>

Without amending the Constitution of Canada, Charles will automatically succeed Queen Elizabeth II as head of state of Canada, like all British monarchs since the founding of the country.  Poll after poll shows the 96-year-old Queen who has battled some recent health issues is widely respected by Canadians.
However, for several years an ever-decreasing number of Canadians, according to polls, have wanted to swear allegiance to another British monarch, in particular Charles, who is hated by many here and who represents an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Secret Service documents obtained by The Daily Dot show that agents charged with protecting former President Donald Trump feared that he would have a milkshake hurled at him during a 2019 trip to the United Kingdom.
Ahead of the trip, anti-fascists activists in the U.K. started a campaign called "Splash the Fash" that targeted far-right political figures such as Trump ally Nigel Farage with milkshakes.
To protect the then-president from the threat of getting pelted by a delicious summer treat, the Secret Service monitored social media accounts that fantasized about dousing him with milkshakes.
"We’ll have to keep an eye on SplashThe[Fash],” one Secret Service official wrote in a message obtained by The Daily Dot. “I’m sure it will get a lot of attention. I’ll pass it along to the person monitoring the trips.”

The official added that they would "not waste a milkshake" by using it to attack Trump.
At other points, the agents acknowledged that it would be very hard for them to contain all potential milkshakes that could potentially be lobbed at the president.
“At some point on this trip, one of the 4 of us is getting 'Milkshaked,'" one person in the Presidential Protective Division wrote in another message obtained by The Daily Dot.

The United States and Europe have coordinated closely to enact sweeping sanctions against Russia in the nearly three months since its president, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered an invasion.  But they have been less aligned with the need to help sustain Ukraine’s economy and help rebuild it once the war is over.

In an interview with Bobb, Real America's Voice host Ed Henry explained that host David Brody had asked Oz why he had refused to call the election "rigged" or "stolen."
"I want to be careful," Oz replied.
Henry seemed shocked by the answer.
"As you know, Oz was a very controversial endorsement by your boss, Donald Trump," the anchor told Bobb. "And now you add to it, when asked by David Brody -- again, not in a gotcha way -- do you think the last election was stolen? He basically wouldn't answer."

Spring has come to Bucha in the six weeks since Russian soldiers withdrew from this dormitory community outside kyiv, leaving behind mass graves of massacred citizens, many maimed, and streets shattered and destroyed buildings.
A semblance of normal life has returned to the city.  Residents have returned to Bucha in recent weeks, and the city has moved to repair the physical damage caused by russian invasion troops and their weapons.  Now, in the verdant spring streets of the city, it’s hard to imagine the horrors that unfolded here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were midway through their set when Islamist militants sprayed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris with gunfire, cutting down revelers, frontman Jesse Hughes recounted before a French court on Tuesday. 
Guitar technician Eden Galindo's first thought had been that the sound system was exploding, but Hughes said he knew instantly the venue was under attack.
"Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gun shots," Hughes told the trial of Salah Abdeslam, the only suspected surviving member of the squad that killed 130 people at several locations on November 13, 2015.
"I knew that death was coming," he said.
The assailants burst through the music hall's main entrance and blasted automatic gunfire into the crowd as the band played.
"We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming," Galindo told the court. "After a while they reloaded and a technician told us, 'next time they stop, we run'."
The band escaped through a side door but their tour manager was killed.
The attackers took hostages inside the music hall during an hours-long assault that claimed 90 lives and ended after police shot dead one militant and the two others detonated their suicide vests.
Survivors have recounted playing dead for hours, or hiding in cupboards, not knowing if their friends or relatives were still alive. They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.
Abdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.

He told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.
Six years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.
"Evil did not win," he said. "You can't kill rock and roll."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - His doctors probably don't agree but Pope Francis thinks a shot of tequila just might help his painful knee.
While his popemobile stopped in St. Peter's Square at his last general audience, a group of Mexican seminarians shouted out to him, asking how his leg was doing.
"It's being naughty," the Argentine pope replied in Spanish. A flare up of pain in his knee and existing leg problems have forced the pope to use a wheelchair at times recently.
One of seminarians then thanked the seated pope for continuing to carry out his duties despite the pain, telling the 85-year-old Francis that his persistence was an example for them as future priests.
Noting that they were Mexican because of the flag they were carrying, the pope said: "Do you know what I need for my leg? A bit of tequila."
After much laughter, one of them shouted back: "If one day we go to Santa Marta, we'll bring you a bottle," referring to the guest house where Francis lives in the Vatican.
One of the seminarians, Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, posted the exchange, which took place at the general audience last Wednesday, on TikTok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported that Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine is still running strong in Russia, with a Kremlin spokesperson telling the Russian people that invasion of Ukraine will "make life better" for them.
This is in spite of the fact that the ensuing embargo by western nations has caused the Russian economy to implode, with a leaked internal Kremlin forecast projecting the economy to shrink by 12 percent just this year alone.
""We are in fact now living in the conditions of a perfect storm and the moment of truth, that very storm and moment of truth that will ensure and protect our interests, and make it so that your lives are better, more comfortable, more stable, and more secure," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to Daily Beast reporter Allison Quinn. 
Peskov also claimed that "our president knows where he is leading our country" and that 'the whole country supports him.'"

Quinn skeptically notes that "the war that the Kremlin has depicted as a heroic crusade against nonexistent neo-Nazi leaders in Ukraine has led to hundreds of foreign companies cutting ties with Russia, killed as many as 27,000 Russian troops, and, according to Ukrainian intelligence, left Putin’s military in shambles."
Meanwhile, experts believe Russia's military has taken such heavy losses that their war aims may have to be scaled back again. Even Russian military analysts appear to be more pessimistic in their reports on state TV.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's extremely rare for a Russian military expert to criticize the performance of the country's armed forces. 
But according to Mikhail Khodaryonok, a defense analyst, his country's war in Ukraine isn't going according to President Vladimir Putin's plan -- and likely is failing.
The BBC's Francis Scarr, who regularly monitors Russian state TV, posted a subtitled video clip on Twitter in which Khodaryonok offered his bleak assessment of the war effort in Ukraine.
"First of all, we shouldn't take information tranquilizers," he said, "because sometimes information is spread about some morale and psychological breakdown in the Ukrainian armed forces, which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis of morale and so on. All of that, to put it mildly, is false."

Khodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, "despite the resistance of a single senator." Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.
"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future," Khodaryonok said. "and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse."
Watch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.

In an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation. It's fairly long but worth your time so I've added subtitles.pic.twitter.com/0mr7WAgSx6

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters shows that keeping global warming below the key 1.5°C threshold by the end of the century will require not just halting the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure, but also shutting down many existing sites.
"Some existing fossil fuel licenses and production will need to be revoked and phased out early."
Led by Kelly Trout of Oil Change International, the study estimates that 40% of fossil fuel reserves at currently operational development sites across the globe must be left in the ground if the world is to have a 50-50 chance of adequately slashing carbon emissions and limiting warming to 1.5°C or below.
If fossil fuel reserves at existing sites are extracted, the researchers find, nations will "substantia…]]></summary>

(Reuters) -Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies have lost their majority in Lebanon's parliament in a general election, a Reuters tally of final results showed on Tuesday, a major blow to the heavily armed group that reflects anger with Lebanon's ruling elite.
The Shi'ite Muslim movement and factions that support its possession of arms won around 62 of parliament's 128 seats in Sunday's election, a reversal of the 2018 result when they secured a majority of 71.
In the first election since Lebanon's economic collapse and the Beirut port explosion of 2020, reform-minded political newcomers won about a dozen seats, making an unexpectedly strong breakthrough into a system long dominated by the same groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sandstorm engulfed Saudi Arabia's capital and other regions of the desert kingdom Tuesday, hampering visibility and slowing road traffic.
A thick grey haze made iconic Riyadh buildings such as Kingdom Centre nearly impossible to see from more than a few hundred metres (yards) away, though there were no announced flight delays or cancellations.
The kingdom's meteorology centre forecast "surface dusty winds" in the country's east and in Riyadh, "reducing horizontal sight", according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
Dusty conditions were also expected farther west in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to the forecast.
Electronic signs along Riyadh's highways warned drivers to reduce their speed because of the lower visibility.
In central Riyadh, sand layered cars and buildings, and residents struggled to keep it out of their homes.
"Working outside is very difficult because of the dirt," a Pakistani construction worker who gave his name as Kalimullah told AFP as he installed tiles.
"I try to wash my face from time to time," the 30-year-old added, wrapping a piece of cloth around his face to block the sand.
Saudi office worker Abdullah Al-Otaibi said he was grateful he works indoors.

"Dust storms are part of our culture and we are used to it, but some of them are severe," said Al-Otaibi, 39, rubbing his eyes as he hurried into his office building.
Parts of Saudi Arabia typically see sandstorms between March and May, with varying intensity. The frequency of the storms has increased in recent months in the region.
Neighboring Iraq has experienced eight sandstorms since mid-April, a phenomenon fueled by soil degradation, intense droughts and low rainfall linked to climate change.
In Iran on Tuesday, government offices and schools and universities were closed in many provinces due to "unhealthy weather" and sandstorms, state media reported.

RFE: China Takes Aim At NATO

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Ankara to convince it to approve their NATO bid. 
In a news conference, Erdogan said Turkey would not approve their bids to join NATO, calling Sweden a "hatchery" for terrorist organisations, and adding they had terrorists in their parliament. 
Ankara says Sweden and Finland harbor people it says are linked to groups it deems terrorists, namely the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt.

Reuters: Ukrainian force begins evacuating from last Mariupol stronghold  
KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) -The force holed up in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol began evacuating on Monday, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after months of bombardment. 
Five buses carrying troops from the Azovstal steelworks arrived in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk late on Monday, some 32 kilometres (20 miles) to the east, a Reuters witness said. 
Some of the evacuated troops were wounded and carried out of the buses on stretchers. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said 53 were taken to a hospital. 
It was not immediately clear how many troops were aboard the buses. Malyar said 211 other troops were taken to another site. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant.

Update #3: Injured troops to be evacuated from Azovstal – Moscow (RT)   
WNU Editor: There was no military point to stay in the steel plant. These Ukrainian soldiers have been surrounded for weeks, and their supplies had run out. The only question that remains unanswered is .... are there any Ukrainian soldiers left in this steel plant.]]></summary>

The war in Ukraine is severely curtailing the European Union's economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic with this year's growth forecast sharply revised down, the European Commission warned on Monday. 
It lowered its economic growth forecast for the eurozone in 2022 by 1.3 points to 2.7% and increased its inflation forecast by 3.5 points to 6.1%.   Inflation for the whole of the EU is meanwhile expected to reach 6.8% this year.

					The UN migration agency, IOM, is running migrant centres across six provinces in Turkey as part of its refugee response, which provide migrants, refugees, and host community members, with education, social services, law, vocational guidance, and community support. One of those who has benefited from the centres is Leyla Al Darazi, originally from Lebanon, who although born male, has identified as female since a young age. To coincide with the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, marked on 17 May, Leyla told her story to Begum Basaran, a communications assistant with IOM Turkey.

OilPrice.com: The NOPEC Bill Could Send Oil Prices To $300 
* For decades, different forms of ‘NOPEC’ legislation designed to pave the way for lawsuits against OPEC have been considered by Congress. 
* Last week, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved the NOPEC bill, leading to pushback from both within and outside the U.S. 
* OPEC’s most influential energy ministers warned that the bill could send oil prices soaring by 200 or even 300 percent. 
If the U.S. passes the NOPEC bill, a bill designed to pave the way for lawsuits against OPEC members for market manipulation, the oil market could face even more chaos. OPEC’s most influential energy ministers warned against passing the legislation, suggesting it could send oil prices soaring by 200% or 300%.   “The last thing we want is someone trying to hinder that system,” the UAE’s Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said at a conference in Abu Dhabi, referring to the system OPEC has had in place for decades to ensure supply to the market is adequate (adequate according to OPEC’s view).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: Russia is earning $20 billion per month in oil sales as higher crude prices lift export revenue 50%, says IEA 
* Russia's oil export revenue has soared 50% this year, the International Energy Agency said. 
* The Kremlin is earning close to $20 billion per month in 2022. 
* Asia has boosted Russian crude purchases as global powers condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russian oil export revenue is up 50% since the start of 2022 with the Kremlin generating close to $20 billion per month in sales, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Export volume has rebounded to levels seen before Russia invaded Ukraine, which triggered a wave of international sanctions and a spike in crude prices that's helped oil revenue. 
In April, Russian oil exports climbed by 620,000 barrels per day from the prior month to 8.1 million, back to their January and February average, the IEA said. Increased demand from India and China offset declines from the US and Europe.

Daily Mail: Sri Lanka is down to its last day of petrol and faces 'severe' shortage of medicine, new PM warns amid economic crisis that plunged country into turmoil sparking deadly riots 
* The nation has suspended repayment of $7 billion in foreign loans due this year 
* Sri Lanka's total foreign debt is $51 billion, about half of which is due in 2026 
* People face major shortages of petrol and essential medicine among other items 
* 'We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices,' PM Wickremesinghe said 
* The country has seen widespread protests in recent weeks amid the crisis 
* Nine people were killed and 300 injured in clashes with government supporters last week   Sri Lanka's new prime minister today declared the crisis-hit nation was down to its last day of petrol, as the country's power minister told citizens not to join the lengthy fuel queues that have galvanised weeks of anti-government protests. 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, appointed prime minister on Thursday, said in an address to the nation the country urgently needed $75 million in foreign exchange to pay for essential imports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remarkable new retail project is about to join the Downtown Brooklyn development boom.  The building at 555 Fulton St. by Steven Witkoff and Apollo – shown here for the first time – will occupy the wraparound corner where Fulton Street, DeKalb Avenue and Bond Street converge.
Designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, it will provide one lucky tenant with highly visible space with 7,902 square feet on the ground floor and an additional 6,459 square feet on the lower level.  The first pickaxe should take place soon.
GoodSpace brokers Chris DeCrosta and Hank O’Donnell said the image isn’t quite final.  “Because this is a customizable building, we’ll market to see if a tenant wants a say in the final design,” DeCrosta said.
They target sports brands such as Nike or Adidas, “which could make sales of $40 million to $50 million a year,” DeCrosta said.  O’Donnell added: “It’s a place to do crazy business.”  Brokers refused to quote an asking rent.
The area is seeing a meteoric rise in commercial and residential development, including City Point, a new Ace Hotel and giant apartment towers from Extell, JDS and others.

Reuters: IMF Lifts Weighting of Dollar, Chinese Yuan in SDR Basket 
BEIJING (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Saturday it has increased the weighting of the dollar and Chinese yuan in its review of the currencies that make up the valuation of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR), an international reserve asset. 
The review is the first since the yuan, also known as the renminbi, joined the basket of currencies in 2016 in what was a milestone in Beijing's efforts to internationalise its currency. 
The IMF raised the U.S. currency's weighting to 43.38% from 41.73% and the yuan to 12.28% from 10.92%. The euro's weighting declined to 29.31% from 30.93%, the yen's fell to 7.59% from 8.33% and the British pound fell to 7.44% from 8.09%. 
The IMF said in a statement its executive board had determined the weighting based on trade and financial market developments from 2017 to 2021.

Recommendations for Yoon-Biden Summit – Must Build on the Strong Alliance Foundation
19fortyfive.com · by David Maxwell · May 16, 2022
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol began his five-year term on May 10 with a midnight security briefing from the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff. This meeting, which precedes a May 21 summit between Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden, reflects Yoon’s view that North Korea is the South’s “main enemy.”
Yoon’s presidency comes at a tumultuous time in U.S. foreign policy. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine continues, and it enjoys Chinese support. Strategic competition is expanding with Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has conducted 16 missile tests in 2022 so far. Raising the possibility of internal instability in North Korea is the COVID-19 outbreak that Kim has finally admitted to, after more than two years of claiming zero cases in the country.
In this context, the South Korea-U.S. alliance remains as important as ever. The upcoming summit provides an opportunity not only to reaffirm the alliance at the start of the Yoon administration, but also to build on the ROK-U.S. vision laid out in the May 2021 summit.

There may be no easy answers.  Platforms like Facebook, Twitch and Twitter have made progress in recent years, experts said, in removing violent content and videos faster.  Following the shooting in New Zealand, social platforms and countries around the world joined an initiative called Christchurch Call to Action and agreed to work closely together to counter terrorism and violent extremism content.  One tool that social sites have used is a shared database of hashes, or digital fingerprints of images, which can flag inappropriate content and remove it quickly.

The central problem is that the coronavirus has become more adept at reinfecting people.  Already, people infected with the first variant of Omicron are reporting second infections with newer versions of the variant – BA.2 or BA2.12.1 in the United States, or BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa.
These people could have a third or fourth infection even within this year, researchers said in interviews.  And a small fraction may have symptoms that persist for months or years, a condition known as Long Covid.

Reuters: EU ministers urge Hungary to sign up to planned Russian oil embargo 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU foreign ministers sought to publicly pressure Hungary on Monday to lift its veto of a proposed oil embargo on Russia, with Lithuania saying the bloc was being "held hostage by one member state".
The ban on crude imports proposed by the European Commission in early May would be its harshest sanction yet in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and includes carve-outs for EU states most dependent on Russian oil.  Germany, the European Union's biggest economy and a major buyer of Russian energy, said it wanted a deal to authorize the oil embargo, which it suggested could last for years.

Lunar watchers across the United States can experience a celestial wonder as Earth’s shadow covers the moon during prime time on the night of May 15.  Those on the East Coast can watch our natural satellite begin to turn an eerie copper-red color around 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time during one of the longest lunar eclipses in recent memory.
“For most of North America, this is a tremendous viewing opportunity,” said Madhulika Guhathakurta, an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

* Rush to wean off Russian gas has made European consumers highly vulnerable to LNG price shocks. 
* Global LNG demand outstrips supply in 2022. 
* New LNG projects are unlikely to provide relief until 2024. 
A liquified natural gas (LNG) crisis is brewing for European countries dealing with energy insecurity in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as demand will outstrip supply by the end of this year, Rystad Energy research shows. Although soaring demand has spurred the greatest rush of new LNG projects worldwide in more than a decade, construction timelines mean material relief is unlikely only after 2024. Global LNG demand is expected to hit 436 million tonnes in 2022, outpacing the available supply of just 410 million tonnes. A perfect winter storm may be forming for Europe as the continent seeks to limit Russian gas flows. The supply imbalance and high prices will set the scene for the most bullish environment for LNG projects in more than a decade, although supply from these projects will only arrive and provide relief from after 2024

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Susan Pollack, a property manager who shopped one afternoon last week at a Costco in Marina del Rey, Calif., said she was surprised the price of a bulk pack of toilet paper had gone up from $17 to $25.
At his local kosher butcher, prices rose even more: over $200 for a 5-pack of ribs.
“I told my husband, ‘We’ll never have short ribs again,'” she said.
Global forces such as supply chain disruptions, severe weather, energy costs and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine contributed to rising inflation rates that spooked equity investors and put President Biden’s administration on the defensive.

“Pleasure in work puts perfection in work,” Mr. Ridge first said, quoting the Greek philosopher.
Then he took a recent note from BlackRock.  “Companies that have forged strong bonds with their employees have seen lower turnover levels and higher returns throughout the pandemic,” Mr. Ridge read aloud.
He punctuated it with his own comment: “Well, duh!”
WD-40, which comes in a bright blue and yellow canister familiar to many homes with squeaky doors, is a cleaning product with a secret formula that can loosen a rusty bolt, scrub the crayon on the wall, remove insect splatters from a car and removing rust from a bicycle chain.

A member of the Seri people, also known as the Comcáac, she was the only woman to work in the traditional guard of the indigenous group, which had protected Seri territory for many decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An NBA playoff Game 7 is supposed to be the most exciting and intense type of game, where the high stakes bring out the best in both teams.
It doesn’t always work out that way, but it’s rare for a team to fall apart as completely as the Phoenix Suns did on Sunday night.
At halftime, Suns fans were slumped in their seats, Phoenix players wore blank stares as they sat on the bench and the Mavericks’ Luka Doncic couldn’t help but laugh.
The Phoenix disaster was well underway.
The top-seeded Suns lost to the No. 4-seeded Dallas Mavericks, 123-90, in Game 7 of the teams’ Western Conference Semifinals series on Sunday in Phoenix.  Dallas, which led by 46 points in the second half and never trailed on Sunday, will face Golden State on Wednesday at San Francisco in Game 1 of the Conference Finals.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Djokovic, like his career-long benchmarks Nadal and Roger Federer, underscored his passion with longstanding excellence and constantly ignoring clues that his peak years might be behind him.
For Djokovic, it has been an unparalleled season and challenge: his decision not to be vaccinated against the coronavirus led to a standoff with Australian authorities that ended in his expulsion on the eve of the Open. Australia this year, and that kept him out.  the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, California, and Miami Gardens, Florida in March.
But with health protocols now relaxed in Europe, Djokovic returned to regular action on clay last month.  Although he struggled in his first matches with his timing and stamina, he slowly but convincingly started to achieve his goals again, and he gathered momentum just in time for Roland Garros.
“I always try to use those kinds of situations and adversity in my favor to motivate me for the next challenge,” he said of Australia.  “As much as I felt pressure in my life and my career, it was something really on a whole other level. But I feel that’s already behind me. I feel good on the court. Mentally also, I am cool.I am lively.
Against Tsitsipas, the hirsute Greek star who pushed Djokovic to five sets before losing the French Open final last year, Djokovic controlled most of the baseline exchanges with as much patience as panache.  When Tsitsipas failed to serve the second set, Djokovic proved the most reliable force in the tiebreaker, perfectly content, it seemed, waiting for Tsitsipas to crack.
“To a certain extent it’s a relief because after everything that happened at the start of the year, it was important for me to win a big title,” Djokovic said.

Hunter Greene, a rookie right-hander, had struck out nine through seven innings without allowing a hit.  His counterpart, Pirates veteran left-hander José Quintana, nearly matched him, allowing just three hits and one walk in seven innings before handing the game to the Pittsburgh bullpen.


Although Greene’s pitch count exceeded 100, Reds manager David Bell allowed him to start the bottom of the eighth inning in pursuit of a no-hitter in Pittsburgh.  Greene caused a groundout, but then gave Rodolfo Castro and Michael Perez walks.  After seven and a third innings, five walks and 118 pitches, Greene was finally retired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only unknown was playoff experience and the ability to win on the biggest stage.  They certainly have that now to go with a generous dose of confidence.
Gallant had faith in Panarin, saying after the game he felt the Russian striker, even though he hadn’t come out on top earlier in the game, would pull through.  And he did, with just nine seconds left on the power play.  Panarin took the puck from Adam Fox at the top of the right face-off circle, skated a few steps toward goal, then shot right-footed, beating Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry on the short side through a screen and sparking a wild celebration on the ice and in the stands.
“Honestly, they let me shoot since the first game,” Panarin said through an interpreter.  “My bad, I didn’t really do those shots. But maybe I should listen to everyone’s advice now and go out and take some shots.
The tying goal came with 5:45 left in the third period after a play that angered Penguins coach Mike Sullivan.  Pittsburgh’s Marcus Pettersson lost his helmet behind the Penguins goal after becoming tangled with Rangers forward Alexis Lafrenière.  According to the rule, Pettersson either had to find his helmet and put it back on or leave the ice for safety reasons.  Pettersson walked to the bench.
Kris Letang, Pittsburgh’s top defenseman, took Petterson’s place, but he skated to the net, past Jarry, and was unable to challenge Zibanejad’s shot.  And if Pettersson had been on the ice, he might have helped the Penguins clear the puck.  Sullivan, unsurprisingly, is not a fan of the rule.
“I think it stinks,” he said.  “He has to go out.  His helmet was intentionally ripped off, but that’s the rule.
For the Penguins, who were in the playoffs for the 16th straight year, the loss was particularly hard to bear because it could be the last season for their longtime core of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Letang playing together.  These last two can be free agents and sign with other teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farming is a high-risk life.  Mr Woiwode was 63 when his jacket was caught in the draft shaft of a hay baler, breaking three ribs, compressing his spine and nearly severing his right arm.  As a teenager, her son, Joseph, was trampled by a horse and spent days in a coma;  when he recovered, his motor skills still fragile, he almost lost his fingers because of a mower. 
One day, setting fire to the weeds blocking a tractor, Mr Woiwode nearly set himself on fire and Joseph, then a toddler strapped to the seat with a cowboy belt.  During a cataclysmic blizzard one winter, it was so cold for so long that Mr Woiwode had to fuel his wood-burning furnace with the dead chickens that had frozen in their coop.
But the place also nurtured Mr. Woiwode’s family and work.
“There is a thump that the virgin ground has here on unshaded ground, so different from cultivated land,” he wrote, “and in the colors of the surrounding painter, in light undimmed by pollution, you can feel like you’re on a soundstage.For a second, you see the entire panorama as being constructed to contain you in its stage.
The Woiwodes practiced the Presbyterian faith to which they had turned when their marriage was difficult, and Mr. Woiwode, who had been raised Roman Catholic, often wrote about his chosen faith, about the land and about the biblical stories that supported and shaped it.  This makes him an anomaly in literary circles, as well as in the liberal arts institutions where he taught for decades.
“Most of life seems to me to be a religious experience,” Mr. Woiwode told the New York Times in 1988.  “I mean, I guess either it does or it doesn’t, and for me it does.”
Larry Alfred Woiwode was born October 30, 1941 in Carrington, ND His father, Everett, was a high school teacher and principal;  his mother, Audrey (Johnston) Woiwode, a housewife, died when Larry was 9 years old.  He grew up in Sykeston, ND, then in Mason County, Illinois.

View co-host Sunny Hostin blamed the national shortage of infant formula on the lack of federally paid maternity leave.
hostin said:

I think the fault lies in the fact that we have terrible maternity leave because a lot of women wish they could stay home and breastfeed their children and take care of their children, and the fact is that we can’t do that’s because we have very limited maternity leave and we have to immediately go back to work to take care of our families and feed our families, and the government is not supporting us in that, and I think that’s where lies the problem.
I worked for the government and right after I had my son, I had to borrow time off from other federal prosecutors so I could stay home a little longer, and I had just had a C-section.  It was absolutely…]]></summary>

* The Senate Minority Leader led a delegation of Republican colleagues to Kyiv 
* They met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reaffirmed support 
* It comes after a bipartisan push to fast track $40 billion in more Ukraine aid was stalled by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, delaying the vote to this week 
* Also last week, bipartisan senators introduced a resolution demanding that the State Department designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism 
* If designated it would join Cuba, Syria, Iran and North Korea on the list 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday demanded that President Joe Biden designate the Russian Federation as an official state sponsor of terrorism over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. 
The label places miscellaneous financial and foreign aid restrictions on a country and allows alleged victims of terrorism that its government is accused of sponsoring to sue for civil damages.

"All the analysts in America, pundits, are picking a landslide at the midterm elections in November," Professor Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

"President Biden knows they're coming for him.

"They're going after him, the kid (Hunter), they're going to go after his performance ... they're going to go after incompetence.

"Biden knows it’s coming – he hired a very expensive fellow; he's going to be called special counsel and his only job is to keep President Biden out of jail.

Yesterday the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu. 
Why? 
The U.S. readout of the call says:      
 On May 13, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu for the first time since February 18. Secretary Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication. 
Austin initiated the call and the U.S. is seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine!!! 
Are we not told that the Ukraine is winning the war? That it will soon push the Russian forces back over the border? The operation to 'weaken Russia', which Austin had publicly announced two weeks ago, does not seem to go that well.

(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is set to offer its gas importers a solution to avoid a breach of sanctions when buying fuel from Russia and still effectively satisfy President Vladimir Putin’s demands over payment in rubles. 
In new guidance on gas payments, the European Commission plans to say that companies should make a clear statement that they consider their obligations fulfilled once they pay in euros or dollars, in line with existing contracts, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The EU’s executive arm told the governments that the guidance does not prevent companies from opening an account at Gazprombank and will allow them to purchase gas in accordance with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the people added.

        <id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-732247599994189300.post-1650636902222306133</id>
        <link href="https://www.newsrust.com/2022/05/book-review-familia-grande-by-camille.html"/>
        <updated>2022-05-15T15:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kouchner adds, “My grandmother killed herself soon after that.”
It’s the second funeral in the book — “a militant, heartbroken crowd who’d come to pay tribute to my grandmother’s freedom to kill herself.”  The suicide leaves Camille’s mother an alcoholic shell.  She drinks herself blind every night: “This is absolutely not up for discussion.  It’s my freedom.”
The book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: “He started stroking me, and then, you know …”
From this point, the narrator’s voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a “hydra” of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.
The book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  “Let’s be clear about this,” she writes:

Article 222—31—1 of the criminal code
Rape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:
1) ascending year;
2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;
3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.

Claire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.  She lives in Paris.

THE FAMILY GRANDE, by Camille Kouchner |  Translated by Adriana Hunter |  214 p.  Other Press.  |  $24.
