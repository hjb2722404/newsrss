        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese Yuan banknotes are seen in this illustration taken February 10, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 
Market Insider: China tells state banks to prepare for a massive dollar dump and yuan buying spree as Beijing's prior interventions have failed to stem its currency's worst year since 1994 
* Reuters reported that China told state-owned banks to get ready to sell dollars and buy yuan in an effort to prop up the local currency. 
* The move could stem the yuan's fall, as it remains on track for its largest annual loss against the dollar since 1994. 
* A hawkish Fed has pushed the dollar to 20-year highs this year, pressuring currencies around the world. 
The People's Bank of China has told major state-run banks to prepare to shed dollar holdings while snapping up offshore yuan, which has continued to fall despite prior interventions, sources told Reuters. 
The scale of this latest effort to prop up the yuan will be big and could provide a floor to the Chinese currency, according to the report. 
The amount of dollars to be sold hasn't been decided yet, but Reuters said it will primarily involve the state banks' currency reserves. Their offshore branches, including those based in Hong Kong, New York and London, were ordered to review offshore yuan holdings and check to see that dollar reserves are ready.

Update: Exclusive: China's state banks told to stock up for yuan intervention (Reuters).   
WNU Editor: IMHO there are three reasons why China will start to dump the US dollar. (1) The first is to prop up the yuan. (2) The second is to not possess US dollar reserves. China saw how the U.S. seized Russia's foreign currency holdings, and Beijing does not want to be positioned to have the same thing happen to them. (3) The third reason is that many in China believe the U.S. economy is on the road to a slow collapse, and what better way to bail-out is when the US dollar is as high as high as it is right now .... Is the US economy about to tank? (Gregory K. Tanaka, China Daily).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: OPEC+ has begun talks on output cut at Oct. 5 meeting - OPEC source 
DUBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Leading OPEC+ members have begun discussions about an oil output cut at the group's next meeting on Oct. 5, three sources told Reuters. 
 One OPEC source told Reuters a cut was "likely", while two other OPEC+ sources said key members had spoken about the topic. 
A source familiar with Russian thinking told Reuters earlier this week that Moscow could suggest a cut of up to 1 million barrels per day (bpd).  The latest comments suggest that key OPEC members have started communicating over the matter, although the volume of any potential cut is still unclear. 
Next week's meeting takes place against a backdrop of falling oil prices from multi-year highs hit in March, and severe market volatility.

WNU Editor: My gut tells me that there will be a push at this OPEC+ meeting to cut production that will deliberately and significantly raise oil and gas prices to impact the US midterm elections, while bleeding the US strategic oil reserves at the same time.

Reuters: EXCLUSIVE Afghan Taliban sign deal for Russian oil products, gas and wheat 
KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban have signed a provisional deal with Russia to supply gasoline, diesel, gas and wheat to Afghanistan, Acting Afghan Commerce and Industry Minister Haji Nooruddin Azizi told Reuters. 
Azizi said his ministry was working to diversify its trading partners and that Russia had offered the Taliban administration a discount to average global commodity prices. 
The move, the first known major international economic deal struck by the Taliban since they returned to power more than a year ago, could help to ease the Islamist movement's isolation that has effectively cut it off from the global banking system.

Russia will on Friday begin formally annexing up to 18% of Ukrainian territory, with President Vladimir Putin expected to host a ceremony in the Kremlin to declare four occupied Ukrainian territories part of Russia. 
The ceremony would take place on Friday at 15:00 local time (08:00 ET) in the Kremlin’s St. George’s Hall, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
Putin will deliver a speech and meet with Russian-backed leaders of the four occupied regions on the sidelines of the ceremony, he added.

Giving a presentation in Toronto tomorrow. It is a rush thing, and I am preparing for it right now. Flying out tonight, and returning Saturday evening. 
I gave a presentation last week to a business group on what to expect geopolitically in the spring of 2023 and beyond. Apparently I freaked-out a lot of people who were there on what I see is trending, especially on the war, and after the Nord Stream pipeline attacks this week they now want me to present it to a larger audience tomorrow.
Needless to say blogging will be light until then, but I have time posted a number of interesting stories for Friday and Saturday that I know will be of interest to the followers of this blog.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: ‘The worst is yet to come’: Russians rush to the borders amid draft fears  
Dariali, Georgia CNN  — With one bag in each hand and another on his back, Denis makes his way up a hill on foot, having just crossed the border from Russia into Georgia.  “I’m just tired. That’s the only thing I feel,” the 27-year-old says as he tries to catch his breath. 
Denis has just spent six days on the road, most of them just waiting in line to cross the border. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of Russians enduring a grueling marathon journey to leave their country. 
Though women and children are among those crossing, most are fighting-age men who fear the possibility that they will be drafted to fight the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.

On one side fingers are pointing at the U.S. .... Whodunnit? - Facts Related to The Sabotage Attack On The Nord Stream Pipelines (Moon of Alabama). 
On the other side fingers are pointing at Russia .... Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged, and the best suspect is the nation that sabotaged them before (Daily Kos). 
I personally say it is best to wait before making any judgements. We only know that these pipelines have been attacked/sabotaged. There is still a lot that we do not know.   
Update: Most of my friends and contacts in Europe believe the U.S. was responsible for this attack. 
Opinion in Ukraine is interesting. While the government narrative is that this was a Russian attack, my Ukrainian friends, family members, and contacts are convinced that this was an attack green-lighted by the US and then handled by them or through a third party.]]></summary>

* In 2018, Russia conducted a "major renovation" of a nuclear weapons site there, an expert said. 
The US military appears to be stepping up aerial surveillance of a Russian territory in Europe, potentially signalling concern that the Kremlin could decide to deploy or even use nuclear weapons in Ukraine as Russian leaders have warned.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test and a possible window for carrying it out could be between Oct. 16 and Nov. 7, South Korean lawmakers briefed by its spy agency said on Wednesday. 
Preparations for a possible nuclear test by North Korea, which would be the first since 2017, had been completed at the Punggye-ri test tunnel, where the reclusive state conducted six underground tests from 2006 onward, two legislators told reporters after a briefing by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). 
The timing of the test could be determined by events like the party congress in China, North Korea's main ally, and the midterm elections in the United States, its chief rival, they said. 
Also it would depend on whether Pyongyang can bring an outbreak of COVID-19 under control, they said.

CNN: Navy proposes stringent blood testing for elite SEALs training program to address drug use  
Washington CNN  — Senior Navy officials are concerned about the use of performance enhancing drugs by Navy SEAL trainees and have asked the Pentagon to approve blood testing to detect potentially illegal or banned substances used by the elite forces. 
The request for more stringent blood testing comes after performance enhancing drug (PED) paraphernalia were found in the car of a SEAL trainee who died hours after completing the infamous “Hell Week” training program in February. 
In an interview with CNN, Regina Mullen, the mother of the dead trainee said that according to a toxicology report her son, 24-year-old Seaman Kyle Mullen, did not have PEDs in his system, but that he had told her that other trainees were using them. 
“There was more doing it than not let’s just say,” Regina Mullen told CNN.

* North Korea believed to have fired a ballistic missile towards Sea of Japan 
* It comes days before a planned visit by the US Vice President Kamala Harris 
* Projectile is believed to have already fallen, according to Japan's coast guards 
* North Korea has tested a record number of ballistic weapons since 2022 began 
North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile towards the Sea of Japan just days before US military drills and a visit by Vice President Kamala Harris to the region amid regional tensions, South Korea and Japan's leadership have said. 
South Korea's military have claimed North Korea fired a single, short-range ballistic missile fired from near the Taechon area of North Pyongyan Province just before 7am. 
Since the beginning of 2022, North Korea has dialed up its testing activities to a record pace - testing more than 30 ballistic weapons, including its first intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017 - as it continues to expand its military capabilities amid a prolonged stalemate in nuclear diplomacy.

The embassy warned that Russian-U.S. dual nationals could be conscripted by the Kremlin for military service. 
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow is urging American citizens residing in Russia to leave immediately amid Vladimir Putin’s escalation of the war in Ukraine. 
“U.S. citizens should not travel to Russia and those residing or traveling in Russia should depart Russia immediately while limited commercial travel options remain,” the embassy said in a security alert issued Tuesday. 
The alert comes just a week after Putin announced an escalation of Russia’s war in Ukraine on Sept. 21, when he partially mobilized the country’s reservists and hinted at resorting to nuclear warfare. 
Thousands of Russians have fled the country in recent days following Putin’s announcement.

Warzone/The Drive: Flying Saucer Appears On U.S. Aviation Intelligence Office Logo (Updated)  
An official flying saucer-adorned aviation intelligence unit logo has appeared drawing significant interest and speculation online.  
A new official logo for a U.S. Intelligence Community office focused on aerial threats and related security issues, particularly in the skies over the United States, is turning heads for its inclusion of a depiction of a flying saucer. This comes at a time of reinvigorated interest within the U.S. government, as well as the public at large, in unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, which are currently now referred to officially as unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP. Over the past year or so, the U.S. military, in particular, has been increasingly sparring with members of Congress about how best to respond to the potentially very real threats that UAP present.

CNBC: The U.S. and Europe are running out of weapons to send to Ukraine 
* NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg held a special meeting of the alliance’s arms directors to discuss ways to refill member nations’ weapons stockpiles. 
* But ramping up defense production is no quick or easy feat. 
* The U.S. has been by far the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, providing $15.2 billion in weapons packages to date since Moscow invaded its neighbor in late February. 
In the U.S. weapons industry, the normal production level for artillery rounds for the 155 millimeter howitzer — a long-range heavy artillery weapon currently used on the battlefields of Ukraine — is about 30,000 rounds per year in peacetime. 
The Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces go through that amount in roughly two weeks. 
That’s according to Dave Des Roches, an associate professor and senior military fellow at the U.S. National Defense University. And he’s worried. 
“I’m greatly concerned. Unless we have new production, which takes months to ramp up, we’re not going to have the ability to supply the Ukrainians,” Des Roches told CNBC.

Preliminary results have already been released by Russian state media, which report around 90 per cent of votes counted so far are in favour of joining. 

The referendums have been widely dismissed as a “sham”. 

The Governor of one of the regions said the referendums could raise the risk of Moscow using nuclear weapons against Ukrainian forces. 

“We need to be ready. And Russia needs to understand such a step would plunge them into an abyss before they even acted,” Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. 

“Russians have a choice: either come here to the territory of Ukraine and not return alive, come back with bits of your body missing or be imprisoned or rise up against the regime on the ground in Russia.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was mocked for her "word salad" answer to a question from Fox News' Peter Doocy on rising crime in the country.

Reporter Peter Doocy questioned the press secretary on what President Biden thinks of rising crime statistics impacting major cities in the last year.

"Does President Biden think America's big cities are safe?" Mr Doocy asked.

"It is not a yes or no question. It is very much a question of what has he done…to make sure that cities…have the funding and have what they need to protect their community, and that is what the president has done," Ms Jean-Pierre responded.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Jean-Pierre for avoiding the question, and claimed she portrays Biden’s America as a “Mythical Place.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: It is interesting that President Biden threatened in February to “bring an end to” the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine.     
“I promise you we will be able to do it,” Biden responded when a reporter asked how the U.S. could put a stop to the pipeline, which was under German control. 
That is a rather damning video and one that Russian media is going to disseminate widely.   
Update #1: Moon of Alabama makes the case that the US was responsible for this attack, and the real target was Germany .... The War On Germany Just Entered Its Hot Phase (Moon of Alabama).   
Update #2: The CIA is now pushing the narrative that they warned everyone a few weeks ago that such an attack was possible .... CIA warned Berlin about possible attacks on gas pipelines in summer - Spiegel (Reuters). More here .... Germany warned by CIA of possible attack on Nord Stream gas pipeline weeks in advance: report (FOX News).
 Update #3: Poland’s former defense and foreign minister is convinced that the US is responsible for this attack .... US praised for Nord Stream explosion (RT).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC News: Nord Stream: Ukraine accuses Russia of pipeline terror attack 
Ukraine has accused Russia of causing leaks in two major gas pipelines to Europe in what it described as a "terrorist attack". 
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said the damage to Nord Stream 1 and 2 was "an act of aggression" towards the EU. 
He added that Russia wanted to cause pre-winter panic and urged the EU to increase military support for Ukraine.  Seismologists reported underwater blasts before the leaks emerged. 
"There is no doubt that these were explosions," said Bjorn Lund of Sweden's National Seismology Centre, as quoted by local media.

Update: Kyiv says gas leaks on Nord Stream pipelines are result of Moscow ‘terror attack’ -- AFP   
WNU Editor: Russia has nothing to gain by blowing-up its own pipeline. In fact they have a lot to lose by not having any leverage on countries like Germany when it comes to energy supplies. 
As I mentioned in a previous post ....      
.... It was almost two weeks ago that Russian President Putin told the EU that their energy crisis would be solved if they open Nord Stream 2 .... Putin tells Europe: if you want gas then open Nord Stream 2 (Reuters). 
With this interruption of two separate pipelines at the same time, coupled with seismic evidence pointing to two maybe three deliberate explosions, it is clear to me that someone does not want Putin's option on the table.]]></summary>

Politico: ‘Huge problem’: Iranian drones pose new threat to Ukraine  
Recent attacks are prompting renewed calls for the U.S. to send more advanced weaponry. 
It was a little over a week ago that Iranian drones first began appearing in the skies over Ukraine.

The drones evaded the soldiers’ defenses and dropped bombs on their position, destroying two tanks with their crews inside.  “It’s very difficult to see these drones on radars,” said Arekhta, who traveled to Washington, D.C., last week as part of a delegation of female Ukrainian soldiers. “It’s a huge problem.”

Demonstrators call for greater support from west and help communicating with outside world 
The EU and the US are considering further sanctions against Iran over the attempt to suppress demonstrations and strikes in universities over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in a police detention centre. 
Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, condemned Iran’s disproportionate use of force and said all options would be on the table at the next meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers. 
The main options are helping to prevent the internet being shut by Iran, and further economic sanctions. 
Demonstrators at the street protests – now in their 10th day – have also called for greater support from the west, as well as help in communicating with the outside world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: For the first time in 30 years, Asia’s developing economies are set to grow faster than China’s, ADB says 
* The Asian Development Bank now sees growth among emerging Asian economies of 4.3% in 2022 and 4.9% in 2023. 
* The ADB expects the rest of developing Asia excluding China to grow by 5.3% in both 2022 and 2023, while it now expects China to grow by 3.3% in 2022, lower than revised forecasts released in July. 
* This will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the report said. 
Asia’s developing economies may be showing signs of recovery, but the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cut its growth forecasts for them yet again — thanks to China’s prolonged zero-Covid policy. 
But this will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the Manila-based lender said in its latest outlook report released Wednesday. 
“The last time was in 1990, when (China’s) growth slowed to 3.9% while GDP in the rest of the region expanded by 6.9%,” it said. 
The ADB now expects developing Asia — excluding China — to grow by 5.3% in 2022, and China by 3.3% in the same year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fears are growing of a violent crackdown in Iran as the government cracks down on the hijab protests occurring across the country.
"The largest anti-government protests in Iran since 2009 gathered strength on Saturday, spreading to as many as 80 cities, even as the authorities escalated a crackdown that has reportedly killed dozens of people and brought the arrests of prominent activists and journalists, according to rights groups and news media reports," The New York Times reported. "In many cities, including Tehran, the capital, security forces responded by opening fire on the crowds."
State media is reporting 35 fatalities.
"Deep resentments and anger have been building for months, analysts say, particularly among young Iranians, in response to a crackdown ordered by the country’s hard-…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wednesday's announcement of Russia's first public mobilisation since World War Two, to shore up its faltering Ukraine war, has triggered a rush for the border, the arrests of over 1,000 protesters, and unease in the wider population.
	

		It is also attracting criticism from the Kremlin's own official supporters, something almost unheard of in Russia since the invasion began.
	

		"It has been announced that privates can be recruited up to the age of 35. Summonses are going to 40-year-olds," the RT editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, railed on her Telegram channel.
	

		"They're infuriating people, as if on purpose, as if out of spite. As if they'd been sent by Kyiv."

It said this was in line with Washington's hostile stance towards Tehran.
"By reducing the severity of a number of communications sanctions - while maintaining maximum pressure - the U.S. is seeking to advance its goals against Iran," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying.

		The brass lettering on the stone reads "George VI 1895-1952 / Elizabeth 1900-2002" on the top two lines, followed by a garter star and then "Elizabeth II 1926-2022 / Philip 1921-2021" on the bottom two lines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eighty-nine bodies have been recovered since a boat carrying migrants from Lebanon sunk off Syria's coast, Syrian state media said Saturday, as the Lebanese army said it arrested a suspected smuggler behind one of the deadliest recent shipwrecks in the eastern Mediterranean.
Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), called it a "heart-wrenching tragedy".
At least 14 people rescued were recovering in hospitals in Syria while six others were discharged, as search efforts continued, with several people still missing since the boat sank on Thursday.
"There are 89 victims, while 14 people are receiving treatment at Al-Basel Hospital, two of whom are in intensive care," Syria's official news agency SANA reported, quoting Iskandar Ammar, a hospital official.

A dozen teenagers and young adults gather around instructor Alex Flaherty. They don't want to miss any of the traditional hunter's precise gestures as he carves a fish or lights a fire.
"Our culture has changed so much in the last 50 years when people used to live in igloos... the change is happening so fast, (and) we are losing our culture," he tells AFP.
Flaherty blames the societal shifts for a series of social ills such as violent crime, substance abuse and a high rate of suicide.
Hoping to help remedy these problems, he's taken hundreds of teenagers hiking, camping and hunting in the vast t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official death toll has nearly doubled to 35 in a crackdown by Iran's security forces on more than a week of protests that erupted after the death of a young woman in custody.
Angry demonstrators have taken to the streets of major cities across Iran, including the capital Tehran, for eight straight nights since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.
The Kurdish woman was pronounced dead after spending three days in a coma following her arrest by Iran's feared morality police for wearing the hijab headscarf in an "improper" way.
"The number of people who died in recent riots in the country has risen to 35," state media said, raising the official toll from at least 17 dead, including five security personnel.
Protests were held around the Islamic republic on Friday, with online videos show…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Vladimir Putin's threat to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine if Russian "territorial integrity" is threatened has sparked deep discussion in the West as to how it would respond.
"Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction," Putin said, adding: "This is not a bluff."
However analysts aren't convinced the Russian president is willing to be the first to unleash nuclear weapons since the US bombed Japan in 1945.
AFP spoke with several experts and officials about the possible scenarios that could arise should Russia carry out a nuclear attack.
What would a Russian nuclear attack look like?
Analysts say Moscow would likely deploy one or more "tactical" or battlefield nuclear bombs.
These are small weapons, ranging …]]></summary>

		China's foreign ministry, in a statement on the meeting, said the United States was sending "very wrong, dangerous signals" on Taiwan, and the more rampant Taiwan's independence activity, the less likely there would be a peaceful settlement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had downed four Iranian-made "kamikaze" unmanned aerial vehicles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain Tehran was harming Ukrainian sovereignty and its citizens.
	

		Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied.
	

		"Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran," said a statement on the foreign ministry's website.
	

		"In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv."
	

		The message was handed to the acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
	

		Military authorities in southern Ukraine said in a statement they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the port of Odesa.
	

		Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who has fled his home country of Russia this week delivered a scathing portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership in an interview with The Atlantic.
The man in question, a 38-year-old IT manager named Anton Shalaev, escaped from Russia this week to the Armenian capitol of Yerevan, which is one of the few places that will still allow Russians into the country.
When asked specifically about Putin's decision making during the war, Shalaev did not hesitate to slam the man who has led his homeland for more than two decades.
"A few old men and an army of zombies are leading us to hell," he said. "I say that because people around me in Russia behaved as if they had been bitten by a zombie, dragging my entire country into a dreadful war. All I saw was Russian loser husbands beating their wives, while the entire rotting house of the state system has turned my people into an army of the dead."
IN OTHER NEWS: Insiders fear Letitia James is set to inflict 'the biggest political damage' to Trump with GOP voters: report
To put a fine point on it, Shalaev added, "They are my enemies."
Shalaev also had some unkind words for Russian state media operations.
"Russian propaganda is a weapon, and the bastards working there are war criminals," he said. "The greatest guilt in this entire tragedy belongs to a small bunch of old men at the top: KGB officers."
Various media outlets have reported that many Russian men of military age have been trying to escape the country even since Putin called for a mobilization earlier this week to rescue his war in Ukraine.

	The official death toll from popular unrest in Iran shot up to 17 on Thursday as Raisi vowed that Amini’s death would be investigated. She died in a Tehran hospital on September 16 after falling into a coma following her arrest by the “morality police” which enforces the wearing of the veil.


Women are compelled to cover their hair in public in Iran, which as a Shiite theocratic state follows a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The morality police – officially known as the Gasht-e Ershad; or “guidance patrol” – are responsible for enforcing this dress code.
But the law does not precisely define the “correct” way to wear the veil…]]></summary>

The demonstrations followed the strongest warning from the authorities yet when the army told Iranians it would confront "the enemies" behind the unrest - a move that could signal the kind of crackdown that has crushed protests in the past.
Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as "Israel's soldiers", live state television coverage showed. They also shouted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel", common slogans the country's clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

"We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel, and our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald," 4th Estate Books said.
"This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work," it added, providing no other details.
Mantel won the Booker Prize for "Wolf Hall" (2009) and "Bring Up the Bodies" (2012) and had been tipped to win again in 2020 with "The Mirror & The Light," the third in the trilogy.

About 30 of the animals were released into the ocean on Thursday, but some had beached themselves again, said Brendon Clark, incident controller with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.
Under cool drizzle, marine wildlife experts began to wrap up a complex days-long rescue operation that started with a large pod of the animals, which are part of the dolphin family, stranding on the beach mid-week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly seven months of war, and a critical battlefield defeat in northeastern Ukraine earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin explicitly backed the referendums after the Russian-controlled regions lined up to ask for swift votes to join Russia.
	

		The self-styled Donetsk (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republics (LPR), which Putin recognised as independent just before the invasion, and Russian-installed administrations in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will hold votes.
	

		The voting, which the West and Ukraine says is a sham, is due to begin on Friday and will end on Tuesday, with results expected soon afterwards.
	

		Russia will formally annex the areas after the results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pfizer said it agreed to reduce the number of doses it will deliver by year end to 600 million, down from the billion-dose commitment the U.S. government made a year ago.
	

		The United States will have an option to buy up to an additional 400 million shots for the program after this year.
	

		The drugmaker said it would have sufficient supply to deliver the full billion doses under the U.S. commitment, but "we are seeing reduced demand in some low- and lower-middle-income countries due to barriers in administration and vaccine hesitancy."
	

		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.
	

		Pfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.
	

		The vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world's poorer countries.
	

		The program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.
	

		COVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.

Nuclear threat

		The integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.
	

		After the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use "all means" to protect its territory.
	

		Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included "strategic nuclear weapons". He predicted the voting regions "will integrate into Russia".
	

		For most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.
	

		The referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.
	

		Election officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.]]></summary>

The Bermuda Weather Service said the center of Fiona was forecast to pass more than 110 miles (180 kilometers) to the west of the British territory on Friday morning at around 5:00 am (0700 GMT), but with a storm of that strength and size, residents were taking no chances.
"This storm is going to be worse than the last one," Richard Hartley, owner of the Torwood Home store in the capital, Hamilton, told AFP as he and his wife covered the shop's cedar-lined windows with metal sheets.
