        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi has taken aim at the United Nations for enabling the Islamic Republic of Iran to use the organisation to “legitimise itself”.  

Ms Boniadi sat down with Sky News Australia host Laura Jayes to discuss the dangerous regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Ms Boniadi urged the West to enforce sanctions on Iranian officials amid the rampant human rights abuses in the country.  

She said the Islamic Republic is using the United Nations to “normalise” itself to the global public. 

“The problem with the UN is … when UN member states and their representatives don’t stand for democracy, and they play into the Islamic Republic’s propaganda and side with them, then we’re never going to see change,” she told Sky News Australia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[She tried to censure and it came up short. 
Now she's shaming the names who didn't vote in favor. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib," Greene said on Wednesday. "This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC."

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.
"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger," she said. "And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate."
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.
"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib," tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: "motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans."

And CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: "House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution."]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/tommy-tuberville-senate-protest-blockade/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-01T22:12:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US couple has been fined $28,000 by a court in Uganda after pleading guilty to child cruelty and "inhumane treatment" of their 10-year-old foster child. The couple admitted to making the child sleep on a wooden platform and feeding him cold food. They were sentenced to two months in prison, which they have already served, and ordered to pay the victim $26,000 in compensation. The case has sparked criticism from child rights activists in Uganda, who have called it a travesty of justice.]]></summary>

The Fed aims to cool down demand and encourage companies to slow down price increases. Despite the economy's resilience, inflation has gradually decreased from its peak in 2022.

With the Israel-Hamas war escalating, the United States risks becoming involved in a larger conflict that could entangle some of the more than 40,000 U.S. military personnel based across the region.

 
Why it matters: U.S. troops and military contractors in Iraq and Syria have been targeted in over a dozen attacks by Iranian-backed militia groups since Hamas' surprise attack against Israeli civilians and soldiers on Oct. 7.

EruAsian Times: French Rafales ‘Trounce’ Eurofighters As Germany Blocks Sale Of Typhoon Jets To Saudi Arabia – Reports

 
Germany loosened export restrictions against Saudi Arabia earlier this year. Still, it refused to allow the sale of the 4.5th generation Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet to the kingdom, despite the UK government’s intense lobbying.

The United Kingdom is likely to see a loss of 6,000 jobs in the defense sector and no manufacturing of fighter jets for a decade in the face of Germany’s unwillingness to green-light the sale of Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the Royal Saudi Air Force, British newspaper The Sun reported.
Berlin is blocking a multibillion-dollar agreement to sell 48 Typhoons to Saudi Arabia, and ministers have threatened to “close” BAE production lines if the contract is refused. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz clarified in July this year that Germany will not deliver Eurofighter combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al-Monitor: West Bank death toll exceeds 120 as US warns Israel over settler violence 
Over 120 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed amid raids by the Israeli army and settler attacks since Oct. 7. 
As Israel expands its ground incursion in the Gaza Strip, violence in the West Bank is also escalating, with at least 115 Palestinians killed and more than 2,000 injured since the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, according to the United Nations. 
Clashes between Palestinians in the West Bank and the Israel Defense Forces as well as attacks by Jewish settlers are common, but both have intensified in recent weeks. 
The IDF has been conducting an increasing number of raids in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Since then, more than 8,500 Palestinians have been killed in the subsequent Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

The Israel Defense Forces intercepted a missile and two drones over the Red Sea that were fired by Ansar Allah, the Iran-backed group in Yemen more commonly known as the Houthis, earlier today. The attack marked the third by the Houthis that has targeted Israel, and the terror group has threatened more as Israel pushes its ground offensive into Gaza. 
The missiles and two drones were launched from the “Red Sea area” and shot down “outside the territory of the State of Israel,” the IDF said, according to The Times of Israel. The Houthi missile was shot down with the Arrow air defense system, while Israel Air Force fighters downed the two Houthi drones.

Pakistan’s government announced a major crackdown earlier this month 
Pakistan's government plans to deport over 1.4 million Afghan nationals after November 1, and the United Nations is calling for the country to hold off to avoid human rights violations. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a press release that it is "extremely alarmed" by Pakistan’s deportation announcement, as there are currently over two million undocumented Afghans living in the country. 
Of the two million, more than 600,000 are immigrants who left Afghanistan after the Taliban reclaimed power in August 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media users have reacted online after pro-Palestinian activists took over London's Liverpool Street Station to stage a sit-in protest, calling for an end to Israel's attacks on Gaza.
 
Over 500 pro-Palestinian activists organised a sit-in protest, denouncing the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 
The sit-in, orchestrated by the direct action group Sisters Uncut, featured Palestinian music and chants like "ceasefire now".
 
Various activist groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement and International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, joined the demonstration.
 
The protest concluded around 7 p.m. and the station continued its operations, a Network Rail spokeswoman confirmed.
 
British Transport Police responded to reports of the protest and reportedly ensured a safe dispersal of the crowd, allowing passengers access to the station.
 
A similar sit-in involving more than 200 people occurred at London Waterloo station on the preceding Saturday.]]></summary>

With just the sun and a solar panel, a theater can be set up in areas where people struggle to access food and water and make a decent living. But what it truly requires is the courage to not view creativity as a luxury. Sydelle and Rowand, the founders of Sunshine Cinema, a network of mobile movie theaters, are not just entertaining people; they are crossing a bridge.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35193">Read the full story, “Can Creativity Change the World?”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

Creating resilience is crucial to adapting to climate change and ensuring climate justice. 
 Although women account for more than three-quarters of the agricultural labour force and manage 40 percent of small-scale farms, historically, they neither owned nor controlled the land because land rights were passed down to male relatives. It is a historic gender injustice whereby women could only access land through close male relatives.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35192">Read the full story, “Women Correct Historical Injustices, Build Climate Resilience Through Cash Pooling”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

* Houthi rebels said they fired a series of drones towards Israeli city of Eilat 
* Iran today warned the situation in the Middle East could 'get out of control' 
Iran today boasted its powerful proxies 'won't stay silent' and hinted the fighting between Israel and Hamas could engulf the Middle East after the Tehran-backed Huthi rebels fired drones into the Jewish state from Yemen. 
The Huthis, who seized Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and control large swathes of the country, said they fired a series of drones towards the Red Sea city of Eilat this morning in retaliation to Israel's war against Hamas. 
'These drones belong to the state of Yemen. We are fighting with words and drones,' Abdelaziz bin Habtour, prime minister of the Huthi government, said.

Zero Hedge: Bills On Israel, Ukraine 'Dead On Arrival' In Both House And Senate As Shutdown, Funding Battles Gear Up 
As the nation celebrates Halloween, the House and Senate are engaged in some spooky late-stage Republic chaos over aid to Israel and Ukraine amid a backdrop of yet another government shutdown looming in two weeks. 
* The government will run out of money (again) in roughly two weeks, requiring Congress to act (again). 
* According to Democrats and GOP Neocons such as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, America needs to send billions of taxpayer funds to both Israel and Ukraine, and won't consider any legislation that doesn't combine the two. 
* House Republicans under newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), as well as a group of Senate Republicans, want Israel aid separated from Ukraine aid, while the Biden White House wants to jam a $105 billion foreign aid package ($14B to Israel, $60B to Ukraine) through Congress. 
* The House's plan (if they can even pass it) to separate Israel aid from Ukraine aid is DOA in the Senate, while both the Senate's combined package and the Biden admin's package is DOA in the House.

Under the slogan “You’ve come a long way, baby” it was exclusively marketed to women. The advertising campaign exploited the civil rights movements of the 1960s, indicating that those cigarettes were enjoyed by strong, independent, and liberated women.</p><p>A blatant lie – why would “independent” women choose to poison themselves with a commodity which each year causes  more than 480,000 deaths in the US alone – nearly one in five deaths?

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
