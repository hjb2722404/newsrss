The war in Ukraine should galvanize policy makers in Washington.  It demonstrated that the American defense industrial base is not up to the task of supplying the American military with weapons for a protracted conventional conflict with a great power like China.  Production lines for Stinger and Javelin missiles destined for Ukraine are stretched to capacity, with critical components no longer being produced in sufficient quantities to meet demand. 

The industrial skills required for sustained conventional warfare have atrophied.  In 2018, the Trump administration identified nearly 300 significant gaps in 10 “…]]></summary>

I just wanted to thank the heroes of the Greenfield Police Department, as well as the heroes of the local fire department and the heroes of the local ambulance services for their outstanding work in helping me after I was hit by a vehicle and seriously injured the night of Monday, August 15, using a crosswalk to cross Elm Street across from the Franklin County Jail.  Greenfield Police Department officers were professional, courteous and responded to the crime scene within half an hour.  I pray that whoever hit me on the crosswalk will be caught and brought to justice.  I’m sure the Greenfield police are doing their best, and I can’t wait to see the suspect sent to jail for his crime against me.
Thank you to everyone involved, including the staff at Greenfield Hospital as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pictured: A map showing where the Chinese aircraft entered the country's the country's Air Defence Identification Zone and crossed the median line 
 Daily Mail: The world's most dangerous tit-for-tat: China deploys 51 warplanes and six ships around Taiwan in response to America sending nuclear stealth bombers over Pacific and the island democracy agreeing to U.S. trade talks 
* Taiwan said 25 Chinese aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line or flew into Taiwan's air defence zone, in the latest provocation from Beijing 
* Move came after U.S. government said it would hold trade talks with Taiwan 
* Earlier this month, Beijing fired missiles towards Taiwan to intimidate the island 
* This was after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this month became the highest-ranking American official to visit the island in 25 years 
Taiwan's defence ministry said 51 Chinese aircraft and six Chinese ships had been detected operating around Taiwan on Thursday as Beijing continued military activities near the island.
That included 25 aircraft that crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, which in normal times acts as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, or flew into Taiwan's air defence zone.

(CNN)The World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has suggested that racism is behind a lack of international attention being paid to the plight of civilians in Ethiopia's war-shattered Tigray region. 
Calling it the "worst humanitarian crisis in the world", with 6 million people unable to access basic services, Tedros questioned in an emotional appeal why the situation is not getting the same attention as the Ukraine conflict. 
"Maybe the reason is the color of the skin of the people," Tedros, who is from Tigray, told a virtual media briefing on Wednesday. In April this year at a briefing, he questioned whether "black and white lives" in emergencies worldwide are given equal attention.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (R) as they meet in Lviv, Ukraine. 
VOA: Zelenskyy Hosting UN Chief, Turkey’s President in Lviv 
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Thursday for the United Nations to ensure the security of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia facility, controlled by Russian forces and operated by Ukrainian technicians. 
Zelenskyy, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said that “the deliberate terror” by Russia in attacking the power plant “can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world.  "Therefore, the U.N. must ensure the security of this strategic object, its demilitarization and complete liberation from Russian troops," Zelenskyy said after meeting in the western Ukraine city of Lviv with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
For his part, Guterres called for the site to be “demilitarized,” with the withdrawal of military equipment and personnel.

An American military expert has revealed that Ukraine may be forced into an 'ammo diet' after its current sources from allied countries dry up. 
Ukraine may soon be starved of ammunition following a reduction in the amount of ammo provided to it by its European allies.  According to American military expert and analyst Michael Kofman in a recent interview with Der Spiegel of Germany, Ukraine may be strapped for bullets and ammunition relatively soon as allied nations providing the country with ammunition are reaching their weapon supply limits. 
Notably, reports indicate that since Western support has a limit in terms of weapon supplies, it's not in Ukraine's best interest to bide for time as it makes making counteroffensive maneuvers much more difficult.

Update: Ukraine could be put on ‘ammo diet’ – US military expert (RT)   
WNU Editor: It looks like this "ammo diet" is being enforced now. Weapon transfers from Europe have dropped appreciably in the past month. And in regards to U.S. arms transfers, a number of retired US generals and ex-officials are now sounding the alarm .... 19 retired generals and ex-officials urge US to increase arms supplies to Ukraine (The Guardian).   
Update #2: Here is a complete list of US arms that have been transferred to Ukraine .... By the numbers: Keeping track of the single largest arms transfer in US history (Responsible Statecraft).]]></summary>

Space News: China’s spaceplane remains in orbit but clues emerge from recovered launch debris 
HELSINKI — A Chinese reusable experimental spacecraft remains in orbit nearly two weeks after launch, despite passing directly over its expected landing site early Monday. 
The “reusable experiment spacecraft” launched from Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert atop of a Long March 2F rocket Aug. 4 and has remained in 346 by 593 kilometer orbit inclined by 50 degrees since launch, according to tracking by the U.S. Space Force’s 18th Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS). 
Though China has released no details of the mission, there are clear differences from the spacecraft’s apparent first outing in September 2020. The new mission orbit is more eccentric than that of the first, when the spaceplane spent two days in an orbit of 331 by 347 kilometers.

The official notice was signed by the CEO of the Prudential Authority, Fundi Tshazibana.  In the past, some South African banks had severed their ties with Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) – as they are called in the document – ​​due to unclear regulations or a high risk factor. .
However, the advisory stresses that risk assessment does not mean giving up on crypto altogether:

“Risk assessment does not necessarily imply that institutions should seek to avoid risk altogether (also called risk reduction), for example, by termina…]]></summary>

Politicians and litigators are blocking companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain like Bonnie and Clyde.  The shotgun is Federal Judge Dan Aaron Polster, who on Wednesday ordered CVS,
            Walgreens
      and
            walmart
      providing $650 million to two counties in Ohio to address opioid abuse.  Now on to the next raid. 
Judge Polster is overseeing some 3,000 opioid lawsuits brought by municipalities and their attorney friends against drug manufacturers, distributors and retailers.  His explicit goal is to push companies to write a big check to do “something meaningful to alleviate the crisis”, as he said during a hearing in 2018. “We don’t need a lot of memoirs and we don’t need trials.”

James Barna couldn’t be more wrong when he says banning parking on Lincoln and Sunset Avenues in Amherst will deprive city workers, who are Amherst taxpayers, of their rightful parking spots.
How do we know he’s wrong?  The evidence is there for everyone.  During the Christmas, Spring and Long Summer holidays, UMass does not park there.  And during school term, when people park there, they all walk north on Lincoln to campus.  They do not work in downtown businesses and businesses.
The only people who would be denied parking if these bans were passed are UMass students and employees who park there to avoid paying fees for the parking spaces made available to them on campus.
As he says, they are not all Amherst taxpayers either.  Many of them don’t live or register their cars in Amherst, so don’t pay property tax or auto excise in Amherst.
When UMass is in session, these two-way streets become one-way hazards.  We who live on Lincoln and Sunset are not just inconvenienced.  We are in danger when firefighters and other emergency vehicles cannot get quick and direct access to our homes.  The speed bumps mentioned by Mr. Barna may slow traffic, but they do not widen our streets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ars Technica: After ICBM test, US stresses it was “not the result of current world events” 
Test comes after delays due to Russia, China tensions.  Early on Tuesday morning, an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, to test the capabilities of the US nuclear armed forces. 
The missile carried a test reentry vehicle, which traveled about 6,700 km to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where there is sophisticated tracking equipment to verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system. 
During an armed conflict, such a missile, which has a range of nearly 10,000 km, could be equipped with a nuclear warhead.

Thanks to the person who delivers the Gazette to my house early every morning.  Thanks to the person who wrote the article on Hue’s Barber Shop.  Thanks to Hué Pepin.
Thursday morning I tried to cut my hair myself.  After two cuts, my wife told me to stop.  I pedaled my bike to the hair salon in Hue at 8am.  At 9 am I arrived home with a professional haircut.  Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A South Korean city near Seoul has successfully implemented a pilot program that allows police to seize crypto from the exchange accounts of individuals with traffic fines.
Gunpo, a city of about 275,000 people in the northwest province of Gyeonggi, was selected by the national government to run the pilot program in 2022, which took place on Aug. 16. report news outlet JoongBoo Ilbo said it was a way to collect overdue funds in a “contactless” or “non-contact” way.
The program appears to have been successful, at least in the first half of 2022, with Gunpo police achieving an 88% collection rate on traffic fines totaling $668,000, setting the city on pace to significantly exceed its goal of chasing $759,000 in traffic fines by the end of the year.
However, the trial only saw overdue fines totaling an excess of approximately $759 by an individual subjected to crypto seizures by the police, while the crypto seizures were only a measure taken if the funds on the individual’s bank accounts were already depleted. 
Related: Do Kwon allegedly hired lawyers in South Korea to prepare Terra investigation
Jungo Ilbo said fines collected in the first half of the year already exceed total annual collections in each of the past three years.
The Korean crypto market is lucrative for law enforcement because it reached $45.9 billion in 2021although the report did not indicate what crypto would be seized and sold to pay fines.

Federal Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart will hold a hearing Thursday on whether to unseal the affidavit the Federal Bureau of Investigation used to justify last week’s search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home.  The public interest is best served if the judge lets Americans see what only he and federal officials now know.
On Friday, Judge Reinhart issued the warrant for research after Attorney General Merrick Garland and Mr. Trump called for his release.  The public gleaned general information about the warrant and what was collected, but not enough to conclude whether the unprecedented search of a former president’s home was justified.  The affidavit almost certainly includes more detail about the legal and factual bas…]]></summary>

On July 20, President Joe Biden visited the site of the former Brayton Point coal-fired power plant on the South Shore of Massachusetts to call for action on climate change.  Less than a month later, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Congress have answered that call, in what I hope will be the start of a cascade of climate action.
When you think about global warming, you might feel concerned – and for good reason.  We see the effects of global warming all around us, as anyone who experienced this summer’s heat wave can attest.
Responding to the call to action, last week Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed a far-reaching climate bill that will help make our homes and businesses more energy efficient, put more electri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tell them that there are three causes for the civil war:	
The first cause is slavery.	
The second cause is slavery.	
And the third cause is slavery.	
The civil war started because of slavery, period.	
Was it about other things?	
Yes.	
Would this have happened if he	
weren’t for the slavery party?	
No.	
It was not about states’ rights.	
Read it –	
the Confederate States, when they seceded,	
it was a question of preserving slavery.	
How not to say that it is slavery?	
I think people are so attached to the morality of slavery	
this may not necessarily have been the root cause.	
The existence of slavery as an economic tool in the South	
was one of the main causes of the civil war.	
The North was not the pious North,	
and the South was not the bad South.	
The North profited greatly from slavery,	
just as much as the South did.	
Remove the slaves from the South	
essentially took most of their wealth.	
The reconstruction was a period	
in which the federal government has maintained a very close link	
eye on the South.	
And as a result, you see some successes	
within the African-American community.	
You see that black people have seats in Congress.	
You see an increase in voting rights.	
However, it comes to an abrupt end.	
There’s gonna be a deal	
and it’s called the compromise of 1877.	
Republicans will make a deal	
retain the presidency.	
The army will be withdrawn from the South.	
And from 1877 until the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s,	
the South will be dominated by segregation.	
It was an opportunity for this country to do things right.	
Yeah, could have.	
But we didn’t.	
What really happened	
we are still recovering from now.	
What really happened is 100 years of	
institutionalized racism.	
I want them to understand that the Reconstruction continues	
touches us today.	
I do not say,	
reconstruction,	
we didn’t quite understand.	
I show them all this evidence.	
Nine times out of 10 they will	
to come to this conclusion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he strategically downplayed the impending Russian invasion to prevent a financial panic that he says would have resulted in his country swiftly falling to the Kremlin. 
Zelensky described the delicate balancing act he faced leading up to the invasion in an interview with The Washington Post published Tuesday. The remarks by the Ukrainian leader sheds light on why Zelensky publicly contradicted statements of U.S. officials who accurately predicted Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
As Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed more than 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine in January, President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials increasingly sounded the alarm that Russia would launch an invasion.

Russia is hosting the Tenth Moscow Conference on International Security, an event that brings together defense ministers, heads of international organizations, and experts and think-tank representatives from around the world. 
The collective West is purposely destroying the European security system with NATO moving further east, said Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, addressing the X Moscow Conference on International Security.   
"Western globalist elites are provoking chaos by rekindling old and inciting new conflicts, implementing a policy of so-called containment, while undermining any alternative, sovereign paths of development. Thus, they are desperately trying to preserve the hegemony and power that are slipping out of their grasp, trying to keep countries and peoples in the grip of a neo-colonial order,” Putin stated.

Daily Mail: Is Putin Plotting to Unleash Hell on This Holiday? 
Fears are mounting among Ukrainian officials that Russian President Vladimir Putin might choose to escalate his attacks on Ukraine during the country’s Independence Day holiday next week. 
“We must definitely be prepared for possible missile strikes,” said Yuriy Ihnat, Spokesperson for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on Wednesday. He warned that Russia has a preference for using certain special dates for so-called “congratulations.” 
There are concerns that Russia might use Belarus as a launchpad for attacks given a flurry of movements observed there in recent days, according to Ihnat. 
“We constantly observe the movement of [Russian] troops in the territory of Belarus, as well as the transportation of ammunition, Iskander and other types of missiles. This happens all the time. If an Il-76 flies from the Russian Federation to the territory of Belarus, then it is clear that it delivers weapons,” Ihnat said.

   The Eurasian Times: China’s Version Of HIMARS Bombard Taiwan Strait; Experts Call It Game-Changer In Conflict With Taipei 
Images have emerged on social media of a Chinese Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), described as China’s version of US-made HIMARS that has gained a ‘cult status’ after their deployment in Ukraine. According to an expert, this Chinese-made MLRS could be a ‘game changer’ in a potential conflict with Taiwan. 
The pictures were posted on Twitter by Lyle Goldstein, the Director of Asia Engagement at the Defense Priorities think tank. 
According to Goldstein, the images, sourced from the Chinese television channel CCTV-7, showed the MLRS firing rockets into the Taiwan Strait on August 4, as part of the Chinese military drills in waters surrounding Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s arrival on the island by aircraft on August 2, despite several warnings from China.

At the time, Church leaders and historians said it would be the Roman Catholic Church’s greatest effort to fix the buying, selling and enslaving of black people in the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bad Bunny reclaims No. 1 on the Billboard album chart by the slimmest of margins this week, as the Puerto Rican superstar’s three-month-old album “Un Verano Sin Ti” recorded its eighth time at the top, beating the last release of the prolific Louisiana rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again by only 400 copies.
‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, a consistent streaming hit since its release 14 weeks ago, is credited with the equivalent of 108,800 sales in the US, while YoungBoy’s ‘The Last Slimeto’ had 108,400. according to Luminate tracking service.
Looking Under the Hood shows slight differences in the performance of the two albums over the past week.  “Un Verano” had 143 million streams, which Luminate and Billboard attribute to the equivalent of just over 102,000 sales.  “The Last Slimeto,” on the other hand, took significantly more streams — 163 million — to earn just 1,000 more equivalent sales.


Billboard gives more weight to streams from paying subscribers than non-paying ones.  The tea leaves data suggests that YoungBoy may have performed particularly well on services with free tiers like Spotify and YouTube, where YoungBoy has been a huge attraction for years.


Even so, the deciding factor in winning No. 1 was the number of copies sold in a complete package.  Last week, the CD version of “Un Verano” became widely available, so the album sold 6,000 copies, while “The Last Slimeto” only sold 4,600.
“Rebirth” by Beyoncé best seller last week, falling two places to No. 3 in its second week, with the equivalent of 89,000 sales, a drop of 73%.  Beyoncé’s single “Break My Soul” topped the Hot 100 chart, thanks to a “Queens Remix” which incorporates Madonna’s 1990 hit “Vogue” and features Beyoncé tweaking her predecessor’s song screams to include black musicians such as Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Aaliyah and Lizzo.
Morgan Wallen’s ‘Dangerous: The Double Album’ is No. 4 and Harry Styles’ ‘Harry’s House’ is No. 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point, did your relationship with the role turn into a sense of belonging?
Yes.  mike is mine.  Mike is mine.  I caught myself choking almost for a moment when you asked that.  And I think the honest thing to say is if I really think about it, maybe Mike changed Johnny too.
I think Jonathan Banks, playing Mike, became a little quieter, a little less rambunctious.  And by silence, I mean, I think I’m listening a little more than 12, 13 years ago.  I don’t like to use the word witness, but that’s what comes to mind.  I think it may have affected me in that I’m a bit more patient.  Maybe it comes with age anyway.
Was there ever a time when you had a script and thought, “Mike wouldn’t do that”?
There were times when I was like, “Oh, I don’t think Mike would do that.”  But I found, quite honestly, often that what the writers told me, if I relied on them, made sense.
The first thing that comes to mind is in “Breaking Bad” when Mike left his granddaughter in the park and had to escape.  And I was like, ‘No, Mikey would never leave his granddaughter.  And of course the reasoning is that the police department – ​​they’re right there in the park.  They will take care of her, they will return her to her mother.  I still have trouble with Mike leaving his granddaughter in the park.
There’s a scene in “Better Call Saul” last season where Mike reads “The Little Prince” to his granddaughter, Kaylee.  It is a passage where the little prince says: “My flower is ephemeral, and it has only four thorns to defend itself against the world.  What do you think this scene means for Mike?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-driving car services are popping up across the country.  But they are not what they seem.
The latest example is an improved service in Las Vegas from ride-sharing company Lyft.
On Tuesday, the company said it would allow users to hail a new type of self-driving car on and around the Las Vegas Strip, building on a similar service it has offered in the city for four years.  But the news comes with an important caveat: These vehicles will come with two of what the industry calls safety drivers, who will take control of the car if something goes wrong.
The technology and automotive industries spent much of the last decade promising cars that would drive the streets on their own.  But many years, perhaps even decades, will pass before truly autonomous vehicles are commonplace.  Although la…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Russian MIG-31 fighter jet carried out an 'unsafe close pass' of an RAF spy plane while it was in international airspace over Norwegian and Barents Seas, MoD reveals after Moscow claimed British aircraft crossed its state border 
* Moscow said it 'intercepted' a British RC-135 spyplane over the Barents sea 
* A leading pro-Putin politician demanded a 'harsh' response from the Kremlin 
* MoD refuted the claim, arguing the spyplane did not breach Russia's airspace 
* The plane maintained constant contact with Russian civilian air traffic control     * An MoD spokesperson said a Russian MiG-31 jet made an 'unsafe close pass' of the RAF aircraft to force it away 
A Russian MiG-31 fighter jet made an 'unsafe close pass' of an RAF spy plane yesterday, Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said, after Moscow claimed the plane had infringed on its airspace. 
The RAF spyplane was flying over the Norwegian and Barents seas on Monday on a flight path which took it close to Russian territory, but at no point did the British aircraft enter Russian sovereign airspace. 
The MoD said the RC-135 spy plane's crew maintained radio communications with Russian civilian air traffic control throughout its flight.

* 'Following the visit, tensions have gone up one notch,' Lawrence Wong said in an interview with Bloomberg 
* 'We're starting to see a series of decisions being taken by both countries that will lead us to more dangerous territory'

 Singapore's prime minister-in-waiting warned that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan had put the U.S.-China relationship on a 'very worrying' trajectory and warned the two nations may 'sleepwalk into conflict' if neither side takes action to deescalate. 
'Following the visit, tensions have gone up one notch,' Lawrence Wong said in an interview with Bloomberg. 'And that's the risk that can happen, that we're starting to see a series of decisions being taken by both countries that will lead us to more dangerous territory.'

RT: Ukraine bombs nuclear waste storage site – official  
Rockets also targeted the cooling systems of the facility  
Ukrainian artillery has fired multiple rockets directly at the coolant systems and nuclear waste storage site inside the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in Energodar, local government administration member Vladimir Rogov told Russian media on Tuesday. 
He warned that a successful strike may result in a radiation release equivalent to a “dirty bomb.”  “One of the guided missiles hit just ten meters” from the barrels with spent nuclear fuel,” Rogov told Soloviev Live. “Others hit a bit farther away, 50 to 200 meters.” 
Since the storage site is out in the open, any hit will result in the release of nuclear waste ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilograms and contamination of the area, the official explained. “In plain language, that would be like a dirty bomb,” said Rogov.

Politico: Xi Jinping’s Saudi trip seeks to exploit Riyadh-Washington tensions  
Saudi’s Chinese flirtation reflects a leverage bid with Biden administration. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon end more than two years of self-imposed in-person diplomatic isolation as he travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — a month after President Joe Biden’s strained visit to Jeddah. 
The Xi trip has not been confirmed, but an unnamed Saudi source said it may occur as early as this week. 
Xi can expect a full helping of Saudi diplomatic pomp and ceremony in contrast to Biden’s low-profile visit, punctuated by an awkward fist bump with MBS, as the Crown Prince is known. Instead of pesky questions about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, Xi will get a red-carpet welcome and likely respond with a full-throated affirmation of deepening Saudi-Chinese ties.

 Novelist Salman Rushdie walked on stage at a summer festival at the Chautauqua Institution in New York to speak on Friday and was stabbed 10 times by an assailant. The violent attack on free speech has left Rushdie in the hospital and revived concerns around the perils facing artists who take risks.
Rushdie has faced death threats for more than three decades, since the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Rushdie in 1989 and called for his death over purported blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses, which satirized Islamic histories and mythologies with magical re…]]></summary>

Antiwar.com: Will China Mess With US Warships Headed for Taiwan Strait? 
The US has thrown down the gauntlet. A showdown may come "in the coming weeks," if sanity does not prevail. 
White House and Pentagon spokesmen keep insisting, as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl did on Aug. 14:  "What’s important for us right now is to make sure that Beijing understands that our forces in the region will continue to operate, to fly, to sail wherever international waters allows. 
That includes the Taiwan Strait.  "I think you should expect that we will continue to do Taiwan Strait transits, as we have in the past, in the coming weeks. …"

Today, I’m taking a turn as a guest host of the Climate Forward newsletter with a bit of news on how this movement is expanding into new territory.
Cambridge University faculty and senior staff are set to vote on a measure that would force the university to stop accepting funding from coal, oil and gas companies.  It would be the first major university to do so, and a vote could take place as early as this fall.
People I interviewed wouldn’t make any predictions about the vote, but the proposal appeared to have strong support, especially among a younger cohort of university scholars.

The high cost of hearing aids, which are not covered by basic health insurance, has discouraged millions of hearing-impaired Americans from purchasing these devices.  Health experts say untreated hearing loss can contribute to cognitive decline and depression in older people.

His family announces the death in a report published on the Princeton Tigers website.  He did not say where he died or give the cause of death.
As the men’s head coach from 1967 to 1996, Carril (pronounced care-ILL) taught a thinking man’s basketball at Princeton.  As a member of the Ivy League, Princeton could not offer athletic scholarships and its academic standards were high, but Carril’s teams, almost invariably outmatched and outmatched, still won twice as often as they lost.

Washington Post: Chinese military ship docks in Sri Lanka over Indian, U.S. objections 
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — A Chinese navy ship at the center of a diplomatic spat docked in a southern port in Sri Lanka on Tuesday, marking a small triumph for Beijing over India and the United States. 
The Yuan Wang 5 arrived before 8 a.m. on Tuesday and will stay for three days, according to the Hambantota International Port Group. 
The ship, which reportedly carried 2,000 sailors, was welcomed in a traditional Sri Lankan ceremony attended by Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhenhong and Sri Lankan lawmakers. 
Footage from the event showed the dignitaries sitting on a red carpet in front of the docked Chinese military vessel while its crew held a massive red banner along a deck that read: “Hello Sri Lanka, Long Live Sri Lanka — China Friendship.”

French forces have been supporting Mali against insurgents for nearly a decade, but President Emmanuel Macron decided to pull out after France and the Malian junta fell out in the wake of a military takeover in August 2020. 
"Today at 13H00 Paris time (1100 GMT) the final contingent of the Barkhane force still on Malian territory crossed the border between Mali and Niger," the statement said.

        <updated>2022-08-16T14:46:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish firefighters said Tuesday they had recovered 100 tons of dead fish from the Oder river running through Germany and Poland, deepening concerns of an environmental disaster.
"We'd never had an operation of this scope on a river before," said Monika Nowakowska-Drynda from the national firefighter press office.
She confirmed that around 100 tonnes (220,500 pounds) of dead fish had been recovered since Friday.
The cause of death is uncertain, though officials believe the fish are likely to have been poisoned.
"Probably enormous quantities of chemical waste was dumped into the river in full knowledge of the risk and consequences," Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said last week.
Water samples have been sent to laboratories in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Britain in the hopes of finding the cause.
The first reports of mass fish deaths were made by Polish locals and anglers as early as July 28.
German officials have accused Polish authorities of failing to inform them about the deaths, and were taken by surprise when the wave of lifeless fish came floating into view.
In Poland, the government has also come under heavy criticism for failing to take swift action.
The Oder has over the last years been known as a relatively clean river, and 40 domestic species of fish are found in the waterway.
But now, dead fish -- some reaching up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) -- can be seen across the river.
Nowakowska-Drynda said more than 500 firefighters have been recovering the dead fish in Poland with the help of dams, boats, quad bikes and even a drone.

DeGrom.  Scherzer.
You can command them any way you want now that Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom are finally installed at the top of the Mets pitching rotation.

Or a fantasy.
From 2016 to 2019, the four National League Cy Young Awards have all gone to Scherzer (then a Washington National) or deGrom (so far a Met career).  From 2016 to 2019, only two NL pitchers have had more than 20 wins over substitution: Scherzer (27) and deGrom (24).

But something unusual happened: the TV show didn’t get a commercial cut.
Instead, the camera trailed behind Díaz as he walked through the bullpen door, jogged, and crossed the grass of the outfield.  The trumpets of “Narco,” Díaz’s beloved entrance song, were piped directly from the stadium’s PA system to the broadcast, giving fans at home the feeling of watching it all happen in person.

In the populous Rift Valley town of Nakuru for instance, female candidates were elected to eight positions, including governor, senator and woman representative -- with Susan Kihika, Tabitha Karanja and Liza Chelule claiming those victories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Roger Tung
TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan accused China of exaggeration and "tricks" on Tuesday after the Chinese military published footage of the strategically located Penghu islands where there is a major Taiwanese air base.
China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has carried out military exercises around the island this month after a visit by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was followed by five U.S. lawmakers on Sunday and Monday.
The Chinese military unit responsible for the area adjacent to Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command, released on Monday video of the Penghu islands, apparently taken by a Chinese air force aircraft close by.
Taiwan Air Force Vice Chief of Staff for Operations Tung Pei-lun told reporters in Taipei that this was Chinese information warfare, though he said he had no comment on who had taken the video.
"China used the exaggerated tricks of cognitive warfare to show how close it was to Penghu - which is not true," Tung said.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry on Monday, in an update of Chinese air force activity near Taiwan, showed on a map that the closest Chinese aircraft to Penghu that day were four J-16 fighters.
The fighters crossed the Taiwan Strait median line - normally an unofficial barrier between the two sides - but stayed closer to the Chinese coast than Penghu, the map showed.
Tung said Taiwan had a real-time "grasp" of what was going on in the skies, and that Chinese aircraft have been operating to the north and southwest of Taiwan and across the median line.
"Both the air force and ground air defence forces respond."
Penghu is close to Taiwan's southwestern coast, unlike the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands which are right next to the Chinese coast.
Penghu is a popular summer tourist destination for its beaches, reefs and seafood.

It was the first time the three countries have held such drills since 2017, after relations between Seoul and Tokyo hit their lowest in years in 2019 amid renewed historical disputes dating to Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative who took office in May, has vowed to improve relations with Japan and deepen the U.S. alliance to better deter North Korea, including by expanding or resuming joint drills.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukrainian and Russian-installed officials reported shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Monday, with both sides blaming each other days after the world nuclear watchdog warned of disaster if the fighting does not stop.
Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations this month of shelling near the plant, which dominates the south bank of a vast reservoir on the Dnipro River, amid fears of a nuclear catastrophe.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned Russian soldiers who attack Europe's largest nuclear power station or use it as a base to shoot from that they will become a "special target".

Analysts paint a picture of a weakened armed resistance against the Taliban and an Afghan population that increasingly abhors the Islamic fundamentalist group – but is too exhausted to oppose it.
When Afghanistan captured the world’s attention shortly after the Taliban’s precipitous takeover on August 15, 2021, the media focused on the Panjshir Valley – where late Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud held off both the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. As the Taliban closed in, the lionised commander’s son, Ahmad Massoud, vowed to fight the Taliban from Panjshir once again.

Iran has denied any involvement in the attack on writer Salman Rushdie in the United States.
"There is no connection between Iran and the perpetrator," foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Monday, as reported by the Iranian news agency Isna.
"Rushdie himself is responsible for the attack," Kanaani asserted, noting that the author's work not only offended Iran, but Muslims worldwide.
Rushdie was stabbed onstage as he was about to deliver a lecture in New York State on Friday. The writer is recovering in hospital. A 24-year-old suspect is in custody.
The Indian-born Briton's novel "The Satanic Verses" led to death threats from Iran in the 1980s.
Iran is increasingly coming in for criticism in the international community over a death sentence issued against the respected author in the 1980s.
Late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, or fatwa, sentencing Rushdie to death more than 30 years ago because of the "The Satanic Verses," published in 1988.
Khomeini accused Rushdie of insulting Islam, the prophet Mohammed and the Koran in his novel.]]></summary>

"Clearly it is ludicrous to suggest that Salman Rushdie was in any way responsible for this abhorrent attack on him," the spokesman told reporters.
"This was not just an attack on him, it was an attack on the right to free speech and expression and the UK government stands both by him and his family, but equally we stand in defence of free speech around the world."

According to the UN, 95 percent of Afghans are going hungry. It’s a catastrophe that worsened after the fall of Kabul one year ago, exacerbated by the US decision to freeze the Afghan Central Bank’s assets and the international sanctions that have crippled an already fragile economy.
The Afghan economy was already in a terrible state when the Taliban seized Kabul a year ago, with half the population living below the poverty line. The situation has only worsened since then. International aid accounted for 80 percent of the Afghan state budget – but it was cut off upon the Taliban victory, prompting economic collapse and depriving many Afghans of basic necessities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revelations that Australia's ex-prime minister secretly appointed himself to several ministerial posts during the pandemic sparked a political firestorm Monday, with his successor promising a rapid investigation.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Scott Morrison of "tin-pot activity" after it emerged the former leader had made himself minister of health, finance and resources, among other positions, without informing colleagues, parliament or voters.
Describing Morrison's actions as "extraordinary and unprecedented", Albanese said Monday he had sought legal advice from the solicitor-general and would be briefed later today.
"This is a sort of tin-pot activity that we would ridicule if it was in a non-democratic country," Albanese said. "Scott Morrison was running a shadow government"
In some cases, Morrison made himself a co-minister without telling the cabinet members he had already appointed to those positions.
The scandal has shone a light on the opaque nature of decision-making inside Australia's government -- and raised questions about whether more stringent democratic safeguards are needed.
It is still not clear how many posts Morrison held, but local media reported that he took on the resources portfolio and used his power to axe a significant gas project off Sydney's coast.
Morrison's conservative coalition lost power in May elections, ending nearly a decade of centre-right rule in the country.
In Australia, elected politicians are selected by the prime minister before being sworn in by the governor-general in a formal ceremony that is usually publicly recorded.
Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey described the allegations as "bizarre" and said it raised possible legal challenges to some of the former government's decisions.
"The secrecy involved in this is just simply bizarre. I mean, you know, you just wonder what's wrong with these people, if they have to do everything in secret," she said.
"It's just utterly inappropriate. We live in a democracy, which requires transparency."

But the Modi administration has overseen massive crackdowns on civil liberties, including discrimination against India’s Muslim minority, raising fears for the future of the world’s largest democracy.
Speaking from the 17th century Red Fort, the former residence of Mughal emperors in Delhi, Prime Minister Modi said India must turn into a developed nation before it marks a centenary of independence from colonial Britain.
"We must turn India into a developed country in the next 25 years, in our lifetime," said the 71-year-old Modi, wearing a turban in the colors of the Indian flag, in his 75-minute-speech in Hindi.

The unannounced two-day trip by senior members of Congress prompted China to renew its rhetoric that it would "prepare for war" over Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing's leaders claim and have vowed to one day seize.
The five-member congressional delegation -- led by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts -- met with President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday, according to Washington's de facto embassy in Taipei.
"The delegation had an opportunity to exchange views with Taiwan counterparts on a wide range of issues of importance to both the United States and Taiwan," it said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taliban fighters chanted victory slogans next to the US embassy in Kabul on Monday as they marked the first anniversary of their return to power in Afghanistan following a turbulent year that saw women's rights crushed and a humanitarian crisis worsen.
Exactly a year ago, the hardline Islamists captured Kabul after a nationwide lightning offensive against government forces just as US-led troops were ending two decades of intervention in a conflict that cost tens of thousands of lives.
"We fulfilled the obligation of jihad and liberated our country," said Niamatullah Hekmat, a fighter who entered the capital on August 15 last year just hours after then-president Ashraf Ghani fled the country.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will aim to become a developed nation within 25 years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a national day address on Monday, with policies to support domestic production in power, defence and digital technology.
Speaking from the 17th century Red Fort in Delhi as India celebrates its 75th year of independence from British colonial rule, Modi exhorted youth to "aim big" and give their best years for the cause of the country.
"We must turn India into a developed country in the next 25 years, in our lifetime," said the 71-year-old Modi, wearing a turban in the colours of the Indian flag, in his 75-minute-speech in Hindi.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese fans of the sci-fi hit "Stranger Things" can chow down on demonic pasta and rock out to retro 1980s tunes at a pop-up cafe inspired by the Netflix Inc horror drama.
The shop, a partnership with local restaurant chain Pronto Corp, recently extended its run in the fashionable Shibuya district of Tokyo several months amid overwhelming demand. "Stranger Things" has remained one of the streamer's top 10 shows in Japan since the release of its fourth season in May.
The interior has replicas of shops and sets from the show, set in fictional U.S. town of Hawkins, Indiana, along with its dark-mirror underworld that the pre-teen protagonists call the "Upside Down."
Patrons can take pictures next to the drama's signature Demogorgon monster while songs from the show, such as Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill," play in the background.
Diners can nosh on food inspired by the show, such as squid-ink pasta arranged like the monster's head or the waffles craved by the psychically powered star character, Eleven.
To reduce the risk spreading COVID-19, now battering Japan in record infections, the cafe requires visitors to make a reservation and only about 20 are allowed inside every hour.
"Every day at midnight, I have been trying to book a table on my phone," said 29-year-old mother Kimiko Nakae. "Finally there's an opening today because someone had cancelled the reservation."
Tokyo has a long tradition of themed restaurants and cafes, featuring everything from ninja waiters and exotic animals to vampire-inspired cuisine.
But like many tourist-oriented businesses, the sector has been hard hit by the pandemic. The Lockup, a chain of haunted prison eateries, ended a 23-year run when its final location closed last month, joining the fate of the famous Robot Restaurant, a gaudy music and dance spectacle in the red-light district of Kabukicho that closed in March 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Climate activists affiliated with Extinction Rebellion have targeted golf courses in southern France, filling holes with concrete in protest over exemptions from water restrictions during one of the worst droughts on record.
France has told residents to avoid non-essential water usage like car-washing and watering gardens. However, activists complain that golf courses are allowed to continue watering greens.
The protest action took place at the Vieille-Toulouse club and also at the Garonne des Sept Deniers course.
Defending their exemption from the water restrictions, Gerard Rougier of the French Golf Federation told the France Info news website: "A golf course without a green is like an ice-rink without ice."
Extinction Rebellion Toulouse posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing a golf hole filled with cement and a sign saying "This hole is drinking 277,000 litres. Do you drink that much? #Stop Golf".
A petition aimed at scrapping the exemption enjoyed by French golf courses during drought said: "Economic madness takes precedence over ecological reason."
Water bans are enforced at the discretion of regional officials and so far only Ille-et-Villaine in western France had banned the watering of golf courses.
France had been one of the hardest hit by the hot and dry conditions across Europe with firefighters battling a "monster" blaze in forests in the southwest France.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Afghan security personnel with sensitive knowledge of U.S. operations left behind by the American evacuation operation are vulnerable to recruitment or coercion by Russia, China and Iran, Republican lawmakers said on Sunday, noting that President Joe Biden's administration failed to prioritize evacuating them.
"This is especially true given reports that some former Afghan military personnel have fled to Iran," minority Republicans of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a report on the first anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Kabul.
