        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has labelled the Democratic Party an “elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness” in a video posted to social media announcing she’s officially leaving the party.

“I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that is now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue & stoke anti-white racism,” Ms Gabbard said in her YouTube video.

"I believe in a government that is of the people, by the people and for the people. Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not. Instead, it stands for a government that is of, by and for the powerful elite.”

Ms Gabbard has held various roles in the Democratic Party since 2002 including representing Hawaii’s 2nd congressional district from 2013-2021.

She was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 Presidential election before dropping out in March and endorsing Joe Biden.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angela Lansbury, star of the drama series “Murder, She Wrote”, has died, the family of the British actress confirmed.  She was 96 years old.
She died “peacefully sleeping at home in Los Angeles” on Tuesday morning, Michael A. McConnell of Zero Gravity Management said in a statement on behalf of her three children.  Lansbury would turn 97 in just five days.
Throughout her 80-year career, Lansbury has starred on the big screen, television and on stage.  She has won five Tony Awards, most recently in 2009 for her role in the Broadway revival of “Blithe Spirit”. 

Lansbury starred in Disney’s 1991 animated musical “Beauty and the Beast”, voicing Mrs.  Potts, but is perhaps best known for starring as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher in the CBS hit “Murder, She Wrote,” which ran from 1984 to 1996. 
Before her television career, she was considered one of the last movie stars of Hollywood’s golden age, CBS Los Angeles  reported.  She was a player signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s.

* The International Monetary Fund predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% in 2023. 
* “The worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,” the report reads. 
* Its GDP estimate for this year remained steady at 3.2%, which was down from the 6% seen in 2021. 
The International Monetary Fund predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% next year, 0.2 percentage point lower than its July forecast, and anticipates 2023 will feel like a recession for millions around the world. 
Aside from the global financial crisis and the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, this is “the weakest growth profile since 2001,” the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook published Tuesday. 
Its GDP estimate for this year remained steady at 3.2%, which was down from the 6% seen in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An explosive new report claims that Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin before he floated a "peace plan" for Ukraine that was widely panned by critics as a gift to Russia.
Vice News reports that newsletter from Ian Bremmer, a foreign policy expert and the founder of the Eurasia Group global risk consultancy firm, is claiming that Musk said that Putin is now "prepared to negotiate" a peace settlement but only if Ukraine accepted Russia's annexations of its territories in the eastern part of the country.
Putin emphasized to Musk that Russia's annexation of this Ukrainian territory, as well as an agreement in which Ukraine would maintain neutrality and not join NATO, would be accomplished "no matter what," and he even emphasized that his nation was prepared to launch a nuclear strike should Ukrainian forces attempt to retake Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.
Bremmer also claims that Musk personally told him that "everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome," and that was why he publicly floated his plan.

But Musk's plan has not been well received in Kyiv, with many officials saying it would amount to capitulation to Russia.
"The only outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing tesla crap. So good luck to you," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk wrote to Musk on Twitter. "F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you."
Musk has denied Bremmer's claims, however, and he wrote on Twitter that "I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space."

Websites for 14 U.S. airport websites were targeted with “denial of service” cyber attacks on Monday morning. Russian-speaking hackers have claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Denial of service attacks crash websites by simultaneously sending large numbers of artificial users to websites. 
The overwhelmed service requests shut down the websites by overwhelming the sites’ computer servers. 
The attacks affected the public-facing websites for LaGuardia airport in New York City, O’Hare international airport in Chicago, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, and nine other airport websites. Most of the sites have since returned online.

WNU Editor: No one is really sure if the Kremlin was responsible for this attack .... 'Too soon to know' whether Kremlin was behind cyberattacks on US airports, Kirby says (ABC News).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, describing it as a "special military operation." Most military analysts expected an easy victory. The Russians had a significant numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, much greater firepower, air and naval superiority and seemingly bottomless resources with which to impose its will. It was reasonable to believe that Russia would conquer Ukraine rapidly and then replace the existing government before declaring "victory". 
Of course, that did not happen.
The Ukrainians had been preparing for this eventuality since at least 2014, when the Russian military and its allied forces invaded eastern Ukraine and illegally occupied and annexed Crimea. With the help of the U.S. and other Western allies, the Ukr…]]></summary>

Insider: 80 years after launching the first drone from an aircraft carrier, the US Navy is planning to fill its flattops with them 
* The US Navy is investing heavily in unmanned aircraft to operate aboard its aircraft carriers. 
* Navy officials now say that they hope to have drone aircraft compose 60% of their carrier air wings. 
* Eighty years ago, the Navy made its first crack at trying to operate drones aboard its carriers. 
The US Navy is working hard to incorporate unmanned aircraft into its aviation fleet. Service officials now say they aim for drones to compose 60% of their carrier air wings, a sizable increase from the 40% goal cited in the past. 
Leading the way on that effort is Boeing's MQ-25 Stingray, and unmanned aerial refueling drone that Navy officials say could eventually take on new roles, such as intelligence-gathering. 
The MQ-25 is expected to achieve initial operational capability by September 2025 and deploy aboard a carrier in 2026. 
It will be the first purpose-built carrier-based drone in service with any navy, but it won't be the first drone that the US Navy has operated from a flattop.

Protests calling for the fall of the clerical establishment have swept Iran since Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, died on Sept. 16 while being detained by the morality police in Tehran for "inappropriate attire".
While observers do not believe the unrest is close to toppling the government, the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, with reports of strikes spreading to the vital energy sector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kerch bridge is a vital link between Russian-annexed Crimea and Russia itself [AFP]   
Grayzone: EXPOSED: Before Ukraine blew up Kerch Bridge, British spies plotted it 
The secret British intelligence plot to blow up Crimea’s Kerch Bridge is revealed in internal documents and correspondence obtained exclusively by The Grayzone. 
The Grayzone has obtained an April 2022 presentation drawn up for senior British intelligence officers hashing out an elaborate scheme to blow up Crimea’s Kerch Bridge with the involvement of specially trained Ukrainian soldiers. Almost six months after the plan was circulated, Kerch Bridge was attacked in an October 8th suicide bombing apparently overseen by Ukraine’s SBU intelligence services. 
Detailed proposals for providing “audacious” support to Kiev’s “maritime raiding operations” were drafted at the request of Chris Donnelly, a senior British Army intelligence operative and veteran high ranking NATO advisor. The wide-ranging plan’s core component was “destruction of the bridge over the Kerch Strait.” 
Documents and correspondence plotting the operation were provided to The Grayzone by an anonymous source.

WNU Editor: I am always skeptical on news organizations and web sites using "anonymous" sources. But before the Crimea Kerch Bridge attack there were reports in the media that Ukraine asked the UK for help to destroy the Kerch Bridge .... Ukraine held talks with Britain for destruction of Crimean bridge (APA).]]></summary>

Her household is among a handful of families who still inhabit the Kome Caves, a heritage site in the north of the country, first occupied about 200 years ago by local tribes seeking shelter from conflict and cannibalism.
"Life is good, we grow our own vegetables, I can pray anytime I want," Ntefane, a rosary around her neck, tells AFP.
More than 1,800 meters above sea level, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the capital Maseru, the settlement is surrounded by barren pastures, where shepherds draped in long woolen blankets graze cattle in the morning mist.

As a result of the Fed's relentless tightening blitz, which on November 2 will have hiked rates by 75bps on four occasions in just 96 trading days, the fastest tightening campaign since Volcker, both US capital markets (the S&P 500 is down -24%, for the 4th worst year on record, only 1931, 1974, and 2002 were worse; and 10Y TSYs are down -17% for the worst year on record... 1987 second worse, and bonds were down -10%) and the US economy have been left reeling. 
However, the damage in the US - whose economy is relatively isolated from the knock-on (or is that out) effects of the soaring global reserve currency - are nothing compared to the devastation unleashed by the Fed in the form of the soaring dollar and exploding interest rates. And yet the outcry against either the Soros Biden administration, or chair Powell has been relatively muted (excluding the occasional scathing oped in China's Global Times and fake populist rage-tweet by everyone's favorite "native American", Liz Warren).

The insults are flying between the two candidates before the second round of presidential elections.
Here is a timeline of some of the put-downs:
Bolsonaro on Lula: 'swindler'
"I talk dirty, but I'm not a thief," Bolsonaro said at a September 7 campaign event on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, referring to Lula's 2017 conviction on charges of accepting bribes for public contracts while president. A Supreme Court judge annulled the conviction last year.
"Liar, ex-convict, traitor," Bolsonaro said of Lula in the last televised debate on TV Globo on September 28.

The kingdom has been stunned by the tragedy in northeastern Na Klang province, one of the worst mass killings in its history, with flags at half-mast and King Maha Vajiralongkorn visiting the families of the victims.
At Wat Rat Samakee temple in Na Klang, chanting monks began the ceremony as the exhausted and grieving close-knit rural community prepared to say a final goodbye to 19 of those killed.
"An incident like this shouldn't have happened," said Thanakorn Nueangmatcha, 39, ahead of the funeral at the temple.

Iran's clerical authorities have been shaken by over three weeks of protests that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year old Iranian of Kurdish origin, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police.
Despite the use of brutal force by the authorities that activists say has left dozens dead, and led to hundreds of arrests, there is so far no sign of the protest movement coming to an end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskiy on Monday that the United States will provide Ukraine with advanced air systems after a devastating missile barrage from Russia.
Biden spoke by phone with Zelenskiy to give assurances about continued U.S. support and to condemn the "senseless attacks" from Russia that hit civilian targets.
"President Biden pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems," a White House statement on the phone call said.
Biden also told Zelenskiy the United States and its allies and partners would continue imposing costs on Russia, "holding Russia accountable for its war crimes and atrocities, and providing Ukraine with security, economic, and humanitarian assistance," the White House said.
The United States has provided more than $16.8 billion worth of U.S. security assistance since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and imposed a wide-ranging array of economic sanctions on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - The United States and other G7 powers will hold crisis talks Tuesday on Russia's recent bombing blitz across Ukraine, with Britain's Liz Truss expected to insist they "must not waver one iota" in their support for Kyiv.
The meeting comes a day after Russian missiles rocked the Ukrainian capital for the first time in months, with President Volodymyr Zelensky warning Moscow that his country "cannot be intimidated".
Russian forces rained more than 80 missiles on cities across Ukraine on Monday, according to Kyiv, in apparent retaliation for an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia.

Washington Examiner: Russia's Medvedev urges 'complete dismantling' of Ukraine’s political regime 
Russia must pursue a “complete dismantling” of Ukraine's system of governance, according to a top Russian official and longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
“The goal of our future actions, in my opinion, should be the complete dismantling of Ukraine’s political regime,” Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and Putin deputy, said Monday. 
Medvedev, dispensing with his reputation as a relative liberal within the Russian system, has provided hawkish commentary on the war since February, when Putin launched the campaign to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
Putin has attempted to portray the war as a mere “special military operation” with limited military objectives, but the Ukrainian attack on the Kerch Strait bridge, which links the Crimean Peninsula, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, to the Russian mainland, prompted an outpouring of missile strikes against civilian areas, along with a blast of bellicose rhetoric from Moscow.

In the wake of President Biden's mention of nuclear "armageddon", and Elon Musk tweeting that "nuclear war probability is rising rapidly," it is natural that people have pondered online what they would do, and where they would shelter, in the event of a nuclear war. 
But, the safest place to go in the case of a nuclear bomb being detonated depends on where the bomb is targeted, as well as the size of the nuclear weapons, the time of year, the weather conditions, and variety of other factors, meaning the safest location will vary considerably. 
Some estimates name Maine, Oregon, Northern California, and Western Texas as some of the safest locales in the case of nuclear war, due to their lack of large urban centers and nuclear power plants.

Semiconductor stocks across the globe - in Hong Kong, Europe and certainly in the US - are tumbling after the Biden administration on Friday unveiled new restrictions on technology exports to China which are meant to undercut Beijing's ability to develop wide swaths of its economy, from semiconductors and supercomputers to surveillance systems and advanced weapons. 
As noted earlier, the US Commerce Department on Friday unveiled sweeping new regulations that limit the sale of semiconductors and chip-making equipment to Chinese customers, striking at the foundation of the country’s efforts to build its own chip industry. The agency also added 31 organizations to its unverified list, including Yangtze Memory Technologies and a subsidiary of leading chip equipment maker Naura Technology, severely limiting their ability to buy technology from abroad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky News host Rita Panahi says the late-night talk show The Daily Show has “surprised everyone” by producing a “hilarious compilation” of Kamala Harris and the Veep character ‘Selina Meyers’. 

“The Daily Show has, like many other US late-night programs, largely given up any pretence of trying to be funny and turned into yet another leftist propaganda outfit,” Ms Panahi said. 

“But out of nowhere, they surprised everyone by putting together this hilarious compilation of Kamala Harris and the fictional vice president Selina Meyers.
 
“Let's take a minute now and marvel at a US comedy program that has somehow managed to produce comedy.”]]></summary>

“And last week while she was roasting a chook for the children, police came in and barged into her home, demanded she hand over all of her electrical devices and then the Surrey police dragged her off to jail where she spent the next eight hours frightened and understandably stressed.”

The message comes from Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez, who has veto power over foreign arms sales. 
A top Democratic senator is vowing to block all future weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and urging the Biden administration to “immediately freeze all aspects” of U.S. cooperation with the kingdom in response to its decision to cut oil production amid a global energy crisis set off by Russia’s war in Ukraine. 
The message from Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who has veto power over foreign arms sales, comes amid the West’s outrage at OPEC+ for slashing its oil output — a move that the U.S. and other allied governments saw as a gift to Moscow as it suffers significant losses on the battlefield in Ukraine.

(Bloomberg) -- The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank warned of a rising risk of a global recession as advanced economies slow and faster inflation forces the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, adding to the debt pressures on developing nations. 
In the US, the world’s largest economy, the labor market is still very strong but is losing momentum because the impact of higher borrowing costs is “starting to bite,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Monday. 
The euro zone is slowing as natural gas prices soar, as is China due to Covid-19 disruptions and volatility in the housing sector.  The IMF calculates that about one-third of the world economy will have at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this year and next, and that the lost output through 2026 will be $4 trillion.

Putin let rip with 83 missiles at what he claimed were military, energy and communications networks in Ukraine. 
Kyiv said the missiles actually hit power plants and busy civilian areas in major cities, killing at least 11 and wounding scores more. It was Russia's largest single barrage since the opening day of the war.

Known as Socrates Zaferiou House (the name of the first owner), the mid-century one-story home is just one of nine Wright designed in the 1950s for developer Marshall Erdman.  It is also the only Wright-designed house on the west bank of the Hudson River.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The websites for a number of major US airports were briefly taken offline Monday after a cyberattack promoted by a pro-Russian hacking group.
The distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks hit the airport websites of several major US cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and St Louis.
A DDOS attack involves knocking a website offline by flooding it with traffic.
The airport websites were targeted after the pro-Russian hacking group known as "KillNet" published a list of sites and encouraged its followers to attack them.
The DDOS attacks only affected the public-facing websites of the airports, which supply flight and services information and do not have any impact on operations.
Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport said its website is "up and running after an incident early this morning that made it inaccessible to the public."
"An investigation into the cause of the incident is underway," it said. "At no time were operations at the airport impacted."Most of the airport websites targeted appeared to be functioning normally after being temporarily knocked offline.
KillNet claimed responsibility last week for attacks on a number of US state government websites, and it has taken aim at other countries opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
There was no immediate comment from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Vladimir Putin threatened on Monday more "severe" attacks against Ukraine after Russian missiles rained down on the capital Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities in what Washington branded "utter brutality".
The biggest wave of strikes across Ukraine in months killed at least 11 and wounded more than 80 in retaliation for an explosion this weekend that damaged a key bridge linking Russia to the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula.
"Let there be no doubt," Putin said in televised comments addressed to his security council, "if attempts at terrorist attacks continue, the response from Russia will be severe."
Kyiv said Russian forces had fired more than 80 missiles on cities across the country and that Russia had also used Iranian drones launched from neighboring Belarus, spurring panic and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently floated a new "compromise" intended to keep peace between Taiwan and China -- and it is being given the same kind of hostile reception that politicians in Ukraine recently gave to his proposed "peace plan" with Russia.
As CNBC reports, Musk told the Financial Times over the weekend that the United States should endorse some kind of plan that gives Beijing some administrative control over Taiwan.
Specifically, Musk said America should "be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy.”
“And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong," Musk added.
However, Taiwanese diplomat Hsiao Bi-khim immediately shot down Musk's proposal, which had received a friendly reception from Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the United States.

"Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale," she said. "Any lasting proposal for our future must be determined peacefully, free from coercion, and respectful of the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan.
Bates Gill of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis similarly told CNBC that there is little desire among people in Taiwan to have any such arrangement, especially after watching how China slowly destroyed freedoms that had existed previously in the city of Hong Kong.
"The world’s wealthiest man obviously feels he has a lot to say on these geopolitical questions," explained Gill. "I would only suggest that he take a lot harder look at the realities, the historical precedents and geopolitical contestation that surround all of these questions before giving us all a lesson in diplomacy."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several cities across Ukraine were rocked with explosions in what some are calling the most extensive attack on the country since Russia launched its invasion in February. 
"This morning, a massive high-precision strike was conducted on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, military command, and communications," said Russian President Vladimir Putin. "In case Ukrainian terrorist attacks continue on Russian territory, our response will be tough and proportional."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the strikes disproportionately targeted civilian infrastructure in 11 of Ukraine's 25 regions. 
"It's a tough morning when you're dealing with terrorists," said Zelenskyy in the video. "They're choosing targets to harm as many people as possible."

BBC reporter Hugo Bachega was broadcasting live from Kyiv when when the first rounds of the strikes came in, causing him to duck for cover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia on Monday launched a series of missiles into cities across Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson doesn't believe that any new initiative will help the country succeed in its goals of taking and holding Ukrainian territory.
While speaking on CNN, Anderson broke down news that Russian General Sergey Surovikin would be taking over as head of the Kremlin's "special military operation" in Ukraine, which in recent weeks has been hit with multiple humiliating setbacks.
While Surovikin has a well earned reputation as a hardliner, Anderson was skeptical he could turn things around given the current state of Russia's military.
"I don't think there's going to be a new approach because he's incapable of doing a new approach as long as the Russian army is what it is, which is a terrible army," he said.
IN OTHER NEWS: Trump sounded 'guilty and scared' during his latest rally rant: Former federal prosecutor
Later in the segment, Anderson elaborated on why new leadership won't be nearly enough to fix what's broken in the Russian military.
"It's not like the soldiers are going to jump into a phone booth and come out as Superman," he said. "They have a terrible army. They're ten years away from having a good army that can take on the Ukrainians and achieve the military objectives they wanted. They have a low morale... They're incapable of executing the military operations that Vladimir Putin wants. George Patton couldn't make this a success for Putin."

In Iran no-one who expresses dissent from the ruling theocratic system, including the famous, is safe from being caught in the dragnet of a crackdown that has seen hundreds arrested in more than three weeks of protests.
Activists say that when the unrest erupted last month over the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police, the authorities initially resorted to lethal force, killing dozens in the space of days.
But, as well as keeping up the threat of force, authorities are increasingly resorting to arrests, with a particular focus on those who promote videos of protests or anti-regime messages on social media.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan throws open its doors to visitors this week after more than two years of pandemic isolation, hopes for a tourism boom face tough headwinds amid shuttered shops and a shortage of hospitality workers.
From Tuesday, Japan will reinstate visa-free travel to dozens of countries, ending some of world's strictest border controls to slow the spread of COVID-19. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen's slide to a 24-year low.
Arata Sawa is among those eager for the return of foreign tourists, who previously comprised up to 90% of the guests at his traditional inn.
"I'm hoping and anticipating that a lot of foreigners will come to Japan, just like before C…]]></summary>

The Netherlands will not continue to exploit the Groningen gas field because of the resulting earthquakes that impact those living in the area, Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists in Prague on Thursday. 
Groningen is one of the world’s largest gas fields and has been described as “the only potential game-changer in Europe” to replace the increasingly disrupted gas supply from Russia. 
The giant Dutch gas field once produced more than 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas yearly – equivalent to 10% of the EU’s consumption – but its production has now been capped due to earthquakes, EURACTIV reported.

Update: Dutch limit Groningen gas production despite energy crisis (Reuters)   
WNU editor: The Groningen gas field is massive. At its peak it was producing 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas yearly. This compares with Nord Stream 1 that use to send 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas yearly.

Refiners and traders predicted a raise of 40 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey from last week.  “It is a surprise,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst in London at brokerage PVM Oil Associates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen secured a second six-year term in office by obtaining more than 50% of the vote in an election on Sunday to avoid a runoff, initial projections issued soon after voting closed showed.
A projection by pollster SORA for national broadcaster ORF based on a partial vote count put Van der Bellen, a 78-year-old former leader of the Greens, on 54.6% with a margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. His nearest rival was far-right Freedom Party candidate Walter Rosenkranz on 18.9%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Julia slammed into Nicaragua on Sunday carrying top winds of up to 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and a storm surge, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, warning of dangerous weather in the coming days across the region.
The storm made landfall early on Sunday near Laguna de Perlas, the NHC said. By 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) it was around 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of Bluefields.
The hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it crosses Nicaragua, emerging over the eastern Pacific by Sunday night. It was forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night, the NHC said.
"Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides possible from heavy rains over Central America and Southern Mexico through early next week," the center said.
