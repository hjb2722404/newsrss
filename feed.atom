        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  The Future Science Awards Foundation (‘the Foundation’) has announced that the ‘2023 Future Science Prize Award Ceremony’ and associated week-long events will be held for the first time in Hong Kong in October this year.  The Future Science Prize is a highly respected annual award that recognises outstanding achievements in scientific research and innovation in three categories: life science, physical science, and mathematics and computer science.  The decision to host the event in Hong Kong was made in recognition of the city's growing status as an international hub for scientific research and innovation. The event is expected to draw leading scientists, researchers and industry experts from around the world, providing a platform to promote collaborations and for the exchange of knowledge and ideas.  Hong Kong has a unique opportunity to leverage its strengths in R&D capabilities, technology infrastructure, legal system and intellectual property, thanks to the national 14th Five-Year Plan and the Greater Bay Area. By acting as a strategic bridge for innovative companies, Hong Kong can capitalise on these advantages and become a key player in the international innovation and technology scene, according to Wu.  The University of Hong Kong (HKU) has three laureates namely: Prof Yuen Kwok-yung, Henry Fok Professor of Infectious Diseases and Chair Professor of Microbiology at the HKU Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, and Prof Joseph Sriyal Malik PEIRIS, Tam Wah-Ching Professor in Medical Science (2021 The Life Science Prize) and Prof Mok Ngai-ming, Edmund and Peggy Tse Professor in Mathematics (2022 The Mathematics and Computer Science Prize).   To celebrate this world-class science event, the Foundation and co-organisers, including the HKU and Tencent Foundation, hosted the first significant event of the ‘2023 Future Science Prize’ event series on Saturday, June 10. The event, known as the ‘Future Science Prize Laureates…]]></summary>

President Volodymyr Zelensky marked 500 days of Russia's full-scale war on July 8 with a video filmed on Snake Island, promising that Ukraine will reclaim every part of its territory currently occupied by Russia.

Snake Island, located 35 kilometers from the mainland of Odesa Oblast, was captured by Russian forces at the onset of the full-scale invasion due to its strategic importance.

On Feb. 24, 2022, two Russian warships attacked the island and told the Ukrainian border guards to surrender. One of the Ukrainian border guards famously responded, "Russian warship, go fuck yourself," a phrase which became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.

WNU Editor: The counteroffensive is not going well. In fact it is now a disaster. Hence the photo-op on Snake Island to divert everyone's attention.

Or about the population of both the territories controlled by the Ukrainian authorities before the start of the full-scale Russian aggression (the so-called 2022 borders) and the non-government-controlled lands? Or about the remaining population living on the territory controlled by the Ukrainian authorities after the start of the Russian full-scale invasion, and if so, in which month, since the current situation is highly unstable?

Reuters: Poland moves troops to eastern border amid Wagner fears

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Pentagon defends sending Ukraine cluster munitions 
Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl confirmed to reporters at a Pentagon briefing that the bomblet failure rate of the munitions being sent is above 1%, the export of which is banned by a 2009 law, but said the move did not break any laws as President Joe Biden has the authority to waive the limit. 
Kahl said he cared about the "humanitarian circumstance" given that civilians could be harmed from unexploded ordnance, "but the worst thing for civilians in Ukraine is for Russia to win the war. And so it's important that they don't."

Update: Biden Defends 'Difficult' Decision to Send Cluster Munitions to Ukraine (The Hill)

 
WNU Editor: During the Vietnam war there was phrase (true or not) that said the following .... "we had to destroy the village to save it".  Now we have a new phrase from the Pentagon .... ‘Russian victory’ worse than civilian cluster-bomb deaths. 
Not surprising. Russian media is having a field day with this quote .... ‘Russian victory’ worse than civilian cluster-bomb deaths – Pentagon  (RT). 
Ukraine has promised Washington that they will not use these cluster munitions against civilian targets. But Ukraine has been using cluster munitions against civilian targets in the Donbas for years. Check out two of Patrick Lancaster's reports on Ukraine's use of cluster bombs below. One from last year and one from eight years ago.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: China is restricting the export of two little-known metals crucial to the semiconductor industry. It shows Beijing still holds important chips in its tech war with the West. 
 * China will restrict the exports of gallium and germanium — metals vital to chipmaking — from August 1. 
 * Authorities said the move aims to "safeguard national security and interests." 
* The export curb is seen as a retaliatory move by Beijing amid a chip war with the West. 
China and the US are getting increasingly ensnared in a chip war that has escalated since October. 
A recent move by China to restrict the export of two little-known metals has again sent the semiconductor industry into a tailspin. 
In a Monday notice, China's commerce ministry and customs department said it plans to control the exports of two metals — gallium and germanium — along with several of their compounds from August 1 to "safeguard national security and interests."

(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden told Chinese President Xi Jinping following his meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin to "be careful" because Beijing relies on Western investment, according to excerpts from an interview with CNN. 
"I said: This is not a threat. This is an observation," Biden said. 
"Since Russia went into Ukraine, 600 American corporations have pulled out of Russia. And you have told me that your economy depends on investment from Europe and the United States. And be careful. Be careful."

Daily Mail: China been preparing for war with US for DECADES racing ahead while Army takes gender pronoun class 
* Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley shared concerns about China's military emphasizing that the country has been preparing for war for years
* Haley, former US ambassador to the UN, introduced a proposal to address China threat cautioning while country's military grows the US has become complacent 
* She has used her foreign policy stance and hardline stance on China as a way to differentiate herself in a crowded Republican field 
Nikki Haley has suggested China 'has been preparing for war' with the US as it has built up its military over the last few years. 
Haley said while China had been expanding its military presence America has been complacent and 'taking gender pronoun classes'. 
She outlined a like-for-like comparison of the two militarizes, noting how China had the world's largest naval fleet, with the US firmly in second place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When US superstar Taylor Swift announced yet more dates for her much-hyped world tour -- but once again skipped Canada -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could not shake it off.
In a tweet referencing the lyrics of Swift's songs, Trudeau urged her to fill the blank space and perform in America's neighbor to the north.
"It's me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you," Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. "So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon."
The artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.
She plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.
The bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer's lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.
Swift last came to Canada in 2018.]]></summary>

According to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index, the world's richest people added an average of $14 million per day to their wealth over the past six months, "the best half-year for billionaires since the back half of 2020, when the economy rebounded from a Covid-induced slump."
Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk saw the largest net worth boost of any global billionaire, adding nearly $97 billion in the first half of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, saw his wealth grow by close to $59 billion, the second-largest gain of any billionaire.

The app went live on Apple and Android app stores in 100 countries at 2300 GMT on Wednesday, and will run with no ads for now, but its release in Europe has been delayed over data privacy concerns.
Threads is the biggest challenger yet to Elon Musk-owned Twitter, which has seen a series of potential competitors emerge but not yet replace one of the world's biggest social media platforms, despite its struggles.
"10 million sign ups in seven hours," Zuckerberg wrote on his official Threads account Thursday.

"The figures we have 12 hours after the rescue work began are 29 people dead and 19 injured," Bernardo Rodriguez Alamilla said by telephone.
Images from the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle lying on its side at the bottom of a steep cliff as rescuers worked nearby.
Fifteen women died, two of them while receiving hospital care, as well as 13 men and a child, the prosecutor said.

Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on June 24, seized the command centre there where Russia coordinates its war in Ukraine, and sent a column of fighters towards Moscow before standing down after striking a deal with the Kremlin.
His mutiny posed the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin since the Russian leader came to power more than two decades ago and has forced the Kremlin to move into a damage-limitation exercise in which it has stressed the loyalty of the armed forces and the unit…]]></summary>

"The month was the warmest June globally at just over 0.5 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, exceeding June 2019 -– the previous record -– by a substantial margin," the EU monitor said in a statement from its C3S climate unit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey said the Hollywood actor grabbed him "like a cobra", a London court heard on Wednesday.
The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is the third of four men accusing Spacey of a string of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
The accuser said he met the US actor, who won Oscars for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", at an event in a West End theatre in 2005.
In a recording of a police interview played at Southwark Crown Court in south London, the man said Spacey "smelled of booze" and "looked disheveled" when he arrived.
"My first impression is that he seemed very arrogant," he added.
"I remember he looked me up and down and looked at my crotch region," the accuser said, adding that the actor made crude remarks towards him.
"It was very aggressive. I have never had anyone talk to me in that way. It was all getting hardcore," he said about the alleged comments.
The complainant said Spacey allegedly grabbed him "with such force it was really painful", describing it as "like a cobra coming out and getting hold".
"I remember freezing and pushing his arm away and feeling shellshocked and frustrated that anybody would be that sleazy," he added.
The accuser said he had initially put the incident "in a box" but it had "a detrimental effect" on his life.
The alleged victim criticized Spacey for coming out as gay several years ago when other allegations against him became public.
"He took no responsibility for it, he just said 'I'm gay'.
"He's still not hearing what he did was wrong –- that's sort of spurred me on a bit," the witness said.
The court has heard from two other complainants, one of whom said Spacey was an aggressive "predator" uncomfortable with his sexuality.
Another accuser alleged Spacey kissed his neck and grabbed his crotch.
The prosecution has described Spacey as a "sexual bully", whose preferred method of assault was grabbing other men in the crotch.
Spacey denies all the charges.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blondie drummer Clem Burke on Wednesday said adding drumming to the UK school curriculum could be a "game changer" for autistic children after a study found as little as 90 minutes a week offered benefits.
A study conducted as part of the Clem Burke Drumming Project found children with the condition who learned to play the drums showed better control of their emotions and fewer signs of hyperactivity, inattention and repetitive behavior.
"This landmark study is the first of its kind to show how the brain responds positively to drumming and how it can help children with autism and other social and emotional difficulties," said Burke.
"Given the pressure schools are currently facing trying to deal with a huge rise in the number of children experiencing social and emotional problems and learn…]]></summary>

At 90, Nokkho Konyak can barely see beyond a few feet, his facial tattoos marking him as a warrior are fading and his frail body needs support.
But his eyes light up and his hands become animated when he talks about "those simpler times".
"We witnessed our brave elders cutting off enemies' heads and participated in many battles," he told AFP.
Nokkho is a Konyak, a small but fierce and respected warrior community in northeastern India's Nagaland state.
The Konyaks were the last to give up the age-old practice of severing enemies' heads in this remote, hilly and densely forested region close t…]]></summary>

But now the 37-year-old is ready to take on anything thanks to an experimental Austrian scheme, which claims to be a world first in tackling long-term unemployment.
The village of Gramatneusiedl near Vienna now has a zero jobless rate after guaranteeing work to all its 129 long-term unemployed.
The project shows it is possible to eradicate this stubbornly difficult problem at a community level, said economist Oliver Picek of Vienna's Momentum Institute.
"It is possible to give a job to everyone who needs one," he told AFP.

The planned, decades-long discharge of accumulated water from the devastated nuclear facility has been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as meeting global standards.
Its chief Rafael Grossi acknowledged at a meeting in Iwaki, Fukushima prefecture, that concerns remain.
"All these complex graphs and statistics are one thing but the reality, the reality of people, the reality of the economy, the reality of the social mood and perceptions may be different," he told a meeting of residents and officials.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
