The crowd gathered in the city's Hyde Park railed against the proposal, which if it passes on October 14, would give Indigenous peoples the right to be consulted on policies that affect them, a measure dubbed the Voice.
"I'm here because I believe that everyone should be voting no. This Voice is causing so much division in the whole of Australia. And we don't need it," Faye Bevan, who attended the rally, told AFP.
Some protesters held signs with slogans such as "Vote no to the Voice of division" and "I don't trust the Voice, I'm voting no". Others carried placards referring to a range of conspiracy ideas, such as about human …]]></summary>

He addressed a joint meeting of the Canadian Parliament Friday following meetings in the United States, where he appealed for more weapons and rebuked Russia before the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. 
"Life and justice must prevail," Zelenskyy told the House of Commons in a speech that received at least a dozen standing ovations.

The fire, which began Friday evening and raged all night, injured more than 100 people, most of them workers, the Pingtung county government told local media.
One firefighter and three other people are missing.
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen visited the scene on Saturday morning and expressed condolences to the victims' families. She said an investigation into the cause of the tragedy is underway.
"I want to thank everyone for their hard work and please stay safe," Tsai told emergency response personnel.
She also stopped at the morgue to pay respects to the victims and visited the injured at a hospital.
An official with the Pingtung Fire Department told local media that chemical peroxide stored inside the factory could have been the cause of the one large and several smaller explosions.
Several people were trapped inside due to the blasts, which caused a section of the factory roof to collapse.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-23T11:53:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis on Saturday hammered home his message that European governments must do more to care for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, saying "those who risk their lives at sea do not invade, they look for welcome".
Closing a meeting of bishops and young people from around the Mediterranean in French port city Marseille, he added that migration is "a reality of our times, a process that involves three continents around the Mediterranean and that must be governed with wise foresight, including a European response".
The pope's remarks -- given in front of President Emmanuel Macron, whose government plans tougher measures to control migration -- follow his insistence on arrival in France Friday that "people who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued".
The way Europe addresses large numbers of arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa has shot up the political agenda since last week, when thousands of people landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa over just a few days.
The pope also appeared to weigh in on French domestic politics, targeting two of Macron's projects in assisted dying and inscribing the right to abortion in the constitution.
Old people risk being "pushed aside, under the false pretences of a supposedly dignified and 'sweet' death that is more 'salty' than the waters of the sea," Francis warned.
He also spoke of "unborn children, rejected in the name of a false right to progress, which is instead a retreat into the selfish needs of the individual".]]></summary>

President Joe Biden has told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the United States will provide a small number of long-range missiles to aid the war with Russia, three U.S. officials and a congressional official familiar with the discussions told NBC News on Friday. 
The officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, did not say when the missiles would be delivered or when a public announcement would be made. 
For months, Ukraine has asked for the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which would give Kyiv the ability to strike targets from as far away as about 180 miles, hitting supply lines, railways, and command and control locations behind the Russian front lines.

“There will be another Republican presidential debate coming up and that will give an opportunity for somebody to lead the pack.

“I don’t have high hopes that any of them will be able to do that much better than they did in the first presidential debate.”]]></summary>

“The Team Room” follows a fictional Special Forces ODA that deploys in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
 Green Beret veteran-turned-writer Bill Raskin has his first play premiering in Washington, DC, October 7-28 at The Keegan Theatre! “The Team Room” follows a fictional Special Forces ODA that deploys in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The production is running on a non-profit basis, and net proceeds will go the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. This non-profit mission has benefitted greatly from other SOF and SOF family leaders, including MG(Ret) Jim Linder and a cohort of retired SF NCOs who have mentored and advised our team of actors. Learn more and purchase tickets at the website below! Bill also welcomes any direct questions or outreach at chair@teamroomfoundation.org https://teamroomfoundation.org

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump's purported comments about not wanting "to see" a severely wounded veteran have ignited conservative pundits and experts alike who say the former president crossed a line.
Trump, who is said to have snarled about seeing a severely wounded veteran sing at an event held during his presidency at a military base, is now being called out on his alleged comments by Gen. Mark Milley.
Now, other conservatives are joining Milley in criticizing the former president.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Retired Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe said the incident reminds him "of the time Trump mocked a reporter with a physical disability and a speech impediment."
"Or when he dissed Senator McCain for having been captured in war and having endured torture," Tribe added. "Who revels in such cruelty? The Man Who Would Be King, that's who. No thank you!"
Conservative attorney and anti-Trump activist George Conway answered Tribe's question, saying, "Who is such a person? A malignant narcissist—a soulless, conscienceless, and morally bereft individual relentlessly driven by pathological levels of narcissism, sociopathy, sadism, and Machiavellinism."
In a separate post, Conway wrote, "There is no nice way to put it. P01135809 is pure scum," referring to Trump's assigned booking number from his recent arrest in Georgia.
Former GOP campaign consultant Rick Wilson also said, "Trump's loathing for an injured war hero speaks more volumes about his low, repulsive character than almost any of the other stories of his public or private behavior. I've read damn near every account of his degenerate, foul life, and this one still shocks."
Former Trump supporter David Weissman on Thursday added, "Trump continues to show his distain of American war heroes. This two time impeach and indicted a--hole is no patriot."]]></summary>

The United States has poured more than a hundred billion dollars into Ukraine's effort to repel Russia's invasion, spending far more than any other nation. 
But as President Volodymyr Zelensky comes to Washington to ask for more, there is growing Republican scepticism about funding the war effort. 
 In his Tuesday speech to the UN, Joe Biden made a passionate plea for the global community to not turn its back on Ukraine. 
"Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence," he said.
"But I ask you this: If we abandon the core principles of the United States to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they're protected?"

WNU Editor: The Ukraine sources that I trust are telling me that over half of this aid is now being lost due to corruption. It is almost as if everyone has come to the same realization that aid from the West is not going to be forthcoming as it has been in the past, and now is the best time to grab what you can before the spigot is turned off. 
I can speak personally on how rotten this corruption is. I am part of a group that helps to send needed drugs and medicines to Ukraine. Specifically it goes to my father's home town that is south of Kyiv. We always had some losses, but our last three shipments of vital supplies just disappeared.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
