DPA: Lavrov confirms Moscow's plans for regime change in Ukraine 
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said, in contrast to earlier statements, that Russia is seeking to overthrow the Ukrainian government. 
 "We will definitely help the Ukrainian people to free themselves from the regime that is absolutely anti-people and anti-history," Lavrov said in Cairo on Sunday. The Russian and Ukrainian people would live together in the future, he added.

WNU Editor: This is a major escalation on the part of Russia. It also tells me that the Kremlin has changed its war objectives and strategies, and will continue the war until the Zelensky government has been replaced by one that Russia will favor. 
Sighhh .... I know this is going to be a long war. Listening to Lavrov this evening only confirms my worst fears. 
The Ukraine government has responded .... "Regimes are something we find in Russian prisons": the Office of the President Presidential Office responds to Lavrov's statements (Ukrayinska Pravda).]]></summary>

Mr Cormann discussed the progress of the OECD's 'Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy'.

"Once you've got sizeable jurisdiction, like for example the European Union and a number of others, legislating for a global minimum tax ... it becomes self-defeating and counterproductive for other countries not to follow suit," Mr Cormann told Sky News Australia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: British spy chief says Russia is about to 'run out of steam' in Ukraine, opening the door for Ukrainian forces to 'strike back' 
* The UK's spy chief said Russia is likely to "run out of steam" in Ukraine soon. 
* He said this will give Ukraine an opportunity to strike back against invading forces. 
* Other military and Russia experts have offered similar assessments as the conflict morphs into a war of attrition. 
The Russian military offensive in Ukraine will likely lose momentum in the near future, offering Ukrainian forces an opportunity to "strike back," Richard Moore, chief of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), said on Thursday at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. 
"I think they're about to run out of steam," Moore said of the Russians. "They will have to pause in some way, and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back." 
Moore said that it's important for Ukrainian morale that they "demonstrate their ability to strike back."

MI6 head Richard Moore is also saying the Russian Army is exhausted. That may be true, but from what I am seeing it is the Ukraine Army that is looking exhausted.

Bussiness Insider: Zelenskyy says there's no point in negotiating with Russia until it gets 'smashed in the face' and all Ukrainian territories are liberated 
* Zelenskyy told WSJ that Ukraine can't agree to a ceasefire until it takes its territory back from Russia. 
* A ceasefire "means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest," Zelenskyy said. 
* He said Russia would just resume its offensive later on after regaining strength. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a new interview with The Wall Street Journal that establishing a ceasefire in the war with Russia while allowing it to maintain control of parts of Ukraine would result in a prolonged conflict.
"Freezing the conflict with the Russian Federation means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest," Zelenskyy said, adding, "They will not use this pause to change their geopolitics or to renounce their claims on the former Soviet republics." 
Zelenskyy said Russia would use a ceasefire to regain strength and then resume its offensive against Ukraine later on.

   Moon of Alabama: Ukraine Grain Exports - Myths And Reality  
A deal between Ukraine and Russia aims to ease the global food crisis. - New York Times - Jul 23, 2022       
BRUSSELS — Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement in Istanbul on Friday to free more than 20 million metric tons of grain stuck in blockaded Black Sea ports in Ukraine, a deal aimed at bringing down soaring grain prices and alleviating a mounting global hunger crisis. 
The highlighted claims are as false as much of the other NYT reporting on Ukraine.   
Ukraine grain exports reach 47.2 million tonnes so far for 2021-22 - World-Grain.com - Jun 6, 2022   
KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine has exported 148,000 tonnes of grain in the first five days of June, pushing its July to June 2021-22 marketing year total to 47.2 million tonnes, the country’s agriculture ministry said on June 6, Reuters reported. 
The ministry said the total volume included 18.578 million tonnes of wheat, 22.4 million tonnes of corn and 5.7 million tonnes of barley, with corn shipments dominating the June start, Reuters reported.     ...     Ukraine reached 54.9 million tonnes of wheat, corn and barley exports in 2019-2020, but dipped to 44.9 million tonnes in 2020-21, mostly on lower wheat production, according to the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Feb. 1 Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) quarterly report. 
Before Russia's invasion, Ukraine had been projected to export 63.7 million tonnes of the grains in 2021-22. 
The above numbers are more than 6 weeks old. Back then the difference between projected exports and exports up to June 5 was 63.7 - 47.2 = 16.5 million tons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce says the American people know "something is wrong" given US President Joe Biden's "many strange remarks". 

Ms Bruce said President Biden “has a history” of saying things “that are just not true”. 

“Here, we call it being a fabulist, which is not just exaggerating things, but adding stuff on to give yourself kind of a sense of bravado or charisma or an attempt to place yourself, almost like Zelig in ... every event that's ever happened,” Ms Bruce told Sky News Australia host James Morrow. 

“And it comes from a lack of self-esteem and also from perhaps a desire to manipulate.

“But the American people have seen this from him for 50 years.

“He’s not as smooth with it these days.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky News Australia host James Morrow says “the knives are well and truly out” in America as criticism mounts against President Biden and his administration. 

Mr Morrow said calls are growing in America that it is “time for Joe to go”. 

He also said the left in the US “still does get its marching orders from late-night tv”. 

“And what’s being said there? … well basically late-night tv is also saying it’s time for Joe to go,” Mr Morrow said.  

Mr Morrow said the "knives are well and truly out" in the "wake of the White House’s tepid action to fight for the only freedom the left cares about, no not freedom of speech or religion or self-defence – but to have an abortion".]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Missiles sent to Ukrainian troops could end up on black market as criminal gangs try to intercept Western supplies 
* Security source claims gangs are entering Ukraine and paying cash for weapons 
* Only the higher-grade systems of the military aid sent to Ukraine are tracked 
* Police fear that gangs, and even terrorists, could exploit the lack of oversight 
Criminal gangs are trying to intercept Western weapons supplies sent to Ukraine amid fears they will be sold on the black market, the Daily Mail can reveal. 
British anti-tank rockets are among an estimated £7billion of military aid to have flooded the country during recent months to help repel Russia’s invasion. 
Only the higher-grade systems are tracked, prompting police to fear gangs, and even terrorists, could exploit the lack of oversight which has seen equipment ‘disappear’.

WNU Editor: The Ukraine Defense Ministry is calling concerns of Western missiles ending up on the black market as an "artificial" concern .... Amid flow of weapons to Ukraine, DefMin says black market smuggling is ‘artificial’ concern (Breaking Defense). But after saying it is an "artificial" concern, Kyiv has set up a commission to monitor arms transfers .... Ukraine invites allies to check on their weapons donations (Politico). 
As to what is my take. 
To me it is a given that a portion of these Western weapons will find itself on the Black market. There is just too much money to be made.]]></summary>

KYIV (Reuters) - The United States promised more military support for Ukraine, including drones, and is doing preliminary work on whether to send fighter aircraft, as fighting raged on in the east of the country five months into Russia's invasion.
Moscow and Kyiv signed a landmark deal on Friday to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports. However, representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the agreement ceremony in Istanbul, reflecting wider enmity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Friday's agreement as unlocking around $10 billion worth of grain exports, needed to ease a food crisis.
But on the war, he said there could be no ceasefire unless lost territory was retaken.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombian President-elect Gustavo Petro on Friday met with representatives of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in Bogota, the Colombian capital, where they discussed topics including drug trafficking, the environment and economic development.
Petro, a 62-year-old economist who will become Colombia's first leftist leader next month, has been roundly critical of the U.S.-led war on drugs and was elected on promises to tackle deep inequality and climate change and to seek peace with remaining leftist rebels.
"This is a positive meeting because it shows the interest that exists in the government of the United States in Latin America and in Colombia," Petro told journalists, as he was accompanied by U.S. principal deputy nationa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Jakubonis attacked gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during his bail reform speech on Thursday. Jakuboniswas arrested and released hours later under the state's lenient bail laws 
  
Daily Mail: How can they let him out? Fury after military vet who tried to assassinate NY governor candidate Lee Zeldin with 'Made in USA' blade is still roaming free under state's lax bail laws as politician says he's ramped up security for remainder of campaign 
* Military veteran David Jakubonis, 43, was released without bail hours after he attacked Zeldin, who, fittingly, was giving a speech on bail reform 
* Jakubonis, 43, approached the candidate on Thursday and told him: 'Okay, you're done' 
* 'The suspect will likely be right back out on the street immediately,' Zeldin predicted after the attack 
* The suspect was quickly subdued by Marine Corps combat veteran Joe Chenelly 
* Photos from the scene show authorities recovered what appeared to be a set of brass knuckles with a sharp blade in the shape of a cat 
* New York's GOP chairman blamed Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul for the attack after her campaign posted details about Zeldin's event 
A man who attempted to stab US Rep. Lee Zeldin at a New York campaign rally on Thursday is still roaming free as the New York gubernatorial candidate said his ‘guard’ was completely down when he saw the attacker approach him wearing a veteran's hat. 
'The first thing I saw was that he was wearing a hat that says he was a veteran and the way that I'm wired when I see somebody wearing a hat that is a veteran - my guard couldn't possibly be more dropped,' Zeldin said at a Friday press conference.

U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hinted that the Pentagon expressed concern her plane "would get shot down" by the Chinese if she makes a rumored visit to Taiwan this summer. 
The California Democrat is planning a trip to the self-governing island next month, a report in the Financial Times earlier this week claimed, drawing an angry response from Beijing. 
Pelosi refused to confirm the trip during a weekly press conference Thursday, saying "I don't ever discuss my travel plans."  "You never even hear me say if I'm going to London, because it is a security issue," she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General's office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
"Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense," said the statement.
"Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime."
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira's heart -- as a motive for the killing.

When the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, won a landslide victory in May, 2022, he went to visit the home of his mother Imelda, former first lady and wife of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
In a video showing mother congratulating son, one detail in Imelda’s opulent home stood out. On the wall, was a distinctive painting of an abstract nude rendered in blues and greens, on a red and orange bed. It was unmistakably Pablo Picasso’s “Femme Couchée VI”.

Lustosa wears no specialized suit or gloves, however, just a light net to cover his face. These bees are stingless.

In addition, gaps are growing between the promised and received aid

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department issued two general licenses on Friday authorizing certain transactions related to Russia sanctions.
One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury's website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

Worst hit is expected to be Milan in the north with temperatures hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), while Bologna to its south and the capital Rome could hit 39 degrees, according to official government estimates.
Other major cities under a cautionary heatwave red alert for Friday and Saturday by Italy's health ministry include Florence, Genoa, Turin and Verona.
On Thursday, the city of Pavia, just south of Milan, broke a record with thermometers hitting 39.6 degrees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's nuclear regulator on Friday formally approved a plan to release more than a million tonnes of treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean.
The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO's plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the "reliability and transparency of its handling".
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
"For us they are part of the landscape," said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones "where there is fresh garbage," he added.

The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned "Iroojlaplap", or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a "Kailoojoj" in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.
The blowing of a conch shell heralded each stage of the elaborate ceremony, whic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.
Biden on Thursday insisted he was "doing great", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery," Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the "next ten days", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: "Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese."]]></summary>

Here is what we know about the deal:
Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.

In a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey the Duke of Sussex revealed that prior to the birth of their son, an unnamed family member asked what color baby Archie's skin would be. The Duchess said that there were "several conversations" but the Duke said “That conversation, I am never going to share. At the time, it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.”
She later explained that Harry wanted to stress that the comments did not come from his elderly grandparents.

Authorities say police are investigating the killings, the worst of a series of brutal cases of cruelty to dogs.
But they face criticism from animal welfare activists who say laws defending domestic animals like dogs are not being enforced.
The latest killings took place at an industrial compound near the capital Doha on July 10, but the slaughter was only reported days later, activists told AFP.
Four men, two armed with hunting rifles, threatened guards at the factory and then killed 29 dogs and puppies, activists said. At least three others were wounded, including two in the late stages of pregnancy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of "I take care of Mexico," an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the "seriousness of the injuries" in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
"We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women's human rights and fight against gender-based violence," UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor's behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son's health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
"You're going to die," and "I'm going to burn you alive," the messages read.
"How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family," she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.]]></summary>

This indicator is called the yield curve, and it is a way of showing how the interest rates of various US government bonds compare., including three-month treasury bills and two- and ten-year treasury bills.
Usually, bond investors expect to be paid more for tying up their money for a long time, so interest rates on short-term bonds are lower than those on longer-term bonds.  Plotted on a graph, the different bond yields create an upward sloping line – the curve. 


But from time to time, short-term rates exceed long-term rates.  This negative relationship distorts the curve into what is called an inversion and signals that the norm…]]></summary>
