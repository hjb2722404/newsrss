CNN: Taiwan reports record incursion by Chinese bomber aircraft  
Hong Kong CNN  — China has sent a record 18 nuclear-capable H-6 bomber aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense zone, the island’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, as Beijing continues to step-up pressure on the self-ruled island. 
The 18 bombers were part of 21 total Chinese warplanes sent into Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone – a buffer of airspace commonly referred to as an ADIZ – in the 24-hour span between Monday morning and Tuesday morning, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. 
The ministry said it monitored the situation and employed its fighter jets as well as land-based missile systems to track the Chinese planes. 
The flights represent the largest number of H-6 sorties in a 24-hour period since Taipei began releasing daily data on Chinese fighter incursions in 2020.

New Delhi CNN  — Indian and Chinese troops have clashed on their disputed Himalayan border, the first known incident between the two nuclear-armed Asian powers in nearly two years. 
In a statement, India’s Ministry of Defense said soldiers from both sides sustained minor injuries in the face-off, which took place Friday in the Tawang Sector in India’s northeastern territory of Arunachal Pradesh, a remote, inhospitable region that borders southern China. 
The 2,100 mile-long (3,379-kilometer) disputed border has long been the source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing, with tensions escalating sharply in June 2020 when hand-to-hand fighting between the two sides resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers in Aksai Chin-Ladakh.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2022
   Daily Mail: Twitter banned Trump when 'activist' employees compared him to Hitler and Head of Policy said his term 'American Patriots' could be 'coded' as an incitement - despite execs saying he did NOT violate policy and while dictators could keep accounts 
* Part Five of the so-called Twitter Files dropped Monday afternoon 
* It details Twitter's decision to indefinitely ban Donald Trump, who was president at the time, from the platform  
* Internal correspondence shows those assigned to evaluate Trump's tweets didn't see proof of incitement of the Capitol riot 
* That didn't stop for massive internal calls to ban the president from Twitter   Twitter decided to indefinitely ban Donald Trump two days after the January 6 Capitol attack when rank-and-file employees compared him to Adolf Hitler and a terrorist leader - even though senior staff said said he didn't violate policy. 
The latest revelations of the platform's actions taken against the former president and conservative voices were detailed in the fifth installment of the Twitter files published on Monday afternoon. 
Journalist Bari Weiss shared internal messaging showing some staffers for the social media platform were concerned of the negative repercussions of banning Trump, including allegations of censorship.

But spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "we hope the president will after all find an opportunity to talk" to the media.

WNU Editor: I did not expect an annual year-end news conference this year. The Kremlin and everyone else is Russia is totally focused on the Ukraine war right now. A 5-6 hour marathon news conference on topics that would mostly not cover the war makes no sense at this moment in time.

Now that disgraced financier Sam Bankman-Fried has been charged with defrauding investors out of $1.8billion and is awaiting extradition back to the US from The Bahamas, speculation is turning now to whether or not his CEO ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison will turn on him or also face charges too.   
Bankman-Fried, 30, was arrested in The Bahamas last night at the request of prosecutors from the US Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York. He is now also facing charges from the SEC.  
He is accused of stealing the money his investors plugged into FTX - his now defunct crypto trading platform - to cushion his own investment fund, Alameda. He used the money to buy lavish properties in The Bahamas and make political donations that some say went as high as $1billion.

Ipsos survey for Halifax International Security Forum finds 73% of people, on average, across 33 countries expect in the next 25 years we could see another world conflict involving superpowers similar to World Wars I & II.  The invasion of Ukraine seems to have global citizens feeling on edge. As new Ipsos polling conducted on behalf of the Halifax International Security Forum finds almost three in four (73%) agree we could see a worldwide conflict like last century’s major military confrontations. 
Of the more than 32,000 people surveyed, an average of 73% somewhat/strongly agree with the statement: “I expect in the next 25 years we could see another world conflict involving superpowers similar to World Wars 1 & 2”, up 10 percentage points since last year. Australia (+8 points to 81%), Ireland (80%, new this year), Mexico (+8 pts to 80%) and Peru (+3 pts to 80%) are the countries where people are most concerned with worldwide conflict breaking out. Concern rose significantly, but is lowest in Japan (+16 pts to 51%), Sweden (+11 pts to 60%), Germany (+17 pts to 63%) and Indonesia (63%, new).

Daily Mail: The ticking border time bomb: 1,000 migrants in the largest caravan in HISTORY crosses the Rio Grande into El Paso - with huge numbers being released onto the streets and just nine days until Title 42 ends 
* A group of 1,000 migrants crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas on Sunday night  
* It is possibly the largest single caravan so far to cross into the U.S. from Mexico 
* Migrants are mostly from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua 
* Comes just nine days before the expiration of Title 42, which allowed immediate expulsion of asylum-seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic 
* Before the mass migration over the weekend, Mexican police escorted nearly 20 buses full of migrants into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico 
More than 1,000 migrants streamed across the southern border into Texas on Sunday night in a dire indication of the chaos to come when Title 42 comes to an end in just nine days. 
The group from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua - possibly the largest in history - ran across the Rio Grande into El Paso, where local officials are releasing hundreds of migrants back onto the streets and border officials are bracing for a surge in crossers. 
Footage shows the migrants wading through the water carrying belongings and then waiting in line on the river's bank to be processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.

A large package containing around $40 million in cash for "humanitarian aid" was seen on an airport tarmac in Afghanistan, officials there said last week. 
The money was handed over to the Da Bank of Afghanistan, the Taliban-controlled central bank of Afghanistan, which is headquartered in Kabul. 
The bank tweeted several images of the cash.   One shows packages of U.S. $100 notes bound in plastic, boxed and bagged in an airport.

And it would enhance Japan’s conventional deterrent as China undertakes a sweeping military modernization and North Korea barrels ahead with its nuclear program.

TOKYO – China’s hegemonic moves are described as “the greatest strategic challenge” Japan faces in a draft of the National Security Strategy (NSS), which is set to be revised in mid-December. 
The government submitted the draft to a working team of the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito on Wednesday.  The current NSS, formulated in 2013, refers to China as “an issue of concern for the international community.” 
The description of China as a “challenge” in the draft reflects Japan’s position of seeking “constructive and stable relations” with Beijing while expressing utmost caution.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Japan needs to increase its military spending in the face of the "grim reality" of the threat from China and North Korea, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party said on Sunday during a visit to Taiwan. 
Although Chinese-claimed and democratically-governed Taiwan and Japan do not have formal diplomatic ties, they have close unofficial relations and both share concerns about China, especially its increased military activities near the two. 
Koichi Hagiuda, the LDP's policy chief and a former industry minister, said during a visit to Taipei that since World War Two Japan has "walked the path of peace" and that path will not change in the future.

   Moon Of Alabama: U.S. No Longer Supports Fight For Crimea 
The U.S. seems to have changed its position with regards to Crimea.  Blinken in August 2022:      Secretary Antony Blinken @SecBlinken - 16:46 UTC · Aug 23, 2022 
United States government official 
In my remarks to the Crimea Platform Summit, I urged the international community to keep raising the costs and pressure on President Putin and his enablers until all Russian troops leave Ukraine. Crimea is Ukraine. That was our position in 2014, and it remains in 2022.     Embedded video 
Same dude, yesterday: 
Secretary Antony J. Blinken With Editor in Chief Matt Murray At The Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit 
SECRETARY BLINKEN: Our focus is on continuing to do what we’ve been doing, which is to make sure that Ukraine has in its hands what it needs to defend itself, what it needs to push back against the Russian aggression, to take back territory that’s been seized from it since February 24th, to make sure as well that it has the support economically and on a humanitarian basis to withstand what’s happening in the country every single day. That’s our focus.

WNU Editor:I would not read too much on US Secretary of State Blinken's one remark on Crimea last week. But if it is repeated again. Yeah. It is a major change in the US position on Crimea.]]></summary>

Reuters: Saudi Foreign Minister: 'All Bets Off' if Iran Gets Nuclear Weapon 
DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Sunday that Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours would act to shore up their security if Tehran were to obtain nuclear weapons. 
Indirect U.S.-Iranian talks to salvage a 2015 nuclear pact between global powers and Iran, which Washington exited in 2018, stalled in September. 
The U.N. nuclear chief has voiced concern over a recent announcement by Tehran that it was boosting enrichment capacity. 
"If Iran gets an operational nuclear weapon, all bets are off," Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said in an on-stage interview at the World Policy Conference in Abu Dhabi when asked about such a scenario.
"We are in a very dangerous space in the region...you can expect that regional states will certainly look towards how they can ensure their own security."

Politico: Erdoğan warns Greece that Turkish missiles can reach Athens  
'If you don’t stay calm, … a country like Turkey will not be a bystander,’ Turkey’s president says. 
ATHENS — Turkey warned Greece that a missile could hit the Greek capital unless “you stay calm,” further escalating its rhetoric against Greece.
“Now we have started to make our own missiles,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said during a speech on Sunday in Samsun, in northern Turkey. “Of course, this production scares the Greeks. When you say ‘Tayfun,’ the Greek gets scared and say, ‘It will hit Athens.’ Well, of course it will.” 
Tayfun, which is Turkish for “typhoon” is a short-range ballistic missile developed by Turkey. The missile, which was test-fired in October over the Black Sea and hit a target at a distance of about 560 kilometers, a range more than double that of the current missiles in Turkey’s arsenal.

There were indications on Thursday night that Ukrainian forces were getting closer to the city of Kherson, a port at the mouth of the Dnipro River, said a Ukrainian military analyst and a media commentator.
It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

"A new international treaty that addresses autonomous weapons systems needs a more appropriate forum for negotiations."
The 40-page report, which was co-published with Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic, posits that "rather than accepting continuing stagnation" while trying to reach a deal within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), proponents of a legally binding instrument for banning killer robots should try something new.

The new rule, introduced this week, further squeezes women out of an ever-shrinking public space that already sees them banned from traveling without a male escort and forced to wear a hijab or burqa whenever out of the home. 
Schools for teenage girls have also been shut for over a year across most of the country.
"For the past 15 months, we tried our best to arrange and sort it out -- and even specified the days," said Mohammad Akif Sadeq Mohajir, spokesman for the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia ordered its troops to withdraw from the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday in a further major blow to its campaign amid a Ukrainian counter-offensive.
"Begin to pull out troops," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia's commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its "special military operation" and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow's forces since the offensive began on February 24.
Ukraine's troops have for weeks been capturing villages en route to the city near the Black Sea and Kremlin-installed leaders in Khers…]]></summary>

The elite Russian soldiers expressed their anger in an open letter published on Sunday, prompting the ministry of defense's response about the human cost for Russia of the "special military operation" in Ukraine.

Soldiers of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade broke their silence following a particularly harsh battle not far from the city of Donetsk in the Donbas region. "As a result of the 'carefully' planned offensive by the 'great commanders', we lost about 300 people [..] 50 percent of vehicles," write the authors of the open letter, which was widely shared on Telegram, the main communication app used by Russian military and political …]]></summary>

Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
