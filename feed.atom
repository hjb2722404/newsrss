Access the article HERE.

Excerpt:

I have been waiting my whole career for authorities to focus on north Korea. We will get permissions though?

US policy toward Taiwan is all about “strategic ambiguity.” That means every trip and remark has to be just right.
 How reckless can a trip to Taiwan be? 
For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, potential travel plans have already caused a domestic political debate and a minor foreign policy fracas.
Pelosi began a multi-stop tour of Asia Monday with a visit to Singapore. And while Taiwan remains off her delegation’s official itinerary, US and Taiwanese officials told CNN she is expected to visit the island. That’s despite fears that China, antagonized by a senior American representative planning to travel …]]></summary>

President Joe Biden called Monday on Russia and China to enter nuclear arms control talks, saying that Moscow in particular has a duty to show responsibility after its invasion of Ukraine.
In a statement, the U.S. leader reiterated that his administration is ready to "expeditiously negotiate" a replacement to New START, the treaty capping intercontinental nuclear forces in the United States and Russia, which is set to expire in 2026. 
 "Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control," Biden said.

Update: Biden offers talks with Russia (RT) 
WNU Editor: The White House statement is here .... President Biden Statement Ahead of the 10th Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (White House). 
My prediction is that these talks are not going to happen.  The U.S. is currently involved in an indirect war with Russia over Ukraine, and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is about to land in Taiwan thereby breaking the U.S. commitment to a one China policy. Arms control talks are not on Beijing's and Moscow's agenda right now.
 Update #2: Puzzlement is not the word that I would use .... Russia puzzled by Biden proposal to replace nuclear arms treaty (Reuters). From what I am seeing, reading, and hearing on Russian media, they are treating this proposal as a joke.]]></summary>

 Nikkei: U.S. deploys ships and planes near Taiwan as Pelosi eyes visit 
TOKYO -- The U.S. military is moving assets, including aircraft carriers and large planes, closer to Taiwan ahead of an anticipated but unconfirmed visit to the island by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
The military was initially opposed to the speaker's visit but now looks to be creating a buffer zone for Pelosi's plane, in case she decides to go ahead with the controversial stop. 
But with China declaring that it would "never sit idly by" if she were to visit the island, tensions in East Asia have quickly escalated, perhaps against the will of both U.S. President Joe Biden, who was seeking to remove some tariffs on Chinese goods to counter inflation, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who faces a sensitive political season at home with his rule extension on the line.
A reporter for local network TVBS tweeted that the speaker is expected to arrive in Taiwan on Tuesday evening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“When Mrs. Carroll makes her first entrance,” wrote Frank Rich in The Times, “a nervous silence descends on the audience of the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger here, as hundreds of eyes search for a trace of the woman whom they’ve seen in a thousand TV reruns. What they find instead is a Falstaff who might have come out of a formal painted portrait: a balding, elderly knight with tufts of silver hair and mustaches. sparse, a huge belly, rosy cheeks and squinting frog eyes peering through boozy mists.The sight is so eerie that you cling to your seat.
“You realize,” Mr. Rich continued, “that it is the character of Shakespeare, and not a parody of camp, that is being served.”
Patricia Ann Carroll was born May 5, 1927 in Shreveport, Louisiana and grew up in Los Angeles.  Her father, Maurice, worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Electricity;  his mother, Kathryn (Meagher) Carroll, worked in real estate and office management.
Ms Carroll attended the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles on an English scholarship, but left before she graduated.  “I realized what I was learning wasn’t going to advance what I wanted to do,” she said in 2011. “I always thought experience was the best preparation.”
In 1947, Ms. Carroll left Los Angeles for Plymouth, Mass., where she worked at the Priscilla Beach Theater and, she said, ate, drank and breathed the theater.  She made her professional stage debut there that year in “A Goose for the Gander”, with Gloria Swanson.  Soon after, she traveled to New York, where, among other odd jobs, she shined shoes.

Families in Padangbai are sending off 117 deceased. They were previously buried in a public cemetery, not far from the cremation site. 

Cremation is usually held by individual families, but the mass ceremony eases the burden of cost. Some families waited for more than five years for the cremation. 

The Hindu rites on Friday started in the morning as the residents paraded bade, a 6-meter (20-foot) wooden tower carrying bodies and a coffin in the shape of Gajah Mina, an elephant-headed fish, to the sea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a late-night televised address, Zelenskiy also said the hundreds of thousands of people still in combat zones in the larger Donbas region needed to leave.
	

		"The more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill," he said, adding that residents would be given compensation.
	

		Separately, domestic Ukrainian media outlets quoted Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk as saying the evacuation needed to take place before winter begins since the region's natural gas supplies had been destroyed.
	

		Zelenskiy said hundreds of thousands of people were still living in areas of Donbas where fighting was fierce.
	

		"Many refuse to leave, but it still needs to be done," he said. "If you have the opportunity, please talk to those who still remain in the combat zones in Donbas. Please convince them that it is necessary to leave."

The day before they left, two of the deceased, Robbie Phillips, 65, a travel consultant who was actually one of Sandals’ top salespeople, and her husband, Michael, 68, checked themselves into a medical facility complaining of nausea and vomiting, according to local authorities.  Donnis Chiarella, 65, who was staying on the other side of the wall, also visited a clinic, his son told ABC News.  All returned to their adjacent beachfront villas, where the Phillips and Ms Chiarella’s husband Vincent, 64, were found unresponsive the next morning according to local authorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NORTH AUGUSTA, SC — As LeBron James sat in a folding chair in the corner of a basketball court at a recreation center last week, he often appeared to be in an agitated state.
There was James, sneaking onto the pitch repeatedly to check the scoreboard and the clock above him.  Or chew an apple and dig into a gallon-sized bag of nuts.  Or pleading, “Come on, ref,” when a call wasn’t to his liking.
He stood up to whisper instructions to his son, who nodded sharply as he passed the ball inbounds along the baseline.  James entered the pitch at half-time – first to give advice to the coach of the travel ball team he sponsors, Strive for Greatness, then to fire off some left-handed shots, prompting many in the crowded stands to pull out their cellphones.  to save the exercise.

"I don't think I can go at the same pace as I used to travel," said the 85-year-old pope, who suffers pain in his knee that has seen him increasingly reliant on a wheelchair.
"I think that at my age and with this limitation, I have to save myself a little bit to be able to serve the Church. Or, alternatively, to think about the possibility of stepping aside."
It is not the first time Francis has raised the possibility of following the example set by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who quit over his own failing health in 2013, and is now living quietly in Vatican City.

Pelosi, number three in the U.S. line of presidential succession, after Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, signalled on Friday she was embarking on a trip to Asia.
She did not mention Taiwan, but speculation of her visiting the democratically ruled island, claimed by Beijing, has intensified in recent days, fuelling tensions beyond the Taiwan Strait.
Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Biden in a phone call on Thursday that Washington should abide by the one-China principle and "those who play with fire will perish by it."

The declaration came a day after Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of bombing a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian-held territory, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying more than 50 were killed and calling the attack a war crime.
"Today, Gazprom suspended its gas supplies to Latvia... due to violations of the conditions" of purchase, the company said on Telegram.
Gazprom drastically cut gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline on Wednesday to about 20 percent of its capacity.

David Diaz of the Spanish oceanographic institute told Le Monde such ocean heatwaves were "the equivalent of underwater wildfires, with fauna and flora dying just as if they had been burned."
The region has suffered an extreme heatwave this month, producing record air temperatures and low winds, causing a significantly hotter and deeper layer of ocean surface water.
As Reuters reported, "The warmer air along with shifting ocean currents and a stable sea surface have warmed coastal Mediterranean waters several degrees Celsius beyond the average temperature of 24°C to 26°C for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Saturday outlined a draft referendum question in a bid to change the constitution to set up a representative Indigenous body in parliament.
Australia's constitution currently does not recognize Indigenous peoples, and the move to enshrine a so-called "voice" -- a consultative body to supply advice to the government on decisions that would impact the marginalized group -- in the document would require a nationwide referendum.
Speaking at an Indigenous festival in Arnhem Land -- home to a majority Indigenous population -- centre-left leader Albanese proposed a draft referendum question to the Australian public: "Do you support an alteration to the Constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice?"
Albanese -- elected in May -- had promised a referendum vote to be held before the end of his term in 2025.
It remains unclear how the referendum will take shape but proposing the draft question to Aboriginal Australian leaders and the public would be a first step.
He also on Saturday recommitted to the "Uluru Statement from the Heart", which called for improved rights and constitutional recognition for Australia's First Nations people.
The 2017 statement was rejected by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's conservative government.
But Albanese said the Uluru statement is "about consulting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on the decisions that affect you, nothing more, but nothing less".
"This is simple courtesy. It is common decency," he added.
"It recognizes the centuries of failure... the failure to ask the most basic human question: how would I feel if this were done to me?"
Australia has long failed to close the gap between the health and wellbeing of its First Nations people and the rest of the population, with soaring incarceration rates among Indigenous peoples and a life expectancy about eight years lower than the national average.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden's administration tried Friday to defuse heated Chinese warnings against a possible trip to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as Beijing announced live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait.
Pelosi is reportedly about to leave on an Asian tour that would include Taiwan -- although she pointedly refused to confirm Friday that she would visit the self-ruled island citing travel security considerations.
China sees any such stop by the speaker as a provocation, upsetting the tense status quo under which Washington formally recognizes China's sovereignty claim over the island -- while backing the democratic Taiwanese government.
"We have many differences when it comes to Taiwan, but over the past 40-plus years, we have managed those differences and done it in a way…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ZURICH (Reuters) - Austrian leaders appealed for national unity after a doctor who faced death threats from anti-vaccination activists and coronavirus pandemic conspiracy theorists took her own life.
"Let's put an end to this intimidation and fear mongering. Hate and intolerance have no place in our Austria," President Alexander Van der Bellen said, hailing Lisa-Maria Kellermayr as a doctor who stood for healing people, protecting them from disease and taking a cautious approach to the pandemic.
"But some people have been enraged by this. And these people scared her, threatened her, first on the internet and then also in person, directly in her practice."
The body of the doctor -- who had often given media interviews about fighting the coronavirus pandemic and promoting vaccinations -- was found in her office in Upper Austria on Friday.
Media cited prosecutors as saying they had found a suicide note and were not planning an autopsy.
Austria last month dropped plans to introduce compulsory COVID-19 vaccination for adults, saying it was unlikely that the measure would raise one of western Europe's lowest vaccination rates.
Tens of thousands of people had marched in regular protests against lockdowns last year and plans to make vaccinations mandatory, highlighting a social divide over public health measures that many countries have experienced.
But the doctor's death -- which the Austrian physicians' association said reflected a broader trend of threats against medical staff -- shocked the country.
"Hatred against people is inexcusable. This hatred must finally stop," Health Minister Johannes Rauch said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Maher Nazih
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Shi'ite populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed Baghdad's fortified government zone on Saturday for the second time in a week, escalating a political stand-off that is hitting ordinary Iraqis hardest.
Protesters rallied by Sadr and his social-political Sadrist Movement tore down concrete barriers and entered the Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions, heading for Iraq's parliament, a Reuters witness said.
The scenes followed similar protests on Wednesday, although this time several protesters and police officers were hurt as Sadr's supporters threw stones and police fired teargas and stun grenades, according to security officials and medics.
Sadr's party came first in a general election in October but he withdrew his lawmakers from parliament when he failed to form a government which excluded his Shi'ite rivals, mostly groups backed by Iran.
Sadr has since made good on threats to stir up popular unrest if parliament tries to approve a government he does not like, saying it must be free of foreign influence and the corruption that has plagued Iraq for decades.
The Sadrists chanted against Sadr's political rivals who are now trying to form a government. Iraq has been without a president and prime minister for a record period because of the deadlock.
Sadr maintains large state power himself because his movement remains involved in running the country - his loyalists sit in powerful positions throughout Iraqi ministries and state bodies.
Iraqis linked neither to Sadr nor to his opponents say they are caught in the middle of the political gridlock.
While Baghdad earns record income from its vast oil wealth, the country has no budget, regular power and water cuts, poor education and healthcare, and insufficient job opportunities for the young.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China accused the United States of double standards at the United Nations on Friday for challenging Beijing's sovereignty over Taiwan while emphasizing the principle of sovereignty for Ukraine after Russian forces invaded.
A day after Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned U.S. President Joe Biden in a phone call against playing with fire over Taiwan, deputy U.N. Ambassador Geng Shuang reinforced the message during a meeting on Ukraine at the 15-member U.N. Security Council.

The man, a volunteer fireman from the Herault region, was arrested on Wednesday, regional prosectors said.
The case of the man dubbed in media as the "pyromaniac fireman" has sparked a keen interest in France, which was shocked by a swathe of wildfires in last week's heatwave that forced the evacuation of thousands of people.
Montpellier prosecutor Fabrice Belargent said in a statement that the man had admitted staring fires with a lighter on May 26, July 21 and most recently over the night of July 26-27.

The 85-year-old pontiff was set to make a speech first in Quebec City before traveling to the vast northern territory's capital, Iqaluit, which means "the place of many fish."
There, he will first meet with survivors of the residential school system -- which saw Indigenous children separated from their families, language and culture in a bid to stamp out their identity -- before appearing at a public event hosted by the Inuit.
"It's not going to solve anything, but an apology to the world, it means a lot to us. It does," Iqaluit stay-at-home mother Elisapee Nooshoota, 36, told AFP …]]></summary>
