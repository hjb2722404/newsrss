        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New Hampshire Democratic Party's office in Belknap County was hit with antisemitic vandalism and a swastika sometime this Thursday, NBC News reported. 
According to reports, a flyer claiming the Jews were responsible for 9/11 was placed on an outside window along with a swastika. Also found was an image of a Star of David with a knife through it. 
"Hate crimes and civil rights violations have no place in New Hampshire," said a spokesperson for Attorney General John Formella. "The attorney general’s office is committed to working with our local, state, and federal partners to identify these acts and their perpetrators and to pursuing action to the fullest extent possible."

In a post to X, Rep. Chris Pappas, D-(NH) wrote, "I’m thinking of all my friends in Laconia tonight. This antisemitic vandalism is part of a surge in hateful attacks on the Jewish community across the country. There is simply no place for bigotry and hate in our society, and we must speak with one voice to condemn it."
As NBC News points out, the incident comes as law enforcement agencies report a significant spike in antisemitic hate crimes around the country.]]></summary>

The transcript includes bin Laden's assertion that the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001 due to its support of Israel.
Links to the original were replaced on the Guardian website with a statement saying it had been shared "without the full context".

        <updated>2023-11-16T16:26:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 100 people, including 16 children, have died and over 700,000 been forced out of their homes in the Horn of Africa due to flash flooding, the British charity Save the Children said Thursday.
The region, particularly Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, has been lashed by unrelenting downpours since the beginning of the month due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, inundating homes and farmland.
About 46 people had died in Kenya, 32 in Somalia and another 33 in Ethiopia, Save the Children said, warning the rains were "showing no signs of slowing down".
The Horn of Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events are occurring with increased frequency and intensity.
The region is emerging from the worst drought in four decades after multiple failed rainy seasons that left millions of people in need and devastated crops and livestock.
"Heavy flooding and displacement have cut off families and children from basic services including access to food, healthcare, water and hygiene services," said Xavier Joubert, Ethiopia director for Save the Children.
"With that comes the real risk of waterborne diseases including cholera and measles."
Humanitarian groups have warned that the situation is only likely to worsen and called for urgent global intervention as El Nino is expected to last until at least April 2024.
El Nino is typically associated with increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere.
Between October 1997 and January 1998, devastating floods caused by El Nino led to more than 6,000 deaths in five Horn of Africa countries.
At least 1,800 people died in Somalia where the Juba River burst its banks.
At the end of 2019, 265 people died and tens of thousands were displaced during two months of relentless rainfall in several countries in East Africa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A grandson of French war hero and former president Charles de Gaulle said Thursday he wanted Russian citizenship, saying Russia offered “great possibilities”.
Pierre de Gaulle is little known in France, but Russian state media have heralded his pro-Kremlin statements as proof that leading Western voices support Moscow’s assault in Ukraine.
“It would be an honour for me to acquire Russian citizenship,” he told a journalist at the Saint Petersburg Cultural Forum, Russian agencies said.
He also said that Russia was “fighting for traditional values, the family and spirituality” in Ukraine and that “NATO had lost”.
This is not the first time the previously obscure scion of France’s most famous political family has made waves.
Yves de Gaulle, his eldest brother, told Le Parisien daily in January that his sibling’s views “concern no one else other than himself – not me, not our family and even less the general.”
Charles de Gaulle headed the French resistance movement from London during World War II, before returning triumphantly to France.

As president, he positioned France as a hinge between the US-dominated Western bloc and the Soviet Union during the Cold War – a position that his grandson claims to represent. 
But historians agree de Gaulle also kept France firmly anchored in the Western alliance. His views are a source of debate in France, particularly when applied to contemporary events.

* USS Thomas Hudner shot down a drone launched from Yemen in the Red Sea 
* Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have targeted Israel and US forces 
* It is the latest in a wave of drone and missile attacks on US troops in the region 
The USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, shot down a drone launched from Yemen while operating in the Red Sea on Wednesday. 
A Pentagon official told DailyMail.com that the Hudner’s crew 'engaged and shot down the drone to ensure the safety of US personnel,' adding that there were no US casualties or any damage to the ship. 
The official confirmed that the drone originated in Yemen and was heading toward the ship, which was operating in international waters. It's unclear whether the drone was armed or how close it came to the ship before being shot down.

MOSCOW, (Reuters) -Russia's rocket forces loaded an intercontinental ballistic missile equipped with the nuclear-capable "Avangard" hypersonic glide vehicle into a launch silo in southern Russia, according to a defence ministry TV channel broadcast on Thursday. 
President Vladimir Putin announced the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle in 2018, saying it was a response to U.S. development of a new generation of weapons and a U.S. missile defence system that it could penetrate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major oil and gas companies such as Aramco, ExxonMobil and Shell could have paid for their share of the damage caused by climate change and still earned trillions of dollars in profit, researchers said on Thursday.
Their conclusions were released ahead of the UN's COP28 climate negotiations later this month in Dubai, where developing countries not responsible for most carbon emissions are expected to push for governments and firms to pay more for their role in global warming.
If the top 25 oil and gas companies had been held accountable for their role in global warming in recent decades, they would still have made $10 trillion dollars in profit, according to the report published by think tank Climate Analytics.
The estimated damage caused by carbon emissions from the 25 companies cost $20 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[China is "ready to be a partner and friend of the United States," President Xi Jinping told US business leaders on Wednesday, as concerns mount over the country's slowing economy.
If one country sees the other as a main competitor and most consequential geopolitical challenge, "this will only lead to wrong policymaking, misguided actions and unwanted results," he told a dinner on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.
Xi's remarks in San Francisco came hours after his highly anticipated talks with US President Joe Biden, where both men pledged to reduce tensions as they met for the first time in a year.
The two sides announced a host of agreements after talks at the luxury Filoli Estate, starting with the reactivation of a high-level military hotline.

Scientific American: Who Would Take the Brunt of an Attack on U.S. Nuclear Missile Silos?

 
These fallout maps show the toll of a potential nuclear attack on missile silos in the U.S. heartland 
 Last March the U.S. Air Force released a two-volume, 3,000-plus-page report detailing the environmental impact of its plans to replace all 400 “Minuteman” land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with new “Sentinel” missiles by the mid-2030s. The program is part of a $1.5-trillion effort to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal and its command-and-control infrastructure. The report, required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, covers the “potential effects on the human and natural environments from deployment of the Sentinel system” and from, among other things, the refurbishing of existing missile silos and the construction of new utility corridors and communications towers. But it doesn't mention the most significant risks to surrounding communities—namely, what happens if these missiles, which are intended to serve as targets for enemy nuclear weapons, are ever attacked.

Woodside, California CNN  — US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he still believes Chinese President Xi Jinping is a dictator, even as the two leaders made progress in their relationship during a meeting outside San Francisco. 
“Well, look, he’s a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is a communist country that’s based on a form of government totally different than ours,” Biden told CNN’s MJ Lee. “Anyway, we made progress.” 
When asked about Biden’s latest comment at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday, a spokesperson called it “extremely erroneous” and an “irresponsible political maneuver, which China firmly opposes.”

* Israeli soldiers stormed the sprawling al-Shifa hospital early on Wednesday 
* They claimed on Wednesday afternoon to have found weapons within the facility 
Israel claimed to have found military equipment and 'terror infrastructure' during their search of Gaza's largest hospital today. 
'We have discovered weapons and other things. We entered the hospital on the basis of actionable intelligence,' Mark Regev, an advisor to the Israeli Prime Minister announced on Wednesday after nearly a week spent encircling the facility. 
The news broke as Israeli troops finally began to withdraw from the beleaguered hospital, according to a journalist trapped inside. Israel alleges that al-Shifa is sat on top of a secret underground Hamas base, claims Hamas and the hospital deny.

 Ishaan Tharoor, Washington Post: Xi and Biden meet amid a fracturing world order 
 There’s a lot riding on the meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two convene at a summit of Pacific rim nations on Wednesday. Both leaders will face each other after months of tensions and anticipation. There have been angry barbs tossed over the future of Taiwan and stealthy balloons sent over the North American landmass. Beijing fulminates over a legacy of U.S. global “hegemony” and styles itself as a champion of a different kind of international order. The Biden administration, much like its right-wing predecessor, sees a rising China as the main 21st-century challenge to the United States on the world stage, and has sought to organize both its domestic and international agendas in response.

WNU Editor: I have a different take from the above Washington Post article. I personally think Chinese President Xi made the decision to go to San Francisco to meet Biden, albeit on the sidelines, to gauge if there has been any change in US thinking and policy since he last talked with the US President. It is one thing to see and read on the news and listen to one's subordinates on what is the status of U.S. - Chinese relations, it is a whole different level when the leaders meet. 
As to what both sides expect. On the U.S. side the White House has been very clear on what they want (link here). But this is not what Beijing is focused on. Their focus is on issues like Taiwan and trade, and they certainly want the U.S. to back-off as China continues to become a global player while deepening ties with countries that the U.S. is in conflict with (i.e. Russia and Iran). 
My prediction. 
Nothing is going to change from today's meetings. On the big issues the two sides have no common ground.]]></summary>

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the first time in a year on Wednesday, for talks that may ease friction between the adversarial superpowers on military conflicts, drug-trafficking and artificial intelligence.
However, deep progress on the vast differences separating the world's economic superpowers may have to wait for another day. 
Officials on both sides of the Pacific have set expectations low as Biden and Xi are set to discuss Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Israel-Hamas war, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea, and human rights, each of them areas where the leaders have been unable to resolve long disagreements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Tuesday for Pacific Rim nations to be free to choose their own partners, a veiled criticism of China on the eve of a presidential summit.
Blinken, addressing ministers from the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in San Francisco, quoted a 2020 statement of the group that called for an "open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community."
"The United States believes in that vision -- a region where economies are free to choose their own path and their own partners, where problems are dealt with openly, where rules are reached transparently and applied fairly, where goods, ideas and people flow lawfully and freely," he said.
The United States has accused China of using economic pressure and growing assertiveness at sea to press countries that have disputes with Beijing.
China in turn has criticized the US role in Asia, particularly its military alliances, arguing that Beijing historically has been the dominant player.
Despite an array of tensions, US President Joe Biden will meet Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit.
Both countries have voiced hope, in different ways, of bringing more stability to the fraught relationship between the world's two largest economies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, a world heritage site popular with tourists, was underwater Wednesday after heavy rain flooded thousands of homes and blocked highways.
Pictures on state media showed residents navigating flooded streets in boats, while homes and cars were partially submerged.
"The city is flooded everywhere, with waters rising very quickly since Tuesday night," Hue resident Vu An told AFP, adding that power had been cut off in the city.
Heavy rain has pounded several provinces along the coast since Monday.
More than 2,000 people have evacuated their homes in central Quang Tri province, where three people are missing, authorities said Wednesday.
Some parts of the national highway linking north and south Vietnam have also been blocked by landslides due to the flooding.
Vietnam is frequently lashed by harsh weather in the rainy season between June and November.
Forecasters said water levels may remain high for the next two days before improving this weekend.
According to official figures, natural disasters including floods and landslides have left 136 people dead and missing in Vietnam this year.
Scientists have warned that extreme weather events globally are becoming more intense and frequent due to climate change.]]></summary>

International warrants were also issued for the arrests of Assad's brother Maher, the de-facto chief of a Syrian elite military unit, and two armed forces generals.

The scope of the operation was stunning. It targeted over 50 platforms and applications including YouTube, Reddit, X, TikTok, Pinterest, and Medium. The operation, part of what security professionals have named the “Spamouflage” network, focused on improving foreign perceptions of Chinese foreign policy, attacking critics of the Chinese Communist Party, and denigrating the United States and its allies.

Axios: Dozens of journalists killed in Hamas-Israel war 
 At least 42 journalists have been killed since the Hamas-Israel war began Oct. 7, according to the latest tally from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) out Tuesday. Many others have been reported missing or injured.

 
The big picture: It's a staggering number of journalist deaths to be documented across such a short period of time. 
* For context, a total of 15 journalists have been killed in Ukraine between 2022 and 2023, per CPJ. 

 
Details: Most of the 37 Palestinians killed during the Hamas-Israeli war died during Israeli bombardments, per CPJ. 
* Four Israeli journalists were killed in Hamas attacks and one Lebanese journalist has also been killed in an attack Lebanon's government blamed on an Israeli missile strike. 
* Many of the journalists killed were working as photojournalists or videographers, trying to document the crisis unfolding on the ground.

Pentagon — Iranian-backed militants have attacked U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria at least four times in the past 24 hours, raising the number of attacks to 52 in less than a month, U.S. defense officials tell VOA. 
"These attacks must stop, and if they don't stop, then we won't hesitate to do what's necessary, again, to protect the troops," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters at a news conference in Seoul on Monday.
The four attacks occurred after U.S. forces carried out strikes against two Iran-linked sites in Syria late Sunday in response to attacks on American personnel. The strikes hit a training facility near Abu Kamal and a safe house near Mayadin, according to the military.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
