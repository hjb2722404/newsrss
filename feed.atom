Russia's Defence Ministry released video footage on Tuesday of what it said were German-made Leopard tanks and U.S.-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles captured by Russian forces in a fierce battle with Ukrainian troops. 
 Reuters was able to confirm that the vehicles seen in the video were Leopard tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but was not able to independently verify the location or date of the footage. 
The Defence Ministry said the armoured vehicles and tanks were captured on the Zaporizhzhia front in southern Ukraine, one of the areas where Ukrainian forces have been trying to counter-attack. 
Two Leopard tanks were shown in the footage, which was released on the ministry's official channel on the Telegram messaging application, along with two damaged Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

Sonar 21: What Could Russia Demand to Negotiate an End to the War in Ukraine? 
I know that some in the West are suggesting that there may be a way to negotiate and end to the war in Ukraine and I think they do not understand what Russia is now likely to demand to secure such a deal. For starters, will Russia insist on securing the rights to all territory east of the Dnieper River and on a special status for Odessa? I think so. Odessa would no longer be ruled by Ukraine.
I also would expect Russia to demand (non-negotiable) the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the murder of 42 Russian speaking Ukrainians in 2014 who sought refuge in the Trade Unions House.

I also would expect that Russia will demand the dismantling of NATO Aegis missile systems in Poland and Romania and a ban on U.S. or NATO troops being posted in countries that share a border with Ukraine. In light of Russia’s stated goal of de-nazification I would not be surprised if Russia demands the laws of Ukraine be changed and that Nazi-affiliated parties and symbols be banned.

Daily Mail: US spy agencies BUY and sell huge amounts of data on Americans available online: Information on nearly EVERY citizen is available - and they don't know it, damning intelligence report reveals 
* Sales creating huge threat to privacy new report commissioned by Director of National Intelligence  Avril Haines found

The offerings on have grown from basic address history and demographic information to piles of data generated smartphone devices and apps, social-media platforms, automobiles and location trackers such as fitness watches, the Wall Street Journal reported.

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/jeff-sharlet/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-12T21:59:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an all-caps rant on his Truth Social platform Monday, former President Donald Trump vowed to appoint another special counsel to prosecute President Joe Biden. It was a single word that raised the alarm for an expert in religious extremism.
"NOW THAT THE 'SEAL' IS BROKEN, IN ADDITION TO CLOSING THE BORDER & REMOVING ALL OF THE 'CRIMINAL' ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ILLEGALLY INVADED OUR COUNTRY, MAKING AMERICA ENERGY INDEPENDENT, & EVEN DOMINANT AGAIN, & IMMEDIATELY ENDING THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA & UKRAINE, I WILL APPOINT A REAL SPECIAL 'PROSECUTOR' TO GO AFTER THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA, JOE BIDEN, THE ENTIRE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY, & ALL OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS, BORDERS, & COUNTRY ITSELF!" wrote Trump.
The use of "seal" may not be an accident, wrote religion reporter and extremism expert Jeff Sharlet. It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.
"QAnon & many fundamentalists will read this — & I don’t think it’s a stretch to imagine Trump’s people are aware of that — as both the indictment & 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ," wrote Sharlet.
The Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. 
This could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist — as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.

SKY News: Iran: The West cannot stop us from building nuclear weapons but a deal is possible

 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's words come at a time of high tension between Iran and Israel, with Israel's leader already having said his country will do "whatever we need to do to defend ourselves". 
The West cannot stop Iran from building nuclear weapons, the country's supreme leader has said.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking on Sunday as tensions continue to mount over the country's nuclear work.

In words reported by state media, he said: "Talks about Tehran's nuclear weapons is a lie and [the West] know it.
"We do not want nuclear arms based on our beliefs, otherwise they would not have been able to stop it."

A deal with the West over the nuclear programme is possible, the supreme leader said, but only if Tehran can keep its nuclear infrastructure intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[-Lawyers for Ukraine at the top U.N. court on Monday rejected Russia's account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a "rambling conspiracy theory", in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
Kyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.
Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had "overall control" over the separatist forces.
Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine's MH17 case was based on "nonsense" and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.
On Monday, Ukraine's lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been "subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory" about the shooting down of MH17 which would be "better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet".
Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.
Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine's allegations on Thursday.
The World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.

* A PLA warning was played as the island's leader was making a radio call to a captain stationed in the southern city of Kaohsiung 
* Taiwan says the mainland military had not hacked into her radio channel, but security specialists call for an investigation in case plans are being leaked to the PLA

The People's Liberation Army disrupted a radio call between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the island's air force, sparking a discussion about secure communications. 
Tsai was visiting southern Taiwan on Friday to boost morale among service personnel ahead of next week's Dragon Boat Festival and spoke to two female officers stationed at an air defence and missile command centre in Kaohsiung.

WUNSTORF, Germany — More than 250 aircraft and 10,000 personnel began a two-week military exercise on Monday involving NATO nations and Japan, in what host nation Germany bills as the largest deployment of aircraft in the alliance’s history. 
Planning for the training began in 2018. But it comes as fighting escalates on NATO’s doorstep in Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces, backed by arms from Western allies, are mounting an offensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia since the invasion ordered last year by President Vladimir V. Putin.

Officials involved in the 25-nation NATO exercise said it sends a message about the alliance’s solidarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi dies at 86 
Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian former PM who overcame various scandals to hold office four times, has died at 86. He died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan. 
In April, he was treated for a lung infection linked to leukaemia.

Berlusconi's death leaves a "huge void", Italy's defence minister said, with a national day of mourning due to take place on Wednesday. 
The longest-serving prime minister in post-war Italy, he had bounced back from sex scandals and corruption cases. 
After taking political office in 1994, the billionaire media tycoon led four governments until 2011 - though not consecutively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrayinska Pravda: Ukraine asks Germany for more Leopard 2 tanks 
Considering the first losses during the counteroffensive, Andrii Melnyk, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, is asking for more German-made tanks.

 
Details: Against the background of the loss of the first tanks delivered by the Western allies to participate in the hostilities in Ukraine, Kyiv is once again calling for increased support, in particular from Germany. 
"The Ukrainian army desperately needs many more Western battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and other armoured vehicles," Melnyk said. 
"Each Leopard 2 is literally worth its weight in gold for a decisive offensive," added the former ambassador of Ukraine in Berlin.

In his opinion, the Bundeswehr is capable of providing more than the 18 already delivered pieces from its stockpile of more than 300. The current number could be "tripled without jeopardising Germany's ability to defend itself". 
Melnyk also asked to hand over "another 60 Marder infantry fighting vehicles" to the Ukrainian army.

My favorite source on the war from the Ukrainian side is repeating what others are saying .... the Ukrainian goal is to launch small scale attacks along the front until they reach the first Russian fortifications. It is then when the bulk of the military will then be thrown in.

.... It seems pretty clear that the Russians have  a flexible defense strategy in front of the first fortified line. They hold the outposts when the Ukrainian attack is not so strong, they retreat to the next village when the attack is stronger and counterattack whenever there is a good chance. Most importantly the Russian artillery gives the Ukrainians a hard time when they move into this forward area.]]></summary>

While Gen. Mark Milley cautioned against a direct comparison between the Allied landing and Ukraine’s current battle plans, he acknowledged the goals of both were “certainly the same, to liberate occupied territory and to free a country that has been unjustly attacked by an aggressor nation.” Milley’s comments unintentionally serve to highlight the importance of another less noted anniversary as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The dramatic reenactment of Prince Harry’s court trial was “fairly accurate” in portraying how the Duke of Sussex tried to “pull at the heartstrings” of the judge, says writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue.

"People online have been saying it’s not Prince Harry but Prince Barry because of the nature of the re-enactment," Ms Krakue told Sky News host Danica De Giorgio. 

“I think ‘theatre’ is the right way to describe it and I mean, it’s  … fairly accurate in the way that Prince Harry was trying to pull at the heartstrings, or tug at the heartstrings of the judge in this particular case but unfortunately that’s not how a courtroom works.

“A courtroom works based on facts and not your feelings.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in Colombia's southern jungle will tell their own story about the ordeal, the father of the two youngest siblings said on Sunday.
The children, aged 1 through 13, survived a May 1 plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults and were found on Friday in Caqueta province after weeks of searching by the military and Indigenous communities.
Their ordeal began in the early hours, when the Cessna 206 aircraft carrying seven people and traveling between Araracuara airport in Caqueta and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure.
"They will tell their stories and you will hear them," said Manuel Ranoque, the father of the 1-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, after visiting them at Bogota's military hospital.
"It's not easy to ask them because the children went 40 days without eating well, so I have not been able to get information from the oldest child," Ranoque told reporters.
Ranoque also told reporters the children's mother had survived for four days after the crash, an account disputed by another family member who also spoke to journalists. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information.

The Russian ship carried out security tasks along the routes of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of Black Sea. All of them were destroyed, there were no casualties, the ship was not damaged.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's supreme leader on Sunday said a deal with the West over Tehran's nuclear work was possible if the country's nuclear infrastructure remained intact, amid a stalemate between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.
Months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since September, with both sides accusing each other of making unreasonable demands.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's guarded approval comes days after both Tehran and Washington denied a report that they were nearing an interim deal under which Tehran would curb its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hill: Nearly half in new poll say Trump indictment is politically motivated  
Almost half of Americans in a new poll said that they believe the federal indictment of former President Trump is politically motivated after he was charged with 37 counts in relation to the alleged mishandling of records at his Mar-a-Lago estate. 
Forty-seven percent of respondents in the ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday say the charges against Trump are politically motivated, while 37 percent say they are not. Sixteen percent say they are not sure. 
Most Republicans — 80 percent — say the charges announced last week are politically motivated, with only 16 percent of Democrats aligning with that view. 
By comparison, 71 percent of Democrats say the charges are not rooted in politics. Only nine percent of Republicans say the same.

WNU Editor: Only half?!?!?!? 
The details of the ABC/IPSOS poll are here .... Most Americans view latest Trump charges as serious (IPSOS). 
Update: Lawyer Robert Barnes is right (see tweet below). But that is not the media or political narrative right now.

Any executive branch document created before or during a Presidency is the President's to do with as he pleases. That's the point of The Presidential Records Act. It has to be that way to keep Constitutional power in the hands of the only elected official of the executive branch.…

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia on Sunday said it had destroyed at least seven German-made Leopard tanks and five U.S.-made Bradley vehicles over 48 hours while repelling Ukrainian attacks, though Russian bloggers reported Ukraine had briefly pierced part of the Russian line.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged on Saturday that his military was engaged in "counter-offensive and defensive operations", a day after President Vladimir Putin said Russia had repelled the first attacks of the offensive. 
Russia's defence ministry said it had repelled more than a dozen Ukrainian attacks over the past day in three major directions and had destroyed a column of armoured vehicles of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in the Zaporizhzhia region.

Reuters: Russia says Ukraine tried to attack Russian ship near major gas pipelines in Black Sea 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine had made unsuccessful attempt to attack a Russian naval ship with six high-speed drone boats as the Russian vessel patrolled major natural gas pipelines in the Black Sea. 
The 'Priazovye' ship was carrying out what Russia's defence ministry said was "monitoring of the situation and ensuring security along the routes of the TurkStream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of the Black Sea." 
Ukraine attacked in the early hours of Sunday about 300 km south-east of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet on the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, the defence ministry said.

Shelling and gunfire resumed Sunday in the Sudanese capital, witnesses said, at the end of a 24-hour ceasefire that had given civilians rare respite from nearly two months of war.  
Deadly fighting has raged in the northeast African country since mid-April, when army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), turned on each other. 
The latest in a series of ceasefire agreements enabled civilians trapped in the capital Khartoum to venture outside and stock up on food and other essential supplies. 
But only 10 minutes after it ended at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday the capital was rocked again by the sound of shelling and clashes, witnesses told AFP.

KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - For Kherson resident Iryna Radetska, the catastrophic flooding of her city after the giant Kakhovka dam was destroyed is the latest chapter in more than a year of wartime suffering.
"They say a new love kills the old one. Maybe it's the same with tragedy," said 52-year-old Radetska, who is deputy head of a school in the southern Ukrainian city.
Few places have felt the extent of suffering that Kherson has since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Few people bore the brunt of it harder than Radetska, who said she has survived imprisonment, beatings and rockets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) - Honduras opened an embassy in China on Sunday, Chinese state media reported, after the Central American nation cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan earlier this year.
The embassy in Beijing was opened by foreign ministers from the two countries, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro is in China for a state visit, during which she is to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, state media have reported.
Tegucigalpa in March ended its decades-long relationship with Taipei and established diplomatic ties with Beijing.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>
