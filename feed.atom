SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Chinese President Xi Jinping told North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that Beijing was willing to work with Pyongyang for world peace, North Korean state media said Saturday. 
The message from Xi came days after North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in one of its most powerful tests yet, declaring it would meet perceived U.S. nuclear threats with nukes of its own. 
North Korea has conducted a record-breaking blitz of missile launches in recent weeks, and fears have grown that it is building up to a seventh nuclear test, its first since 2017.

Update: There was no direct face to face or phone call communication. It was a letter .... Xi says he attaches great importance to China-N. Korea ties in letter to Kim: KCNA (Yonhap News Agency).

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says his country's ultimate goal is to possess the world's most powerful nuclear force at the launch of his country's largest ballistic missile.

He said building the nuclear force was for reliably protecting the dignity and sovereignty of the state and its people.

Insider: The CIA is looking for Russians who are 'disgusted' with the Ukraine war to recruit as spies 
* The CIA's deputy director of operations said last week the agency is looking for Russian recruits. 
* During an event at George Mason University, David Marlowe said the agency is "open for business." 
* Marlowe added the CIA is looking for Russians who are "disgusted" with the war in Ukraine. 
The Central Intelligence Agency is looking for Russians who are "disgusted" with the Ukraine war to recruit them as spies, David Marlowe, the agency's deputy director of operations, said last week. 
Marlowe told an audience at George Mason University's Hayden Center in Fairfax County, Virginia, that Putin was "at his best moment the day before he invaded [Ukraine]" because he had "all the power that he is ever going to have." 
"He squandered every single bit of that," Marlowe said, before adding: "We're looking around the world for Russians who are as disgusted with [Putin's actions] as we are. Because we're open for business."

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that U.S. midterm elections would not improve the "bad" relations between Moscow and Washington, as it dismissed allegations Russia was meddling in the U.S. vote, Russian state media reported.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.

"Russian state media is following the midterm elections in the United States with great interest, but the mood in Moscow’s studios had noticeably soured in comparison to the fun-filled episodes of the years preceding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine," Davis reported. "While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.
