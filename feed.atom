        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has survived the vote of no confidence against his leadership with just 63 votes helping secure his position.

Questions, however, remain to the strength of his leadership – even though Mr Johnson said the result was “decisive”. 

“What it means as a government is we can move forward and focus on the stuff that I think really matters to people,” he said. 

“I’m grateful to colleagues, grateful for the support they have given me and of course I understand what we need to do now is come together as a government, as party, and that is exactly what we can now do.”]]></summary>

“His position, I think, still remains tenuous but under the rules of the Conservative Party, they’re not able to hold another leadership ballot for a year so there is that factor,” he told Sky News Australia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has added to social media upheaval as more and more new surfers paddle through local queues without learning local etiquette.  The exploration and rites of passage it took to find these places, their secrecy or their access maintained through generations of internet users in some cases, can vanish with an over-eager Instagram post.  And one geotagged Instagram post begets another and another.
“There are people who feel like they’ve tended a garden for years, and then you come in with a dirt bike and donuts and peel it, kicking the dirt in their face,” said Devon Howard, the former editor.  of Longboard magazine and a leading figure in surfing.
Dropbox, a fun and once-quiet spot near Mulcoy’s Tofino home, is now so crowded he doesn’t bother surfing there anymore.  If someone shares a photo of the wave pulling one day, the break is filled with new surfers the next, he said.
Some photographers have redirected their careers to respect local breaks. Chris Burcard, an outdoor photographer with 3.8 million Instagram followers, has become known for his photographs of extremely remote locations.  It wasn’t his original plan: the central coast of California, where he’s from, is full of big waves – but ill will towards anyone photographing them.
“One of the reasons I was drawn to remote, wild places was because I was so tired of taking care of things at home,” Burkard said, using a swear word, citing having his car vandalized and receiving death threats.
He and other photographers see no reason to name a place, even if it is photographed.
“For me, the mystery and anonymity of the surfing experience is key,” Burkard continued.  “When I grew up seeing these secluded beaches on the cover of Surfer, and all you got was the name of a country, it was so cool. Which made me want to make it a career is literally this lack of information.

Partygate hasn’t taken down the UK prime minister — at least not yet.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has survived a no-confidence vote, but his political future remains tenuous amid a strong Conservative Party rebellion against his leadership.
The final vote Monday was 211 to 148, which means Johnson won enough support from Conservative members of Parliament to remain as the leader of his party after facing months of allegations that he lied about parties hosted at Downing Street during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis.

Washington Post: China secretly building PLA naval facility in Cambodia, Western officials say 
China is secretly building a naval facility in Cambodia for the exclusive use of its military, with both countries denying that is the case and taking extraordinary measures to conceal the operation, Western officials said. 
The military presence will be on the northern portion of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, which is slated to be the site of a groundbreaking ceremony this week, according to the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. 
The establishment of a Chinese naval base in Cambodia — only its second such overseas outpost and its first in the strategically significant Indo-Pacific region — is part of Beijing’s strategy to build a network of military facilities around the world in support of its aspirations to become a true global power, the officials said.

The court found James Fitton, a 66-year-old retired geologist, guilty under a 2002 law which carries a sentence of seven to 15 years in prison for theft of artifacts or antiquities.  Looting antiquities with weapons or with other people is a crime punishable by death in Iraq.
“The site where he took the small pieces and stones was open without guards, so he took a few pieces as souvenirs,” said Mr Fitton’s defense lawyer, Thair Soud, adding that his client did not had made no attempt to hide the pieces, wrapping them in Kleenex and putting them in her luggage.

Republic World: Italy Warns Of 'bread War' In Africa As Russian Blockade Of Ukrainian Ports Continues  
Earlier this month, a report published by the WFP noted that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has forced over 20 million people to suffer food shortages. 
As Ukrainian ports have been blocked for three months in a row, an Italian minister believes a "bread war" has already begun in African nations. Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, said that the situation in several vulnerable countries, especially African nations, which are already facing the worst ever food crisis, has plunged into a further "food emergency".
"The global bread war is already going on and we must stop it. We risk political instability in Africa. For the proliferation of terrorist organisations, for coups: this can lead to the grain crisis that we are experiencing," The Business Tribune quoted Di Maio as saying.

OilPrice.com: Russia Sees Extra $6.4 Billion Oil Revenue In June As Prices Rally 
* Russia's Finance Ministry expects $6.37 billion in additional oil revenue in June. 
* Russian oil exports haven’t fallen off a cliff, while it continues to sell natural gas to most of the EU. 
* Russian crude exports could drop if the EU's sixth' sanctions package is fully implemented. 
Russia expects to receive as much as $6.37 billion in additional oil and gas revenues in June, its finance ministry said on Friday, as energy commodity prices have rallied since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
According to estimates released on Friday by the Finance Ministry, Russia expects its additional revenue from oil and gas sales to be 393 billion rubles, or $6.37 billion, this month. 
Additional budget revenues are expected at $10.66 billion (656.6 billion rubles) for the months of May and June because of the higher-than-expected oil prices, Russia said.

        <updated>2022-06-06T17:00:00.027Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Tory MPs begin to vote on Boris Johnson's future after he tells them 'I will lead you to victory again' and begs them not to hand Keir Starmer the keys to No10 by ousting him - with the PM needing 180 of 359 to back him to limp on 
* MPs have two hours until 8pm to cast their votes for or against Mr Johnson, with the result declared at 9pm. 
* The PM's allies have insisted he will 'fight his corner' amid warnings that an early general election is possible 
* Backbench chief Sir Graham Brady calls a full vote when he receives 54 letters from MPs asking for one 
Tory MPs have begun voting on whether to keep Boris Johnson as party leader and Prime Minister after he warned them not to give Labour the keys to power by unseating him. 
A queue of politicians waited to cast their ballots this evening after a day of high drama in Westminster saw  backbench chief Graham Brady confirm that the PM''s political enemies had reached the critical threshold for a referendum on his time in office. 
Mr Johnson addressed his mutinous troops this afternoon and told them successful 'fratricide' would gift Keir Starmer and his party an election win.

Update #1: Live: Tory MPs voting now on prime minister's future (BBC News)  
Update #2: Boris Johnson no-confidence vote under way as Tory MPs cast ballots to decide prime minister’s future – live (The Guardian)  
Update #3: British Prime Minister Johnson to face no-confidence vote (AP)   
WNU Editor: This could be nothing. It could also be the end of Boris Johnson as Prime minister. The result will be known in the coming hours. My prediction is that Boris Johnson will receive enough support to continue as Prime Minister even though 54 Tory MPs indicated this morning that they wanted this vote. But this will be a hollow victory. He will be politically damaged, and his days as Prime Minister are numbered.]]></summary>

Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro closed their sky to Putin’s foreign minister.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to Serbia Monday has been canceled, Russia's state-run Interfax press agency reported Sunday, after neighboring countries reportedly closed their airspace to his plane. 
Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had all banned Lavrov's plane from their airspace, Serbian newspaper Danas reported. 
"Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation," a Russia foreign ministry source quipped to Interfax.  The three countries banned Russian flights from their airspace as the results of sanctions against Moscow, which has waged war on Ukraine. But at least one exception was made in April, when a Russian place flew through Bulgaria to pick up Russian diplomats from Serbia.

* South Korea and the US carried out joint missile drill around 4.45am on Sunday 
* Allies launched eight rockets from base in South Korea into East Sea, they said 
* Drill was designed to show their readiness to respond to 'crisis event,' US said 
* Came just hours after Kim Jong Un tested eight of his own missiles, as tensions continue to mount on the Korean peninsula 
South Korea and the US have test-fired a volley of missiles as a show of strength to Kim Jong Un after the North tested eight of its own rockets on Saturday. 
Seoul said one US missile and seven Korean missiles were fired from an unspecified base in the northeast of the country into the East Sea in a volley that lasted 10 minutes and began around 4.45am local time Sunday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[In Case You Missed It: What Canada Doesn’t Know About Its Guns]
Given the sweeping firearms measures announced this week, let’s stay on topic.
Two of the government’s plans dominated the news.  First, Canada took immediate action to freeze the sale, donation, trade and import of handguns.  It’s not a ban, but it does mean the number of handguns legally owned by Canadians outside of the military and police won’t increase from the roughly 900,000 currently held.
The other thing that caught the eye was the government’s decision to follow through on its earlier ban on military-style assault rifles with a mandatory buyback program.

Newsweek: Russia Warns of 'Horsemen of the Apocalypse' as Ukraine War Hits 100 Days 
A high-ranking Russian official issued a warning to the international community, saying that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the book of Revelation in the bible's New Testament have already started their trip as Russia's invasion of Ukraine reaches 100 days. 
Russian Security County Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said in a recent interview that "one can believe that the horsemen of the Apocalypse are already on their way and all hope is in Almighty God," the Russian-state run news agency TASS reported. 
Medvedev added that things have already been set in motion, "however, one can still try to tone down this international situation."

WNU Editor: I remember when former Russian President Medvedev was regarded by the West (and by many Russians) as a soft leader. No more now. He has become the most vocal hardliner within the Kremlin. My gut tells me that he is positioning himself to run again for the Russian Presidency after Putin is gone, and Putin is not blocking him nor telling him to tone down his rhetoric.

Ukrainian forces themselves will determine the range of performance of HIMARS systems. 
"As President Biden announced yesterday, a $700 million security assistance package had been signed. This includes HIMARS long-range rocket systems. This will help Ukrainian forces to aim more accurately but also have a longer range. The exact range will be determined by the Ukrainian forces," U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink told journalists after presenting credentials to the President of Ukraine, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

Russian missiles struck Kyiv on Sunday for the first time since late April, destroying tanks donated from abroad, Reuters reported. 
Driving the news: The strikes interrupted the sense of normality that had returned in Kyiv since Russian forces were forced out of the capital. 
* The strikes were carried out using "long-range air-launched missiles fired from heavy bombers as far away as the Caspian Sea," Reuters reported, underscoring the sophistication of Russia's weaponry. 
* The strikes also targeted railway facilities and other infrastructure in Kyiv, AP reported.   
The big picture: Russian President Vladimir Putin warned against international weapons donations to Ukraine on Sunday, saying that if the U.S. were to provide longer-range missiles as planned, Russia would strike new targets in Ukraine.

If this happens, Russia will strike targets so far left intact, the president has warned 
Russia will hit targets it has so far not struck if long-range missiles are delivered to Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned.   
“If they are supplied, we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our weapons, which we have enough of, in order to strike at those objects that we have not yet struck,” Putin told Russia 1 in an interview broadcasted on Sunday. 
The Russian president noted that the shipment of US-made multiple-launch rocket systems confirmed by President Joe Biden on Tuesday is unlikely to bring anything new to Kiev’s forces. The Ukrainian military already has Soviet- and Russian-designed Grad, Smerch, and Uragan systems of the same kind, he explained.

The Defence Department recently revealed a “dangerous manoeuvre” by the Chinese J-16 jet posed a threat to the safety of the crew on the RAAF P-8 maritime aircraft. 

“It’s a provocative action by China, and I come back to our government and our party’s strength and determination,” Ms Ley told Sky News Australia. 

“I will let the geostrategic implications take their course with the current government. It’s for them to take the action that they need to, but it needs to be strong, and it doesn’t need to be taking a backwards step.”]]></summary>

In a 13-minute video posted on his YouTube page on Sunday, Mr Brand said Prime Minister Trudeau is using new powers to crack down on legitimate dissent.  

Last month, Prime Minister Trudeau announced Canada's security agencies will get new tools to combat “extremist ideology” and “misinformation.” 

Mr Brand warned the new powers will erode freedom within Canada.

"It won't mean more freedom, it'll mean their ability to capture your data, share that data, and use that data to manipulate your behaviour,” Mr Brand said.]]></summary>

CNN: Western allies meeting regularly to game out potential framework for Ukraine ceasefire 
Washington (CNN)Staring down the prospect of an extended stalemate in Ukraine, the US and its allies are placing a renewed emphasis on the need for a negotiated settlement to end the war as the conflict grinds into its 100th day with no clear victory in sight for either side. 
US officials have in recent weeks been meeting regularly with their British and European counterparts to discuss potential frameworks for a ceasefire and for ending the war through a negotiated settlement, multiple sources familiar with the talks told CNN.

French president says door must be left open to allow for improvement in diplomatic relations after war 
Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine, Emmanuel Macron has said, to allow an improvement in diplomatic relations between the west and Moscow whenever the war comes to an end. 
The French president said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, had made a “historic and fundamental” error in invading Ukraine, but that nevertheless a wider escalation in hostilities had to be avoided. 
Giving an interview to a group of regional newspapers in his home country, Macron said: “We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels.”

Update: Russia Must Not Be Humiliated Despite Putin's 'Historic' Mistake - Macron (Reuters).   
WNU editor: I am skeptical that French President Macron is concerned about Putin/Russia be humiliated. I think he is more worried about the West/EU being humiliated if Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is successful, and the West is powerless to do anything about it.   
Update #2: This is not a surprise. The Ukraine government is furious that French President Macron does not want Russia to be "humiliated" .... Ukraine officials hit out at Macron after suggestions Russia 'should not be humiliated' (Euro News).]]></summary>

The company, born from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, also agreed to cooperate with federal authorities as part of his plea deal, according to a statement released by prosecutors.
The investigation focused on an allegation that Fiat Chrysler attempted to circumvent emission standards for some of its pickup trucks and Jeeps.  Prosecutors said the US division, also known as FCA US, had misled customers and regulators for years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox News host Maria Bartiromo urged House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to do something to help the people who rioted on Jan. 6, 2021 if he becomes Speaker of the House.


	"I know that we're 156 days away from the midterm elections," Bartiromo said as McCarthy smiled. "What are you going to do to that committee, the Jan. 6 Committee, should you become the majority because right now as we speak, there are honest -- and people sitting in jail because they were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. They are still in jail a year later."


	McCarthy answered without saying what he would do about the Jan. 6 Committee or the detained rioters if he becomes Speaker.


	"We live in America," McCarthy said. "People have a right to have a say and to go to court. They shouldn't be held for this long inside. You watch what is happening to political opponents with this one-party rule. In 156 days, we're going to become energy independent, we're going to secure our border, we're going to make our streets safe again but we need you to help us."


	"We are not going to bend," he added. "We are not going to let them go after our First Amendment rights and go after the individuals that they're trying to do for political purposes."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ontario Progressive Conservative (PC) government’s attempt at re-election brings to the forefront questions of Canadian conservatism and its viability, not just in the country’s most populous province. 
Throughout its tenure, the PC government has undergone significant changes in policy, appearance and general tone. A 2018 populist movement has seemingly shifted to the moderate PC coalition of old.
To capture this change, is it necessary for Ford to turn back the clock to 2018? After all, he won both the party leadership and the election on a populist agenda. 
Following the more centrist Patrick Brown’s removal as PC leader in January 2018, Ford entered the race brandishing his previous anti-establishment and brash Toronto City Council persona.

Flags will fly to welcome and acknowledge those who fought in the Great Crusade. Over the summer, hundreds of commemorations will take place to mark 80 days of battle. 
While not the only contribution by Canadian service men and women, D-Day takes a prominent place in Canada’s cultural memory of the Second World War. 
As a researcher of war heritage, I have observed and participated in commemorations in Normandy over the years. My focus has been on how the region, as a memorialized landscape of war, is managed and interpreted. I am also interested in the meaning people draw from the histories and stories told at these sites of memory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US has announced it will resume a limited military presence in Somalia. The former administration withdrew troops from the country in 2020. The mission of the American soldiers is still what it has been for the last 15 years: to advise and assist Somali forces. US troops will not be directly involved in conflict. Their number, 450 to 500, is smaller than the last deployment. 
The decision to redeploy in Somalia might appear to be surprising, for two important reasons. First, US president Joe Biden promised during his campaign to avoid the “forever wars” against terror lasting since 2002. None of these wars were ever fully won and remain unpopular with the US electorate. It is also surprising in the light of moves to restructure the US military to meet a threat from China.

The day, marked on 3 June every year since the 1920s, is therefore a pivotal celebration in the life and history of Christianity in Uganda.   
The story begins farther back in 1875 when the British-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley arrived in the court of the Kabaka Mutesa I in Munyonyo (outskirts of Kampala). The Kabaka, or king, warmly welcomed him as a new ally of his Buganda kingdom (in central Uganda) and an opportunity to face off Egyptian and Sudanese threats.
Indeed, during his month-long stay, Stanley proved a good ally by aiding the Kabaka in the battles against the autonomous Vumma of Buvumma Island on Lake Victoria, using his firea…]]></summary>

Putin has warned that if Kiev receives long-range missiles, Russia will move and strike sites that have been off-target so far. -/Kremlin/dpa
Supplying long-range missiles of Western manufacture to Ukraine will result in a strong response from Russian forces, President Vladimir Putin told state broadcaster Rossija 1.
“If they supply, then we will draw the corresponding conclusions from this and deploy our means of destruction, of which we have enough, to deliver blows to those objects that we are not yet attacking,” he said. The West’s aim in supplying arms to Ukraine was to draw out the conflict, Putin said.
The Russian leader appeared relaxed about the delivery of modern HIMARS multiple rocket launchers announced by the United States, saying it would not change the balance of forces fundamentally. “There’s nothing new here,” he said, noting that the Ukrainian army already had similar, Russian-made systems and that US deliveries would just replace systems that had been destroyed.
Precisely which missiles were deployed would be decisive, Putin said. According to his information, missiles with ranges of between 45 and 70 kilometres would be supplied, similar to Russia’s Uragan, Smerch and Grad systems. Ukraine had 515 such systems when the "operation" began and is still thought to have 360, he said.]]></summary>

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea fired eight short-range ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast on Sunday, likely its largest single test, a day after South Korea and the United States ended joint military drills.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that at least eight missiles were fired from the Sunan area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang and they flew between 110 km-600 km (70-370 miles) at altitudes between 25 km to 90 km.
In response to North Korea's missiles launch, Japan's Self Defence Force issued a statement that Japan and the United States had conducted a joint military exercise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk plans to cut 10% of the electric car maker’s salaried workforce, he told staff in an email on Friday.
The job cuts won’t apply to employees who build cars or batteries or install solar panels, and the number of hourly workers will increase, Musk said in the email, a copy of which was reviewed by the New York Times.  “Tesla will reduce the number of employees by 10% because we have become overstaffed in many areas,” he said.
Reuters reported the news earlier, citing another email Mr. Musk sent only to Tesla executives.  The automaker’s stock price closed about 9% lower on Friday after the article was published.
Tesla’s workforce has grown significantly as sales have grown, and it has built new factories, including two that opened this year near Berlin and Aus…]]></summary>

Although he often challenged the Victorian-era patriarchal view of female sexuality, she writes, “he reflected in his theories the belief that women were secondary and not the norm”.  As for her conclusion that “women always fall in love with their male therapists,” she said, he sanitized attachments such as transference.
“He said it didn’t matter, women got over it afterwards,” Professor Freud said, “but I disagree. Women then go to another therapist to get over the one -the.
She escalated her criticism in an interview for a Canadian TV movie, “Neighbours: Freud and Hitler in Vienna” (2003), saying, “In my eyes, Adolf Hitler and my grandfather were false prophets of the 20th century. ”  They shared, in his words, “an ambition to convince other men of the one and only truth upon which they had stumbled”.
“He could never be wrong,” she said.

Professor Freud’s book, an amalgam of letters, was published in 2007.Credit…Praeger Publishers

Miriam Sophie Freud was born in Vienna on August 6, 1924. Her father, Jean Martin Freud (known as Martin), was the eldest son of Sigmund Freud and a lawyer who became the director of the psychoanalytic publishing house of the Dr Freud.  His mother, Ernestine (Drucker) Freud, was a speech therapist known as Esti.
Sophie tried to make the most of her childhood, despite her parents’ bickering and the animosity between her and her older brother, Walter.  It wasn’t until she was enrolled as a teenager in Vienna’s most progressive girls’ school, the Schwarzwaldschule, that she excelled as a student.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky News correspondent Annelise Nielsen says Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have “sat out” a number of the main events held across the Platinum Jubilee weekend, including the Party at the Palace concert.

“I think that was pretty deliberate – that they didn’t want to be drawing attention away from anything,” Ms Nielsen said, 

“When speaking to people here – the diehard royal fans – a lot of them say that they are disappointed in how Harry and Meghan have conducted their step back from royal life, that they don’t agree with many of their criticisms of the Royal Family. 

“But they do say … he is the Queen’s grandson and so there should be respect for the monarch and in that instance it does mean her heirs as well.”]]></summary>

CNN: Biden's meeting with Saudi crown prince pushed back to July 
(CNN)A meeting between President Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is now expected to happen next month, according to an administration official. 
CNN reported earlier this week that Biden and the crown prince were planning to meet at the end of June as part of a broader summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which Saudi Arabia currently presides over. 
Biden is still expected to travel later this month to Germany and Spain for the G7 and NATO summits respectively. 
Officials determined that two separate trips -- one to Europe and one to the Middle East -- would allow for more time to plan and set a schedule and agenda.

TEL AVIV, Israel—The ongoing war between Israel and Iran across the Middle East came out of the shadows and into the open long ago. 
But now, on the back of several suspected Israeli attacks inside Iran itself, the deadly contest threatens to escalate—possibly beyond the region.
Last week, several quadcopter drones smashed into a suspected Iranian nuclear research and drone facility at Parchin, killing one engineer. Mere days before, two assassins on motorbikes shot dead an Iranian military colonel in the heart of Tehran. In February, several drones hit an Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base in the west of the country at Kermanshah. Although never officially taking responsibility, various unsubtle hints by Israeli officials and media reports have left little doubt as to the provenance of these attacks.

        <updated>2022-06-04T22:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data from the app showed that in 2021, users hosted more than 3,600 bachelorette parties in Scottsdale, compared to about 13,000 in Nashville, said Mike Petrakis, 31, founder and chief executive of Bach.  This year, its data shows that more than 11,600 parties are planned in Scottsdale, compared to 30,000 in Nashville.  If that rate of growth continues in Scottsdale, Mr. Petrakis said, it has the potential to overtake Nashville in terms of bookings.  And on a recent weekend in May, more than one bachelor party attendee said Scottsdale was “the new Nashville.”
Robert Mayer, 35, owner of Arizona Party Bike, said his Scottsdale location began booking a record number of bachelorette parties in the summer of 2020. Brides were looking for a place to celebrate without restrictions pandemics, he added.  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, never enacted a statewide mask mandate and reopened restaurants for indoor dining in May 2020. In Maricopa County , which includes Scottsdale, about 1,200 new Covid cases are currently reported per day.
Mr. Mayer’s company, which features on Bach, runs tours of the Old Town on cart-sized cranksets, charging up to $499 (plus the cost of alcohol) for two-hour private tours for up to 15 people.  His clientele is currently 75% female, with a median age of 28, he said.  Local outfitters of hot air balloons and desert jeep tours are also teeming with groups of women in their twenties singing Katy Perry songs and only occasionally throwing up.
It is perhaps unsurprising that the influx has already caused unrest.  One Saturday in May at the Arizona Party Bike depot in Old Town, Lacy Gray, 27, a company guide, had to explain the rules of the road to a South Dakota bachelor party after her members, sporting candy-colored wigs, took their seats at a neon-pink pedal bar.
An instruction?  No playback requests “‘WAP’, specifically,” Ms. Gray said.  (The song was proactively banned, Mr. Mayer added, after attracting stares from “disgruntled” pedestrians.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was one of the funniest moments of the NBA playoffs.
In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston Celtics reserve guard Payton Pritchard drove into the paint against Miami Heat’s Tyler Herro and take a little jump.  Pritchard then put a hand close to the ground, a common NBA taunt to signify that a defender is too small to guard the taunter.
Pritchard is just over six feet tall and is, in almost every situation in the NBA, the shortest player on the court.  Herro is four inches taller than him.
“The game is competitive, so, I mean there will always be a bit of bickering here and there.“, Pritchard remained impassive in a recent interview.
Usually Pritchard is the recipient of these jeers.
“If you give it, you also have to take it,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[His post-play years were troubled.  In 2014, Barber was detained by police in Mansfield, Texas, also outside of Dallas, and hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.
And according to police reports, he was arrested in 2019 on two counts of criminal mischief for incidents the previous year in which, while jogging, Barber approached two cars different and hit and damaged them.  He pleaded no contest and his sentence included 12 months probation.
Last year, former Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant posted a video of Barber’s plays on Twitter and wrote that “he’s down…we’re just a stat and moments for Most people”.
On Monday, Bryant wrote on Twitter: “Too much to digest, so much to say… This is real life, it can be any one of us. We need each other, we need unity.
Marion Sylvester Barber III was born on June 10, 1983 in Plymouth, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis.  Like his father, Barber played at the University of Minnesota, where he was part of a powerful backfield with Laurence Maroney. Barber rushed for 1,196 yards and 1,269 yards in 2003 and 2004.
The Cowboys selected him in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft.
Football was a family affair for barbers.  In addition to his father, Barber’s brothers, Thomas and Dominique, also played for the University of Minnesota Gophers.  Dominique was a defensive back with the Houston Texans of the NFL.
In a statement Thursday, PJ Fleck, head coach of the Gophers, said, “Marion was one of the best to ever play in Minnesota, and he’s a big reason a lot of people are Gopher fans today.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Bollywood-style dance to henna tattoo workshops, celebrations for Queen Elizabeth’s record-breaking 70-year reign in the northwestern English city of Preston had a multicultural flavour on Saturday. With a population of 140,000 and close to Manchester, Preston is home to a large community with South Asian ancestry, and this year combined its annual festival of subcontinental arts, culture, tradition and heritage with celebrations for the queen’s Platinum Jubilee. To mark the royal landmark, the Preston City Mela, a showcase for all things South Asian since 1997, broadened its scope to include culture from the 54 Commonwealth countries.  “Of course we live in this country and we do love our queen, but it’s nice to have our culture in the spotlight for a change, and all the Commonwealth cultures as well,” Hanifa, a Preston resident of Indonesian origin, told Agence France-Presse. “The atmosphere is so nice and to have all those influences, all these cultures, makes it even nicer,” said the 60-year-old, who was enjoying the day with friends. She said she watched on television as the royal celebrations got under way in central London on Thursday with the Trooping of the Colour military parade, and found it “moving” to see the queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family. Gulab Singh, organiser of the Preston mela, said this year’s curators had tried to align with the jubilee “as much as we can”. “With the Mela, it’s always South Asian art, but we’ve broadened it up to reflect the Commonwealth perspective,” he explained. “This year, we have a cake-cutting ceremony … Cake cutting is sooo British,” added fellow organiser Shreya Ghodke. The Commonwealth is a grouping of mainly former British colonies headed by the queen, who is also head of state in 14 of these countries or realms in addition to the UK. Australia, New Zealand hail Queen Elizabeth as republic question returns Sitting in the sun, 58-year-old Amit Chauhan was getting into the festive mood, eating vegetable samosas and nodding to the music…]]></summary>

Swiatek, an avid reader and excellent student during her high school years, is a particularly thoughtful and committed young champion.  Gauff, the prodigy from Delray Beach, Florida, is a particularly thoughtful and committed finalist, ready to use her athletic success to speak out on social issues, like gun violence in the United States, which she did after her semi-final victory over Martina Trevisan on Thursday.
Just four years ago, they both competed in the French Open women’s tournament, with Gauff winning the title and Swiatek losing in the semi-finals.  But Swiatek, Gauff’s eldest by nearly three years, has since taken center stage on the women’s stage with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1980, Fred Wilpon would buy the team, adding another layer of connective tissue: Wilpon attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn with Dodgers Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax and was a rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fan.  It was under his leadership that Citi Field opened in 2009 with so many Dodgers-related touches — including the enormous Jackie Robinson Rotunda — that some Mets fans complained there were no more winks. in Brooklyn than at the Mets.
The connections would only continue, with Mike Piazza’s Hall of Fame career spanning the franchises and Justin Turner, a crucial member of the current Dodgers squad, having started his career in orange and blue.
Now Steven A. Cohen, who tried to buy the Dodgers in 2012, is calling the Mets shots.  In his first public remarks after buying the Mets, he cited the Dodgers as a model of what he hoped the Mets would become.  He backed that up by pushing the Mets payroll near the top of the sport.
“They’re going to separate themselves from the pack,” said Valentine, who, in keeping with the connective tissue theme, was once married to a daughter of Ralph Branca, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  “Kind of like the Dodgers tried to do when they left town, and the Yankees always have.”
Two of Hodges’ adult children — Gil Jr., 72, and Irene, 71 — plan to be at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, along with two of Irene’s granddaughters and a cousin.  And as the videos roll and the lights flash, the iron steel cable that spans decades and miles will remain as strong as ever.
“Without a doubt, the 1969 World Series was amazing,” says Irene Hodges of her favorite memory.  “Everyone was just thrilled.  All of Brooklyn was crazy.  It was a wonderful moment.  My dad, I think, was a little scared to manage in New York.  He knew how good the fans were here, how much they loved him, and he just wanted to do the right thing for them.  He wanted to have a successful team.  And he did.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An 83-year-old yachtsman arrived in Japan early Saturday morning after a solo, non-stop trip across the Pacific, becoming the oldest person ever to achieve the feat.
Famed ocean adventurer Kenichi Horie's arrival in the Kii Strait off western Japan capped a two-month trip that started from a yacht harbour in San Francisco in March.
It was only the latest seagoing achievement by the Japanese octogenarian, who in 1962 voyaged from Japan to San Francisco at age 23, becoming the first person in the world to sail alone across the Pacific.
The public relations team for his most recent voyage said Horie's Saturday return to Japan made him the world's oldest person to pull off a solo, non-stop crossing of the largest and deepest ocean on Earth.
"I'm about to cross the finish line," Horie wrote on his blog Friday after what he described as a three-day battle with the pushback from a current.
"I'm exhausted."
His 1962 Pacific crossing made headlines as he embarked on the trip without a passport, essentially smuggling his way into the United States.
Sixty years ago, "I was constantly anxious and stressed that I might get caught... My condition was the worst," he blogged in April.
"But this time it's different, I was sent off by many people and have their support through tracking systems and wireless radio. I couldn't be more grateful."
Aside from his 1962 Pacific crossing, Horie is known for sailing around the world solo in 1974 and his longitudinal voyage around the world between 1978 and 1982.
The latest expedition was the first he had undertaken since 2008, when he sailed from Honolulu to the Kii Strait on a wave-powered 31-foot boat.

Discussion of the crackdown is highly sensitive to China's communist leadership.
It has gone to exhaustive lengths to erase Tiananmen from collective memory, omitting it from history textbooks and censoring online discussion.
On June 4, 1989, the government sent troops and tanks to break up peaceful protests, crushing a weeks-long wave of demonstrations calling for political change and curbs on official corruption.
Hundreds, by some estimates more than 1,000, were killed in the crackdown.

What purpose does this international club of nations serve, and what may the future hold? 
With roots in the British empire, the Commonwealth in its modern-day form came about in 1949 with the London Declaration establishing a precedent of member states being “free and equal”. Membership was not contingent on recognizing the British monarch as the head of state. King George VI was the political association’s first head, and Elizabeth II took over in 1952 after her ascension to the throne.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States staged their first combined military exercises involving an American aircraft carrier in more than four years, Seoul's military said on Saturday, amid reports that North Korea was preparing for a nuclear test.
The three-day drills took place in international waters off the Japanese island of Okinawa until Saturday, including air defence, anti-ship, anti-submarine, and maritime interdiction operations, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
The exercises came amid signs that North Korea is gearing up to conduct a nuclear test for the first time since 2017. Seoul officials have said Pyongyang has conducted multiple experiments with a detonation device in preparation for its seventh underground explosion.

Russia was also ready to ensure the export of its own wheat and fertiliser, Sall said after the talks in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on day 100 of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

LONDON (Reuters) - A pop concert, featuring the likes of singers Alicia Keys and Diana Ross, and the Epsom Derby horse race take centre stage on the third day of Britain's nationwide celebrations for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee.
However, the 96-year-old monarch, a huge horse-racing fan and owner of many thoroughbreds, will skip the 243rd running of the Derby because of "episodic mobility problems" which also forced her to miss a thanksgiving service in her honour on Friday.
Her daughter Princess Anne, who competed in the three-day equestrian event in the 1976 Olympics, is expected to stand in for her mother.

An advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has predicted that the war with Russia could last up to half a year longer.
"This could drag on for another two to six months," presidential advisor Mykhailo Podoliak said in an interview with the opposition Russian portal Medusa late on Friday, with the size of weapons stockpiles a key factor.
Another main factor was how the mood in Europe, Ukraine and Russia may change over time, he said.
There would only be peace negotiations, he added, if the situation on the ground changed and Russia no longer felt it could dictate the conditions.
He warned that territorial concessions to Russia would not end the war. Some cities, like Mariupol and now Severodonetsk where the fiercest fighting is taking place, effectively no longer existed, he said.
Podoliak estimated Russian losses at a total of 80,000 people so far. This included dead and wounded among the regular army, the separatists and the mercenary force Wagner.
He said that after a disastrous initial phase of the war for Moscow, with up to 1,000 war dead per day, the current losses of Russian and Ukrainian troops were "comparable."
Zelensky had recently put Ukrainian losses at up to 100 dead and 500 wounded per day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been ordered to appear in a Spanish court to testify about an alleged U.S. plot to kidnap Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, ABC Spain reports.
Last year, Yahoo! News reported that the CIA plotted to kidnap Assange as he was holed up in Ecuador’s embassy in London. 
"Some senior officials inside the CIA and the Trump administration even discussed killing Assange, going so far as to request 'sketches' or 'options' for how to assassinate him," Yahoo! News' report stated. 
"Discussions over kidnapping or killing Assange occurred 'at the highest levels' of the Trump administration, said a former senior counterintelligence official. 'There seemed to be no boundaries.'"
As The Daily Beast points out, Spain’s National Court has also been investigating a Spanish security firm that may have spied on Assange for the CIA while providing security for the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. "
National High Court Judge Santiago Pedraz agreed to summon Pompeo and former U.S. counterintelligence official William Evanina as witnesses to explain whether a plot was drawn up," the Beast reports. "They must appear in June and can testify via videoconference. Pompeo has not yet commented on the ruling."

Los Angeles (AFP) - The Mexican head of a huge church admitted sexually abusing children in the United States on Friday, days before he was scheduled to stand trial.
Naason Joaquin Garcia, the leader of La Luz del Mundo (The Light of the World), which claims millions of members worldwide, pleaded guilty to the assaults on young church members around Los Angeles over a number of years.
"As the leader of La Luz del Mundo, Naason Joaquin Garcia used his power to take advantage of children," California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.
"He relied on those around him to groom congregants for the purposes of sexual assault."
Prosecutors say Garcia, 53, exploited his position of trust to force underage girls to commit sexual acts on him.
During the course of the investigation they alleged Garcia and his co-defendants had told victims that refusing to comply with his wishes would be acting against God.
Garcia had faced a raft of charges relating to alleged wrongdoing up to his arrest at Los Angeles International Airport in 2019.
The preacher, who was charged alongside two other church members, had been due to stand trial, starting on Monday.
But his guilty pleas to three counts mean he will now be sentenced next week, and is expected to face several years' jail.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often stories of genetic theft, or extreme precautions taken to avoid it, make headline news. So it was with a picture of French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin sitting at opposite ends of a very long table after Macron declined to take a Russian PCR COVID-19 test. Many speculated that Macron refused due to security concerns that the Russians would take and use his DNA for nefarious purposes. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz similarly refused to take a Russian PCR COVID-19 test.

While these concerns may seem relatively new, pop star celebrity Madonna has been raising alarm bells about the potential for nonconsensual, surreptitious collection and testing of DNA for over a decade. She has hired cleaning crews to sterilize her dressing rooms after concert…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden confirmed Friday he was considering a trip to Saudi Arabia, which would be a stark reversal after he called for the kingdom to be made a pariah state.
The New York Times and other US media, quoting anonymous sources, have reported that Biden would go ahead with the long-rumored Saudi stop during an upcoming overseas tour.
The reported decision came shortly after Saudi Arabia addressed two of Biden's priorities by agreeing to a production hike in oil -- which could help tame rocketing US inflation -- and helping extend a truce in war-battered Yemen.
"I'm not sure when I'm going," Biden said when asked about reports of an imminent visit. "There is a possibility that I would be going to meet with both the Israelis and some Arab countries at the time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Emmanuel Macron on Friday bestowed France's highest order of merit on the pioneering US tennis great Billie Jean King, as she celebrates the 50th anniversary of her French Open victory.
"In 50 years you have revolutionized international sport, but also equality between women and men and the rights of minorities worldwide," Macron said at the Elysee Palace ceremony.
"Your history is an American dream, one of these destinies that are almost too good to be true," he said.
King, who is attending this year's French Open at Roland Garros, was also honored by the tournament organizers Thursday with a video of fellow legends saluting her title win at the 1972 tournament.
The following year she made history by dominating Bobby Riggs in the "Battle of the Sexes" exhibition match, a key moment as the push for women's rights gained ground.
King was also among the Original Nine female players who defied tennis authorities by creating their own women's circuit to denounce the huge discrepancy in prize money and competition opportunities compared to men.
That led the US open to start offering the same prize money to women as men in 1973, and paved the way for a wave of wealthy female superstars such as Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.
And in 1981, she withstood a fierce backlash after being outed as a lesbian and acknowledging her sexuality, a groundbreaking -- and risky -- stance for an international sports star.
"It was a very difficult moment, but I told the truth. And the next day I lost all my sponsors," she told French television this week.
"I want to thank you for everything you've done for women's tennis and for women," Martina Navratilova said in the French Open video.
"What a beautiful tribute. Thank you," King responded in a tweet.

Several carriages of the red-colored local train were lying on their sides on a grassy area next to a highway.

Rescuers stood on the top-facing side of the carriages, using ladders to climb into the wagons to reach trapped passengers.
"In the serious train accident, as of 3:32 pm (1532 GMT), four people were fatally injured," said police in a statement.
"Around 30 passengers were injured, 15 of them so seriously that they have had to be admitted to nearby hospitals," they said, adding that a huge rescue operation was underway.

Abraham Vazquez, 22, and Vivir Quintana, 32, are two of the new faces of the "corrido" genre that emerged during the Mexican revolution of 1910-1917 to tell an alternative story to the official narrative.
Vazquez, originally from the northern state of Chihuahua, boasts 1.1 million listeners monthly on Spotify.
His rap-infused "narcocorrido" -- a ballad about drug traffickers -- "El de las dos pistolas" (The one with the two guns) has been played 52.8 million times on the digital music platform.

The displaced mayor of the captured Ukrainian city of Mariupol has accused Russia of holding the remaining citizens hostage.
Vadym Boichenko said there are still about 100,000 residents in the city who are unable to flee to safe Ukrainian territory. He believes Russia is keeping them there to make it more difficult for Ukraine to mount a counter-offensive.
"They are being held there by Russian troops and practically used as human shields," he said in Kiev.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kiev is waiting for further weapons to be delivered from the West before trying to liberate more territory.
Boichenko also said that more than 20,000 people had been killed in the fighting around the largely destroyed city of Mariupol.
"This is twice as many as in World War II under German occupation. It is the biggest bloodshed in the history of Mariupol," he said. The figures could not be independently verified. He added that the risk of infection from only partially buried corpses is high.
