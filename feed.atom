Newsweek: U.S. Troops Should be Sent to Ukraine, Third of Americans Say 
Almost a third of Americans support U.S. troops being sent to war-torn Ukraine, according to a new poll. 
A total of 31 percent of eligible voters in the U.S. support or strongly support American military forces heading to the battlefields of Ukraine, polling conducted exclusively for Newsweek by Redfield & Wilton Strategies has revealed. 
A quarter of respondents neither supported nor opposed the idea of sending U.S. soldiers to Ukraine, with 34 percent against the suggestion. Just under one in ten respondents did not know.

The Pentagon said it had no comment to make when contacted by Newsweek about the results of the poll.

After months of grueling advances through minefields, small villages and open steppes, Ukrainian forces are making some progress along two major lines of attack, according to analysts, Ukrainian officials and Russian military bloggers. 
The advances, while small in terms of territory taken, are compelling Moscow to redeploy forces, military analysts say. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, called the advances “tactically significant,” adding that the situation would create new challenges for Russian forces spread across the vast front line.

Bloomberg: Biden fears China's economic problems are ‘ticking time bomb' posing danger to world 
Throws barbs at Xi Jinping in fundraising speech 

President Joe Biden blasted China’s economic problems as a “ticking time bomb” and referred to Communist Party leaders as “bad folks,” his latest barb against President Xi Jinping’s government even as his administration seeks to improve overall ties with Beijing. 
In comments that included several major inaccuracies about the world’s second-largest economy, Biden said at a political fundraiser Aug. 11 that China was in “trouble” because its growth has slowed and it had the “highest unemployment rate going.”
He also blasted Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative as the “debt and noose,” because of the high levels of lending to developing economies associated with the global investment program.

WNU Editor: The US President quoted some inaccurate numbers .... Biden misstates China's GDP growth, calls its economy a 'ticking time bomb' (Reuters). 
As to what is my take on the President's concerns. I am more concerned on where the US economy is going than the Chinese economy.
Update: This is not the best way to approach China if you want better ties .... China is run by ‘bad folks’ – Biden (RT).

Air & Space Forces Magazine: USAF, Northrop Test New Tech That Lets the B-2 Update Mission Parameters ‘In Seconds’ 
 Northrop Grumman and the Air Force successfully demonstrated a new mission update system for the B-2 bomber in a two-day event at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., last month. 
The system receives new mission parameters and feeds them directly into the B-2’s computers without the need for the pilots to manually input the data. 
The Integrated Airborne Mission Transfer (IAMT) demonstration started July 18 after B-2 No. 1086, the Spirit of Kitty Hawk, was fitted with Northrop’s Multi-Mission Domain (MMD) open-mission architecture, meant to make adding new mission capabilities easier.

West African leaders on Thursday ramped up the rhetoric against Niger’s coup leaders, ordering the “activation” and the “deployment” of a regional standby force to restore constitutional order in the coup-hit country. 
Meeting in Abuja, Nigeria after the expiration of the one-week ultimatum they gave to the Niger’s military junta, leaders from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a deployment “to restore constitutional order in the Republic of Niger,” according to a statement read by Omar Alieu Touray, President of the ECOWAS Commission. 
 It was not immediately clear what the “deployment” and “activation” of the force would entail. 
The statement also emphasized a “determination to keep all options on the table for the peaceful resolution of the crisis.”

TAIPEI
(Taiwan News) — The Ministry of National Defense (MND) tracked 33 Chinese military aircraft and six naval ships around Taiwan between 6 a.m. on Wednesday (Aug. 9) and 6 a.m. on Thursday (Aug. 10). 
Of the 33 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, six J-10 Chengdu combat jets and two Shenyang J-16 fighter jets crossed the Taiwan Strait median line in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND. 
Meanwhile, one Shaanxi Y-8 anti-submarine warfare plane and one Shaanxi Y-9 plane flew into the southwest sector of the ADIZ.

In response, Taiwan sent aircraft, naval ships, and used land-based missile systems to monitor PLA activity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Six suspects linked to assassination of Ecuadorian presidential candidate Francisco Villavicencio identified as Colombian nationals, including one facing murder and drug trafficking charges 
* Colombian nationals Andrés Mosquera; José López; Adey García; Jules Castaño; and Jhon Rodríguez are in custody for the murder of Francisco Villavicencio 
* The name of a sixth suspect, also Colombian, has not been released; a seventh suspect, also Colombian, was killed in a shootout with police Wednesday 
* Villavicencio, an Ecuadorian presidential candidate, was shot moments after he walked out of a campaign event in Quito on Wednesday 
Six suspects linked to the assassination of Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio have been identified as Colombian nationals, the government revealed Thursday. 
The government added that the six men, who are in custody, are members of criminal organizations, but did not specify which ones they belong to. 
The apprehensions took place following the murder of Villavicencio as he walked out of a campaign event in the northern province of Quito on Wednesday night, less than two weeks before the elections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Joe DINED with oligarchs who paid Hunter: New bank records detail part of the $20 MILLION in foreign cash to Biden family - including $142,000 from Kazakh oligarch to president's son that he used to buy Porsche after DC dinner 
* Bank records confirm Hunter bought the sportscar after $142,000 wire was sent 
* Details how Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina sent $3.5m to a shell company 
* Republicans say Devon Archer and Hunter used firm to 'hide' foreign payments 
New detailed bank records show $20 million in payments to the Biden family and their partners from foreign actors in places like Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan during Joe's time as vice president. 
House Oversight Republicans released documents suggesting Hunter and his former business partner Devon Archer used shell companies to 'hide' millions in payments from overseas companies and oligarchs - though none of the newly released records directly link payments to Joe Biden. 
The new evidence backs up Archer's bombshell testimony to the committee that Hunter was raking in large amounts of cash from foreign deals, and how his father Joe was present in-person during dinner meetings and sat in on at least 20 phone calls with foreign associates.

"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.
Organisers had insisted the event would continue but on Monday the World Organization of the Scout Movement said Seoul had told …]]></summary>

The US sailors and Marines entered the Red Sea on Sunday after transiting through the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the US Navy's Fifth Fleet said in a statement.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
