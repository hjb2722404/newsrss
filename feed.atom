        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 28,000 prisoners including murderers, violent sexual criminals and those guilty of grievous bodily harm have been freed from jails to fight for Vladimir Putin in his war in Ukraine, it is claimed. The scheme has so far led to the release of more than five percent of the entire male prison population in Russia as the Kremlin steps up recruitment of inmates after suffering a humiliating defeat against Ukraine 's army in the east of the country.   
Daily Mail: More than 28,000 prisoners including murderers, rapists and thugs - one in 20 of Russia's entire jail population - have been freed to fight in Ukraine 
* One in 20 Russian prisoners offered freedom deal to fight for Putin in Ukraine 
* They must survive six months on the front lines in exchange for a pardon 
* Oligarch behind the Wagner Group PMC seen in video making prison sales pitch 
* Soldiers are expected to blow themselves up than surrender and deserters shot 
* Recruitment stepped up after disastrous Russian losses in east of Ukraine 
More than 28,000 prisoners including murderers, rapists and those guilty of grievous bodily harm have been freed from jails to fight for Vladimir Putin in his war in Ukraine, it is claimed. 
The scheme has so far led to the release of more than five percent of the entire male prison population in Russia as the Kremlin steps up recruitment of inmates after suffering a humiliating defeat against Ukraine's army in the east of the country.
The astonishing figure - revealed by independent Volya Telegram channel - is far higher than previous estimates of released prisoners fighting for Russia in Ukraine.

WNU editor: Ukraine says they are fighting prisoners .... Ukraine Soldiers Say They Are Fighting Prisoners, Not Soldiers (VOA). U.S. officials say many are refusing .... Russian mercenaries want felons to go fight Putin's war in Ukraine, but many are refusing, US official says (Insider). As to what is my take. I am surprised that they got 5% of the Russian prison population to commit.]]></summary>

The Guardian: Germany’s Die Linke on verge of split over sanctions on Russia 
Leftwing party’s future in balance after series of resignations, as former co-leader calls coalition ‘stupidest government in Europe’ 
Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing party’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. 
The German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats.

Update: Die Linke lawmaker: Russia sanctions causing ‘social and economic catastrophe’ in Germany (People's World)   
WNU Editor: If Die linke (The Left) leaves the coalition, the German government will collapse (see distribution of Bundestag seats here). And while I do not think this is going to happen right now, I would not be surprised that if economic conditions worsen in the winter months and protests mount, we may see the German government fracture and fall apart.

CBC/Reuters: Moscow summons Canada envoy, says Russian Embassy was attacked in Ottawa 
Russia's Foreign Ministry says unknown person unsuccessfully threw Molotov cocktail onto the embassy grounds 
Russia's Foreign Ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian Embassy in Ottawa, the ministry said on Monday. 
It said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail onto the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Ottawa. It also said  "aggressive" demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy. 
Russian Ambassador to Canada Oleg Stepanov was quoted in Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik on Monday as saying that the bottle was thrown early on the morning of Sept. 12 but didn't ignite. The embassy should have a permanent police presence, he is quoted as saying.

WNU Editor: I am surprised .... stunned really .... that there is no permanent police presence outside the embassy. Canada has a large Ukrainian and Russian immigrant population, and tensions between the two sides are the worse that I have ever seen. 
My own church is thinking of hiring security because of threats that only got worse when the Canadian government imposed sanctions on the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in July .... Canada Imposes Sanctions On The Head Of The Russian Orthodox Church (July 10, 2022).

The Taliban have released a US engineer they had held hostage since 2020 in exchange for an Afghan tribal leader held in US custody since 2005. 
Mark Frerichs was handed over at Kabul airport on Monday, the Taliban said.  In return they received Bashir Noorzai, a Taliban ally serving a life sentence for drug trafficking. 
US President Joe Biden said that the swap required "difficult decisions" that he did not take lightly. 
Mr Frerichs, 60, was abducted by the Taliban the year before the group swept back to power in Afghanistan and its Western-backed government collapsed. 
He had been living and working in Kabul as a civil engineer for 10 years. 
Mr Frerich's sister, Charlene Cakora, said the family had never given up hope of getting him back.

“We’re coming to a point right now where I think Putin is going to have to revise what his objectives are for this operation,” Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier said. 
He also emphasized that it is now quite clear that Putin "is not going to be able to do what he initially intended to do."  “He’s coming to a decision point,” Berrier said. 
 “What that decision will be, we don't know. But that will largely drive how long this conflict lasts.”

Update: US Military Intel Chief Says Putin Can't Achieve Ukraine Goal (VOA/AP)   
WNU Editor: I think Putin's objectives will remain the same. What will be different is how will he achieve them. Last week's missile strikes on civilian infrastructure tells me that Russia will soon be targeting civilian infrastructure such as electricity, communication, water, and rail/bridge networks.

Such an upgrade will mean pouring in more resources into the war, as well as expanding the target list for the military.]]></summary>

President Joe Biden said “the pandemic is over” in discussing Covid during an interview that aired on Sunday evening on CBS’ “60 Minutes.” 
“The pandemic is over,” the president told Scott Pelley as they talked last week at the Detroit Auto Show. 
“We still have a problem with Covid. We’re still doing a lot of work on it ... but the pandemic is over. If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it’s changing.” 
Despite Biden’s statement, Covid has continued to exact a toll in the United States and around the world. The John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center lists more than 2 million Covid cases in the country in the last 28 days, with hundreds dying from the disease every day.

(Bloomberg) -- Turkey is seeking membership to the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attempts to forge alliances with friendly countries in the East. 
Erdogan made the announcement after attending the SCO summit in Uzbekistan on Friday where he held talks with leaders including China’s President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
A successful bid would make Turkey the first member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to join the bloc. 
 “Our relationship with these countries will be moved to a much different position with this step,” Erdogan said about the SCO when he spoke with reporters in the city of Samarkand where the summit was held, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.

Hungary can “no longer be considered a full democracy,” the European Parliament said in a statement following its adoption of a report on Thursday. 
The Parliament said the situation has “deteriorated such that Hungary has become an ‘electoral autocracy.’” 
“Overall, [The European Parliament] expresses regrets that the lack of decisive EU action has contributed to a breakdown of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary, and turning one of its member states into hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,” the report read. 
“There is increasing consensus among experts that Hungary is no longer a democracy,” the report added.

A man with a gun that turned out to be a toy was arrested after holding up a Lebanese bank in the southern city of Ghazieh, a security source said. 
Also on Friday morning, an armed man entered a branch of BLOM bank in the Lebanese capital's Tariq al-Jdideh neighborhood seeking his deposit, the bank told Reuters in a statement, adding that the situation was under control.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s condition was said to be critical last week after surgery due to bowel obstruction, but to have improved in recent days

Khamenei’s health deteriorated early last week when he began experiencing severe stomach pains, the report said, citing four people familiar with the matter. 
The supreme leader had surgery at a makeshift clinic set up in his home, and his office canceled all public appearances for the rest of the week.

So, royal watchers anticipate Monday's funeral for Queen Elizabeth II will be a blend of grand spectacle and personal grief not seen in generations. Correspondent Seth Doane talks with former BBC anchor Jon Sopel and professor Pauline Maclaren about what to expect from Monday's service at Westminster Abbey, which has been decades in the planning. (Watch the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II live on CBS Monday, September 19 beginning at 5:30 a.m. ET, or online at cbsnews.com, and on the CBS News mobile app. You may also stream live via Paramount+.)]]></summary>

“We have people from such a broad range, every state and territory being represented here – people from Indigenous backgrounds, people from different backgrounds that reflects our multicultural nation,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Australia in an exclusive interview ahead of his meeting with King Charles III. 

“I’m very proud to have had the opportunity to be here, and it does say something about the late sovereign, Her Majesty, that … this planning was put in place a long while ago," he said.

“Her Majesty had input into the service that will take place on Monday, including the nature of the representation and that’s why we have followed the protocol to the letter, including the invite to ten Australians who’d made a contribution to their community.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says Queen Elizabeth II developed a relationship with Australia “that was so important”.

“Her first visit was almost two months long and she visited dozens of cities and towns right around our vast continent, it was the first of her 16 visits,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Australia in an exclusive interview ahead of his meeting with King Charles III. 

“And during that period she met, of course, prominent Australians, but she also met everyday Australians.”

Mr Albanese said this was part of a six-month world tour around the Commonwealth.

“During that period, Queen Elizabeth was a regular visitor to our shores and she engaged with some 16 prime ministers, 16 governors-general, so this was a period of massive change in which the Queen was a constant reassuring presence.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BELGRADE (Reuters) - Police clashed with right-wing protesters on Saturday as several thousand people joined an LGBTQ march in Serbia to mark the end of EuroPride week, an event staged in a different European city each year.
Police clashed with two right-wing groups trying to disrupt the march, Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said, adding that 10 police officers were slightly injured, five police cars damaged and 64 protesters arrested.
"I am very proud that we managed to avoid more serious incidents," Brnabic, who herself is Serbia's first gay prime minister, told reporters.
Following protests by nationalists and religious groups, the government had banned the march last week. But faced with calls by European Union officials and human rights activists, it allowed a shortened route for the march.
Those participating walked several hundred metres to the Tsmajdan stadium where a concert took place.
The United States' ambassador to Serbia, Christopher Hill, and the European parliament's special rapporteur for Serbia, Vladimir Bilcik, joined the march.
Previous Serbian governments have banned Pride parades, drawing criticism from human rights groups and others. Some Pride marches in the early 2000s met with fierce opposition and were marred by violence.
But recent Pride marches in Serbia have passed off peacefully, a change cited by EuroPride organisers as one reason Belgrade was chosen as this year's host. Copenhagen was the host in 2021.
Serbia is a candidate to join the EU, but it must first meet demands to improve the rule of law and its record on human and minority rights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This rare Wisconsin home has never changed hands – until now. 
A pastoral Mount Pleasant mansion built by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1954 has gone up for sale for the first time – and its broker has been inundated with calls. 
“I don’t expect it to last into the weekend,” said Re/Max Newport Elite’s Anthony Veranth Crain’s company in Chicago of the low-slung property, which hit the market on Saturday.  By Tuesday, he said, he had already scheduled a dozen screenings. 
The six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is asking $725,000 for the “rare opportunity to own a work by America’s most prominent architect.”  Buyers should expect to pay a bit above the list price, as Veranth warns that the home, while well-maintained over the years, needs roof repairs, among other updates.  Including those in the payment puts the figure between $900,000 and $1 million, he told Crain’s. 
Built by Wright for the family behind consumer chemicals company Johnson Wax, the 3-acre property is currently owned by a trust linked to the great-granddaughter of company founder Samuel Curtis Johnson.  This great-granddaughter, Karen Johnson Boyd, commissioned the house from Wright and lived there until her death in 2016. Her widower, Bill Boyd, died in 2020. 
Members of the Johnson family were big fans of Wright and commissioned him at least two other properties: their headquarters and a vacation home. 
The main house is 4,978 square feet and sits on a ravine bluff overlooking Wisconsin’s Root River.  It is located approximately 77 miles north of downtown Chicago. 
“The dramatic and expansive Great Hall cantilevered over the ravine, emphasizing the continuity between indoors and outdoors”, claims the list of the complex, “blending with nature and maximizing the views”.  All but one of the six bedrooms have an en-suite bathroom and a balcony overlooks the main living space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oktoberfest, Germany's famed beer festival which draws millions of visitors from around the world, opened Saturday in Munich after a two-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In its 200-year history, the world's biggest folk festival has been cancelled just 26 times, mostly due to World Wars I and II but also twice due to cholera outbreaks.
The last time the festival was held in 2019, the 6.3 million guests drank more than 7.3 million liters of German beer.
Munich mayor Didier Reiter kicked off the ceremony by opening a beer keg with a hammer blow and offering the first tankard to the head of the regional government Markus Soeder.
The festival will run until October 3 with no restrictions and no face masks will be necessary.
Oktoberfest generates about 1.2 billion euros in income. Beer occupies cult status in Germany and especially in Bavaria, where Munich is located.
Germans are among Europe's heaviest beer drinkers with an annual average consumption of 84 liters in 2021.
On Friday, the German Brewers' Federation DBB told the government of the numerous challenges it was facing due to the war in Ukraine, including skyrocketing energy prices and disruptions in the supply chain.
"The government must react... Without speedy state intervention and aid, hundreds of enterprises in the German beverages sector will disappear and thousands will become jobless."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's weather agency on Saturday warned of a "very dangerous" typhoon heading towards the country's southern Kyushu island, urging residents to evacuate before powerful wind hits the area.
Typhoon Nanmadol was carrying gusts up to 270 kilometers on Saturday near the remote Minami Daito island, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Okinawa island, the weather agency said.
The storm is expected to approach or make landfall on Sunday in the southern Kagoshima prefecture in Kyushu, then move north the following day before heading towards the main Japanese island.
"There are risks of unprecedented storms, high waves, storm surges, and record rainfall," Ryuta Kurora, the head of the Japan Meteorological Agency's forecast unit, told reporters.
"Maximum caution is required," he said, urging residents to evacuate early.
"It's a very dangerous typhoon."
Kurora said the weather agency was likely to issue the highest alert for Kagoshima later in the evening.
"The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse," he said, also warning of flooding and landslides.
Japan is currently in typhoon season and is hit by around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.
Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The British government urged people on Saturday not to travel to join the queue to file past the coffin of Queen Elizabeth as the huge demand means people are having to stand in line for at least 24 hours to reach her lying-in-state.
Tens of thousands of people have already filed past the coffin in a steady, solemn stream, queuing for hours through the dark and cold to pay their respects to Britain's longest-reigning monarch - a testimony to the affection in which she was held.
On Saturday the culture department said it would pause entry to the queue if demand became too high, adding at 1 a.m. (0000 GMT): "Please do not travel."
The death of the queen on Sept. 8 at her summer estate in the Scottish highlands has sparked an outpouring of emotion across the country and 10 days of highly chor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight Namibian cheetahs arrived in India Saturday, decades after their local extinction, in an ambitious project to reintroduce the spotted big cats that has divided experts on its prospects.
Officials say the project is the world's first intercontinental relocation of cheetahs, the planet's fastest land animal.
The five females and three males were moved from a game park in Namibia aboard a chartered Boeing 747 dubbed "Cat plane" for an 11-hour flight.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over the release at Kuno National Park, a wildlife sanctuary 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of New Delhi selected for its abundant prey and grasslands.
"Today the cheetah has returned to the soil of India," Modi said in a video address after their arrival, which coincided with the leader's 72nd birthd…]]></summary>

Lee spoke to AFP just days after making history as the first foreign-language performer to win the Emmy for best actor in a drama with "Squid Game" -- the most-watched Netflix show of all time.
"As a piece of work that is not in English that we're able to bring to the global audience, we're very happy about that," said Lee.
"Even from Korea everybody was so happy and they were sending me congratulating messages," he said during an interview at the Toronto film festival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea on Friday denounced North Korea's first-use nuclear doctrine announced this month as "escalatory and destabilizing" and Washington vowed to continue to deploy and exercise strategic assets to deter and respond to Pyongyang.
The countries issued a joint statement after a meeting of the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) at vice ministerial level in Washington, the first convening of the body since 2018.
The statement said the countries "expressed their serious concern over the DPRK's escalatory and destabilizing messaging related to nuclear weapons use, including its adoption of the new nuclear policy law" and "committed to continue efforts to employ all elements of both countries' national power to strengthen the Alliance deterrence posture."
"The United States committed to strengthen coordination with the ROK to continue to deploy and exercise strategic assets in the region in a timely and effective manner to deter and respond to the DPRK and enhance regional security," the statement said, referring to South Korea and North Korea by the initials of their official names.
Last week, North Korea officially enshrined the right to use preemptive nuclear strikes to protect itself in a new law that leader Kim Jong Un said makes its nuclear status "irreversible" and bars denuclearization talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sixty-two million years ago, a mother gave birth to a baby. Overcoming the shock of birth in a matter of minutes, the baby began to explore the world around it. The baby started to suckle from its mother, a natural instinct shared by all animals of its kind, the mammals.

Each day it grew, and after a month or two, it began feeding for itself on a diet of shoots and leaves. It would have become independent shortly after, but tragedy struck. After only two-and-a-half months, it died. 
But this baby’s story doesn’t end there. Because 62 million years later, its distant cousins (humans) would discover its skeleton, fossilised in the harsh desert of New Mexico, in the south west of the US. 
It’s classified as a species of early mammal, a bear-like animal called Pantolambda bathmodon. The group…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's president on Friday decreed a law imposing prison terms for spreading false information or rumours online, a move immediately denounced by the main journalists' union as an assault on freedom of speech.
President Kais Saied had said he would uphold the rights and freedoms won by Tunisians in a 2011 revolution that brought democracy after his moves last summer to seize most powers and shut down the elected parliament.
His new law on Friday, issued as a presidential decree, provided for prison terms of five years for spreading false news, false information or rumours with the aim of attacking others, harming public security or generating terror.
If the target of the false information or rumours is an official, the prison term can be 10 years, his new law said.
"The decree is a new setback for rights and freedoms. The penalties for publishing in any networks are a strong blow to the revolutionary values that granted freedom to all journalists and all Tunisians," said Mahdi Jlassi, the journalists' union head.
Jlassi added that the new law was reminiscent of those used by the late autocratic president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to crack down on dissenting opponents.
Since Tunisia's 2011 revolution, its media has become one of the most open of any Arab state, with even the state-owned news agency frequently reporting criticism of the authorities.
Activists on social media sites criticised Saied's decree, describing it as an effort to destroy those hard-won freedoms. Others mocked it, saying they would only publish sports news or art on their social media accounts.
Saied's critics accuse him of having launched a coup last summer when he seized executive authority, moving to one-man rule with a series of decrees that he enshrined in a constitution passed by a referendum in July.
Saied has denied acting unlawfully and says his actions were needed to save Tunisia from years of stagnation and political paralysis.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's police force said the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth will be the biggest security operation it has ever undertaken as prime ministers, presidents and royals come together on Monday to pay their respects to Britain's longest-reigning monarch.
The queen's funeral is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people to London's streets, echoing other important events in Britain's history, including her coronation in 1953, the funeral of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965 and the death of Princess Diana in 1997.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A young Iranian woman, who was in a coma after being arrested by the Islamic republic's morality police, died on Friday, state media reported.
"Unfortunately, she died and her body was transferred to the medical examiner's office," state television reported.
Mahsa Amini, 22, was on a visit to Tehran with her family when she was detained by the specialist police unit that enforces the strict dress code obligatory for women since shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979.
In a statement Thursday, Tehran police confirmed Amini had been detained with other women for "instruction" about the rules.
"She suddenly suffered a heart problem while in the company of others receiving guidance (and) was immediately taken to hospital with the cooperation of the emergency services," it said.
Earlier, President Ebrahim Raisi ordered the interior minister to open an inquiry into the case.
Several lawmakers said they would raise the case in parliament while the judiciary said it would form a special task force to investigate.
Amini's death comes amid growing controversy both inside and outside Iran over the conduct of the morality police, known formally as the Gasht-e Ershad (Guidance Patrol).
In July, a video of a woman standing in front of one of the force's vans pleading for her daughter's release went viral on social media.
The veiled woman kept holding on to the van as it pulled off, only being thrown clear after it gathered speed.
The mandatory dress code, which applies to all nationalities and religions, not just Iranian Muslims, requires women to conceal their hair and neck with a headscarf.
Over the decades, women have increasingly pushed back, particularly in the big cities, wearing their headscarves far back on their head to reveal their hair.]]></summary>

After the start of Moscow's invasion on February 24, signals have emerged that many Russian soldiers have no clear idea of the war's goals with some initially thinking they were simply being mustered for maneuvres.
"The Russian army is an army of lies," General Thierry Burkhard, chief of the French armed forces, told AFP as early as May.
"People lied by saying that the Ukrainian army wouldn't fight, that Russia's forces were ready for war, that their leaders knew how to command," he said.

While organic matter has been found on the Red Planet before, the new discovery is seen as especially promising because it came from an area where sediment and salts were deposited into a lake -- conditions where life could have arisen.
"It is very fair to say that these are going to be, these already are, the most valuable rock samples that have ever been collected," David Shuster, a Perseverance return sample scientist, told reporters during a briefing.

France's DGAC civil aviation authority said 16 airports were operating a skeleton service, as were traffic control centers guiding planes overflying French territory at high altitude.
But several regional airports were closed and the DGAC warned of "cancellations and significant delays across the country".
At Paris' enormous Charles de Gaulle hub, only a few cancellations were listed on departures boards among morning flights mostly going ahead, and staff in high-visibility vests were directing passengers.

Westminster Abbey has space for around 2,000 people, so only heads of state and one or two guests have reportedly been invited to Britain's first state funeral for six decades.
A handful of countries have meanwhile not been invited to the funeral due to political considerations -- sparking a furious outburst in at least one case.
Here are some of the key guests, and some who did not make the list:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least eight people have been killed by torrential overnight rains and floods in the central Italian region of Marche, authorities said on Friday, as rescuers continued to search for four people missing. 
Around 400 millimeters of rain fell within two to three hours, inundating the streets of several towns around the region's capital Ancona on the Adriatic coast.
"It was like an earthquake," Ludovico Caverni, the mayor of the town of Serra Sant'Abbondio, told RAI state radio.
Footage released by fire brigades showed rescuers on rafts trying to evacuate people in the seaside town of Senigallia, while others attempted to clear an underpass of debris.
Stefano Aguzzi, head of civil protection at Marche's regional government, said the downpour was far stronger than had been forecast.
"We were given a normal alert for rain, but nobody had expected anything like this," he told reporters. The head of the national civil protection agency Fabrizio Curcio was heading to Ancona to assess the damage, while party chiefs campaigning for Italy's September 25 election expressed their solidarity.
Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party said it would suspend campaigning in Marche "in a sign of mourning" and in order to allow its local activists to fully participate in efforts to help the flood-hit communities.

Comet Leonard was discovered by G.J. Leonard on 3 January 2021. It made its closest pass on 12 December 2021 and, having left the Solar System, won’t be seen from Earth again. On 25 December 2021, a dramatic tail disconnection event happened. A piece of Comet Leonard’s tail was pinched off and carried away by the solar wind. 

“Astronomy, myth and art come together beautifully in this shot. It holds great value to scientists, as it elegantly captures a disconnection event. Yet this photograph, which was taken on Christmas Day, seems to tell an otherworldly story too – it could be the Star of Bethlehem, an angel or a fairy soaring through the night sky.” – Imad Ahmed

		Hundreds of bodies were found in the Kiev suburb of Bucha after Russian troops withdrew in early April. Russian soldiers have been accused of committing war crimes against civilians there.

Some 22 individuals and two entities were added to the Treasury's blacklist, including justice officials in occupied Crimea and members of Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Kadyrov's family.
In a parallel move, the Treasury and US Commerce Department banned the export of quantum computing services, hardware and software to Russia and Belarus in a move the Treasury said would degrade Moscow's ability to rebuild its military after heavy losses in the continuing war with Ukraine.

The woman, named as Mahsa Amini, 22, was on a visit to the Iranian capital with her family when she was detained by the special police unit that enforces the strict dress rules for women, including the compulsory headscarf.
Her brother Kiaresh told the Iran Wire news website that while he was waiting outside the police station for her to be released an ambulance drove out taking her to hospital.
He was told that she had had a heart attack and a brain seizure and was now in a coma.
"There were only two hours between her arrest and being taken to hospital," he said.

Rockets bombing skyscrapers, rolling tanks, soldiers shooting soldiers, children squatting with fearful faces in air-raid shelters and in front of destroyed houses: The scenes depicted in the drawings of the travelling exhibition now on display in a German state parliament are a lot to take in.
They were drawn by children living through Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began more than half a year ago.
