Moscow Times/AFP: Poland Detains Russian Hockey Player Suspected of Spying for Moscow 
Poland said Friday it arrested a Russian ice hockey player on suspicion of having spied for Moscow while playing for a Polish club, prompting Russia to protest and demand an "immediate" explanation. 
Relations between Warsaw and Moscow have been hostile historically but have reached new lows during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Poland being one of Kyiv's staunchest allies. 
Warsaw said the man was the fourteenth person arrested in what it called a spy ring taking orders from Moscow. 
"All of them were identified as foreigners from beyond the eastern border of the Republic of Poland," Warsaw's ABW secret services said, without clarifying if all of the suspects were Russian citizens. 
 "The entire group was used by the Russians to conduct intelligence activities, including monitoring railway routes, as well as spreading propaganda against NATO, Poland and the policies of the Polish government," it added.

Zero Hedge: Biden Picks Up After Journalist Calls Secret Burner Phone Revealed In Hunter Scandal 
On Sunday, investigative journalist and Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer revealed that Hunter Biden had been paying for a secret global phone from AT&T to the tune of $300 per month.
"We know from the laptop that Hunter Biden's business paid for a private phone line that Joe Biden used while he was vice president," Schweizer told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. 
"It was from AT&T, it was $300 a month, it was a global phone where you could access somebody anywhere around the world."

* Russian president lapped up praise from a fervent crowd in Dagestan last night 
* It is the first time since before the pandemic he has attended such an event 
* His uncharacteristic behaviour has fuelled speculation it was a body double 
Vladimir Putin has been consolidating support in Russia following last week's failed Wagner rebellion with a rare meet-and-greet that saw him cheered by a crowd as he posed for selfies with young girls. 
Footage from last night's event - a presidential appearance during a trip to the city of Derbent in the Dagestan region of southern Russia - showed how he dived into a nighttime crowd like a Hollywood actor at a red carpet show. 
Seemingly imbued with fresh energy after averting a small scale civil war last week, the normally stoic and isolated Putin was uncharacteristically personable, shaking hands and planting kisses on the head of a young teenage girl who gushed over him and pleaded with her mother to snap a photo of her with the president.

WNU Editor: Like every other politician in the world, these events are 95% staged. 
And as to rumors that this was a body double. IMHO that is Putin in the above video.

Daily Mail: Bizarre moment Biden, 80, walks off at end of live MSNBC interview where he was asked about the Supreme Court, January 6, Trump and John McCain - but wasn't questioned about son Hunter, bribery claims or his health 
* President Joe Biden sat down with MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace Thursday 
* He got up and walked off set while she was still on-air 
* Biden traveled to New York to raise funds for his 2024 bid 
President Joe Biden walked off the set of a live MSNBC interview Thursday afternoon, while the cameras were still rolling. 
The president took a day trip to New York City to raise money for his presidential campaign. 
His first stop, however, was to '30 Rock,' to sit for an interview with Deadline: White House host Nicolle Wallace, who previously worked for Republicans including President George W. Bush and the late Sen. John McCain.

New York — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that no new nuclear agreement was on the table with Iran, after quiet new diplomacy between the adversaries. 
"There is no agreement in the offing, even as we continue to be willing to explore diplomatic paths," Blinken said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
"We'll see by their actions," Blinken said of the future relationship, calling on Iran to choose to "not take actions that further escalate the tensions" with the United States and in the Middle East. 
President Joe Biden took office with hopes of returning to a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that was scrapped by his predecessor, Donald Trump. But EU-mediated talks collapsed and mass protests in Iran made Washington increasingly hesitant to strike a deal with the clerical state.

Conflict deaths are higher than they have ever been this century with over 238,000 people killed in conflicts last year. 
Since the 21st century began, war has never cost humanity so much. The number of conflict deaths almost doubled in 2022 compared to the previous year. And war caused a 13% loss of global GDP, according to the Global Peace Index, released on Wednesday by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP). 
The major new survey by the global think tank said that the average level of "global peacefulness" had sunk for the ninth year in a row, with conflict deaths topping the previous global peak reached in 2014 during the Syrian Civil War. 
The dramatic increase in death rates was mostly driven by the war in Ukraine, where 83,000 people were killed in the past year, though the bloodiest conflict was in Ethiopia, where 100,000 people lost their lives.

Politico: Stoltenberg to stay on as NATO chief another year 
The move ‘will be formalized next week,’ a European diplomat said, ahead of the NATO summit in Lithuania. 
 Jens Stoltenberg is set to stay on as NATO’s chief for another year, four people familiar with the decision told POLITICO. 
A U.S. official said the secretary general’s leadership extension is “a done deal.” Asked if that was the case, a senior diplomat from Western Europe said “yes,” adding it “will be formalized next week.” A senior diplomat from Eastern Europe and a senior NATO official also confirmed there is consensus within the alliance for an extension.
The officials were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to preview the move before the official announcement. A spokesperson for NATO didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The move to retain Stoltenberg was widely rumored and expected ahead of a major NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania next month, billed as one of the most important alliance gatherings in years amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

The vessel passed over sensitive military sites before being downed in February. 
The Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean in early February was built, at least partly, using American off-the-shelf parts, a U.S. official has confirmed to ABC News. 
The official could not say whether any of the American gear was sold illicitly to China but said determining whether any of it came from illegal trade was a topic of serious concern among officials since some items -- like chips -- are forbidden to sell to certain markets.
Later Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said that the balloon not only did not transmit data back to China -- it never collected any.

Paris CNN — Parisian suburbs imposed curfews on Thursday as France saw a third night of protests across the country following the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy that was captured on video. 
France’s elite police force, the RAID, were deployed to the cities of Bordeaux, Lyon, Roubaix and Lille, to help contain the protests.
 Confrontations flared up between protesters and police in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre – where the 17-year-old named Nahel was killed days before – and in the southern port city of Marseille, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. 
Amid burning debris, “vengeance pour Nael” appeared to be spray painted on a wall in Nanterre, which translates to “revenge for Nael” in reference to the slain teenager, according to footage from the suburb.

Daily Wire: Biden Denies Taking Part In Son’s Alleged Shakedown Of Chinese Businessman 
 President Joe Biden denied taking part in his son’s alleged shakedown of a Chinese businessman recently revealed in a 2017 WhatsApp message.

Reporters questioned Biden over the WhatsApp message, revealed last week by IRS whistleblowers who investigated the president’s son’s tax affairs, at the White House on Wednesday. 
The president has so far refused to comment at length about the message that allegedly ties him with his son’s dealings with foreign agents.

“How involved were you in your son’s Chinese shake-down text message? Were you sitting there? Were you involved?” a reporter asked the president.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kremlin said Thursday that footage, which could not be verified, apparently showing President Vladimir Putin greeting adoring supporters proved that he has "astounding" support after quelling an armed insurrection.
Moscow has insisted that Putin's long rule has not been weakened after Wagner mercenaries marched hundreds of kilometers -- almost reaching Moscow -- and captured military facilities in southern Russia, appearing to gain some support.
Putin is rarely seen meeting ordinary Russians, especially since the Covid pandemic, which saw him observe strict isolation rules, with some of those restrictions still in place.
Moscow late on Wednesday released footage of Putin walking up to a cheering group of mostly women in Derbent, an ancient city in the Dagestan region of southern Russia.
"In Derbent, there was an astounding demonstration of support and happiness of the local population," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.
He said Putin "could not refuse" greeting the crowd.
Surrounded by men in suits and a cameraman, the 70-year-old leader reached out over a barrier to shake people's hands.
Then, with his jacket off, he waved goodbye and blew a kiss to the crowd, before getting in a car.
The Kremlin, which has not mentioned Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin by name since his mutiny, has insisted that Putin has not been weakened by the rebellion.
"The data we have show the prevailing and dominating support of the president and the special military operation," Peskov said Thursday using Moscow's official term for the conflict in Ukraine.
Putin has insisted that the mutineers did not galvanize support during their rebellion.
He initially condemned the rebelling Wagner fighters as traitors and vowed tough punishment but after the mutiny was halted, Putin allowed the fighters to go back to their homes, join the regular army or go into exile in Belarus.

FOX News: Biden tells reporters Putin is 'clearly losing the war in Iraq' in latest gaffe: 'Totally lost the plot' 
President Biden made a similar comment the night before at a fundraiser

President Biden faced criticism on social media Wednesday over an apparent gaffe when he claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is currently "losing the war in Iraq." 
"It’s hard to tell, but he’s clearly losing the war in Iraq," Biden told a reporter outside the White House on Wednesday when asked "to what extent" Putin has been weakened by recent events in Russia, including a reported attempt at a mercenary coup. 
"He's losing the war at home, and he has become a bit of a pariah around the world," Biden added.

A tech firm and university in Tokyo have teamed up to produce an app trained on thousands of cat photos that they say can tell you when puss is in pain.
Since its release last month, "Cat Pain Detector" has racked up 43,000 users, mostly in Japan but also in Europe and South America, said Go Sakioka, head of developer Carelogy.
The app is part of a growing array of tech for pet owners concerned for their furry friends' wellbeing, including similar mood and pain trackers made in Canada and Israel.
Carelogy teamed up with Nihon University's College of Bioresource Sciences to gather 6,000 cat photos, in which they carefully studied the positions of the animals' ears, noses, whiskers and eyelids.
They then used a scoring system designed by the University of Montreal to measure minute differences between healthy cats and those suffering pain due to hard-to-spot illnesses.
Next, the app developers fed the information into an AI detection system, which has further refined its skills thanks to around 600,000 photos uploaded by users, Sakioka said.
Now the app "has an accuracy level of more than 90 percent", he told AFP.
According to the Japan Pet Food Association, 60 percent of owners take their cat to a veterinarian at most once a year.
"We want to help cat owners judge more easily at home whether to see a vet or not," Sakioka said.
"Cat Pain Detector" is already being used by some vets in Japan, the land of Hello Kitty, where tourists flock to cat cafes and some small islands are overrun by stray felines.
But "the AI system still needs to be more precise before it's used as a standardIzed tool", he cautioned.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A search operation involving hundreds of security personnel was under way in Mexico on Wednesday, a day after gunmen kidnapped 16 administrative employees of the police force, authorities said.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed "no impunity" for the perpetrators, who intercepted a bus transporting 33 workers on a highway in the southern state of Chiapas.
An order had been issued "to rescue those kidnapped, alive of course," he said at his daily news conference.
The abductees worked at a nearby prison and the incident appeared to be connected to a dispute between criminal groups, Lopez Obrador added.
The state security agency updated the number of employees kidnapped to 16, from 14 previously.

Washington Post: Twice-indicted Trump dominates GOP race, as support for DeSantis stalls 
CONCORD, N.H. — The primary was effectively over for many voters who came out to hear Donald Trump’s speech at a GOP women’s luncheon this week. “It’s Trump all the way — don’t even ask me about anyone else,” said Suzanne Pesaresi, a 62-year-old office manager. 
Forty miles south, at a town hall with Ron DeSantis, plenty of others were convinced the party should move on from the former president. “I have a non-top choice, and that’s Donald Trump,” declared former Republican state lawmaker Bill Ohm. But like many around him, Ohm wasn’t yet sold on the Florida governor — or anyone else, for that matter. 
“I could vote for DeSantis if nobody else got traction,” said Don Hallenbeck, a business owner who identifies as an independent and plans to vote in the Republican primary. He worries the governor would “have a tough time finding his way back to the middle” in a general election.

The use of lethal force by officers against the teenager, who was of North African origin, has fed into a deep-rooted perception of police brutality in the ethnically diverse suburbs of France's biggest cities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After recovering pieces of debris from the downed submarine that sought to view Titanic wreckage and instead came to a fatal end, reports now suggest "human remains" have also been found among the ocean wreckage. 
ABC News reports:
"Debris recovered from the submersible that catastrophically imploded while on a voyage to see the Titanic wreckage last week contained 'presumed human remains,' the U.S. Coast Guard said," the outlet reported. "Salvaged pieces of the Titan vessel were unloaded from the Canadian ship Horizon Arctic at the Canadian Coast Guard pier in St. John's, Newfoundland, Wednesday morning."
Investigators are still reportedly looking into what was found to determine the truth:
"The U.S. Coast Guard said later Wednesday it has received the debris and evidence, including 'presumed human remains,' that had been recovered from the ocean floor in the incident, in which five people died," ABC reported. "The evidence will be transported to a port in the U.S. for 'further analysis and testing' by the Marine Board of Investigation, the Coast Guard said."
The news was also picked up by CNN, which cited a news release from the U.S. Coast Guard.]]></summary>

Moscow Times: Russian General Arrested Following Wagner Mutiny – MT Russian 
Russian General Sergei Surovikin has been arrested, The Moscow Times' Russian service reported Wednesday, citing two sources close to the Defense Ministry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The Defense Ministry has yet to comment on the alleged arrest of Surovikin, who has not been seen in public since Saturday, when Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched an armed rebellion against Russia's military leadership.
 "The situation with him was not 'OK.' For the authorities. I can't say anything more," one of the sources said. 
According to the second source, the arrest was carried out "in the context of Prigozhin."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  The Hong Kong Jockey Club (“the Club”) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the Hangzhou Municipal People’s Government to further strengthen Hangzhou-Hong Kong cooperation and exchange with the aim of promoting and driving the development of the equine sports industry in the country. The MOU was signed at the opening ceremony of Hong Kong & Macao - Zhejiang Week & Zhejiang and Hong Kong Cooperation Theme Forum 2023 on 26 June.  The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region John Lee, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Secretary Yi Lianhong and other guests witnessed the signing of the MOU by the Executive Deputy Mayor, Hangzhou Municipal Government, Chen Jin and the Club’s Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.  The National Equine Industry Development Plan 2020-2025 promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the General Administration of Sport in September 2020 provides a framework for the development of the equine sports industry in the country. In line with this, Hangzhou is capitalising on its hosting of the Asian Games by exploring the equine leisure and sports markets. In particular it is seeking to become a national major sports industry demonstration base and a sports consumption demonstration city, thus contributing to economic development in the Yangtze River Delta.  The Club has long contributed to the development of equine sports and related industries in the Mainland, assisting the country in promoting and implementing the goals of the National Equine Industry Development Plan. In May 2023, the Club signed an MOU with the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022 Organising Committee (“HAGOC”) under which the Club will provide technical support for the equestrian events of the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will provide Kyiv with a new military package worth up to $500 million, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, in a show of support for Ukraine's fight against Russia as Moscow deals with the aftermath of a mutiny by mercenary fighters. 
The package will include ground vehicles including Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armored personnel carriers, and munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, according to a statement from the Pentagon. 
The package "includes key capabilities to support Ukraine's counteroffensive operations, strengthen its air defenses ... and other equipment to help Ukraine push back on Russia's war of aggression," the Pentagon said.

The 3.7 magnitude quake, with an epicenter in Poggibonsi near Siena, was also felt in Florence and Empoli -- and hit shortly after the region tested an emergency alert system.
The tremor sent people rushing out of buildings and into the streets in Siena, famous for its artistic heritage and for the Palio, a spectacular horse race that pits neighborhoods against each other twice a year.
The cathedral was evacuated for about an hour, its press office told AFP.
The quake caused bits of plaster to fall off the famous monument, according to Italian media reports, but the cathedral's press office would not confirm.
The council ordered all museums closed for the remainder of Wednesday and Thursday, though it said there was no apparent damage to buildings.
Siena's historic centre is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

New York Times: Russian General Knew About Mercenary Chief’s Rebellion Plans, U.S. Officials Say 
WASHINGTON — A senior Russian general had advance knowledge of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s plans to rebel against Russia’s military leadership, according to U.S. officials briefed on American intelligence on the matter, which has prompted questions about what support the mercenary leader had inside the top ranks.
The officials said they are trying to learn if Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the former top Russian commander in Ukraine, helped plan Prigozhin’s actions last weekend, which posed the most dramatic threat to President Vladimir Putin in his 23 years in power. 
Surovikin is a respected military leader who helped shore up defenses across the battle lines after Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year, analysts say. He was replaced as the top commander in January but retained influence in running war operations and remains popular among the troops.

Update: Senior Russian General Knew About Wagner Leader’s Mutiny Plans – NYT (Moscow Times)

 
WNU editor: If Gen. Sergei Surovikin knew about Prigozhin’s plans to launch a mutiny, and did nothing about it, he would not be in the position that he is in today. He would have been fired/demoted on the spot.
Update #2: The Kremlin has just denied this New York Times report.]]></summary>

Agatha's mother, Thamirys Nunes, says she vividly remembers the day her daughter, then almost four, asked the question that has changed both of their lives.

Two years later in London the couple still feel threatened by the long arm of Beijing, like many other Hong Kongers exiled in the UK.
Following Beijing's crackdown on huge pro-democracy protests in 2019 and a sweeping security law imposed the following year, London has granted 166,000 visas to people from its former colony.
Holders of a British National Overseas passport -- issued to Hong Kongers born before the handover to China 26 years ago on July 1, 1997 -- can apply for a visa.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
