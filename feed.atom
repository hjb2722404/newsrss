        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amber Heard’s attorney has argued that there were several procedural errors in the defamation trial between the actress and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, which she says caused the jury to be “confused”. 

Lawyer Elaine Bredehoft claimed that the jury would have been affected by social media coverage leading to an unfair trial. 

“They went home every night, they have families, the families are on social media, we had a 10-day break in the middle because of the judicial conference,” Ms Bredehoft said.  

“There’s no way they couldn’t have been influenced by it, and it was horrible.  

“It really, really was lopsided.”

“Strengthen background checks and … (have) safe storage laws and red flag laws, repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability, address the mental health crisis.

CNN: Canada says Chinese warplanes are buzzing its North Korea reconnaissance flights 
Seoul, South Korea (CNN)Canadian surveillance planes helping to enforce United Nations sanctions on North Korea are being repeatedly buzzed by Chinese jets that fly so close their crews can see each other, Canada's military has alleged. 
In some instances the Chinese warplanes have come so close the Canadian aircraft have had to change course to avoid a collision, the Canadian Armed Forces said Wednesday. 
"In these interactions, PLAAF (People's Liberation Army Air Force) aircraft did not adhere to international air safety norms. These interactions are unprofessional and/or put the safety of our RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force) personnel at risk," said Dan Le Bouthillier, media relations chief of the Canadian Armed Forces.

But the researchers suggested that Discokeryx was particularly good at one-on-one combat.  The team scanned and reconstructed Discokeryx’s skull and neck in three dimensions.  They then compared it to modern head butters: musk oxen, argali mountain sheep and Himalayan blue sheep.  Using computer models, they deduced that Discokeryx’s skull absorbed more strikes and dampened its brain better than its modern counterparts.

SpaceX employs about 12,000 people, Musk said in a recent interview.
Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, said Mr Musk’s guidelines to employees at SpaceX and Tesla were among the strictest of tech companies.  Many tech companies have instead considered hybrid models in which employees can work from home for part of the time, he said.
Mr Bloom said he expected SpaceX and Tesla to lose about 10-20% of their current workforce and recruiters to try to poach employees by offering jobs with more flexible work options.
Many Tesla and SpaceX employees who work in high tech may believe in Mr. Musk, but there are also people “who are in more mainstream businesses like IT, finance, HR and payroll” , Mr. Bloom said.  “They can say, ‘I don’t design cars.  I pay the employees, and I can do it somewhere else.’  »
Annie Dean, head of distributed work at Atlassian, an Australian software company, called Mr Musk’s view “outdated”.
“This mindset is regressive and ignores the past two years of digitally driven collaborative work,” Ms. Dean, who was a former remote work manager at Facebook owner Meta, said in a statement. E-mail.
Mr. Musk has long been known as a demanding boss.  Sometimes he tried to lead by example by working hard, holding meetings late at night, emailing around the clock, and even sleep at the Tesla factory contribute to the ramp-up of production in 2018.

Newsweek: Exclusive: Putin Treated for Cancer in April, U.S. Intelligence Report Says 
Vladimir Putin's health is a subject of intense conversation inside the Biden administration after the intelligence community produced its fourth comprehensive assessment at the end of May. 
The classified U.S. report says Putin seems to have re-emerged after undergoing treatment in April for advanced cancer, three U.S. intelligence leaders who have read the reports tell Newsweek. 
The assessments also confirm that there was an assassination attempt on Putin's life in March, the officials say. 
The high-ranking officials, who represent three separate intelligence agencies, are concerned that Putin is increasingly paranoid about his hold on power, a status that makes for a rocky and unpredictable course in Ukraine. But it is one, they say, that also makes the prospects of nuclear war less likely.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Putin has been making regular public appearances, and to me he looks OK on TV. 
On Victory Day his security detail looked the same as usual, not what I would expect for someone who survived an assassination attempt. 
So is Putin sick? 
No one outside of Putin's inner circle really knows, and his inner circle are showing no signs that he is ill. 
Because if he was ill, these guys and their supporters would be positioning themselves right now to take over once President Putin can no longer rule, and that type of action cannot be hidden.

In an exclusive interview with Sky News, General Paul Nakasone confirmed for the first time that the US had "conducted a series of operations" in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
US military hackers have conducted offensive operations in support of Ukraine, the head of US Cyber Command has told Sky News.

Speaking in Tallinn, Estonia, the general, who is also director of the National Security Agency (NSA), told Sky News that he is concerned "every single day" about the risk of a Russian cyber attack targeting the US and said that the hunt forward activities were an effective way of protecting both America as well as allies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The patient, from Mexico, was born with microtia, a rare birth defect that makes the auricle or outer part of the ear small and malformed (this can also affect hearing in the ear).  With more research, company executives said, the technology could be used to make many other replacement body parts, including spinal discs, noses, knee menisci, rotator cuffs and joints. reconstructive tissues for lumpectomies.  Later, they said, 3D printing could even produce much more complex vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys and pancreas.
“It’s so exciting, sometimes I have to calm down a bit,” said Dr. Arturo Bonilla, a pediatric reconstructive ear surgeon in San Antonio who performed the woman’s implant surgery.  The trial was funded by 3DBio Therapeutics, but Dr. Bonilla has no financial stake in the company.  “If all goes as planned, it will revolutionize the way it’s done,” he said.
James Iatridis, who directs a spine bioengineering lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said other 3D-printed tissue implants were in the works, but he was unaware of any other product tested in a clinical trial.
“The 3D ear implant is then a proof-of-concept to assess biocompatibility, shape-matching and shape retention in living people,” said Dr. Iatridis.
Still, the outer part of the ear is a relatively simple appendage that’s more aesthetic than functional, said Carnegie Mellon’s Dr. Feinberg.  He warned that the road to solid organs – such as livers, kidneys, hearts and lungs – was still a long one.  “Just going from an ear to a spinal disc is a pretty big jump, but it’s more realistic if you have the ear,” he said.
The 3D printing manufacturing process creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model.  The technology typically involves a computer-controlled printer laying down material in thin layers to create the precise shape of the object.

Over the last month I had come to the conclusion that the Ukraine is losing about 500 men per day due to intense Russian artillery fire. That number may have been too low.
 I had mentioned high Ukrainian casualty rates due to Russian artillery fire on April 25:       
The nearly 1,000 artillery missions in the last 24 hours and on the days before speak of intense preparations for upcoming attacks by Russian mechanized forces. Over all artillery will do the most damage to the Ukrainian troops. In World War II and other modern mechanized wars some 65% of all casualties were caused by artillery strikes. The recent rate on the Ukrainian side will likely be higher. 
I revisited that on May 5:      The Russian military forces are grinding down Ukrainian ground forces by extensive use of heavy artillery. The Ukrainian artillery has been destroyed or lacks ammunition.The Ukrainian forces have orders to stay in their position and to hold the line. That only makes sure that Russian artillery strikes will destroy them. 
The order was given because the 'west' has pushed the Ukrainian president to not make peace with Russia. The consequence will be the assured destruction of the Ukrainian military.

Russia is holding nuclear drills in the Ivanovo province, northeast of Mosco, Russian sources reported. 
Interfax, an independent Russian news agency, cited the Russian Ministry of Defense as confirming the drills were being held by nuclear forces on Russian soil. 
According to Interfax, some 1,000 servicemen are involved in the drills which Reuters described as "intense maneuvers" using more than 100 vehicles including Yars intercontinental ballistic missile launchers.

There are certainly bigger problems in tennis, but Bouin more or less kept his word, retiring well before the French Open adopted its “night sessions” in 2021.

The Chinese military said on Wednesday it had recently carried out a combat "readiness patrol" in the seas and airspace around Taiwan. 
In a statement, the People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command said the patrol was "a necessary action against U.S.-Taiwan collusion." 
The command said the United States often “made moves” to support “Taiwan independence forces, which will push Taiwan into a dangerous situation.” 
China claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory. Over the past few years, mainland forces have increased their military activities around the island to pressure Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Johnny Depp has issued a statement saying he is "truly humbled" to have won his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard as she revealed her shock to the verdict.

The jury found Ms Heard defamed him in her 2018 Washington Post article, alleging she was domestically abused by him. 

The jury of five men and two women reached the verdict unanimously – saying Depp had proven all elements of defamation.

The jury also found the majority of Ms Heard's allegations to be false and conveyed a defamatory implication.

She was awarded $US2 million for one of her claims, but Johnny Depp is to receive $US15 million in total damages.

Depp said the jury’s decision gave him his life back and that he was “truly humbled” by the outcome.

"Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me,” he said in a statement.

“I feel at peace knowing I have finally accomplished that."

Ms Heard also issued a statement saying she was disappointed she had lost the right “to speak freely and openly”.

"The disappointment I feel today is beyond words," Heard said.

"I'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence and sway of my ex-husband.

"I'm even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nick Coyle, partner of Chinese-Australian journalist Cheng Lei who was formally arrested in China in February 2021, has spoken out for the first time in an exclusive interview with Sky News Australia – raising his concerns on the issue. 

Ms Lei, 46, who worked for Chinese state broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) as an anchor, was detained in August 2020 before being formally arrested in February 2021 on suspicion of “illegally supplying state records overseas”. 

Mr Coyle raised concerns about the suspension of consular visits and the decline of her health in detention. 

He said regular consular visits have been suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions in Beijing, which he finds “totally unacceptable” as it’s the one of things that has kept his partner going for 20 months. 

“I mean, she’s been able to make no phone calls with anybody, she’s had what? Maybe three visits from her lawyer just to prepare for the trial, she’s not had one phone call with family, with children, nothing,” he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Benedicts still find happy moments in their home.  Sometimes they play Uno together.  Sabrina is brimming with excitement when she shows off her mom’s ballet moves or talks about upcoming vacations, her favorite meals or her day at school.  Or they flip through photo albums, remembering vacations on Assateague Island.
One afternoon last year, Sabrina sat at the kitchen counter, drawing an intricate plan of a house where she imagined one of her teachers lived.  When Crystol arrived home, Sabrina ran to greet her.  Then she collapsed on the sofa in anticipation of a massage.  Her mother knelt beside her.  Crystol pretended to make pizza on his daughter’s back – kneading the dough, spreading the sauce and sprinkling the cheese.
But within an hour, Sabrina would be overwhelmed with disappointment, frustration, or some emotion she couldn’t name.  She stamped her foot, hard.  And start moaning.
“Do you need help?”  her father asked, his voice even, his eyes averted.
Between moans, Sabrina announced, “I’m crazy.”  But she stopped her parents’ efforts to talk to her.  “I hate you,” she said.  “Leave!”
At times like this, her mother encourages her to breathe in and out.  “Smell the roses and blow out the candles,” she says.  And his parents are there, frozen, waiting for the continuation.
When Crystol first saw Sabrina, asleep in a crib in the hospital, she cried with happiness.  It was July 2008. Unable to have a baby on their own, she and Jeremy had become foster parents, planning to adopt.  They brought Sabrina home when she was only a day and a half old.
They weren’t intimidated by what the fostering agency told them: Sabrina’s biological mother and father both had developmental disabilities and the father had been arrested for sexual assault.

The US' decision to redeploy 500 troops to Somalia to help in the fight against militant Islamists is a clear sign of its support for new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
The redeployment came after former US President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of the troops in December 2020 following years of strained relations with his predecessor Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed "Farmajo", who was voted out of office by Somalia's lawmakers. 
The US considered him to be a failure both in terms of governance and the campaign against Islamist militant groups al-Shabab and the much smaller Somali branch of the Islamic State (IS) group.

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin claimed that up to 70% of tickets presented at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis were fake.  He said at a press conference on Monday that the “root cause” chaos was about 30,000–40,000 English fans carrying counterfeit tickets – or no tickets – that blocked entrances.
But according to official figures reviewed by The New York Times, the exact number of counterfeit tickets intercepted by gate stewards was much lower: 2,589, to be exact.

The machinations in the Lehigh County case have been watched intensely by Mr. McCormick and Dr. Oz, who are separated by less than 1,000 votes with a statewide recount underway in their race, which could ultimately determine control of the divided Senate.

As Russian troops capture territory, a Pentagon official said their “laborious and incremental” pace is wearing them down and the army’s overall combat strength has been reduced by about 20%.  And since the war began, Russia has lost 1,000 tanks, a senior Pentagon official said last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s on the ballot?
There is a wide range of races for positions statewide, as well as many local competitions.  You’ll be asked to make your choice for Governor (Governor Gavin Newsom is up for re-election), Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer, Attorney General and more.
You will be asked to vote for a representative of the House.  And you’ll be asked to vote for the US senator – twice: once to fill out the rest of Vice President Kamala Harris’ term, which ends in January, and once for the full six-year term that begins after that. .
Then, depending on where you live, you’ll have local elections for your city council, district attorney, mayor, state legislators and more.  (In San Francisco, for example, voters will be asked if they should recall Chesa Boudin, the district attorney.)
How does the California primary system work?
Since 2011, California has had what’s called a first-two primary system, which means the top two candidates will advance in the November general election, regardless of their political party.  The November races could be matchups between two Democrats or two Republicans, rather than between the top Democrat and the top Republican.
In almost all statewide elections, there will be a runoff, even if a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.  The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is a notable exception.
In local races, a candidate can win with the majority of votes.  The most publicized example is the race for mayor of Los Angeles.  (If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote this month, they will become mayor without facing a runoff in November.)
Who should I vote for?
Of course, we cannot answer that.  But you may want to read your local newspaper’s recommendations, as they will have interviewed candidates.  here are the candidates endorsed by the Los Angeles Times in state and local elections in Southern California.  The Sacramento Bee has compiled its endorsements here.  And here’s the San Francisco Chronicle list of endorsements for national and local elections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: Biden says the US will give Ukraine more advanced rocket systems but won't enable the country to 'strike beyond its borders' 
* President Joe Biden says the US will provide more advanced rocket systems to Ukraine. 
* Ukraine has been asking the US for long-range artillery, which it says is needed for its defense. 
* These systems have double the range of the M777 howitzers that the US previously sent to Ukraine. 
The US will be providing Ukraine with more advanced rocket systems and munitions to allow Ukrainian forces to "more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield," President Joe Biden wrote in a Tuesday op-ed for The New York Times. 
However, these weapons are only meant for Kyiv's forces to inflict casualties within Ukraine, and the US isn't "encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders," Biden added. 
"We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia," he wrote, per The Times.

Reuters: Russia and Saudi Foreign Ministers Praise OPEC+, Says Moscow 
(Reuters) -Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in Riyadh on Tuesday and both men praised the level of cooperation inside OPEC+, the Russian foreign ministry said. 
The comments were issued amid Western media reports that some members of OPEC+, an alliance of OPEC members and their allies, were considering removing Russia from the group. 
"They noted the stabilising effect that the tight cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia has on world markets for hydrocarbons in this strategically important sector," the ministry said in a statement on its website.  There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia outside of business hours.

But the best-of-five-set format remains a different kind of challenge than the best-of-three-set variety played on the regular tour.  For now, Alcaraz’s best results in major tournaments are the quarter-finals at the US Open last year and now in Paris.
“I didn’t start well, and at this level, quarter-final of a Grand Slam, you are playing against the best players in the world, so you have to start the game better than I did today” , said Alcaraz.  “I have to follow the lesson.  I mean, I have to improve for the next Grand Slam or the next games.  But I would say that I am not far from reaching a semi-final or winning a Grand Slam.
Zverev, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros last year, clearly felt the odds were stacked against him on Tuesday in light of recent results at Alcaraz.  Alcaraz had won the Barcelona and Madrid titles back-to-back on red clay and were on their way back to Roland Garros after saving a match point against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Viñolas in the second round.
“I knew I had to play my best tennis today from the start, and I’m glad I did,” Zverev said.  “Obviously he kept coming back. He’s an amazing player. I told him at the net, he’s going to win this tournament many times, not just once, and I just hope I can win it before it starts. fight all of us, and we won’t stand a chance.
Zverev, despite his strong performance (and obvious relief) on Tuesday, is still a long way from winning his first Grand Slam singles title.  In the semi-finals he will face the winner of Tuesday’s second match: a night session between Djokovic and fifth seed Rafael Nadal, who has won the French Open a record 13 times.
“It’s not really easier from here,” said Zverev, still elated.  “But I’ve often said, I’m no longer 20 or 21;  I am 25.  I’m at the stage where I want to win, I’m also at the stage where I’m supposed to win.

As major league games become longer and slower, frustrating even dedicated fans – Miami Marlins manager Don Mattingly recently said that the sport “is sometimes unwatchable” – the Bananas focus squarely on pleasure.  For viewers like me, it’s the most watchable team in baseball.

“He’s bringing my name, he’s bringing Jamie Quirk’s name – and he’s bringing your name,” Brett said, pointing to his former teammate, Willie Mays Aikens, across the table.
“And he brings up the name Vida Blue, and the name Jerry Martin, and the name Willie Wilson.  And he said, ‘You know, we had a meeting earlier to call bookmakers and betting games. Let’s just say George and Jamie call a guy we’ve been bugged on…’”

Daily Mail: Russia cuts off Denmark's gas – the 5th European country Moscow has refused to supply- amid fears heating prices will soar even FURTHER 
* Danish firm Orsted said Gazprom would cut supplies to Denmark on June 1 
* Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and The Netherlands have also seen supplies cut 
* Russia is turning off the taps in response to Western sanctions over Ukraine war 
* Orsted had anticipated Moscow's move by filling up its storage facilities 
* The announcements follow Monday's agreement by European Union leaders to cut the European Union's imports of Russian oil by 90 percent by year-end 
Danish energy company Orsted said Tuesday that Russian gas company Gazprom Export would cut gas supplies to Denmark on June 1 after the Danish company refused to pay in rubles. 
Orsted, formerly DONG Energy, said Gazprom Export had informed it that its gas supply would be halted at 6:00 am (0400 GMT).  Russia has said it will only accept payment for natural gas deliveries in its national currency, with buyers required to set up ruble accounts or have their taps turned off.

But a few days spent reading the Israeli press and engaging in political conversations dispels that illusion.  There are too many similarities between Israeli and American politics.

In Israel as in the United States, the opposing forces are deeply divided and the majority of the current government is hanging by a thread.  In both countries, various coalitions are held together by mistrust and hatred on the other side.  Right-wing forces are campaigning tirelessly against the threat of an undifferentiated “left” while the center and the far left fear the return to …]]></summary>

    The Friends of the Easthampton Dog Park Board of Directors would like to thank everyone who stopped by to show their support earlier this month for our first dog park fundraiser here in Easthampton. 
The sun stayed behind the clouds, keeping it comfortable for all.  The dogs were all well behaved and especially appreciated the free treats and fresh water provided.  We raised $285 with additional funds that Furs a Flying will generously donate to us for all the nail clippings they did last week. 
Twenty-seven people also join our mailing list of more than 80 people to receive updates on our progress in securing a site for the park.  For more information, please email: easthamptondogpark@gmail.com.  Hope to see you at our next event.

Admiral Fagan, who was previously the service’s second-in-command, graduated from the Coast Guard Academy in 1985, in only the sixth class that included women.  She steadily rose through the ranks, serving at sea on an icebreaker and ashore as a Marine Safety Officer.
It wasn’t until much later in her career that she thought becoming a commander might even be possible.
“A lot of people were like, ‘Oh yeah, I knew she was going to be Admiral,’ but I didn’t think about it,” Admiral Fagan recalled.  “Even when I was first selected as Admiral, you don’t think about it, and…]]></summary>

Like my colleagues noted at the timethe final command text reflected “the balancing act the president is trying to navigate on policing” – between progressive activists demanding greater constraints on the use of force, police groups seeking to limit the scope of the change and Republicans who see rising crime as a winning political issue.  It was the product of delicate coalition politics — more than 120 meetings over more than 100 hours, according to the White House.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Guardian: What’s next for Ukraine after Russia’s Donbas offensive?  
Analysis: Indiscriminate tactics of Russia’s grinding progress in east could characterise next phase of war 
The recent Russian advances in the Donbas lead to an inevitable question: whether the indiscriminate tactics the Kremlin deployed there will be a template for future offensives. 
With reports of large numbers of troops, artillery and rocket launchers mustering across the border near the Russian city of Kursk – in an area that borders Ukraine’s Sumy province – it is an urgent issue. 
While much has been made of the painfully slow and grinding pace of Russia’s recent offensive in the Donbas, the speed of territorial gains is not the only metric.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Ukraine's options are limited, and the reports that I am hearing from Ukrainians that know on what is happening in this war are distressing. 
So what is next for Ukraine? 
There is going to be no let-up in the war. After Donbas Russian forces will be focused on the city of Zaporizhhia (see the above map),  and after that the city of Dnipro. 
This is open country, and ideal terrain for Russian forces to do what they have always been trained to do. Conduct operations that isolate enemy units, and then destroy them with artillery. 
On another sad note. This region and the Donbas has always been the industrial heartland of Ukraine. Its loss will be incalculable for Ukraine, and the Kremlin knows it.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-31T23:00:00.062Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: General Milley tries to give the impression in this interview that the U.S. is not really involved in the Russia - Ukraine war. That the U.S. is an outside power observing the situation. A neutral party. Even saying that this conflict may end up as a stalemate, and if not, be ready to step up to make sure it does not escalate. 
I am not buying anything that the General is trying to sell. 
General Milley knows exactly what is going on in Ukraine right now. After receiving billions in US arms  the Donbas is turning into a disaster for the Ukraine military, and the only thing that the Pentagon can advise right now is to send even more arms into that conflict, thereby escalating it even further.
 Update: A regular clock is right two times a day .... With food crisis looming, Milley says using military to end Russian blockade would be ‘high risk’ (Defense News).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Russia hits back at the EU’s partial oil embargo, says it will find other importers for its crude 
* The European Union on Monday agreed to ban most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of new measures designed to punish the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine. 
* Responding to the measures, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, said the oil ban reflects negatively on the bloc. 
* “As she rightly said yesterday, #Russia will find other importers,” Ulyanov said via Twitter, referring specifically to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 
Moscow has pledged to find other importers for its oil shortly after the world’s largest trading bloc agreed to impose a partial embargo on Russian crude. 
The European Union on Monday decided to ban most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of new measures designed to punish the Kremlin over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. 
The move was hailed by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as a “landmark decision to cripple [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war machine.”

Update: Moscow Shrugs Off EU Oil Ban: 'Russia Will Find Other Importers' (Zero Hedge/Epoch Times) 
WNU Editor: Russia will find other customers for its oil. The commodity is vital to the global economy, and there are shortages. 
The problem for Russia is that it will take time to find new customers for its oil, and Russian oil companies will then need to make arrangements with other customers on how to be paid. 
But as difficult as this will be for Russia, the EU will be impacted even more. They will need to find new suppliers, and it will definitely be more costlier because this new oil will need to be delivered by tanker rather than a pipeline. And even that is not a guarantee. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are saying very bluntly that their production capacity is almost at its limit .... Oil Prices Tumble On OPEC-Russia Reports (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>
