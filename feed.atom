        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Cohen, known best as Donald Trump's former attorney and "fixer" who turned into a critic of the former president, made news on Saturday for his actions in confronting a woman who was taking down posters of hostages of Hamas.
Cohen, who made a splash at the ex-president's civil fraud trial, was reportedly walking around in New York when he saw the woman taking down the posters and even laughing.
Cohen started by asking what was wrong with the woman, according to the New York Post.
"Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen confronted a woman on the Upper East Side Friday tearing down fliers of missing Israeli hostages — precipitating a tense confrontation," the outlet reported Saturday.
"'What’s wrong with you?' Cohen snapped at the well-dressed middle-aged woman, wearing sunglasses and a beige trench coat and holding a tote bag, shows video obtained by The Post," the Post wrote. "This is illegal. Turn it on yourself, freak. You should be in jail,” the woman shot back, according to the news report.
The woman appeared to be confused about who Cohen was, according to the Post's account.
"She also appeared to confuse him with hedge fund billionaire and Mets owner Steve Cohen," it reported. "When Michael Cohen demanded the woman’s name, she said it was 'Steve Cohen and I should be back in jail because I’m a piece of s—t.'"
Cohen himself had this to say about the encounter:
"When reached by The Post, Michael Cohen said he wanted to get the woman’s name and hold her accountable," according to the Post's report. "While walking on Park Avenue at the corner of 61st street, I was shocked to see this racist, antisemitic curmudgeon tearing the face off the missing-child poster and laughing about it. There is no place for people like her in civilized society,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump on Saturday thanked the veterans attending his New Hampshire rally, but then proceeded to attack a familiar target: General Milley.
Trump veered off course from his stump speech several times at his rally, even appearing to confuse Barack Obama for Joe Biden at one point. He also took numerous shots at the retired general named Mark Milley, who said he had to restrain the former president's worst impulses throughout his time in office.
Trump mentioned Milley alongside secretary of defense James Mattis.
"You know Mattis. General Mattis. General Milley. Real beauties," Trump said on stage on Saturday.
"General Milley is the one who decided to take the soldiers out first," he added. "General Milley is the one that said let's leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind because it's cheaper than taking it out. It's cheaper than putting a tank of nice, clean fuel in the airplane and flying it to Pakistan or flying it all the way home. It's cheaper to leave it there."
He claimed 700,000 rifles, 70,000 vehicles, and more were left behind after war.
The ex-president added, "We have an unbelievable military. We just have some really bad leaders."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis on Saturday dismissed US bishop Joseph Strickland, a prominent conservative who has repeatedly criticized his papacy, the Vatican announced.
The rare decision to remove a senior Catholic figure came after Francis sent two US bishops to visit Strickland's Texas diocese in June.
"The Holy Father has relieved from the pastoral governance of the diocese of Tyler (US) Joseph E. Strickland," the Vatican said in a statement.
It said the bishop of Austin, Joe Vasquez, had been named as apostolic administrator of the diocese, but gave no further details.
The Vatican has not said what sparked the apostolic visitation this summer -- which Strickland himself made public -- or what conclusions were drawn.
But Strickland, appointed by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012, was one of the most prominent critics of Pope Francis.
The Argentine pope, 86, has sought to forge a more compassionate Church, open to different views.
But he has faced intense opposition from critics -- particularly in the United States -- who accused him of causing confusion and failing to uphold key Catholic beliefs.
In a message earlier this year on X, formerly Twitter, Strickland accused the pope of "undermining the deposit of faith".
In a blog posted on his website in September, the bishop addressed rumours that he was being encouraged by the Vatican to step down.
"I cannot resign as bishop of Tyler because that would be me abandoning the flock" under his care, he wrote.
"I have also said that I will respect the authority of Pope Francis if he removes me from office as Bishop of Tyler," he wrote.
"I love Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church which He established. My only desire is to speak His Truth and live God's Will to the best of my ability," he wrote.
The diocese of Tyler on Saturday announced the Vatican's decision to dismiss the bishop on its website, saying: "Our work as the Catholic Church in northeast Texas continues."

In a document published on Wednesday, the powerful Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the main departments that manages the affairs of the Holy See, said transgender believers can be baptized if it would not cause scandal or confusion.

The document, written in response to questions from a Brazilian bishop and approved by Pope Francis, also raised no objections to baptism for the children of same-sex couples, either adopted or born through surrogacy.
In reality, such baptisms already occur in different dioceses around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia has been spreading "disinformation" about the situation in the Middle East, the president of Microsoft said Saturday, as tensions soar in the region due to the Israel-Hamas war.
Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president, was asked about the role of the US tech giant in promoting peace at an international peace forum in Paris.
He said that Microsoft and its competitors were fighting against disinformation, in particular by using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Smith said that Microsoft and other companies are doing this "by creating technological tools that facilitate the detection of manipulated, modified, altered content," according to remarks translated in French by radio France Inter.
"We are getting very good at identifying a Russian campaign, like when they tried to tell people not to get the Covid vaccine," he said.
"Or today, when we see Russian disinformation in the Middle East," he added.
He said the three options facing technology platforms that identify this kind of disinformation are to do nothing, delete it, or re-label it and flag the content has been modified.
"There is no societal consensus about what companies should do," Smith added.
Th Paris Peace Forum opened against a backdrop of proliferating conflict around the world, and more than a month into the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Since Hamas attacks in southern Israel on October 7 -- in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 239 taken hostage -- Israel has bombarded Gaza relentlessly and sent in ground troops.
The Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza, many of them children.
In an interview with the BBC on the fringes of the peace forum on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron condemend the Hamas attacks but called on Israel to stop bombing civilians in Gaza, saying there was "no justification" and the deaths were causing "resentment".]]></summary>

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Moody's on Friday lowered its outlook on the U.S. credit rating to "negative" from "stable" citing large fiscal deficits and a decline in debt affordability, a move that drew immediate criticism from President Joe Biden's administration. 
The move follows a rating downgrade of the sovereign by another ratings agency, Fitch, this year, which came after months of political brinkmanship around the U.S. debt ceiling.

Federal spending and political polarization have been a rising concern for investors, contributing to a selloff that took U.S. government bond prices to their lowest levels in 16 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an interview with FRANCE 24, Israel's former prime minister Ehud Olmert (2006-2009) said he believes Israel will be able to eliminate Hamas's military capabilities in Gaza, but he expressed regret at Palestinian civilian casualties from the Israeli offensive and stressed that time for the operation was "limited". Olmert said Israel should offer to start negotiations on a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority immediately after conclusion of the war. He also claimed that no Arab country would agree to replace the Israeli army in Gaza after the war, which is why he advocates a NATO-led military presence that would usher in a transitional civilian administration before final talks over a Palestinian state. Olmert slammed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, saying he had failed his citizens and boosted Hamas while weakening the Palestinian Authority: "He is in a nervous breakdown."]]></summary>

Air and Space Forces Magazine: New B-21 Bomber Takes First Flight 
The first B-21 Raider bomber took off from Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Calif., just after dawn on Nov. 10, in a flight that concluded at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif, after 90 minutes, according to local observers. 
“The B-21 safely landed,” said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. “This was a test flight.” 
The aircraft was filmed from outside Plant 42, heading eastbound with an F-16 chase plane after climbing to about 500 feet. The landing gear had yet to be retracted in video and photos that appeared on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Jewish woman was attacked after she confronted two other women who were tearing down posters of Israelis who were kidnapped by Hamas, The New York Post reported. 
According to the NYPD, the 41-year-old victim “engaged the two females in a verbal dispute” as she recorded the incident on her cellphone. 
The suspects then ripped the victim's Star of David necklace from her neck and knocked her cellphone out of her hand before fleeing on foot, leaving her with minor injuries to her face and neck. 
The NYPD released pictures of the two suspects, one of whom can be seen wearing a nose ring. 
Pro-Palestinian protesters have been captured on video in multiple incidents around New York City where they can be seen tearing down posters of kidnapped Israelis. 
At least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 in the worst terror attack in Israel's history.]]></summary>

No more green for Zelenskyy. 
With war funding for both Ukraine and Israel now seemingly snarled up beyond repair in Congress, on Thursday the Pentagon said that funding delays have forced the US to begin restricting the flow of military assistance to Ukraine, and the Pentagon has only $1 billion left to replenish stocks of weapons that were sent to the country, according to a spokeswoman.
“We have had to meter out our support for Ukraine,” Deputy Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters. “We’re going to continue to roll out packages but they are getting smaller.”

        <updated>2023-11-10T12:20:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The publishers of two UK newspapers on Friday lost a bid to have a case for unlawful information gathering brought against them by Prince Harry and others thrown out of court, opening the way for a possible trial.
Lawyers for Associated Newspapers (ANL) -- publishers of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday -- had argued that the claims were brought too late.
But in a written ruling, judge Matthew Nicklin disagreed and said the case could go ahead.
The ruling is the latest chapter in Harry's turbulent relationship with the press, whom he holds responsible for the death of his mother Princess Diana in a 1997 Paris car crash as she fled paparazzi.
Other claimants are pop star Elton John, his husband David Furnish, the actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, politician Simon Hughes, and Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was killed in a racist murder in 1993.
ANL had "not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims of any of these claimants", the judge said in his 95-page ruling.
"In my judgement, each claimant has a real prospect of demonstrating that Associated... concealed from him/her the relevant facts upon which a worthwhile claim of unlawful information gathering could have been advanced," he wrote.
Harry and the other claimants accuse ANL of methods such as hiring private investigators, tapping phone calls and impersonating individuals to obtain medical information for articles. 
The court has been told the alleged wrongdoing dates back to 1993 and continued to as late as 2018.
ANL has dismissed the allegations, arguing the case should not go to trial.
Harry, 39, and his wife Meghan, 42, quit royal duties in 2020 and relocated to California, in part blaming media attention for the move.
The prince, who is formally known as the Duke of Sussex and is the younger son of King Charles III, has vowed to make reforming the British media his life's mission.
The case is one of a number legal battles he is waging with different UK newspapers over privacy concerns.

TASS: Russia may downgrade diplomatic relations with US, senior diplomat says 
Still, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stressed that Moscow did not plan to initiate the severance of diplomatic ties with Washington 
MOSCOW, November 9. /TASS/. Washington’s behavior may compel Moscow to downgrade diplomatic relations or even cut ties, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said. 
"We are indeed going through an acute crisis in relations, the likes of which we have never seen before. We need to carefully calibrate and verify the steps we are taking to prevent further escalation. Our leadership encourages the Foreign Ministry and other federal government agencies to act this way, which is what we are guided by. However, we have seen the Americans take a series of irresponsible and escalatory steps with regard to Ukraine, and not only there," the senior diplomat said in an interview with RTVI. "That is why, if we look at Washington’s current behavior model from this perspective, I don’t rule out anything at all. The level [of diplomatic ties] may be lowered; and the severance of diplomatic relations is also possible," he added.

The administration hopes that this meeting will serve as a first step in a larger dialogue on limiting nuclear arsenals.

Thousands of people have been forced to flee the Sudanese region of West Dafur amid fears of ethnic cleansing, a medical charity says. 
Witnesses have accused the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of targeting and killing non-Arabs, with reports of hundreds of deaths. 
This comes after the RSF captured the Sudanese army headquarters in West Darfur capital of El Geneina.

It has been battling the army for control of the country since April.

A senior Biden administration official said the death toll of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is likely far higher than the 10,000 number being reported by the health ministry amid Israel’s war against Hamas. 
Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told a House panel those killed more than one month into the war are likely “higher than is being cited.” 
President Biden and Israel’s staunchest supporters in Congress have cast doubt the Gaza Health Ministry is able to provide an accurate death toll from Gaza while under the control and coercion of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/james-comer-soulless/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-09T22:03:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) is moving ahead with a subpoena against Los Angeles-based real estate investor Elizabeth Hirsch Naftali, who purchased art from Hunter Biden — despite the fact that Naftali is currently dealing with her three-year-old niece being held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip following the 10/7 terrorist attack.
Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) is enraged by this, issuing a statement accusing the Republican chairman of abusing his power to harass the family of a terror victim.
"In the clearest sign yet of House Republicans' devious and distorted priorities, Chairman Comer has decided to subpoena a private American citizen whose 3-year-old niece is currently being held hostage in Gaza by the terrorist group Hamas," said Goldman. "Despite no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, House Republicans are spending their time attacking the grieving family of a Hamas hostage rather than working to get that hostage released."
"Chairman Comer's behavior is disgusting," continued Goldman. "In his soulless desperation to smear President Biden ahead of the 2024 election, he has stooped to an entirely new low of abandoning the American families of hostages in a pathetic attempt to score political points against President Biden. In this trying time at home and around the world, the American people cannot tolerate this wild goose chase anymore. It must stop immediately."
Comer has spent months trying to look for solid evidence that the president has been laundering bribes through his son's international business deals. No such evidence has yet emerged, and many of their hearings with Hunter Biden's business associates have if anything provided evidence of the opposite.

He said he has asked for even a longer pause in some cases. 
 President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday that he has pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a three-day pause in the Gaza fighting and expressed frustration with some of his Israeli counterpart's actions following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. 
"Did you ask to pause for three days to get the hostages out?" ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang asked Biden as he left Joint Base Andrews for a trip to Illinois.

Biden responded, "Yes. I've -- I've asked for even a longer pause for some of them."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Texas lawmaker's office was repeatedly vandalized this week with messages criticizing the congress member's position on the Israel-Hamas war. 
U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz said on Thursday police are investigating what she described in a press release as pro-Hamas messages scrawled on her District 15 office in McAllen, Texas.
The vandals wrote on her door, entryway, and sheets left outside the office, "Monica murders," "Israel kills Jews too," "Israel is doing genocide and you support it," and "You can't escape your crimes Monica." 
De La Cruz believes she was targeted because her South Texas district has a "small but vibrant Jewish community," of which she counts herself as an ally, she said. 
"My support for Israel and the Jewish community is, always has been, and always will be unwavering," De La Cruz said. "I make no apologies for standing firmly against anti-Semitism. These vandals will not intimidate or silence me."
The war in Israel and Gaza, spurred by a surprise Hamas attack last month, has already claimed the lives of thousands, including numerous civilians killed on the Oct. 7 attack. 
On Thursday, the White House announced that Israel has agreed to four-hour daily humanitarian pauses in the fighting.]]></summary>

US and coalition forces have come under attack at least four more times since the US struck a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria on Wednesday evening, according to a US official. 
 On Wednesday evening, there were two multi-rocket attacks on US and coalition forces at Omar Oil Fields near Mission Support Site Green Village, Syria, and a one-way drone attack on forces at Mission Support Site Euphrates, Syria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France accused Russia Thursday of interfering in its affairs by sharing photos online of Stars of David found daubed on dozens of buildings in Paris.
The foreign ministry in a statement accused the Russian RRN/Doppelganger network of attempting to "exploit international crises to sow confusion and create tension in the public debate in France and Europe", and of mounting a "new operation of Russian online interference".
The accusation came after French prosecutors this week launched an investigation into the possibility that the graffiti, widely condemned as anti-Semitic, may have been carried out at the "express demand" of an individual residing abroad.
An investigating magistrate will probe the intention of the acts, prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement Tuesday, following the arrest of two Moldovans who told investigators they were acting at the behest of a third party.
This has led to widespread suspicion that the French probe is specifically targeting Russia.
Tensions rising in France
On Thursday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters that such accusations were "stupid, utter rubbish and just plain undignified".
"This is an attempt by the authorities in France, or their special services, simply to pretend that the growth of anti-Semitism in France is something other than an internal problem," she added.
The RRN/Doppelganger network has been accused of previous disinformation campaigns against France.
Tensions have been rising in France, home to large Jewish and Muslim communities, in the wake of the unprecedented attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel on October 7 which has been followed by Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
The graffiti, which for some brought back horrific memories of the Nazi occupation of Paris during World War II and the deportation of French Jews to death camps, was condemned across the political spectrum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: US government debt is on track to surpass $50 trillion by 2033. That means $5.2 billion is piling up every day. 

 
The US government's debt is on track to surpass $50 trillion by 2033, Bank of America said in a Tuesday note, citing data from the Congressional Budget Office. 
* The US government's public outstanding debt is on track to surpass $50 trillion by 2033. 
* The increase comes out to roughly $5.2 billion every day or $218 million every hour, Bank of America estimated. 
* "Central banks may simply bail out governments in coming years via QE," BofA said. 
US public debt outstanding currently sits at $33.6 trillion and is expected to surge by $20 trillion to $54 trillion within the next decade amid "fiscal excess in the 2020s," Bank of America investment strategist Michael Hartnett said.
"US public debt is... more than the combined GDPs of China, Japan, Germany, and India," he wrote, adding that the outstanding debt is set to surge by $5.2 billion every single day, or $218 million every hour, for the next 10 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A police officer in Australia was convicted on charges that he pointed a gun at a colleague and warned him not to reveal spoilers from the movie Top Gun: Maverick, Australia's ABC reported. 
Court documents say that back in May, 26-year-old Probationary Constable Morgan Royston told Constable Dominic Francis Gaynor that he saw the movie the previous night, saying, "I'll spoil it for you." Gaynor, 30, then laughed and said: "Don't spoil the movie, c***".
Gaynor also reportedly said, "I'll shoot you."
"He pointed his firearm at the vicinity of the complainant and held it stationary for five seconds," the documents say. "The offender's finger was on the receiver and not the trigger. The offender was laughing throughout this incident."
Gaynor ultimately pleaded guilty to "carrying a firearm with disregard for the complainant's safety."
"This is a case where the skylarking and tomfoolery in an employment context has gone awry," Gaynor's counsel Chris Micali told the court.
"This is going to cost him dearly."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
