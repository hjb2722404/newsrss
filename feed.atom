        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump donor Elizabeth Fago, who infamously hosted a Trump 2020 fundraiser where Ashley Biden’s stolen diary was allegedly distributed, a sold his Florida waterfront estate to Jupiter for $12.5 million. 
The six-bedroom mansion sits at Tony Admiral’s Cove, the glitzy marina, golf and country club just 20 miles from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. 
Residents of Admiral’s Cove include Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who bought their mansion for $9.7 million, apparently with the help of Fago’s son, Joey Fago, who was their broker. 
The 10,000 square foot stone and timber home is at 372 Regatta Drive.  It comprises a master bedroom with a double bathroom and fitted wardrobes, including a “shoe wall”.  There’s also a morning bar with a library area, a theater, a gym, a chef’s kitchen, lots of marble, and even space for a gift-wrapping room. 
Fago, who made his fortune in the nursing home sector, also seems to have a particular preference for the color pink.  The house includes a pink home office and a pink stone shower.

The outdoor space includes a patio, outdoor kitchen, swimming pool and dock – as well as a guest house.  The house also has a six-car garage.
Fago bought the land for $5.7 million in 2006 and then built the villa-like estate in 2012. It was first marketed for $12.75 million last year.  The price was raised last May to $17.49 million following a broker swap. 
The listing brokers are Chad Carroll and Matthew Dugow of Compass.  The buyer was replaced by Vince Marotta at Illustrated Properties, Marotta Group.

Alvarez, along with several priests and lay people, had been holed up at his residence in Matagalpa in central Nicaragua since August 4, alleged by authorities of inciting violence to destabilize the Central American country.
The incident is the latest in a worsening standoff between civil society and a government accused of growing authoritarianism.
The Catholic Church in Nicaragua has been under increasing government pressure since opposition protests in 2018 were met with repression that resulted in hundreds of deaths.

The Federalist: As Questions Mount About Corruption In Ukraine, The Neocon Narrative Is Unraveling  
The Washington establishment would rather cast aspersions on those asking questions about corruption in Ukraine than recognize the problem. 
Americans who even casually followed the news in the fall of 2020 probably know that Ukraine was infamously corrupt long before the United States sent the country $54 billion in aid after the Russian invasion in February. They might not know much else about Ukraine, but they know it’s the kind of place where just being the son of the vice president of the United States can get you an $83,000 monthly paycheck for sitting on the board of an energy company. 
No one knows this better than Ukrainians themselves, who have to put up with a level of official corruption on par with countries like Mexico and Gabon.

I would not be surprised if a third of it is being skimmed off for bribes and pay-offs. And as for the tens of billions that are being loaned to Kyiv and even more promised for the future. Here is an easy prediction. That money is never going to be paid back.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Russia deploys three MiG-31 fighter jets armed with nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles on 'high alert' to its European enclave of Kaliningrad in fresh threat to NATO 
* Three Russian MiG-31 jets carrying hypersonic missiles deployed in Kaliningrad 
* Kinzhals can be armed with nuclear warheads and fly 12 times speed of sound 
* Russia said new aircraft will be on round-the-clock alert, in fresh threat to NATO 
* As jets were deployed, Finland said two of the same fighters violated its airspace 
Russia has deployed three new fighters armed with nuclear-capable missiles to its European enclave in a fresh threat to NATO. 
The MiG-31 jets landed at Chkalovsk airbase in Kaliningrad - which borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania - on Thursday, Moscow's defence ministry said. 
The jets are specially modified MiG-31K variants meaning they can carry Kinzhal or 'Dagger' hypersonic missiles, which can be armed with nuclear warheads and fly at 12 times the speed of sound which Putin says makes them 'unstoppable'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, during the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, numerous atrocities were committed in small towns north of Kyiv – horrors that are still being documented today. In Bucha, an estimated 458 prisoners of war and civilians were slaughtered under Russian occupation, at least fifty of whom are yet to be identified. 
The victims are now being buried in the local cemetery while the investigation into their identities continues. A truck arrives from the Bucha town morgue — inside, the remains of 20 unidentified bodies. It's the third such burial at the town cemetery in the last week. Father Andriy stands alone among the dead — there are no relatives here to mourn their passing. As they are lowered into the ground, he is here to ensure they will not be forgotten.
"It is very important for us to bury them with dignity, not just to bury them as bodies, but to bury them as people with the hope of resurrection from the dead," says the Orthodox priest. 
Six months after the massacre in Bucha, the scene at the cemetery is the beginning of a process of closure. However, it won't be complete until every last body has been identified and the relatives informed]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Thursday said she was upset that videos of her dancing at private parties were published online as they were meant to be seen only by friends.
Marin, 36, spoke after a two-minute video of her singing and dancing with well-known local influencers and artists spread on social media and in Finnish media on Wednesday.
The clips were originally posted to a private Instagram account. Marin, who became the world's youngest serving government leader in December 2019, said she knew she was being filmed but never thought the videos would become publicly available.
"These videos are private and filmed in a private space. I resent that these became known to the public," Marin told reporters. She said she did not know who leaked them.
Many Finns have voiced support for the young leader for combining a private life with her high-profile career. But newspaper Helsingin Sanomat said the episode raised questions about her judgement.
"Marin may have acted in good faith, but this gullible she should not be," the paper wrote in an editorial.
"The prime minister can, in a sensitive situation, put the weapons of information warfare in the hands of those who would like to hurt Finland," the newspaper said.
Marin said the video was a compilation of clips from two separate occasions a few weeks ago. She said people at the events consumed alcohol but no one took drugs to her knowledge.
"We just partied, also in a boisterous way. I danced and sang," Marin said, denying a claim that the videos had been a publicity stunt less than a year until the next general election.
Marin in January told Reuters she and her fellow young female ministers have been targeted with extensive hate speech for their gender and appearance while in office.

Misuzulu Zulu, 47, is set to succeed his father, Goodwill Zwelithini, who died in March last year after 50 years in charge.
Although the title of king does not bestow executive power, Zulu monarchs wield great moral influence over more than 11 million Zulus, who make up nearly a fifth of South Africa's population.
On Saturday, Misuzulu will enter the "cattle kraal" at the Zulu royal residence or KwaKhethomthandayo in Nongoma, a small town in the ethnic group's southeastern heartland province of KwaZulu-Natal.
There, he will take part in a secret rite designed to present the new monarch to h…]]></summary>

Reuters: Canada disburses C$450 mln loan to Ukraine for heating fuel 
OTTAWA, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Canada has disbursed C$450 million ($348.1 million) in loans to Ukraine to support the purchase of necessary heating fuel before winter, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement on Wednesday. 
The amount is a part of a C$1.95 billion in loans Canada committed to Ukraine to support Kyiv during the Russian invasion.

WNU Editor: The official Canadian government announcement is here .... Canada disburses $450 million in loans to Ukraine (Government of Canada). 
I heat my home with oil, and my cost has increased by about 70% in one year. The Canadian government has already made it very clear that there will be no support for oil consumers like me. And as for this $450 million loan. I am more than willing to bet that this money will never be repaid back.
 Update: Did some thinking and I then realized that almost no one heats with oil in Ukraine. Certainly none of my friends or family members do. And then I did some digging and found that heating with oil is negligible in Ukraine (link here). 
So where is this $450 million really going? 
I am willing to bet that this money will be used to buy diesel/heating oil, but it will be used to fuel Ukrainian military vehicles, not homes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just The News: Old case over audio tapes in Bill Clinton's sock drawer could impact Mar-a-Lago search dispute 
Judge ruled in 2012 that a president's discretion to declare records "personal" is far-reaching and mostly unchallengeable. 
When it comes to the National Archives, history has a funny way of repeating itself. And legal experts say a decade-old case over audio tapes that Bill Clinton once kept in his sock drawer may have significant impact over the FBI search of Melania Trump's closet and Donald Trump's personal office. 
The case in question is titled Judicial Watch v. National Archives and Records Administration and it involved an effort by the conservative watchdog to compel the Archives to forcibly seize hours of audio recordings that Clinton made during his presidency with historian Taylor Branch. 
For pop culture, the case is most memorable for the revelation that the 42nd president for a time stored the audio tapes in his sock drawer at the White House. The tapes became the focal point of a 2009 book that Branch wrote. 
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington D.C. ultimately rejected Judicial Watch's suit by concluding there was no provision in the Presidential Records Act to force the National Archives to seize records from a former president.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: It is amazing how history continues to repeat itself. 
As to the Mar-a-Lago raid. I just do not see how a case can be made that the documents that were seized were not classified "properly". As the above article accurately states .... 
.... On the classification issue, both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama signed executive orders — which remain in force to this day — declaring that presidents have sweeping authority to declassify secrets and do not have to follow the mandatory declassification procedures all other government officials do.]]></summary>

“a majority of Americans, 53%, view the FBI as “Joe Biden‘s personal Gestapo,” according to a new Rasmussen poll out Thursday.”
Liberals' FBI trust is a real gut buster https://t.co/QCdTUk61nl via @nypost
— Rasmussen Reports (@Rasmussen_Poll) August 18, 2022
    Washington Examiner: Majority see FBI as Biden’s 'personal Gestapo' after Trump raid 
The Justice-backed FBI raid of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago winter resort home has increased the percentage of people who believe that President Joe Biden is using the G-men as his “personal Gestapo.” 
In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey, 53% of likely voters agreed that “there is a group of politicized thugs at the top of the FBI that are using the FBI as Joe Biden’s personal Gestapo.”

WNU Editor: The optics of the FBI raid on former President Trump's home are terrible. And remarks by Attorney General Garland justifying the raid convinced no one but only those who already have a predisposed hatred for Trump. Glenn Reynolds sums it up best .... If you don’t want to be thought of as corrupt thugs, try not being corrupt thugs.]]></summary>

   Daily Mail: Finland's 'Party PM' Sanna Marin faces MORE leaked video embarrassment: Married leader, 36, 'dances intimately with male pop star' at 4am in new clip - a day after she was forced to deny using drugs at wild party 
* Sanna Marin facing fresh questions as more footage of wild night out leaks 
* Married mother-of-one shown dancing intimately with rock singer in a club 
* Witnesses say she danced with three men and sat on the laps of two male companions after her entourage rolled into Klubi venue around 2.30am 
* Comes after Ms Marin denied taking drugs when more video taken earlier in the evening that captured someone using a slang word for cocaine 
Finland's prime minister is under fresh scrutiny today after video that shows the married mother-of-one dancing intimately with a man in a night club emerged. 
The footage, which is circulating on social media, shows 36-year-old Sanna Marin in Klubi night club around 4am on August 7 with her arms around a man who - according to Finnish media - is singer-songwriter Olavi Uusivirta. 
The pair can be seen swaying hip-to-hip as Uusivirta brings his face close to Mrs Marin's neck and holds his hand in the small of her back.

As Kyiv’s artillery starts to hit Russian forces in the south, analysts are left wondering whether there’s more to come.

The war in Ukraine should galvanize policy makers in Washington.  It demonstrated that the American defense industrial base is not up to the task of supplying the American military with weapons for a protracted conventional conflict with a great power like China.  Production lines for Stinger and Javelin missiles destined for Ukraine are stretched to capacity, with critical components no longer being produced in sufficient quantities to meet demand. 

The industrial skills required for sustained conventional warfare have atrophied.  In 2018, the Trump administration identified nearly 300 significant gaps in 10 “…]]></summary>

I just wanted to thank the heroes of the Greenfield Police Department, as well as the heroes of the local fire department and the heroes of the local ambulance services for their outstanding work in helping me after I was hit by a vehicle and seriously injured the night of Monday, August 15, using a crosswalk to cross Elm Street across from the Franklin County Jail.  Greenfield Police Department officers were professional, courteous and responded to the crime scene within half an hour.  I pray that whoever hit me on the crosswalk will be caught and brought to justice.  I’m sure the Greenfield police are doing their best, and I can’t wait to see the suspect sent to jail for his crime against me.
Thank you to everyone involved, including the staff at Greenfield Hospital as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pictured: A map showing where the Chinese aircraft entered the country's the country's Air Defence Identification Zone and crossed the median line 
 Daily Mail: The world's most dangerous tit-for-tat: China deploys 51 warplanes and six ships around Taiwan in response to America sending nuclear stealth bombers over Pacific and the island democracy agreeing to U.S. trade talks 
* Taiwan said 25 Chinese aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line or flew into Taiwan's air defence zone, in the latest provocation from Beijing 
* Move came after U.S. government said it would hold trade talks with Taiwan 
* Earlier this month, Beijing fired missiles towards Taiwan to intimidate the island 
* This was after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this month became the highest-ranking American official to visit the island in 25 years 
Taiwan's defence ministry said 51 Chinese aircraft and six Chinese ships had been detected operating around Taiwan on Thursday as Beijing continued military activities near the island.
That included 25 aircraft that crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, which in normal times acts as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, or flew into Taiwan's air defence zone.

(CNN)The World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has suggested that racism is behind a lack of international attention being paid to the plight of civilians in Ethiopia's war-shattered Tigray region. 
Calling it the "worst humanitarian crisis in the world", with 6 million people unable to access basic services, Tedros questioned in an emotional appeal why the situation is not getting the same attention as the Ukraine conflict. 
"Maybe the reason is the color of the skin of the people," Tedros, who is from Tigray, told a virtual media briefing on Wednesday. In April this year at a briefing, he questioned whether "black and white lives" in emergencies worldwide are given equal attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Patricia Zengerle, Idrees Ali and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration is readying about $800 million of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Biden would authorize the assistance using his Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks, the sources told Reuters.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that an announcement could slip into next week, cautioning that weapons packages can change in value before they are announced.
The White House declined to comment.
Since Russian troops poured over the Ukrainian border in February in what Russian President Vladimir Putin termed a "special military operation," the conflict has settled into a war of attrition fought primarily in the east and south of Ukraine.
Washington has sent billions of dollars in security assistance to the Kyiv government.

The stones were discovered on a plot of land in Huelva, a province which flanks the southernmost part of Spain's border with Portugal, near the Guadiana River.
Spanning some 600 hectares (1,500 acres), the land had been earmarked for an avocado planation.
But before granting the permit, the regional authorities requested a survey in light of the site's possible archaeological significance -- and revealed the presence of the stones.

A 500 kilogram World War II bomb was discovered during building work in Berlin on Thursday, forcing evacuations.
The bomb in the Friedrichshain district will have to be defused.
"There could be up to 12,000 people in the area of the exclusion zone, and it will take time," a police spokeswoman said.
An emergency shelter has been set up at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, which is normally used for concerts and sports events.
The 500-metre exclusion zone includes the busy Ostkreuz train station in the east of the German capital.

The Piedmontese cattle on the farm in Sommariva del Bosco, near Turin in northwest Italy, died suddenly due to acute prussic acid poisoning on August 6, according to the local IZS animal welfare body.
This acid comes from dhurrin, which is naturally present in young sorghum plants, although not in the same high concentrations as those found in samples taken at the site.

VOA: Zelenskyy Hosting UN Chief, Turkey’s President in Lviv 
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Thursday for the United Nations to ensure the security of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia facility, controlled by Russian forces and operated by Ukrainian technicians. 
Zelenskyy, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said that “the deliberate terror” by Russia in attacking the power plant “can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world.  "Therefore, the U.N. must ensure the security of this strategic object, its demilitarization and complete liberation from Russian troops," Zelenskyy said after meeting in the western Ukraine city of Lviv with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
For his part, Guterres called for the site to be “demilitarized,” with the withdrawal of military equipment and personnel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has ruled out a formal church investigation into a sexual assault claim against Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet after preliminary inquiries found no basis for one, the Vatican said Thursday.
Ouellet, once considered a strong candidate to be pope, was named in court documents this week relating to a class action suit targeting more than 80 members of the clergy in the archdiocese of Quebec.
The 78-year-old is accused of abusing a female intern identified only as "F" from 2008 to 2010, when he was archbishop of Quebec.
In its first response to the case, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that a "preliminary investigation" already ordered by Pope Francis had found there were "no elements to initiate a trial".
The pontiff went back to the author of that probe, a Father Jacques Servais, and was told again that there were no grounds for opening a formal investigation.
"Following further relevant consultations, Pope Francis declares that there are insufficient elements to open a canonical investigation for sexual assault by Cardinal Ouellet against person F," the statement said.
Ouellet is a prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, one of the most important functions within the Curia, the government of the Vatican.]]></summary>

An American military expert has revealed that Ukraine may be forced into an 'ammo diet' after its current sources from allied countries dry up. 
Ukraine may soon be starved of ammunition following a reduction in the amount of ammo provided to it by its European allies.  According to American military expert and analyst Michael Kofman in a recent interview with Der Spiegel of Germany, Ukraine may be strapped for bullets and ammunition relatively soon as allied nations providing the country with ammunition are reaching their weapon supply limits. 
Notably, reports indicate that since Western support has a limit in terms of weapon supplies, it's not in Ukraine's best interest to bide for time as it makes making counteroffensive maneuvers much more difficult.

Update: Ukraine could be put on ‘ammo diet’ – US military expert (RT)   
WNU Editor: It looks like this "ammo diet" is being enforced now. Weapon transfers from Europe have dropped appreciably in the past month. And in regards to U.S. arms transfers, a number of retired US generals and ex-officials are now sounding the alarm .... 19 retired generals and ex-officials urge US to increase arms supplies to Ukraine (The Guardian).   
Update #2: Here is a complete list of US arms that have been transferred to Ukraine .... By the numbers: Keeping track of the single largest arms transfer in US history (Responsible Statecraft).]]></summary>

Space News: China’s spaceplane remains in orbit but clues emerge from recovered launch debris 
HELSINKI — A Chinese reusable experimental spacecraft remains in orbit nearly two weeks after launch, despite passing directly over its expected landing site early Monday. 
The “reusable experiment spacecraft” launched from Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert atop of a Long March 2F rocket Aug. 4 and has remained in 346 by 593 kilometer orbit inclined by 50 degrees since launch, according to tracking by the U.S. Space Force’s 18th Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS). 
Though China has released no details of the mission, there are clear differences from the spacecraft’s apparent first outing in September 2020. The new mission orbit is more eccentric than that of the first, when the spaceplane spent two days in an orbit of 331 by 347 kilometers.

He suggested that such an act could lead to greater long-term risk.
The official notice was signed by the CEO of the Prudential Authority, Fundi Tshazibana.  In the past, some South African banks had severed their ties with Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) – as they are called in the document – ​​due to unclear regulations or a high risk factor. .
However, the advisory stresses that risk assessment does not mean giving up on crypto altogether:

Politicians and litigators are blocking companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain like Bonnie and Clyde.  The shotgun is Federal Judge Dan Aaron Polster, who on Wednesday ordered CVS,
            Walgreens
      and
            walmart
      providing $650 million to two counties in Ohio to address opioid abuse.  Now on to the next raid. 
Judge Polster is overseeing some 3,000 opioid lawsuits brought by municipalities and their attorney friends against drug manufacturers, distributors and retailers.  His explicit goal is to push companies to write a big check to do “something meaningful to alleviate the crisis”, as he said during a hearing in 2018. “We don’t need a lot of memoirs and we don’t need trials.”

James Barna couldn’t be more wrong when he says banning parking on Lincoln and Sunset Avenues in Amherst will deprive city workers, who are Amherst taxpayers, of their rightful parking spots.
How do we know he’s wrong?  The evidence is there for everyone.  During the Christmas, Spring and Long Summer holidays, UMass does not park there.  And during school term, when people park there, they all walk north on Lincoln to campus.  They do not work in downtown businesses and businesses.
The only people who would be denied parking if these bans were passed are UMass students and employees who park there to avoid paying fees for the parking spaces made available to them on campus.
As he says, they are not all Amherst taxpayers either.  Many of them don’t live or register their cars in Amherst, so don’t pay property tax or auto excise in Amherst.
When UMass is in session, these two-way streets become one-way hazards.  We who live on Lincoln and Sunset are not just inconvenienced.  We are in danger when firefighters and other emergency vehicles cannot get quick and direct access to our homes.  The speed bumps mentioned by Mr. Barna may slow traffic, but they do not widen our streets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ars Technica: After ICBM test, US stresses it was “not the result of current world events” 
Test comes after delays due to Russia, China tensions.  Early on Tuesday morning, an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, to test the capabilities of the US nuclear armed forces. 
The missile carried a test reentry vehicle, which traveled about 6,700 km to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where there is sophisticated tracking equipment to verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system. 
During an armed conflict, such a missile, which has a range of nearly 10,000 km, could be equipped with a nuclear warhead.

“The way to stop race-based discrimination is to stop race-based discrimination,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in 2007. Yet too many institutions continue to discriminate in the name of redressing discrimination.  The latest example is that of the public schools in Minneapolis.
The new Minneapolis teachers’ collective agreement requires layoffs to be based on seniority — also known as “last in, first out” — if positions need to be cut for financial reasons.  But minority teachers tend to be younger and less experienced than white teachers.  Thus, the contract exempts members of an “underrepresented group” from the seniority layoff rule.

Far from the Seine river where a beluga strayed in early August north of Paris, the estuaries that flow into the bay in northern Canada offer a sanctuary for the small white whales to give birth in relative warm and shelter.
In the murky bay, the belugas, with small dark eyes and what look like wide smiles, seem to enjoy the presence of a cluster of tourists who travelled to the remote town of Churchill -- home to some 800 people and only accessible by train or plane -- to observe the cetaceans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guatemala said Wednesday it had recovered 33 pre-Columbian artifacts that were voluntarily returned from a private collection in Germany.
Through its embassy, Guatemala "recovered 15 pieces and 18 archaeological fragments that were identified as part of the cultural heritage of our country," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
"Guatemala is grateful for the voluntary return of the objects that form an important part of the country's history, and it gives hope that other holders of similar pieces in private collections may take this same step," the ministry added.
The objects included bowls, other vessels and ceramic figurines dating from the periods between 1,000 BC and 250 AD, and 250-900 AD.
The Maya civilization reached its height in what is present-day southern Mexico and Guatemala, as well as parts of Belize, El Salvador and Honduras, between 250 and 900 AD.

The industry is trying to adapt to this onerous new reality through a variety of techniques, from bringing back forgotten grape varieties to moving their vineyards to new locations.
Winegrowers have had to start their harvests early in several French regions because of the summer’s searing heatwaves. In the southwestern Languedoc-Roussillon, they kicked off the harvest period at the end of July. In Haute-Corse, the northern part of Corsica, they began harvesting at the beginning of August. Both regions carried out their harvests one to three weeks earlier than usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dressed in jeans, sweatpants and abayas, dozens of Ethiopian schoolgirls practice the art of nailing a landing and finding their balance -- and their confidence -- as they zip across a skatepark in Addis Ababa.
Some gingerly slide forward a few meters, holding a friend's hand for support, while others zoom across ramps and concrete bumps at full speed.
Members of Ethiopian Girl Skaters, an all-female group set up by skateboarders Sosina Challa and Micky Asfaw, the girls -- some as young as six -- are pushing back against gender stereotypes and having fun doing it.
Challa, 24, told AFP she set up the organization to empower young women, who often struggle to take up extreme sports because of a commonly-held belief in Ethiopia that "girls should stay home and help their parents".
Since she co-founded the group in December 2020, she and the other mentors in the organization have taught more than 150 girls how to skate.
Hanna Bless, a 22-year-old stylist who started skateboarding two years ago, told AFP: "It's not really common for a girl to start skating because people don't support you.
"But somebody had to be the first, some group had to start and we were the first one and I feel honored to be part of that," she added.
Although Ethiopia is home to many skateboarding groups, they are largely dominated by male skaters.
With time, the women skateboarders have learned to cope not just with the inevitable bruises the sport brings but also the criticism from naysayers.
Iman Mahamud, 17, told AFP that after 18 months of lessons, she no longer cared about "what people say about me being a girl and doing such stuff".
"It helped me defeat my fears," she said.
"I just enjoy it. It makes me happy."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A South Korean city near Seoul has successfully implemented a pilot program that allows police to seize crypto from the exchange accounts of individuals with traffic fines.
Gunpo, a city of about 275,000 people in the northwest province of Gyeonggi, was selected by the national government to run the pilot program in 2022, which took place on Aug. 16. report news outlet JoongBoo Ilbo said it was a way to collect overdue funds in a “contactless” or “non-contact” way.
The program appears to have been successful, at least in the first half of 2022, with Gunpo police achieving an 88% collection rate on traffic fines totaling $668,000, setting the city on pace to significantly exceed its goal of chasing $759,000 in traffic fines by the end of the year.
However, the trial only saw overdue fines totaling an excess of approximately $759 by an individual subjected to crypto seizures by the police, while the crypto seizures were only a measure taken if the funds on the individual’s bank accounts were already depleted. 
Related: Do Kwon allegedly hired lawyers in South Korea to prepare Terra investigation
Jungo Ilbo said fines collected in the first half of the year already exceed total annual collections in each of the past three years.
The Korean crypto market is lucrative for law enforcement because it reached $45.9 billion in 2021although the report did not indicate what crypto would be seized and sold to pay fines.

Federal Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart will hold a hearing Thursday on whether to unseal the affidavit the Federal Bureau of Investigation used to justify last week’s search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home.  The public interest is best served if the judge lets Americans see what only he and federal officials now know.
On Friday, Judge Reinhart issued the warrant for research after Attorney General Merrick Garland and Mr. Trump called for his release.  The public gleaned general information about the warrant and what was collected, but not enough to conclude whether the unprecedented search of a former president’s home was justified.  The affidavit almost certainly includes more detail about the legal and factual bas…]]></summary>

On July 20, President Joe Biden visited the site of the former Brayton Point coal-fired power plant on the South Shore of Massachusetts to call for action on climate change.  Less than a month later, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Congress have answered that call, in what I hope will be the start of a cascade of climate action.
When you think about global warming, you might feel concerned – and for good reason.  We see the effects of global warming all around us, as anyone who experienced this summer’s heat wave can attest.
Responding to the call to action, last week Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed a far-reaching climate bill that will help make our homes and businesses more energy efficient, put more electri…]]></summary>

The first cause is slavery.	
The second cause is slavery.	
And the third cause is slavery.	
The civil war started because of slavery, period.	
Was it about other things?	
Yes.	
Would this have happened if he	
weren’t for the slavery party?	
No.	
It was not about states’ rights.	
Read it –	
the Confederate States, when they seceded,	
it was a question of preserving slavery.	
How not to say that it is slavery?	
I think people are so attached to the morality of slavery	
this may not necessarily have been the root cause.	
The existence of slavery as an economic tool in the South	
was one of the main causes of the civil war.	
The North was not the pious North,	
and the South was not the bad South.	
The North profited greatly from slavery,	
just as much as the South did.	
Remove the slaves from the South	
essentially took most of their wealth.	
The reconstruction was a period	
in which the federal government has maintained a very close link	
eye on the South.	
And as a result, you see some successes	
within the African-American community.	
You see that black people have seats in Congress.	
You see an increase in voting rights.	
However, it comes to an abrupt end.	
There’s gonna be a deal	
and it’s called the compromise of 1877.	
Republicans will make a deal	
retain the presidency.	
The army will be withdrawn from the South.	
And from 1877 until the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s,	
the South will be dominated by segregation.	
It was an opportunity for this country to do things right.	
Yeah, could have.	
But we didn’t.	
What really happened	
we are still recovering from now.	
What really happened is 100 years of	
institutionalized racism.	
I want them to understand that the Reconstruction continues	
touches us today.	
I do not say,	
reconstruction,	
we didn’t quite understand.	
I show them all this evidence.	
Nine times out of 10 they will

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he strategically downplayed the impending Russian invasion to prevent a financial panic that he says would have resulted in his country swiftly falling to the Kremlin. 
Zelensky described the delicate balancing act he faced leading up to the invasion in an interview with The Washington Post published Tuesday. The remarks by the Ukrainian leader sheds light on why Zelensky publicly contradicted statements of U.S. officials who accurately predicted Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
As Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed more than 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine in January, President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials increasingly sounded the alarm that Russia would launch an invasion.

Russia is hosting the Tenth Moscow Conference on International Security, an event that brings together defense ministers, heads of international organizations, and experts and think-tank representatives from around the world. 
The collective West is purposely destroying the European security system with NATO moving further east, said Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, addressing the X Moscow Conference on International Security.   
"Western globalist elites are provoking chaos by rekindling old and inciting new conflicts, implementing a policy of so-called containment, while undermining any alternative, sovereign paths of development. Thus, they are desperately trying to preserve the hegemony and power that are slipping out of their grasp, trying to keep countries and peoples in the grip of a neo-colonial order,” Putin stated.

Daily Mail: Is Putin Plotting to Unleash Hell on This Holiday? 
Fears are mounting among Ukrainian officials that Russian President Vladimir Putin might choose to escalate his attacks on Ukraine during the country’s Independence Day holiday next week. 
“We must definitely be prepared for possible missile strikes,” said Yuriy Ihnat, Spokesperson for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on Wednesday. He warned that Russia has a preference for using certain special dates for so-called “congratulations.” 
There are concerns that Russia might use Belarus as a launchpad for attacks given a flurry of movements observed there in recent days, according to Ihnat. 
“We constantly observe the movement of [Russian] troops in the territory of Belarus, as well as the transportation of ammunition, Iskander and other types of missiles. This happens all the time. If an Il-76 flies from the Russian Federation to the territory of Belarus, then it is clear that it delivers weapons,” Ihnat said.

   The Eurasian Times: China’s Version Of HIMARS Bombard Taiwan Strait; Experts Call It Game-Changer In Conflict With Taipei 
Images have emerged on social media of a Chinese Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), described as China’s version of US-made HIMARS that has gained a ‘cult status’ after their deployment in Ukraine. According to an expert, this Chinese-made MLRS could be a ‘game changer’ in a potential conflict with Taiwan. 
The pictures were posted on Twitter by Lyle Goldstein, the Director of Asia Engagement at the Defense Priorities think tank. 
According to Goldstein, the images, sourced from the Chinese television channel CCTV-7, showed the MLRS firing rockets into the Taiwan Strait on August 4, as part of the Chinese military drills in waters surrounding Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s arrival on the island by aircraft on August 2, despite several warnings from China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of QAnon believers over the weekend tried to conduct citizens arrests of police officers in the city of Peterborough, Ontario -- and then promptly got thrown into the slammer themselves.
As Vice News reports, the QAnon faithful were in the city at the behest of Romana Didulo, the so-called "QAnon Queen" who earlier this year declared herself to be the "Leader of the World" during an event at a campground parking lot.
Didulo instructed her supporters to arrest the Peterborough officers for enforcing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as mask requirements.
As Vice News recounts, Didulo's plan resulted in one follower being "charged with two counts of assaulting police" another follower being slapped with "charges of mischief and resisting arrest" and a third being "arrested and charged with a myriad of charges, including assaulting a peace officer with a weapon."

Peterborough Mayor Diane Therrien took to Twitter on Tuesday to profanely mock the QAnon believers who thought they could get away with arresting her city's police officers.
"People have been asking me to comment on the events of the past weekend," she wrote. "I hate giving airtime/spotlight to these imbeciles. Here is my comment: f*ck off, you f*ckwads."

Researchers say that the lava flow at a volcano in Iceland that started erupting earlier this month has slowed down in the past few days.
According to measurements by researchers at the University of Reykjavik, the lava flow was only moving at two metres per second on Tuesday. This number is subject to change, however.
The researchers said it is not possible to say whether the slowing lava flow is that the eruption is coming to an end or whether it is just a temporary slowdown.
The eruption started in a valley near Fagradalsfjall mountain on the Reykjanes peninsula south-west of Reykjavik, on August 3.
Thousands of tourists have visited the site of the eruption, a chasm which is hundreds of metres long.
To the annoyance of the Icelandic authorities, onlookers have repeatedly strayed into the lava field.
The path to the eruption site is to remain closed on Wednesday due to a storm warning.

The group's former leader, Mike Dunn, has been fighting in Ukraine already, but he says at least ten new members are headed to the front to "help." Ukrainians on the ground have seen American "soldiers" waving tropical-looking flags, assuming they're coming as far away as Hawaii, but that isn't the case. 
"The movement made its way offline and onto American streets in early 2020, when groups of young men in Hawaiian shirts carrying AR-style rifles started showing up to anti-lockdown protests," explained Vice. 
The term "boogaloo" came from memes that encourage a violent uprising against the American government and the start of a second civil war. Aside from…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has suggested that racism is behind a lack of international attention being paid to the plight of civilians in Ethiopia's war-shattered Tigray region.
Calling it the "worst humanitarian crisis in the world", with 6 million people unable to access basic services, Tedros questioned in an emotional appeal why the situation is not getting the same attention as the Ukraine conflict.
"Maybe the reason is the colour of the skin of the people," Tedros, who is from Tigray, told a virtual media briefing on Wednesday. In April this year at a briefing, he questioned whether "black and white lives" in emergencies worldwide are given equal attention.
WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan also hit out at an apparent shortage of concern about the drought and famine unfolding in the Horn of Africa, and the ensuing health crisis.
"No one seems to give a damn about what's happening in the Horn of Africa," said Ryan, speaking at a virtual media briefing on Wednesday.
The WHO called for $123.7 million to tackle the health problems resulting from growing malnutrition in the region, where around 200 million people live and millions are going hungry.
