Bloomberg: B-21 Bomber Delivers Pentagon Surprise: It’s Under Budget So Far 
(Bloomberg) -- Northrop Grumman Corp.’s cost estimate for developing the new B-21 stealth bomber has come in lower than the US Air Force’s $25.1 billion projection, according to the service’s chief weapons buyer, a rare early-stage success story among major weapons programs that routinely run billions over budget. 
“We had money in the program budget that went beyond the contractually required payments” so that “gave us the opportunity” to target the money for early spending on riskier aspects of the program, Andrew Hunter, assistant secretary for acquisition, said in an interview. 
How much Northrop was able to save is classified, as are most details about the Air Force’s next-generation bomber. The service has estimated that the B-21 is likely to cost at least $203 billion to develop, purchase and then operate 100 aircraft over 30 years.

Newsweek: Was Joe Biden Taking on Vladimir Putin His Biggest Blunder as President? 
President Joe Biden is facing crucial midterm elections as the U.S. copes with the highest inflation in 40 years, record-breaking gas prices and concerns about the cost of food. 
Those issues come as the Biden administration has offered strong support to Ukraine in its fight against a Russian invasion, which has now lasted more than 100 days, and seen severe sanctions imposed on President Vladimir Putin's country. 
Biden met Putin in Geneva, Switzerland just over one year ago. The two presidents held a summit on June 16, 2021 and relations have deteriorated substantially since then because of the invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24 this year.

WNU Editor: What is President Biden's "biggest blunder"? 
Afghanistan? 
Energy policies? 
Fiscal, budget, and monetary policies? 
Supply chains? 
Broken border and rising crime? 

China? 
Russia and the Ukraine war? 
IMHO it is the White's House's economic policies that will be remembered as Biden's biggest blunder as President.]]></summary>

I was born and raised in Baltimore.  I was in middle school when ‘The Wire’ was shot – it was shot near McCulloh Homes and also sometimes near Harlem Park, where my school was.  At the time, everyone thought, wow, it’s Baltimore time.  It was a very exciting experience for the city.


I was too young to watch “The Wire” in middle school.  When I saw him in college, I thought the acting was really wonderful.  Wendell Pierce, who played Bunk Moreland, is one of my favorite actors, and as a queer person, I thought Michael K. Williams’ Omar was really handsome – how sweet he was to his partner in contrast to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: 'They're like our nerd warriors': How the Treasury Department is waging economic war on Russia  
Washington (CNN)Three months into US-led sanctions designed to crush Russia's economy for its war in Ukraine, Russia has appeared surprisingly resilient. 
The ruble has rebounded and is now worth more than before the invasion. The Kremlin's coffers are overflowing from record oil and gas sales. Even McDonald's has reopened in Russia, rebranded under a Siberian billionaire's ownership. Meanwhile, Russia's military continues to hammer away at Ukraine with a steady supply of tanks and artillery. 
But inside the Treasury Department, teams of sanctions experts view that resilience as a mirage. In exclusive interviews with CNN, top Treasury Department officials say they remain confident the sanctions are working and that beneath the surface, a much more dire story is unfolding within Russia's economy, where they contend real and lasting damage is being inflicted.

Update #2: Do sanctions against Russia work? (DW)

Here is an analysis explaining why the US Treasury Department and the EU are failing in achieving their objectives in their economic war against Russia .... We should’ve known sanctions on Russia wouldn’t work as intended (Daniel Larison, Responsible Statecraft).]]></summary>

President Joe Biden said Thursday Americans were "really, really down." He's right about that. 
A new USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll shows the country in a funk and one that sets a problematic political landscape for Democrats in the November elections that are approaching fast. 
* Only 39% of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president. A stunning 47% "strongly" disapprove; just 16% "strongly" approve. Academic studies have shown that presidential approval is one of the most reliable predictors of what happens in midterm elections, and a rating this low would traditionally signal significant losses for the president's party. 
* More than 7 in 10, 71%, say the United States is "on the wrong track;" 16% say it's headed in the right direction. Even most Democrats say the country is on the wrong track, 46%-34%. Three of 4 independents and nearly every Republican agree.

An Italian energy firm says the Russian company is slashing its deliveries by 50%. France's gas operator says it has not received any natural gas from Russia via its pipeline from Germany for more than a month. 
Italy's energy firm Eni said on Friday that Russian energy giant Gazprom was reducing its gas supplies to Italy by 50%. 
In recent weeks, Moscow has reduced or cut off gas deliveries to several European Union countries, which have imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. 
French network operator GRTgaz also said on Friday that France has not received any Russian gas via Germany since May 15, citing the effects of reduced Russian supply.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called to equip Ukrainian forces with enough weapons and gear to defeat the Russian military, arguing that Kiev must deal the blows as “direct confrontation” between NATO and Moscow is still off the table. 
Speaking to reporters after hosting a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and several European leaders on Tuesday, Rutte said a Ukrainian victory may still be attainable, if only the US-led military bloc provides sufficient ‘lethal aid.’ 
“In terms of weaponry, we stand united here that it is crucial for Russia to lose the war,” he said, suggesting that Ukraine should serve as a conduit for Western arms in order to maximize pain inflicted on Moscow.

AFP: A Chinese invasion of Taiwan: Too costly to countenance? 
On Taiwan's tiny Penghu islands, the missile bases that sit next to white-sand beaches and bustling fish markets are a visceral reminder of the constant threat of attack from China. 
Despite the huge military discrepancy between the two sides, many analysts believe Taiwan's location, inhospitable terrain and US support mean China would find a full-scale invasion extremely hard -- and possibly too costly to countenance. 
Communist China and Taiwan split at the end of a civil war in 1949 with the losing Kuomintang forces retreating to the island. But Beijing insists now-democratically run Taiwan is part of its territory, and that it will one day re-take it, by force if necessary.

WNU Editor: Quoting former US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld .... "you go to war with the Army you have". If Chinese President Xi deems it necessary to invade Taiwan, he will proceed regardless of the military he has or the cost. 
As to what will be the situation for Beijing to launch an invasion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of large lines and demonstrations at Chinese banks in recent weeks.   
Asia Markets: There’s a run on Chinese banks and it’s being ignored by the world 
In the anatomy of an economic crisis, a bank run is the point of no return. 
Bank runs occur when people scramble to withdraw cash from banks in fear of collapse. In the worst cases, banks’ liquid cash reserves are exhausted, not everyone gets their money and the bank defaults. 
It’s a grim scenario which, fortunately, has occurred rarely in history. 
The most significant bank runs in the United States took place during the 1930’s Great Depression. More recently, there were runs on numerous U.S. banks during the Financial Crisis in 2008. 
In Asia, bank runs have also been rare. A run on Japanese banks in 1927 led to the collapse of dozens of institutions across the country. There was a banking crisis in Myanmar in 2003 which the country has never really fully recovered from. 
But perhaps since the Great Depression, none has been as significant compared to what is seemingly unfolding in China right now.    
Read more ....   
Update #1: China’s bank runs highlight abuse among small-bank shareholders, despite crackdown (SCMP) 
Update #2: China’s bank run is the biggest threat to markets right now. Get ready for it to hit the MSM. (Investment Watch)   
WNU Editor: This bank run is for the time being limited. But this can change very quickly. 
Update #3: Oh oh .... Chinese Banks Freeze Billions In Deposits: Officials Use Health QR Code To Bar Protestors (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

Rallies spread across states over news of four-year contract to replace job-for-life scheme 
Young people in India have set trains and tyres alight and vandalised buses in angry protests against a new army recruitment scheme that calls time on a guaranteed job for life. 
The protests took place in Rajasthan, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh after the announcement on Tuesday of the Agnipath (“path of fire”) scheme, which aims to recruit people aged between 17 and 21 on four-year contracts. 
Once the contract ends, 25% of the proposed 45,000 recruits will be allowed to stay on, and the rest must leave. 
Those who don’t qualify to continue their military careers will receive a lump sum of 1.2m rupees (about £12,000) in lieu of a pension or benefits.

Goma, DRC — Regional authorities in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo said Rwandan soldiers and artillery had supported attacks by the M23 rebel group Sunday, accusing Rwanda of seeking to occupy the Congolese border town of Bunagana. 
The violence pushed over 25,000 people to flee the area, with thousands escaping to neighboring Uganda, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA said.
Congo's accusations are part of an escalating dispute between the neighbors that has revived old animosities. 
Rwanda denies backing the M23 offensive.

A day later, reality sank.
Stocks fell on Thursday as investors accepted what the Fed’s tougher stance meant for the economy: higher interest rates and the growing likelihood of a recession.
The S&P 500 closed more than 3% lower, part of a global pullback that saw stocks in Europe also post steep declines as central banks in other countries hiked rates.  With Thursday’s decline, the S&P 500 is now nearly 24% below its Jan. 3 high, plunging deeper into the bear market which officially started on Monday.

30-year fixed mortgage rates do not move in parallel with the Fed’s benchmark rate, but rather follow the yield of 10-year Treasury bills, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including market expectations. inflation, Fed actions and how investors are reacting to it all.
“We’re seeing rates rising quite rapidly and a lot of that has to do with forward-looking expectations of where things are going,” said Len Kiefer, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac.  “Perhaps inflation will be more rigid than the market thought.”


Mortgage rates have jumped two percentage points since the start of 2022, although they have remained relatively stable in recent months.  But with the consumer prices continue to risemortgage rates are on the rise again – by some estimates as high as 6%.


Watched them closely average rates by Freddie Mac won’t be out until Thursday, but they’ve already started to rise a bit last week: 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were 5.23% as of June 9, according to the main survey on Freddie Mac mortgages, down from 5.09 percent the previous week and 2.96 percent the same week in 2021.
Other home loans are more closely tied to the Fed’s decision.  Home equity lines of credit and adjustable rate mortgages — which each carry variable interest rates — typically increase within two billing cycles after a change in federal funds rates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recession is “not inevitable,” President Biden tells AP in an exclusive interview. Biden acknowledged Americans’ frustrations after a tumultuous two years of COVID and volatility in the economy, saying, “People are really, really down.” https://t.co/zo1Ntf77BM
— The Associated Press (@AP) June 16, 2022
   Daily Mail: Biden insists recession is NOT inevitable, admits Americans are 'really, really down' and 'need mental health' and calls Republican claims he caused inflation 'bizarre' in first press interview since February 10 
* Biden sat down with the AP, following a Feb. interview with NBC 
* He said Americans were 'really, really down'    * Said the need for mental health in the country has 'skyrocketed' 
* Comes amid his own low approval ratings and fears of a recession amid high inflation 
* The Fed board of governors raised rates by 75 basis points this week 
* He cited 3.6% unemployment rate as reason for optimism 
President Joe Biden said Americans are 'really, really down' amid record inflation and the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic – but said a recession is 'not inevitable.' 
He made the comments in a 30-minute sit down interview – his first formal sit-down since February, when he spoke to NBC and called interviewer Lester Holt a 'wise guy' over his inflation comments. 
This time, he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by Republican lawmakers that last year's COVID-19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40-year high, calling that argument 'bizarre.'

VOA: EU, Egypt, Israel Agree to Export Israeli Liquified Natural Gas to Europe  
Cairo — Egypt, Israel and the European Union signed a gas deal Wednesday in which Egypt will export Israeli liquified natural gas to Europe via two Egyptian LNG plants. 
The memorandum of understanding was inked at the East Mediterranean Gas Forum in Cairo, expanding upon gas cooperation among the three partners. 
Representatives of participants at the gas forum applauded announcement of the deal. Egypt is the only country in the gas forum to have plants that can produce liquified natural gas.

WNU Editor: This is just a memorandum of understanding. It will be years before Israeli natural gas finds its way to Europe. And even then it may not happen. Israeli officials have made it very clear in the past that the priority customer for this natural gas will be Israel itself.

VOA: UN: Record Numbers Displaced by War, Persecution 
Geneva — A record 89.3 million people had been driven from their homes by war, violence, persecution, and human rights abuse by the end of 2021, up 8% from the previous year, according to the U.N. refugee agency’s annual Global Trends report. 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi says the figures are made even worse when the number of people forced to flee by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is included. 
"Ukraine has displaced anyway between 12 and 14 million people, depending on how you count them. So, the figure has exceeded 100 million. This is due to a rise in conflict and crisis," he said.

Morgenthau bought the co-op, located at 64 E. 86th St. with his wife and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Lucinda Franks, in 1996 — and remained there until his death.  Franks died in May 2021 – and the house is being sold by their estate.

Soon, this may no longer be the case.
This month, the The European Union has announced a mandate this will force all new portable devices like smartphones, headphones and wireless keyboards to use a common charger by 2024. Two years later, the same rules will apply to new laptops.
Although the law is enforced across Europe, it can affect consumers around the world.  Indeed, it will most likely be expensive for tech companies to manufacture products with different charging technology only for European countries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev © Ekaterina Shtukina © Sputnik 
Insider: Russia's former president says Ukraine might not 'even exist on the world map' in 2 years 
* Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president, says Ukraine might not exist in two years. 
* Medvedev, a Putin ally, is gaining a lot of attention over his bombastic Telegram posts. 
* Russia has been accused by Biden, among others, of committing genocide in Ukraine. 
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev made another bombastic statement on Telegram on Wednesday, suggesting that Ukraine might not exist in two years amid Russia's military offensive in the country. 
Medvedev was posting about Ukraine seeking liquefied natural gas from the US under a lend-lease plan that would see it pay Washington back in two years. 
The former Russian leader — a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — apparently is not a fan of this proposal, which comes as Europe vies to end its reliance on Russian energy in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

CNBC: The West’s unity over Ukraine could be starting to crack, just as Russia’s invasion gains ground 
* Western unity over the war in Ukraine is becoming more vulnerable as the conflict drags on.

After a three-year shutdown for repairs and upgrades, the collider has resumed firing protons — the bare innards of hydrogen atoms — around its 17-mile underground electromagnetic racetrack.  In early July, the collider will begin to smash these particles together to create sparks of primordial energy.
And so the great game of chasing the secret of the universe is about to resume, amid new developments and renewed hopes from particle physicists.  Even before its renovation, the collider had hinted that nature might hide something spectacular.

He finds it every time he sets out on Buffalo Bayou, a slow-moving river that runs through the nation’s fourth-largest city and heads toward its port.  And so it was on a recent sweltering morning when he and his longtime deckhand Trey Dennis headed on a small barge to a boom they had put on the water the day before.
“Ah, isn’t that nice,” said Bayou Dave, whose real name is David Rivers, as the boom took shape.
What they sought and knew they would find was cradled in the massive embrace of the boom: a vast jumble of swirling trash.


There was a toy plane, a yellow soccer ball, a foam egg carton, and a pink nail salon flip-flop.  There were takeout containers, disposable toothpicks and foam cups from 7-11 and Chick-fil-A.  …]]></summary>

He was 78 years old.
The cause was multiple health issues, her daughter Silvie Jensen said.
Good American Pinot Noir was rarely seen in 1972, when Mr. Jensen, in love with French Burgundy, the source of the world’s great Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays, set out to produce his own version in California.  With few exceptions, most American Pinot Noirs of the time were straightforward and fruity at best;  more often than not, these were hot central valley stews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese Premier Xi Jinping has signed a directive that permits 'the legal basis for troops to carry out military operations other than war', such as peacekeeping operations, disaster relief and humanitarian efforts, but could be used as a cover for an invasion of Taiwan   
Daily Mail: Is China gearing up for Putin-style 'special operation'? Fears for Taiwan as Xi signs directive allowing for 'non-war' use of military in echo of tactic used by Russia before Ukraine invasion 
* Xi Jinping signed directive allowing military to be used for 'non-war' purposes 
* It is feared it could lead to an invasion of Taiwan similar to invasion of Ukraine 
* Taiwan has threatened Beijing with its new cruise missile in event of an attack 
* Beijing is on a collision course with Australia over bases on the Solomon Islands 
China could be taking a leaf out of Russia's playbook by trialing a new directive which would expand the use of its burgeoning military for 'non-war' purposes. 
The directive, signed by President Xi Jinping, raises concerns Beijing could be paving the way for an invasion of Taiwan under the misnomer of a 'special military operation'. 
Coming in into effect on Wednesday, the directive could provide Beijing with the cover it needs to launch an assault on Taipei without the legal complications or international condemnation that comes with declaring war.

Newsweek: U.S. Nuclear Weapons Spending Compared to China and Russia 
Last year, the world's nine nuclear-armed states—the U.S., Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea—spent $82.4 billion collectively on their nuclear arsenals, a new report by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has revealed.

This increase in spending shows that despite a general ongoing trend of declining nuclear inventories, the nuclear-armed states have continued to invest in modernizing and improving their nuclear arsenals, as well as funding companies and think tanks writing about nuclear policies to support these huge spending budgets.

* Joe Biden spoke to Ukraine's Volodomyr Zelensky for 41 minutes on Wednesday 
* He told him he was sending another billion dollars in military assistance 
* It is believed to include anti-ship missile systems, rockets and artillery shells 
* It brings the US military aid total to more than $5.5 billion since Russia invaded 
* And it comes amid warnings that Ukraine is struggling to keep up with the pace of Russia's long-range shelling and rocket strikes in a new phase of the war 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced he was sending another one billion dollars in military support to Ukraine, after its leaders pleaded for more ammunition to help fight off the Russian invasion. 
The latest package will include anti-ship missile systems, artillery rockets, and rounds for howitzers, people familiar with the packages said. 
It means the U.S. has now delivered more than $5.5 billion of military support since Russia invaded more than 110 days ago.

But the exchanges are made and the players retire.  Injuries happen, and so do upsets.  The postseason game is a grueling glove to run, and it just keeps growing.  Winning a third straight title is one of the toughest feats in team sports, and it seems to be getting harder and harder.

(Bloomberg) -- Two giant Wall Street banks are withdrawing from handling trades of Russian debt after the Biden administration’s surprise announcement last week it’s banning US investors from scooping up such assets. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were still matching sellers who wanted out of the debts with interested buyers this month, according to market professionals. Now, JPMorgan is pulling back after the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said investors in the U.S. aren’t allowed to acquire them, a person with knowledge of the decision said. A spokesperson for Goldman said it’s halting such transactions, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don Perkins, a six-time Pro Bowl running back with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960s, died Thursday.  He was 84 years old.
The Cowboys and the University of New Mexico, where Perkins was a standout player before his professional career, announced the death.  No announcement said where he died, and none cited the cause.
Perkins rushed for 6,217 yards in 107 games with the Cowboys from 1961 to 1968. He is fourth on the team’s career list behind two Pro Football Hall of Famers – Emmitt Smith, the career leader of the NFL, and Tony Dorsett – and the current Cowboys.  running back, Ezekiel Elliott.  Perkins’ 42 rushing touchdowns rank fifth in team history.


While originally drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the ninth round of the 1960 draft, Perkins had already signed a personal services contract with the expansion Cowboys.  Dallas won its rights after sending the Colts a ninth-round draft pick.


Perkins missed the Cowboys’ inaugural season in 1960 with a broken foot.  He ran for 815 yards in 1961 and finished third in voting for NFL Rookie of the Year, behind Mike Ditka and Fran Tarkenton.  He had a career-high 945 rushing yards in 1962.


Donald Anthony Perkins was born on March 4, 1938 in Waterloo, Iowa.  He played for New Mexico from 1957 to 1959 and captained the team in its final two seasons.  The Lobos’ coach at the time, future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, said Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached.
Perkins returned to the Albuquerque area after his professional football career ended.  He then worked as a television and radio football analyst.


Information about survivors was not immediately available.
“Don is one of the greatest Lobos, and certainly one of the greatest football players to play for UNM,” New Mexico athletic director Eddie Nuñez said.  “He came back to New Mexico and worked for the state and was a tremendous ambassador for so many people.”

GENEVA (Reuters) - Any Chinese military attack on Taiwan would have a greater impact on global trade flows than the Ukraine war, Taipei's top trade negotiator told Reuters on Tuesday, saying it would lead to a shortage of semiconductor chips. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February has triggered commodity price hikes and food export bans, leading to fears of famine in poorer countries. 
John Deng said that, were China to attack Taiwan, the potential disruptions could be worse, citing the world's reliance on Taiwan for chips used in electric vehicles and mobile phones.
