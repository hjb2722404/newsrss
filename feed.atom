        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deputy Liberal Leader Sussan Ley says the incident which occurred last month between a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft and a Chinese military jet in the South China Sea is a “provocative action” by China. 

The Defence Department recently revealed a “dangerous manoeuvre” by the Chinese J-16 jet posed a threat to the safety of the crew on the RAAF P-8 maritime aircraft. 

“It’s a provocative action by China, and I come back to our government and our party’s strength and determination,” Ms Ley told Sky News Australia. 

“I will let the geostrategic implications take their course with the current government. It’s for them to take the action that they need to, but it needs to be strong, and it doesn’t need to be taking a backwards step.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Comedian Russell Brand has slammed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for "fermenting discord" within his own country. 

In a 13-minute video posted on his YouTube page on Sunday, Mr Brand said Prime Minister Trudeau is using new powers to crack down on legitimate dissent.  

Last month, Prime Minister Trudeau announced Canada's security agencies will get new tools to combat “extremist ideology” and “misinformation.” 

Mr Brand warned the new powers will erode freedom within Canada.

"It won't mean more freedom, it'll mean their ability to capture your data, share that data, and use that data to manipulate your behaviour,” Mr Brand said.]]></summary>

CNN: Western allies meeting regularly to game out potential framework for Ukraine ceasefire 
Washington (CNN)Staring down the prospect of an extended stalemate in Ukraine, the US and its allies are placing a renewed emphasis on the need for a negotiated settlement to end the war as the conflict grinds into its 100th day with no clear victory in sight for either side. 
US officials have in recent weeks been meeting regularly with their British and European counterparts to discuss potential frameworks for a ceasefire and for ending the war through a negotiated settlement, multiple sources familiar with the talks told CNN.

A ceasefire offer was advanced by US Secretary of Defense Austin to his Russian counterpart Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov two weeks ago, but General Gerasimov declined. The Russian press said the reason why Austin's ceasefire proposal was refused were over concerns that a ceasefire would only be used to re-arm and reinforce the Ukraine military.]]></summary>

French president says door must be left open to allow for improvement in diplomatic relations after war 
Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine, Emmanuel Macron has said, to allow an improvement in diplomatic relations between the west and Moscow whenever the war comes to an end. 
The French president said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, had made a “historic and fundamental” error in invading Ukraine, but that nevertheless a wider escalation in hostilities had to be avoided. 
Giving an interview to a group of regional newspapers in his home country, Macron said: “We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels.”

Update: Russia Must Not Be Humiliated Despite Putin's 'Historic' Mistake - Macron (Reuters).   
WNU editor: I am skeptical that French President Macron is concerned about Putin/Russia be humiliated. I think he is more worried about the West/EU being humiliated if Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is successful, and the West is powerless to do anything about it.   
Update #2: This is not a surprise. The Ukraine government is furious that French President Macron does not want Russia to be "humiliated" .... Ukraine officials hit out at Macron after suggestions Russia 'should not be humiliated' (Euro News).]]></summary>

Estonia’s government has collapsed amid fears Moscow is attempting to destabilise the country, which is hosting a key Nato deployment of British troops. 
Kaja Kallas, the prime minister, accused her coalition partners of “actively working against Estonia’s core values” in the face of the Russian security threat. 
Her liberal Reform party was in an uneasy alliance with the Centre party, which only cut its long-standing ties with Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party after the invasion of Ukraine. 
“The security situation in Europe does not give me any opportunity as prime minister to continue cooperation with the Centre party,” Ms Kallas said before a backdrop of the flags of the EU, Estonia and Nato.

WNU editor: This coalition collapsed for a number of reasons, but the Ukraine war is IMHO the main one. The coalition partner that was kicked-out is mainly supported by Estonia's Russian speaking population (they make up 25% of the population), who only broke ties with the Russian government after the Ukraine invasion.

The company, born from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, also agreed to cooperate with federal authorities as part of his plea deal, according to a statement released by prosecutors.
The investigation focused on an allegation that Fiat Chrysler attempted to circumvent emission standards for some of its pickup trucks and Jeeps.  Prosecutors said the US division, also known as FCA US, had misled customers and regulators for years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox News host Maria Bartiromo urged House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to do something to help the people who rioted on Jan. 6, 2021 if he becomes Speaker of the House.


	"I know that we're 156 days away from the midterm elections," Bartiromo said as McCarthy smiled. "What are you going to do to that committee, the Jan. 6 Committee, should you become the majority because right now as we speak, there are honest -- and people sitting in jail because they were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. They are still in jail a year later."


	McCarthy answered without saying what he would do about the Jan. 6 Committee or the detained rioters if he becomes Speaker.


	"We live in America," McCarthy said. "People have a right to have a say and to go to court. They shouldn't be held for this long inside. You watch what is happening to political opponents with this one-party rule. In 156 days, we're going to become energy independent, we're going to secure our border, we're going to make our streets safe again but we need you to help us."


	"We are not going to bend," he added. "We are not going to let them go after our First Amendment rights and go after the individuals that they're trying to do for political purposes."

Throughout its tenure, the PC government has undergone significant changes in policy, appearance and general tone. A 2018 populist movement has seemingly shifted to the moderate PC coalition of old.
To capture this change, is it necessary for Ford to turn back the clock to 2018? After all, he won both the party leadership and the election on a populist agenda. 
Following the more centrist Patrick Brown’s removal as PC leader in January 2018, Ford entered the race brandishing his previous anti-establishment and brash Toronto City Council persona.

Flags will fly to welcome and acknowledge those who fought in the Great Crusade. Over the summer, hundreds of commemorations will take place to mark 80 days of battle. 
While not the only contribution by Canadian service men and women, D-Day takes a prominent place in Canada’s cultural memory of the Second World War. 
As a researcher of war heritage, I have observed and participated in commemorations in Normandy over the years. My focus has been on how the region, as a memorialized landscape of war, is managed and interpreted. I am also interested in the meaning people draw from the histories and stories told at these sites of memory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US has announced it will resume a limited military presence in Somalia. The former administration withdrew troops from the country in 2020. The mission of the American soldiers is still what it has been for the last 15 years: to advise and assist Somali forces. US troops will not be directly involved in conflict.

Putin has warned that if Kiev receives long-range missiles, Russia will move and strike sites that have been off-target so far. -/Kremlin/dpa
Supplying long-range missiles of Western manufacture to Ukraine will result in a strong response from Russian forces, President Vladimir Putin told state broadcaster Rossija 1.
“If they supply, then we will draw the corresponding conclusions from this and deploy our means of destruction, of which we have enough, to deliver blows to those objects that we are not yet attacking,” he said. The West’s aim in supplying arms to Ukraine was to draw out the conflict, Putin said.
The Russian leader appeared relaxed about the delivery of modern HIMARS multiple rocket launchers announced by the United States, saying it would not change the balance of forces fundamentally. “There’s nothing new here,” he said, noting that the Ukrainian army already had similar, Russian-made systems and that US deliveries would just replace systems that had been destroyed.
Precisely which missiles were deployed would be decisive, Putin said. According to his information, missiles with ranges of between 45 and 70 kilometres would be supplied, similar to Russia’s Uragan, Smerch and Grad systems. Ukraine had 515 such systems when the "operation" began and is still thought to have 360, he said.]]></summary>

The first time I moved to New York, I was a college student and tried to make Harlem my home.  I had a lot to learn.

"Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital," Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. "Services are already working on site."

The job cuts won’t apply to employees who build cars or batteries or install solar panels, and the number of hourly workers will increase, Musk said in the email, a copy of which was reviewed by the New York Times.  “Tesla will reduce the number of employees by 10% because we have become overstaffed in many areas,” he said.
Reuters reported the news earlier, citing another email Mr. Musk sent only to Tesla executives.  The automaker’s stock price closed about 9% lower on Friday after the article was published.

Although he often challenged the Victorian-era patriarchal view of female sexuality, she writes, “he reflected in his theories the belief that women were secondary and not the norm”.  As for her conclusion that “women always fall in love with their male therapists,” she said, he sanitized attachments such as transference.

She escalated her criticism in an interview for a Canadian TV movie, “Neighbours: Freud and Hitler in Vienna” (2003), saying, “In my eyes, Adolf Hitler and my grandfather were false prophets of the 20th century. ”  They shared, in his words, “an ambition to convince other men of the one and only truth upon which they had stumbled”.

Miriam Sophie Freud was born in Vienna on August 6, 1924. Her father, Jean Martin Freud (known as Martin), was the eldest son of Sigmund Freud and a lawyer who became the director of the psychoanalytic publishing house of the Dr Freud.  His mother, Ernestine (Drucker) Freud, was a speech therapist known as Esti.
Sophie tried to make the most of her childhood, despite her parents’ bickering and the animosity between her and her older brother, Walter.  It wasn’t until she was enrolled as a teenager in Vienna’s most progressive girls’ school, the Schwarzwaldschule, that she excelled as a student.

“I think that was pretty deliberate – that they didn’t want to be drawing attention away from anything,” Ms Nielsen said, 

“When speaking to people here – the diehard royal fans – a lot of them say that they are disappointed in how Harry and Meghan have conducted their step back from royal life, that they don’t agree with many of their criticisms of the Royal Family. 

“But they do say … he is the Queen’s grandson and so there should be respect for the monarch and in that instance it does mean her heirs as well.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — President Biden was briefly evacuated Saturday from his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after a small private plane accidentally flew into restricted airspace, according to White House and Secret Service officials.
Mr. Biden arrived in Rehoboth Beach on Thursday evening and is expected to return to the White House on Sunday.  Officials said the president was not in danger during the incident.
A White House official told reporters that Mr. Biden and the first lady were briefly evacuated and then returned to their residence.
“A small private plane entered restricted airspace, all indications are incorrect and precautionary measures have been taken,” the official said.  “There was no threat against the president or his family.”

        <updated>2022-06-04T22:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data from the app showed that in 2021, users hosted more than 3,600 bachelorette parties in Scottsdale, compared to about 13,000 in Nashville, said Mike Petrakis, 31, founder and chief executive of Bach.  This year, its data shows that more than 11,600 parties are planned in Scottsdale, compared to 30,000 in Nashville.  If that rate of growth continues in Scottsdale, Mr. Petrakis said, it has the potential to overtake Nashville in terms of bookings.  And on a recent weekend in May, more than one bachelor party attendee said Scottsdale was “the new Nashville.”
Robert Mayer, 35, owner of Arizona Party Bike, said his Scottsdale location began booking a record number of bachelorette parties in the summer of 2020. Brides were looking for a place to celebrate without restrictions pandemics, he added.  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, never enacted a statewide mask mandate and reopened restaurants for indoor dining in May 2020. In Maricopa County , which includes Scottsdale, about 1,200 new Covid cases are currently reported per day.
Mr. Mayer’s company, which features on Bach, runs tours of the Old Town on cart-sized cranksets, charging up to $499 (plus the cost of alcohol) for two-hour private tours for up to 15 people.  His clientele is currently 75% female, with a median age of 28, he said.  Local outfitters of hot air balloons and desert jeep tours are also teeming with groups of women in their twenties singing Katy Perry songs and only occasionally throwing up.
It is perhaps unsurprising that the influx has already caused unrest.  One Saturday in May at the Arizona Party Bike depot in Old Town, Lacy Gray, 27, a company guide, had to explain the rules of the road to a South Dakota bachelor party after her members, sporting candy-colored wigs, took their seats at a neon-pink pedal bar.
An instruction?  No playback requests “‘WAP’, specifically,” Ms. Gray said.  (The song was proactively banned, Mr. Mayer added, after attracting stares from “disgruntled” pedestrians.)

In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston Celtics reserve guard Payton Pritchard drove into the paint against Miami Heat’s Tyler Herro and take a little jump.  Pritchard then put a hand close to the ground, a common NBA taunt to signify that a defender is too small to guard the taunter.
Pritchard is just over six feet tall and is, in almost every situation in the NBA, the shortest player on the court.  Herro is four inches taller than him.
“The game is competitive, so, I mean there will always be a bit of bickering here and there.“, Pritchard remained impassive in a recent interview.
Usually Pritchard is the recipient of these jeers.
“If you give it, you also have to take it,” he said.

        <updated>2022-06-04T20:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[His post-play years were troubled.  In 2014, Barber was detained by police in Mansfield, Texas, also outside of Dallas, and hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.
And according to police reports, he was arrested in 2019 on two counts of criminal mischief for incidents the previous year in which, while jogging, Barber approached two cars different and hit and damaged them.  He pleaded no contest and his sentence included 12 months probation.
Last year, former Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant posted a video of Barber’s plays on Twitter and wrote that “he’s down…we’re just a stat and moments for Most people”.
On Monday, Bryant wrote on Twitter: “Too much to digest, so much to say… This is real life, it can be any one of us. We need each other, we need unity.
Marion Sylvester Barber III was born on June 10, 1983 in Plymouth, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis.  Like his father, Barber played at the University of Minnesota, where he was part of a powerful backfield with Laurence Maroney. Barber rushed for 1,196 yards and 1,269 yards in 2003 and 2004.
The Cowboys selected him in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft.
Football was a family affair for barbers.  In addition to his father, Barber’s brothers, Thomas and Dominique, also played for the University of Minnesota Gophers.  Dominique was a defensive back with the Houston Texans of the NFL.
In a statement Thursday, PJ Fleck, head coach of the Gophers, said, “Marion was one of the best to ever play in Minnesota, and he’s a big reason a lot of people are Gopher fans today.”

Swiatek, an avid reader and excellent student during her high school years, is a particularly thoughtful and committed young champion.  Gauff, the prodigy from Delray Beach, Florida, is a particularly thoughtful and committed finalist, ready to use her athletic success to speak out on social issues, like gun violence in the United States, which she did after her semi-final victory over Martina Trevisan on Thursday.
Just four years ago, they both competed in the French Open women’s tournament, with Gauff winning the title and Swiatek losing in the semi-finals.  But Swiatek, Gauff’s eldest by nearly three years, has since taken center stage on the women’s stage with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1980, Fred Wilpon would buy the team, adding another layer of connective tissue: Wilpon attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn with Dodgers Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax and was a rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fan.  It was under his leadership that Citi Field opened in 2009 with so many Dodgers-related touches — including the enormous Jackie Robinson Rotunda — that some Mets fans complained there were no more winks. in Brooklyn than at the Mets.
The connections would only continue, with Mike Piazza’s Hall of Fame career spanning the franchises and Justin Turner, a crucial member of the current Dodgers squad, having started his career in orange and blue.
Now Steven A. Cohen, who tried to buy the Dodgers in 2012, is calling the Mets shots.  In his first public remarks after buying the Mets, he cited the Dodgers as a model of what he hoped the Mets would become.  He backed that up by pushing the Mets payroll near the top of the sport.
“They’re going to separate themselves from the pack,” said Valentine, who, in keeping with the connective tissue theme, was once married to a daughter of Ralph Branca, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  “Kind of like the Dodgers tried to do when they left town, and the Yankees always have.”
Two of Hodges’ adult children — Gil Jr., 72, and Irene, 71 — plan to be at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, along with two of Irene’s granddaughters and a cousin.  And as the videos roll and the lights flash, the iron steel cable that spans decades and miles will remain as strong as ever.
“Without a doubt, the 1969 World Series was amazing,” says Irene Hodges of her favorite memory.  “Everyone was just thrilled.  All of Brooklyn was crazy.  It was a wonderful moment.  My dad, I think, was a little scared to manage in New York.  He knew how good the fans were here, how much they loved him, and he just wanted to do the right thing for them.  He wanted to have a successful team.  And he did.”

The The Metropolitan Police did not say what prompted the evacuation, but said in a tweet that officers were currently at the scene in the square, which is at the opposite end of the mall from Buckingham Palace, where a major concert is scheduled for Saturday night.
A few minutes later, the police tweeted that “the incident is now over” and that they would reopen the place “in due course”.  No further details on the nature of the incident were immediately available Saturday morning.

From a village to food cultivation and rainwater storage areas, the "Rooftop Days" association is showing how to unlock the unused space of Europe's biggest port.
"We want people to experience how great it is to be on a rooftop and what space we have there above the city," Rooftop Days director Leon van Geest told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An 83-year-old yachtsman arrived in Japan early Saturday morning after a solo, non-stop trip across the Pacific, becoming the oldest person ever to achieve the feat.
Famed ocean adventurer Kenichi Horie's arrival in the Kii Strait off western Japan capped a two-month trip that started from a yacht harbour in San Francisco in March.
It was only the latest seagoing achievement by the Japanese octogenarian, who in 1962 voyaged from Japan to San Francisco at age 23, becoming the first person in the world to sail alone across the Pacific.
The public relations team for his most recent voyage said Horie's Saturday return to Japan made him the world's oldest person to pull off a solo, non-stop crossing of the largest and deepest ocean on Earth.
"I'm about to cross the finish line," Horie wrote on his blog Friday after what he described as a three-day battle with the pushback from a current.
"I'm exhausted."
His 1962 Pacific crossing made headlines as he embarked on the trip without a passport, essentially smuggling his way into the United States.
Sixty years ago, "I was constantly anxious and stressed that I might get caught... My condition was the worst," he blogged in April.
"But this time it's different, I was sent off by many people and have their support through tracking systems and wireless radio. I couldn't be more grateful."
Aside from his 1962 Pacific crossing, Horie is known for sailing around the world solo in 1974 and his longitudinal voyage around the world between 1978 and 1982.
The latest expedition was the first he had undertaken since 2008, when he sailed from Honolulu to the Kii Strait on a wave-powered 31-foot boat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was heightened security around Beijing's Tiananmen Square Saturday, the anniversary of the bloody 1989 crackdown, while police in Hong Kong warned people not to gather as China strives to remove all reminders of the events of June 4.
Discussion of the crackdown is highly sensitive to China's communist leadership.
It has gone to exhaustive lengths to erase Tiananmen from collective memory, omitting it from history textbooks and censoring online discussion.
On June 4, 1989, the government sent troops and tanks to break up peaceful protests, crushing a weeks-long wave of demonstrations calling for political change and curbs on official corruption.
Hundreds, by some estimates more than 1,000, were killed in the crackdown.

What purpose does this international club of nations serve, and what may the future hold? 
With roots in the British empire, the Commonwealth in its modern-day form came about in 1949 with the London Declaration establishing a precedent of member states being “free and equal”. Membership was not contingent on recognizing the British monarch as the head of state. King George VI was the political association’s first head, and Elizabeth II took over in 1952 after her ascension to the throne.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States staged their first combined military exercises involving an American aircraft carrier in more than four years, Seoul's military said on Saturday, amid reports that North Korea was preparing for a nuclear test.
The three-day drills took place in international waters off the Japanese island of Okinawa until Saturday, including air defence, anti-ship, anti-submarine, and maritime interdiction operations, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
The exercises came amid signs that North Korea is gearing up to conduct a nuclear test for the first time since 2017. Seoul officials have said Pyongyang has conducted multiple experiments with a detonation device in preparation for its seventh underground explosion.

Above all, they supported it because deep down they know it will work.  They know, at least, that it might create the illusion of an alternate set of facts.  They also know that a lot of the heavy lifting will be done by prejudice, by those who would point out, arch, that this seems to happen a huge amount to Liverpool fans or England fans or just football fans as a whole.
They know that while social media has allowed all of these images, videos and first-hand accounts to surface and spread, citizen journalism is a far less powerful force online than deep-rooted partisanship.  They know that the latter will dominate the former at some point, at least enough to muddy the waters, to obscure not only that specific truth but also the idea of ​​truth, to ensure that some blame is distributed elsewhere.
Many, certainly, have taken the opportunity to assume that Liverpool fans, or English fans, or even a certain swath of football fans as a whole must be at fault.  Many decided that this must be the first time someone had tried to gain access to an event using a fake ticket, not considering whether perhaps some of these people were victims, rather than perpetrators, of a crime. , not wondering if maybe that’s the kind of thing the authorities should be prepared to deal with.
And yet, the temptation to side with the authorities, in the aftermath of an event like this, rather than with those who are different from you only in the team they support is dangerous.

Exactly.
News consumers have long complained that cable news outlets, especially CNN, are overusing the breaking news chart – for stories that simply aren’t breaking news – in a desperate attempt to maintain ratings.
Fortunately, CNN takes a personal view.
In A memo to staffers on Thursday, CNN’s new president Chris Licht said:

An advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has predicted that the war with Russia could last up to half a year longer.
"This could drag on for another two to six months," presidential advisor Mykhailo Podoliak said in an interview with the opposition Russian portal Medusa late on Friday, with the size of weapons stockpiles a key factor.
Another main factor was how the mood in Europe, Ukraine and Russia may change over time, he said.
There would only be peace negotiations, he added, if the situation on the ground changed and Russia no longer felt it could dictate the conditions.
He warned that territorial concessions to Russia would not end the war. Some cities, like Mariupol and now Severodonetsk where the fiercest fighting is taking place, effectively no longer existed, he said.
Podoliak estimated Russian losses at a total of 80,000 people so far. This included dead and wounded among the regular army, the separatists and the mercenary force Wagner.
He said that after a disastrous initial phase of the war for Moscow, with up to 1,000 war dead per day, the current losses of Russian and Ukrainian troops were "comparable."
Zelensky had recently put Ukrainian losses at up to 100 dead and 500 wounded per day.

She poked a finger through a hole in it.
“It looks like an entry,” said Dr. Fortun, who is one of only two medical examiners in the Philippines.  “So an apparent gunshot wound to the head for this one.”
Since July 2021, Dr. Fortun, 60, has been quietly examining these bones at the request of a Catholic priest, the Reverend Flaviano Villanueva, and the families of the victims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been ordered to appear in a Spanish court to testify about an alleged U.S. plot to kidnap Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, ABC Spain reports.
Last year, Yahoo! News reported that the CIA plotted to kidnap Assange as he was holed up in Ecuador’s embassy in London. 
"Some senior officials inside the CIA and the Trump administration even discussed killing Assange, going so far as to request 'sketches' or 'options' for how to assassinate him," Yahoo! News' report stated. 
"Discussions over kidnapping or killing Assange occurred 'at the highest levels' of the Trump administration, said a former senior counterintelligence official. 'There seemed to be no boundaries.'"
As The Daily Beast points out, Spain’s National Court has also been investigating a Spanish security firm that may have spied on Assange for the CIA while providing security for the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. "
National High Court Judge Santiago Pedraz agreed to summon Pompeo and former U.S. counterintelligence official William Evanina as witnesses to explain whether a plot was drawn up," the Beast reports. "They must appear in June and can testify via videoconference. Pompeo has not yet commented on the ruling."

(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a major rewrite of the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Early versions of the text, which is still being finalized, show how the administration’s priorities are shifting in response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and the burgeoning partnership between Beijing and Moscow. 
The document’s publication, originally slated for this past January, was delayed after US officials came to believe that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was likely. 
It is now being substantially rewritten to reflect the ways the world has changed since the war began, the people said. It’s not yet clear when it will be published, and one of the people emphasized it may still undergo changes.

WNU Editor: The world has certainly changed a lot in the past two years. So this rewrite of America's National Security Strategy should surprise no one. But my gut tells me that we are going to see even more change in the coming months that will make this rewrite obsolete. We are definitely living in interesting times.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After leaving high school at age 15, Gilberto took a job as a pharmacy clerk.  Very quickly manager, he opened his own store at the age of 25.  Along the way, he became involved in Cali’s underworld, joining a gang of kidnappers and getting into the drug trade.
In the 1970s, he and his brother helped organize a loose confederation of drug gangs into what became known as the Cali Cartel.  Less authoritarian than Mr. Escobar’s Medellín Cartel, the Cali Confederacy cooperated on processing, shipping and distribution but otherwise gave its member gangs significant autonomy.
Yet, as the most successful members, the Rodríguez brothers were first among equals.  Miguel acted as a sort of general manager for the cartel, overseeing day-to-day operations, while Gilberto was the strategic visionary.  They also set the tone for the organization: no flashy parties, no flamboyant displays of wealth, and above all no unnecessary violence.
Mr. Rodríguez was also responsible for managing the cartel’s legitimate business interests.  He owned a chain of 400 pharmacies, a pharmaceutical laboratory, ranches, a radio network and America, a football club in Cali;  Mr. Rodríguez has served on banking boards and mingled with Colombia’s financial elite.
At first, he and Mr. Escobar got along well;  Jorge Ochoa Vázquez, a chef from Medellín, accompanied Mr. Rodríguez on a trip to Europe in 1984, where they sought to open up new markets.  (They were arrested in Spain for trafficking and extradited to Colombia, but Mr. Rodríguez was found not guilty.)
Soon, however, the relationship between the two cartels soured.  Apart from rivalries in North American markets, they disagreed on how to fight back when, in the late 1980s, the Colombian government launched a campaign to stamp out drug trafficking.
Mr. Escobar preferred war and, over a period of five years, killed hundreds of police officers, politicians, lawyers and journalists.  Mr. Rodríguez hesitated, preferring to watch his two main threats tear apart from the sidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RENO, Nev. — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on several U.S. cities to have sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.
Mr. Zelensky, who addressed the gathering of mayors right after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago;  Jacksonville, Florida;  Portland, Oregon;  San Diego and San Jose, California for maintaining sister city ties in Russia.  He said those relationships should be severed.
“What do these links bring you?  Probably nothing,” Mr. Zelensky said.  “But they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.”
Chicago announced earlier this year that it was to suspendbut not ending permanently, its sister city relationship with Moscowwhich had been in place since 1997. Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister city relationship with Yekaterinburg, Russia.  Since Friday, the websites of the programs of the sister cities of Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.


Many U.S. municipalities have sister city relationships in multiple countries.  Although partnerships can include commercial and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local non-profit organizations.
But Mr Zelensky, who spoke to mayors 100 days after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia any extra credibility.
” Do not apologize ;  don’t have relations with Russia,” said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech was applauded by mayors and city workers who had gathered in Reno, Nevada.  “And please don’t let those who have become murderers call your cities their sister cities.  ”
Portland officials referenced a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners.  Officials from other U.S. cities named by Mr. Zelensky did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Los Angeles (AFP) - The Mexican head of a huge church admitted sexually abusing children in the United States on Friday, days before he was scheduled to stand trial.
Naason Joaquin Garcia, the leader of La Luz del Mundo (The Light of the World), which claims millions of members worldwide, pleaded guilty to the assaults on young church members around Los Angeles over a number of years.
"As the leader of La Luz del Mundo, Naason Joaquin Garcia used his power to take advantage of children," California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.
"He relied on those around him to groom congregants for the purposes of sexual assault."
Prosecutors say Garcia, 53, exploited his position of trust to force underage girls to commit sexual acts on him.
During the course of the investigation they alleged Garcia and his co-defendants had told victims that refusing to comply with his wishes would be acting against God.
Garcia had faced a raft of charges relating to alleged wrongdoing up to his arrest at Los Angeles International Airport in 2019.
The preacher, who was charged alongside two other church members, had been due to stand trial, starting on Monday.
But his guilty pleas to three counts mean he will now be sentenced next week, and is expected to face several years' jail.]]></summary>

We have three important pieces of news. First, the European Union is gradually moving towards the implementation of the sixth sanctions package. Frankly, achieving this is very difficult. Because this sanctions package is primarily about oil.
Finally, the world is giving up Russian oil.
...
The second piece of news is that the United States has confirmed at various levels that modern HIMARS are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land.

So it was with a picture of French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin sitting at opposite ends of a very long table after Macron declined to take a Russian PCR COVID-19 test. Many speculated that Macron refused due to security concerns that the Russians would take and use his DNA for nefarious purposes. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz similarly refused to take a Russian PCR COVID-19 test.

While these concerns may seem relatively new, pop star celebrity Madonna has been raising alarm bells about the potential for nonconsensual, surreptitious collection and testing of DNA for over a decade. She has hired cleaning crews to sterilize her dressing rooms after concert…]]></summary>

France 24: African Union head Sall 'reassured' after talks with Putin on food shortages  
African Union head Macky Sall said on Friday he was "reassured" after talks in Russia with President Vladimir Putin on food shortages caused by Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. 
Putin hosted the Senegalese president, who chairs the African Union, at his Black Sea residence in Sochi on the 100th day of Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. Global food shortages and grain supplies stuck in Ukrainian ports were high on the agenda.
"I found Vladimir Putin committed and aware that the crisis and sanctions create serious problems for weak economies, such as African economies," Sall told journalists, adding that he was leaving Russia "very reassured and very happy with our exchanges".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden confirmed Friday he was considering a trip to Saudi Arabia, which would be a stark reversal after he called for the kingdom to be made a pariah state.
The New York Times and other US media, quoting anonymous sources, have reported that Biden would go ahead with the long-rumored Saudi stop during an upcoming overseas tour.
The reported decision came shortly after Saudi Arabia addressed two of Biden's priorities by agreeing to a production hike in oil -- which could help tame rocketing US inflation -- and helping extend a truce in war-battered Yemen.
"I'm not sure when I'm going," Biden said when asked about reports of an imminent visit. "There is a possibility that I would be going to meet with both the Israelis and some Arab countries at the time."

Russia is making gains in the Donbas through a grinding and indiscriminate war. 
 One hundred days into the war in Ukraine, Russia has turned its siege tactics on Sievierodonetsk, the last major city in Luhansk still outside its control.
Ukraine is still gripping the city, as Russia seeks to take it by leveling it to nothing. Almost 90 percent of Sievierodonetsk’s buildings, and all of its critical infrastructure, have been destroyed, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A few th…]]></summary>

Oil rose higher on Friday, supported by expectations that OPEC’s decision to increase production targets by slightly more than planned won’t much affect tight global supply and by rising demand as China eases Covid restrictions. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on Thursday agreed to boost output by 648,000 barrels per day (bpd) a month in July and August rather than 432,000 bpd as previously agreed.  Brent crude rose $1.80, or 1.5%, to $119.41 a barrel. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude advanced $1.80, or 1.5%, to $118.67.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Emmanuel Macron on Friday bestowed France's highest order of merit on the pioneering US tennis great Billie Jean King, as she celebrates the 50th anniversary of her French Open victory.
"In 50 years you have revolutionized international sport, but also equality between women and men and the rights of minorities worldwide," Macron said at the Elysee Palace ceremony.
"Your history is an American dream, one of these destinies that are almost too good to be true," he said.
King, who is attending this year's French Open at Roland Garros, was also honored by the tournament organizers Thursday with a video of fellow legends saluting her title win at the 1972 tournament.
The following year she made history by dominating Bobby Riggs in the "Battle of the Sexes" exhibition match, a key moment as the push for women's rights gained ground.
King was also among the Original Nine female players who defied tennis authorities by creating their own women's circuit to denounce the huge discrepancy in prize money and competition opportunities compared to men.
That led the US open to start offering the same prize money to women as men in 1973, and paved the way for a wave of wealthy female superstars such as Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.
And in 1981, she withstood a fierce backlash after being outed as a lesbian and acknowledging her sexuality, a groundbreaking -- and risky -- stance for an international sports star.
"It was a very difficult moment, but I told the truth. And the next day I lost all my sponsors," she told French television this week.
"I want to thank you for everything you've done for women's tennis and for women," Martina Navratilova said in the French Open video.
"What a beautiful tribute. Thank you," King responded in a tweet.

Several carriages of the red-colored local train were lying on their sides on a grassy area next to a highway.

Rescuers stood on the top-facing side of the carriages, using ladders to climb into the wagons to reach trapped passengers.
"In the serious train accident, as of 3:32 pm (1532 GMT), four people were fatally injured," said police in a statement.
"Around 30 passengers were injured, 15 of them so seriously that they have had to be admitted to nearby hospitals," they said, adding that a huge rescue operation was underway.

Abraham Vazquez, 22, and Vivir Quintana, 32, are two of the new faces of the "corrido" genre that emerged during the Mexican revolution of 1910-1917 to tell an alternative story to the official narrative.
Vazquez, originally from the northern state of Chihuahua, boasts 1.1 million listeners monthly on Spotify.
His rap-infused "narcocorrido" -- a ballad about drug traffickers -- "El de las dos pistolas" (The one with the two guns) has been played 52.8 million times on the digital music platform.

As Russia's military operation in Ukraine is entering its 100-day anniversary, life in Moscow and St. Petersburg remains largely normal, even as many Western retailers have left Russia   
Daily Mail: Inside Russia's 'ghost town' shopping malls where Western brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Zara have shut in protest over war in Ukraine 
* Dozens of foreign and international companies have withdrawn from Russia since Putin invaded Ukraine 
* Popular brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Zara, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Starbucks sit empty on high streets 
* The changes have been prompted by Western sanctions and unprecedented pullout of Western businesses 
Western brands have pulled out of Russia leaving shopping malls in Moscow and St Petersburg to become 'ghost towns' with high street locations sitting empty. 
Brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Zara have shut in protest over war in Ukraine which began on February 24. 
The changes have been prompted by Western sanctions and a massive, unprecedented pullout of Western businesses that had become entrenched in the landscape of Russia's daily life over three decades.

CNN: The world may be careening toward a 1970s-style energy crisis -- or worse 
New York (CNN Business)The world is grappling with gravity-defying energy price spikes on everything from gasoline and natural gas to coal. Some fear this may just be the beginning.
Current and former energy officials tell CNN they worry that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the wake of years of underinvestment in the energy sector have sent the world careening into a crisis that will rival or even exceed the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s. 
Unlike those infamous episodes, this one is not contained to oil. 
"Now we have an oil crisis, a gas crisis and an electricity crisis at the same time," Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency watchdog group, told Der Spiegel in an interview published this week. "This energy crisis is much bigger than the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s. And it will probably last longer."

The displaced mayor of the captured Ukrainian city of Mariupol has accused Russia of holding the remaining citizens hostage.
Vadym Boichenko said there are still about 100,000 residents in the city who are unable to flee to safe Ukrainian territory. He believes Russia is keeping them there to make it more difficult for Ukraine to mount a counter-offensive.
"They are being held there by Russian troops and practically used as human shields," he said in Kiev.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kiev is waiting for further weapons to be delivered from the West before trying to liberate more territory.
Boichenko also said that more than 20,000 people had been killed in the fighting around the largely destroyed city of Mariupol.
"This is twice as many as in World War II under German occupation. It is the biggest bloodshed in the history of Mariupol," he said. The figures could not be independently verified. He added that the risk of infection from only partially buried corpses is high.
