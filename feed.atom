        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Dianne Feinstein, California’s longest-serving senator, dies at 90 
* Dianne Feinstein, the oldest member of the U.S. Senate and the longest-serving senator from California, has died at age 90. 
* Feinstein’s death leaves vacant her powerful Senate seat, requiring Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint a temporary successor.
* The Democratic senator’s decades-long career was studded with major legislative achievements on issues including gun control and the environment. 
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has died at age 90, her office confirmed Friday.

Feinstein, a Democrat, was the oldest member of the Senate, where she served since 1992. 
She held her seat in the chamber longer than any other woman, and any senator from California.

She passed away Thursday night at her home in Washington, D.C.

WNU Editor: Supporters of President Biden are putting the pressure on California Governor Newsom to quickly appoint a replacement .... Pressure is on Newsom to quickly appoint Feinstein’s temporary replacement (Politico). My gut tells me he is not going to rush into it. As a reader of this blog astutely told me this morning. This gives Newsom an opportunity to appoint Vice-President Harris to take the job, and remove her as an opponent to his own Presidential aspirations.

More than 10,000 of Kiev’s forces have reportedly laid down arms in recent weeks, using a special radio channel to contact the Russian military 
Large numbers of Ukrainian troops have surrendered to the Russian military in recent weeks, using a special radio frequency designed for fighters willing to lay down arms, TASS reported on Wednesday. 
The frequency, 149.200 call sign ‘Volga’, was set up by the Russian military during the summer. Thus far, it has been used by more than 10,000 Ukrainian servicemen who were subsequently taken into Russian custody, according to a source with knowledge of the situation cited by TASS. The person added that the radio frequency is active along the entire front line. 
Read more .... 
Update #1: Over 10,000 Ukrainian fighters surrender since summer using special radio frequency (TASS). 
Update #2: The source named the number of people who used the open frequency 149.200 “Volga” to surrender military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Top War) 
WNU Editor: Ukraine is also claiming the same thing. Aside from paying people to defect .... Ukraine pays USD 500,000 to Russian pilot who surrendered with Mi-8 helicopter (Euromaidan), Kyiv is also making the claim that Russian soldiers are surrendering .... Over 200 Russian soldiers surrender to Ukraine thanks to "I Want to Live" project (Ukrinform). 
I am always skeptical of these reports. But what I do find is disturbing is a large discrepancy in the number of POWs that both sides claim to have. On the Russian sides I understand there are thousands of POWs currently in detention. On the Ukraine side the number is only a few hundred.]]></summary>

Seattle Times/New York Times: Who’s gaining ground in Ukraine? This year, No one  
The front line in Ukraine changed little in the winter. Russia aimed to capture the entirety of the Donbas, but it only inched forward. 
Ukraine has made minimal gains in its counteroffensive. Dense Russian minefields and fortifications have made every attack extremely costly. 
Despite nine months of bloody fighting, less than 500 square miles of territory have changed hands since the start of the year. A prolonged stalemate could weaken Western support for Ukraine.

Slovakia is getting ready to elect its fifth prime minister in just four years, and with Kremlin sympathizer Robert Fico’s opposition party leading the polls, it is one being watched with alarm in the West. 
 Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Slovakia has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies. The two countries share a border, Slovakia was the first country to send air defenses to Ukraine and it welcomed tens of thousands of refugees. 
But all that could change if Fico comes to power. The former prime minister makes no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and has blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Russia’s President Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Putin has used to justify his invasion.

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year 
Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year, funneling massive resources into its Ukraine offensive to fight what it calls a "hybrid war" unleashed by the West. 
With Moscow's "special military operation" now dragging through its 20th month, both sides have been digging deep and procuring weapons from allies in preparation for a protracted conflict. 
The announcement came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the defense ministers of Britain and France visited Kyiv, where President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied for more air defense systems.

These Air Force leaders lead Air Education and Training Command and Air University, respectively, the latter of which is a major component of the former. As such, they work together all the time (and aren’t dueling, but fun title right?). In this episode, they speak to Ryan about what they and their teams are doing to ensure the U.S. Air Force is trained at the highest level possible in order to ensure readiness. Robinson was on the show last year about related topics.

I am not that optimistic. 
In the past few days I have been reflecting on the war, and I do not see this ending in the next year or two. I see the opposite. This Ukraine counteroffensive has burned its best troops and thousands of pieces of Western equipment, and in any other situation a government would sue for peace. But the West, specifically the U.S. government and some of its allies, are hell-bent on continuing this war. They are going to continue the flow of monies and war equipment to Kyiv, even if it will mean the death of hundreds of thousands of more Ukrainians. And if President Biden is re-elected in 2024, God only knows where this conflict is going to end.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Royalty graced the Asian Games on Tuesday with Thai Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana saddling up in the equestrian after being encouraged by the king to "go for it".
The 36-year-old, who competed at the 2006 Games in badminton, is part of Thailand's dressage contingent, riding in the team and individual competitions in Hangzhou.
"I will do my best for (the people of Thailand)," she said at the Tonglu Equestrian Centre.
"They're my cheerleaders, my power, my fuel. I play for the Thai people."
The princess, the only daughter of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his former wife Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, is at her third Asian Games.
As well as badminton in 2006, she also rode in the 2014 Games in South Korea.
"Luckily our father is supporting us. He has always said, 'Go for it! You want to do it? Do it,'" said the princess, who learned to ride aged nine and trained in France.
"He knows that what drives my heart is horses and badminton. Since my grandfather's time, the royal family has always competed in sports."
She is the latest in a line of royals to compete in top-level equestrianism -- Britain's Zara Phillips was a 2012 Olympics silver medallist.
Away from the sporting domain, Sirivannavari is a keen fashion designer and has had shows at Paris Fashion Week.
She cited her sister as inspiration for being in China.
"I do it for my sister. My sister is a horse-lover and a show-jumper and she wants to be on the national team, but she cannot make it," she said.
"So she gave everything to me: all the information, all of her strategy, all of the equipment."
Her elder sister, Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol, was hospitalised late last year for heart, lung and kidney issues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea staged its first military parade in a decade on Tuesday, showcasing its advanced arsenal in the face of plummeting ties with nuclear-armed North Korea.
Pyongyang regularly puts on huge military parades but such events in Seoul are traditionally arranged every five years to mark South Korea's Armed Forces Day.
The last parade was in 2013. Five years later, then-president Moon Jae-in chose to hold a celebratory ceremony instead of a military event, in line with his conciliatory approach to North Korea.
Around 4,000 troops marched through central Seoul on a rain-soaked afternoon, cheered by umbrella-bearing crowds who waved South Korean flags.
They were accompanied by 170 pieces of military equipment, including air and sea drones, tanks and missiles.

Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian reportedly sought to travel to visit Iran's consular interest section following the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
"They did make that request and it was denied by the State Department," spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
"We do have an obligation to allow Iranian officials and other officials of foreign governments to travel to New York for UN business. But we do not have an obligation to allow them to travel to Washington, DC," he said.
"Given Iran's wrongful detention of US citizens, given Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism, we did …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuba's embassy in Washington was attacked by a man using two Molotov cocktails on Sunday night, the country's foreign minister said, describing the incident as a "terrorist attack".
"The Cuban embassy in the US was the target of a terrorist attack by an individual who launched 2 Molotov cocktails. The staff suffered no harm," said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.
This was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. 
The Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.
In New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel's presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.
"The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about," said Rodriguez after Sunday's attack.
In April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d'affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his "energetic protest" over what he called a "terrorist aggression" against his embassy.
That shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. 
US authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.
Alazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including "violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon", according to the US Justice Department.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
