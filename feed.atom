“And it comes from a lack of self-esteem and also from perhaps a desire to manipulate.

“But the American people have seen this from him for 50 years.

“He’s not as smooth with it these days.”

Ms Bruce's comments come after the White House recently retracted a statement made by US President Joe Biden following a blunder during a speech in Massachusetts.]]></summary>

Mr Morrow said calls are growing in America that it is “time for Joe to go”.

“And what’s being said there? … well basically late-night tv is also saying it’s time for Joe to go,” Mr Morrow said.  

Mr Morrow said the "knives are well and truly out" in the "wake of the White House’s tepid action to fight for the only freedom the left cares about, no not freedom of speech or religion or self-defence – but to have an abortion".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Jakubonis attacked gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during his bail reform speech on Thursday. Jakuboniswas arrested and released hours later under the state's lenient bail laws 
  
Daily Mail: How can they let him out? Fury after military vet who tried to assassinate NY governor candidate Lee Zeldin with 'Made in USA' blade is still roaming free under state's lax bail laws as politician says he's ramped up security for remainder of campaign 
* Military veteran David Jakubonis, 43, was released without bail hours after he attacked Zeldin, who, fittingly, was giving a speech on bail reform 
* Jakubonis, 43, approached the candidate on Thursday and told him: 'Okay, you're done' 
* 'The suspect will likely be right back out on the street immediately,' Zeldin predicted after the attack 
* The suspect was quickly subdued by Marine Corps combat veteran Joe Chenelly 
* Photos from the scene show authorities recovered what appeared to be a set of brass knuckles with a sharp blade in the shape of a cat 
* New York's GOP chairman blamed Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul for the attack after her campaign posted details about Zeldin's event 
A man who attempted to stab US Rep. Lee Zeldin at a New York campaign rally on Thursday is still roaming free as the New York gubernatorial candidate said his ‘guard’ was completely down when he saw the attacker approach him wearing a veteran's hat. 
'The first thing I saw was that he was wearing a hat that says he was a veteran and the way that I'm wired when I see somebody wearing a hat that is a veteran - my guard couldn't possibly be more dropped,' Zeldin said at a Friday press conference.

In addition, gaps are growing between the promised and received aid

The poll showed 62 per cent of Tory members would vote for Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and 38 per cent would go for Mr Sunak.  

“The thing about me is what you see is what you get,” Ms Truss said. 

“I’ve always been honest with people about what I can deliver, I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I will completely level with the public about, first of all, how tough things are going to be. 

“But also, the hope that they can have about the future because I have a positive vision for Britain, and I will be helping families immediately with the cost of living.”]]></summary>

Reuters: Iran doesn't want a nuclear deal, British spy chief says 
ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) -Britain's spy chief said on Thursday he was skeptical that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei actually wants to revive a nuclear deal with world powers but said Tehran won't try to halt talks either. 
Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) known as MI6, said he still believed that reviving the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement was the best way to constrain Iran's nuclear program.  Under the deal, Iran had limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.

London (CNN)Boris Johnson will be succeeded as prime minister of the United Kingdom by either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss after the Conservative Party leadership race was on Wednesday narrowed down to the final two candidates. 
Johnson resigned as party leader earlier this month after a series of scandals led to dozens of ministerial resignations. Ten Conservatives stood in the contest to replace him, and over five rounds of voting, members of parliament whittled those down to two. 
Sunak won 137 votes and Truss got 113 votes in the final round, while Penny Mordaunt with 105 votes lost out. 
Both of the final two candidates took to Twitter to comment on the result.

   Daily Mail: Moment blade-wielding assailant tries to STAB NY gubernatorial hopeful Lee Zeldin at Rochester campaign rally before group of onlookers manage to subdue attacker: Unhurt candidate immediately retakes stage to finish speech 
* Republican gubernatorial candidate for New York Lee Zeldin was in the midst of a speech on bail reform at a VFW when he was attacked 
* A man went on stage from behind Zeldin and told the GOP hopeful: 'Okay, you're done' 
* The suspect was quickly subdued by Marine Corps combat veteran Joe Chenelly 
* Photos from the scene saw authorities recover a sharp pair of brass knuckles 
* New York's GOP chairman blamed Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul for the attack after her campaign posted details about Zeldin's event 
New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin was nearly stabbed at a campaign rally on Thursday in Perinton, New York, a small town just outside of Rochester. 
The Republican was in the midst of a speech at VFW location about bail reform as part of his 'United to Fire Hochul' campaign when he was confronted. 
Video from the scene shows the suspect enter the stage from slightly behind Zeldin, walk calmly up to him and eventually raise up his arm towards the candidate's upper body.

Sputnik: Scoop: NATO Doesn’t Trust Ukraine With HIMARS, Operating Advanced Artillery Themselves, Source Says 
The US has delivered 12 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine, and the Pentagon announced Wednesday that Washington would soon send at least four more in the near future. The Russian military and the Donbass People’s Militias have accused Kiev of using the installations to strike civilian areas. 
The HIMARS mobile artillery operating Ukraine are manned by outstaffed career NATO military personnel, and information regarding the advanced weapons systems’ operation is not being transferred to the Ukrainian side due to a lack of trust, a Russian security source has told Sputnik, citing intelligence received from sources inside the Ukrainian military.

WNU Editor: A lot of bombshells in the above report. 
NATO does not trust Ukraine to operate these weapons. Manned by "out-staffed career NATO military personnel?!?!?!? Guarded by private military contractors close to the Pentagon?!?!?! Targets are being selected by US intelligence and US military personnel. 
I do not know if this report is true, but Russian media and the Russian government do believe it is true. That NATO is now directly engaged on the ground against Russian forces in Ukraine.]]></summary>

RT: Russia warns it could stop oil exports 
Foreign crude sales could be suspended if US-driven scheme succeeds, top official says 
 Russia will stop global oil exports if the West’s proposed price cap makes it unprofitable to continue production, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday.

WNU Editor: Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak's background is in the energy industry. In Russia his word is gospel when it comes to energy issues.

Pelosi is now the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the war, with the surprise visit adding to the growing momentum behind the West’s support for the country's fight against Russia.

Politico: Pelosi to Blinken: Label Russia as terrorist state, or else Congress will  
Her comments highlight the chasm in the actions lawmakers want the administration to take and what the secretary is comfortable doing.  
Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a message for Secretary of State Antony Blinken: Designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism — otherwise, Congress will. 
The warning, made on a call between the two earlier this week, was described to POLITICO by two sources familiar with the conversation. Spokespersons for the State Department and Pelosi’s office declined to comment. 
Congress gave the power to label another country as a state sponsor of terrorism to the secretary of state. Some in Congress, though, say lawmakers could pass a law to make the designation without the State Department, thus pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin on their own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla said on Wednesday that second-quarter profits fell nearly a third from the first quarter as deliveries slowed due to shutdowns and shortages of raw materials at the automaker’s Shanghai plant.
Profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, Tesla said, up from $3.3 billion in the first quarter, which was a record.  Sales fell to $16.9 billion from $18.8 billion in the first quarter.
The automaker was also hit by a sharp drop in Bitcoin price.  Tesla said in early 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency.  The company said on Wednesday that it had sold around 75% of its Bitcoin by the end of June.


Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profit almost doubled.  And earnings for the quarter beat analysts’ estimates.  But because Tesla is a fast-growing company, its progress, o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wall Street’s most talked about recession indicator is sounding its loudest alarm in two decades, heightening investor concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.
This indicator is called the yield curve, and it is a way of showing how the interest rates of various US government bonds compare., including three-month treasury bills and two- and ten-year treasury bills.
Usually, bond investors expect to be paid more for tying up their money for a long time, so interest rates on short-term bonds are lower than those on longer-term bonds.  Plotted on a graph, the different bond yields create an upward sloping line – the curve. 


But from time to time, short-term rates exceed long-term rates.  This negative relationship distorts the curve into what is called an inversion and signals that the norm…]]></summary>

Rome, Italy (CNN)Italy's President Sergio Mattarella dissolved parliament on Thursday, triggering a snap election following the resignation of the country's Prime Minister Mario Draghi earlier in the day. 
Mattarella branded the move "inevitable" following the political upheaval faced by the European Union's third largest economy over the last 24 hours. 
Thanking Draghi and his ministers "for their efforts over the past 18 months," Mattarella said in a short address from his Quirinale Palace in Rome.

WNU editor: Former Italian Premier Mario Draghi looks happy and relieved that he is no longer running the government. It makes you wonder if the reason why he is happy to now be out of power is because he knows how difficult and rough the coming months are going to be for Italy, and for the EU has a whole. 
As to who is poised to take power after elections? If polls continue to hold, it looks like this group will take power, and if they do it will be a geo-political earthquake for Italy and in the EU as a whole .... Italy’s far right celebrate Draghi’s downfall and look poised to take power (The Guardian).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Are you sure you want to run again Joe? Biden's national approval rating nosedives to 31% and hits the lowest in Iowa of any President in history at 27%: More disastrous polls show more than 70% of Americans DON'T want him to run in 2024 
* Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove 
* A whopping 71 percent of Americans do not want to see Biden run again in 2024 - including a majority of Democrats, 54 percent 
* The findings contrast with support for Donald Trump on the Republican side - 69 percent of Republicans said they want to see him run again in 2024 
* Republicans in Congress scored even worse than Biden by the Quinnipiac poll, where 23 percent of respondents approved, 68 percent disapproved 
More Americans are unhappy with President Biden's job in office than at any point in his presidency, according to a dim new Quinnipiac poll. 
Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove. 
Among registered voters, 33 percent said they approved while 59 percent disapprove.   The low approval spelled bad news for Biden's 2024 prospects.

WNU Editor: The poll is here .... Biden Approval Hits New Low Amid Public Discontent With Both Parties, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Nearly Half Of Americans Worry About Being Mass Shooting Victim (Quinnipiac). 
What caught my eye in this poll is that Congressional Democrats ( a negative 30 - 63 percent job approval rating) are polling better than Congressional Republicans (a negative 23 - 68 percent job approval rating). Maybe the Democrats will keep control of Congress after this year's midterms?]]></summary>

CBS: CIA director William Burns says ties between Russia, Iran suffer from "limits," lack of trust 
CIA Director William Burns downplayed the utility of Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to Iran on Wednesday, saying an alliance between the two countries would be limited by their historic rivalry in energy exports and an overall lack of trust. 
"I think beneath the images that that we all saw, the reality is that Russians and Iranians need each other right now," Burns said.

ABC News Australia: CIA estimates about 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine war  
Around 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and a further 45,000 have been wounded in the war in Ukraine, the United States believes. 
CIA director William Burns said Russia's efforts to occupy about a fifth of Ukraine had come at a great cost for both countries. 
"The latest estimates from the US intelligence community would be something in the vicinity of 15,000 [Russian forces] killed, and maybe three times that wounded," he said.    
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The CIA Director gives out the Russian casualty number, but he admits in his interview that this is an estimate, and no one really knows what the real number. Translation. He does not know. 
The BBC did a thorough analysis on the number of Russian military casualties a few weeks ago, and their estimate is around 4,000 .... War in Ukraine: Can we say how many people have died? (BBC). This number does not included casualties among Chechen and separatist forces (who have been doing a great deal of the ground fighting since April). 
My sources in Russia tell me that the BBC number is about right, and if you include Chechen and separatist forces the number is around 10,000. 
Ukraine also does not report its casualties. But the numbers that I hear from my sources in Ukraine that I trust are shocking, and I am going to wait until there is an official statement before posting it here.

Vladimir Putin is “entirely too healthy,” CIA Director William Burns said Wednesday, throwing cold water on constant rumors that the Russian president is suffering from illness as he pursues his war on Ukraine. 
Burns, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, noted that his declaration was “not a formal intelligence judgment.” Still, given his position, Burns’ comment could help dampen hopes among Putin’s adversaries that the Russian’s demise is near.

However, the decision has not gone down well with protesters.

On the spot where presidents are normally sworn in, protest leaders demanded Mr Wickremesinghe’s removal.

* The plan asks the 27 EU nations to cut their gas consumption by 15% between 1 August 2022 and 31 March 2023. 
* The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant Gazprom claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc. 
European countries are being asked to curb their consumption of natural gas by at least 15% until next spring, as part of a wider plan to deal with reduced supplies from Russia. 
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, on Wednesday presented a strategy on how countries can prepare for the winter period, when their energy needs are much higher. 
The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant, Gazprom, claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc — a major headache for European nations given they have been so dependent on Russian energy before the invasion of Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The situation is becoming incredibly difficult in Europe. Implementing a 15% reduction in the consumption of natural gas will not only be difficult to maintain, but near impossible if Europe experiences a severe and cold winter.

— FT Europe (@ftbrussels) July 19, 2022
   Politico: European Commission sets out joint weapon-purchase plan 
Aim is to replenish stocks of arms after many EU countries supplied Ukraine 
The European Commission laid out plans Tuesday that will allow European Union nations to jointly purchase weapons, amid growing appeals from Ukraine for more military support in their pushback against Russian forces.

* Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin met face-to-face in Iran on Tuesday 
* It was the first meeting between the two leaders since war in Ukraine started 
* But Erdogan kept Putin waiting for 48 seconds in what appeared to be a snub 
* Putin was 'humiliated', Ukraine foreign ministry adviser said, while others said it showed how far his standing has fallen since the war 
Vladimir Putin was snubbed by Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who left him twiddling his thumbs in front of TV cameras during a summit in Iran yesterday. 
The Russian leader was holding face-to-face talks with his sometimes-ally in Tehran on Tuesday for the first time since ordering the invasion of Ukraine back in February. 
 But he was left waiting for a toe-curling 48 seconds in front of the world's press as Erdogan failed to arrive on time for a hand-shaking photo-op.

WNU Editor: Putin has a history of making leaders wait. But he has also waited for leaders. I recall a decade ago he was waiting 5 minutes for his friend and Italian leader Berlusconi.]]></summary>

 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said geopolitics today requires “Nixonian flexibility” to help defuse conflicts between the US and China as well as between Russia and the rest of Europe. 
While warning that China shouldn’t become a global hegemon, the man who helped reestablish US-China ties in the 1970s said that President Joe Biden should be wary of letting domestic politics interfere with “the importance of understanding the permanence of China.” 
“Biden and previous administrations have been too much influenced by the domestic aspects of the view of China,” Kissinger, 99, said in an interview Tuesday in New York with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “It is, of course, important to prevent Chinese or any other country’s hegemony.”

WNU Editor: The Biden administration is not listening to what Henry Kissinger is saying. But China is listening .... Kissinger warns Biden on China ties amid Washington's enhanced provocations against Beijing; consequences would be 'fatal, unbearable' for Biden (Global Times). 
As to what is may take. 
 Henry Kissinger should also issue the same warning to Beijing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Basque Country, the pandemic has reminded us how much food forms the fabric of local life.  Eating well is a priority throughout the autonomous community of northern Spain, and seems, for some local chefs, even more so now.
