        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Feb 23 (IPS)  - At <em>Statens Museum for Kunst</em> in Copenhagen there is a great painting made in 1797 by the <em>Danish Golden Age</em> painter Jens Juel. It depicts one of Denmark’s richest merchants at the time – Niels Ryberg, his newlywed son Johan Christian, and the son’s bride, Engelke. Johan Christian makes a gesture as though to show off the family estate. There is a strong feeling of harmony between the people and the countryside in which they are placed. The picture reflects the new interest in nature that emerged all over Europe towards the end of the 18th century. It also demonstrates how Denmark’s new, rich bourgeois wished to carry themselves in the style of the aristocracy, a social class which dominance they were infringing. Ryberg and his son appear just as distinguished as the aristocrats that used to be portrayed by Jens Juel.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2024/02/23/36072">Read the full story, “No God but Greed: Slavery and Indifference”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

"It’s becoming increasingly clear that the sham impeachment of President Joe Biden was a sham from beginning to ignominious end, as it appears much of the information upon which it was based originated from the Kremlin," Mary Trump writes in her most recent Substack issue titled "LAWYER: Comer & Jordan In Deep Trouble".
The Republican impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Comer and Jordan heavily relied on FBI informant Alexander Smirnov's testimony that Ukrainian energy company Burisma executives paid Hunter and Joe Biden $5 million apiece back in…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-02-22T00:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was criticized online Wednesday after social media users dragged up an old post in which she fully endorsed a now-arrested informant accused of lying about Joe and Hunter Biden of taking bribes from abroad.
Greene posted on the topic in July 2023, saying, "Joe Biden is a criminal and is compromised! And he is leading us into WW3 because Zelenskyy has proof of more Biden crimes."
"This is the FBI’s FD-1023 UNCLASSIFIED form from the FBI’s most trusted informant that reveals then VP Joe Biden took a $5 million dollar bribe from Zlochevsky to get Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired," Greene wrote at the time. "Joe delivered by withholding $1 billion in US aid until Shokin was fired."
Attached to that social media post were images purporting to show allegations made by the now-indicted claimant.
Unfortunately for Greene, the internet never forgets.

"This aged well...." said historian Heather Cox Richardson Wednesday.
Legal analyst Marcy Wheeler, of EmptyWheel, posted that it was, "Super interesting, actually, given that Smirnov was involved in talks to end the war."
National security attorney Bradley P. Moss also chimed in Wednesday.

"Hi Congresswoman," he wrote to Greene. "This person has been indicted for fabricating the whole thing, in reliance in no small part upon Russian disinformation efforts. Any comment?"
An elections podcast host, Miles W., said, "Aged like milk."
The issue of the arrest has been a thorn in the side of House Republicans, who sought to use the purported insider information in order to justify impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden. Jim Jordan has suggested that the arrest doesn't change the fundamental facts of the case against Biden, but experts have suggested the opposite is true.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An anti-fur protester crashed the Fendi runway show Wednesday during the first day of Milan Fashion Week of mostly womenswear previews for Fall-Winter 2024-25.

The PETA activist jumped into the models’ finale holding up a sign that read “Animals are not clothing,” before being whisked away by security. The animal rights group is pressuring Fendi to join other global fashion brands that have agreed to use synthetic alternatives to real fur.

Fendi was born nearly a century ago as a fur and leather shop in Rome, and fur remains a core part of the brand’s DNA, even if featured a bit less on their runway shows in recent years.

Some highlights from Wednesday’s shows:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday that "we should kill 'em all" after an activist pressed him to respond to atrocities that the U.S.-backed Israeli military is committing against Palestinians in Gaza, including children.
"I've seen the footage of shredded children's bodies," the activist told Ogles. "That's my taxpayer dollars that are going to bomb those kids."
"You know what? So, I think we should kill 'em all, if that makes you feel better," Ogles responded. "Hamas and the Palestinians have been attacking Israel for 20 years. It's time to pay the piper."

Washington indicted the WikiLeaks founder multiple times between 2018 and 2020 over its publication of hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files on the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The long-running legal saga in Britain's courts is now nearing a conclusion after Assange lost successive rulings in recent years. If he fails with this latest appeal bid, he could be extradited within weeks.
On the second of two days of evidence before two High Court judges, Clair Dobbin, a lawyer for the US government, summarised its various arguments for blocking another appeal.
She argued that Assange had "sol…]]></summary>

Andy Spalding, an academic and author who studies corruption in sporting "mega-events" such as the Olympics or the football World Cup, believes French authorities are showing they are serious about delivering a clean Games.
Three preliminary investigations are into possible favoritism in the awarding of around 20 contracts worth tens of millions of euros, while a fourth -- revealed on February 6 by AFP -- is scrutinizing the pay of chief organiser Tony Estanguet.

Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA), working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Europol and agencies from nine other countries in Operation Cronos, said it had infiltrated LockBit's network and taken control of its services.

Russian prosecutors have charged Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich with espionage -- the first time such a criminal accusation has been levelled against a Western reporter in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Gershkovich, his employers and the White House all reject the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.
"Gershkovich will remain in custody until March 30, 2024," the Moscow courts service said in a statement following a hearing at the Moscow City Court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump skewered Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Tuesday, saying at a Fox News town hall that he might cut ties with the minority leader upon regaining the White House. 
“He’ll probably end up endorsing me. I don’t know that I can work with him,” Trump said, as NBC News reports. “He gave away trillions of dollars that he didn’t have to, trillions of dollars. He made it very easy for the Democrats.”

The Republican bigs' bromance soured after McConnell drew a line after Jan. 6, 2021 when hordes of Trump sympathizers stormed the Capitol to thwart the certification of the presidential election to then President-Elect Joe Biden.  
McConnell likened Trump’s role in the fiasco as a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” when he, along with 42 other Republicans voted "not guilty" when he was charged of incitement of insurrection.

"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it," McConnell said at the time. "The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president."
The Republican senator added, "And having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth."
McConnell has yet to endorse Trump's third White House bid. 

It's unclear if McConnell will even seek another term in office, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-TX). 
“That’s a decision for Mitch to make," Cruz said. "Obviously, there’s a lot of bad blood between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. Mitch will have to make that decision. What I want to see is I want to see Republicans in the Senate stand and lead and fight."]]></summary>

"Russian state media first reported that Graham (R-SC), a long-time Russia hawk, had been added to the list, which is monitored by Rosfinmonitoring, the country’s state financial watchdog. That followed Graham blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for Navalny’s death in prison last week," reported Kelly Garrity. "The 47-year-old Navalny’s death spurred international shock and outrage, though the top Putin critic was repeatedly targeted in recent years and was previously subjected to imprisonment and poisoning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Mann covers the U-S opioid and fentanyl crisis for NPR. That means he talks to a lot of people struggling with addiction. Again and again, he's heard stories of people who have succumbed to their addiction — last year 112, 000 — more than ever in history.   
But when Mann traveled to Portugal to report on that country's model for dealing with the opioid crisis, he heard a very different story. Overdose deaths in Portugal are extremely rare.
The country has taken a radically different approach to drugs – decriminalizing small amounts and publicly funding addiction services – including sites where people can use drugs like crack and heroin. 
Portugal treats addiction as an illness rather than a crime. No one has to pay for addiction care, and no one scrambles to navigate a poorly regulated recovery system. Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH) surprised many people in Congress and in the White House last week when made a cryptic announcement about a new threat posed by Russia.
Politico reports that the threat in question was an experimental new anti-satellite weapon that Russia has been working on, and its sources claim that there was a good reason that the Biden administration didn't want it to be talked about publicly.
Essentially, the Biden administration and intelligence officials had been working with countries such as China and India to get Russia to back off testing its weapon, which is designed to use nuclear weapons in outer space to take down rival nations' satellites.
Officials were concerned that publicly spilling the beans about the weapon could compromise their source of information and also…]]></summary>

Kirby also pressed House Republicans to pass critical foreign aid legislation to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia. 
His reinforcement of the existing Level 4 "Do Not Travel" Advisory also comes after last Friday's revelation that Russia may be preparing nuclear weapons for space.

"At President Biden's direction, we will be announcing a major sanctions package on Friday of this week to hold Russia accountable for what happened to Mr Navalny," Kirby told reporters Tuesday. "Whatever story the Russian government decides to tell the world, it's cle…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-02-20T17:22:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chile will once again try to resolve the mystery of what really killed the Nobel laureate poet Pablo Neruda, who many believe was poisoned by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a court said Tuesday.
The appeals court ordered the reopening of the investigation into the death of Neruda, who was a prominent member of Chile's Communist Party when military dictator Augusto Pinochet took power in 1973.
In a statement, the court said that the "investigation has not been exhausted as there are precise procedures that can be carried out to clarify the facts."
Neruda had been preparing to flee into exile in Mexico to lead the resistance against the Pinochet regime when he died in hospital just 12 days after the coup.
The government claimed the 69-year-old had died of prostate cancer.
An investigation into the cause of Neruda's death began in 2011 when Manuel Araya -- his driver and personal assistant -- asserted that the poet was given a mysterious injection in his chest just before he died.
Araya died in June last year, aged 77.
In 2017, a group of Chilean and international experts concluded that Neruda did not die of cancer, but said they could not determine what did kill him.
And in 2023, a scientific panel investigating Neruda's death was also unable to determine whether he had been poisoned, even though they detected dangerous botulism-causing bacteria in his system.
Judge Paola Plaza ordered the probe to be closed in December 2023, but Neruda's family and the Communist Party appealed that decision soon after.
Neruda is remembered especially for sensual poems about love.
However, in recent years his romantic image has been tainted after his admission in his posthumous memoirs that he had raped a woman came to light after the emergence of the #MeToo movement.
Pinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years, oversaw a regime that killed some 3,200 leftist activists and other suspected opponents.
The dictator died in 2006 aged 91 without ever being convicted for crimes committed by his regime.

        <updated>2024-02-20T13:12:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter on Tuesday suspended the account of Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.
According to Sky News, it is not clear why Navalnaya's account was suspended, and her latest posts were demands to the Russian government to return her late husband's body.
The account was suspended for roughly an hour, though as of this writing, it appears to be back online.
Twitter CEO Elon Musk has a long history of attacking American foreign policy when it comes to aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia, although it's not known at this point if Musk had any role in the decision to suspend Navanaya's account.
The death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has further diminished a rapidly shrinking Russian opposition, which has seen its members assassinated, sentenced to lengthy prison terms or forced into exile as Russian President Vladimir Putin makes it clear he will not tolerate challenges to his regime.
It was widely feared that Alexei Navalny was risking his life by positioning himself as Putin’s most vocal critic in an increasingly repressive Russia, even challenging him for the presidency in 2018.
Navalny narrowly survived being poisoned with novichok – a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union – in 2020 and spent months recuperating in Germany. He earned admiration from Russia's disparate opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia the following year.
His death comes just a day before the official launch of campaigning ahead of a new round of presidential elections set for March 15-17.
Putin oversaw changes to the constitution in 2021 that will allow him to run for two more six-year terms, meaning he could stay in power until 2036. Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.
On December 8 Putin announced his candidature for re-election and is widely expected to win, given the lack of political alternatives and the Kremlin's iron grip on the state apparatus.

Gershkovich, his employers and the White House all reject the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's review of a U.S. request to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on espionage charges has been moved to June, with his lawyer telling court on Thursday the whistleblower is in poor health.
The United States has slapped 18 charges against the 47-year-old Australian, who had been hiding in London's Ecuadorian embassy for seven years until his arrest on April 12.
Sweden has since reopened a 2010 rape investigation against Assange and could file its own extradition request.
The Westminster Magistrates Court in London held a brief hearing on Thursday at which it moved the US case to June 12.
Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot referred to Assange as "not very well", with the next hearing possibly taking place at the Belmarsh prison where he is serving a separate 50-week sentence for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez was extradited to the United States Thursday to stand trial for allegedly aiding the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine to America and receiving millions of dollars in bribes.
The 53-year-old, whose 2014 to 2022 stint as president was plagued by allegations of corruption, risks spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
AFP witnessed Hernandez’s departure from an air force base in Tegucigalpa on a Drug Enforcement Administration plane destined for the United States. He is due to appear in a New York court on Friday.
Hernandez is accused of having facilitated the smuggling of some 500 tons of cocaine – mainly from Colombia and Venezuela – to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before his presidency.

Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias, who made "Pepe", one of the buzziest titles at this week's Berlinale festival, said filming the animals on location in Namibia and Colombia had been dicey for his crew.
"One time we didn't know there were hippos there and then they almost took the boat that we were in and so we almost lost the camera," the Dominican filmmaker told AFP.
"Another time a mother -- they are the most aggressive ones -- started running and the sound guy almost lost his equipment."
De los Santos Arias noted the animals can run "up to 35 kilometres (22 miles) per hour, these five tonnes of fat".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia's FSB security services said on Tuesday it had arrested a US-Russian woman suspected of treason for raising funds for the Ukrainian army.
The FSB in the central Urals city of Yekaterinburg said it had "suppressed the illegal activities" of a 33-year-old woman, a resident of Los Angeles with dual citizenship, and taken her into custody.
It said the unnamed woman had been "proactively collecting funds... which were subsequently used to purchase tactical medical items, equipment, means of destruction and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces".
Russian state news agency RIA Novosti posted a video from the FSB showing hooded officers handcuffing and escorting a woman in a white coat with a white hat pulled down over her eyes.
The FSB said she had been acting "against the security of our country" and had been supporting the Ukrainian army while in the United States.
Treason is punishable by up to life in prison under legislation toughened since the start of the military offensive.
Several US nationals are currently imprisoned in Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
He was arrested last year on espionage charges that he, his employer and the US government have rejected.
Another joint US-Russian citizen, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, is also being held in pre-trial detention.
He faces charges of failing to register as a "foreign agent" and contravening Russia's strict military censorship laws.
Former US marine Paul Whelan has been in prison in Russia since 2018, serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to negotiate a prisoner exchange to swap Russians imprisoned abroad for US citizens detained in Russia.

According to the 122-page document from Judge Walther Wesser Voltaire, made public by AyiboPost, the president's widow Martine Moise conspired with former Prime Minister Claude Joseph to kill the president in order to replace him herself.
Moise was shot dead when armed men broke into his Port-au-Prince bedroom on the night of July 7, 2021, a raid that left the former first lady injured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jon Stewart decided to take some much needed reporting lessons Monday night from the "journalist" he respects the least: Tucker Carlson.


	With joy in his eyes, Stewart took out pen and paper then asked Carlson to explain how best to do his job.  Stewart then minced clips of the conservative pundit during his controversial reporting trip to Russia — which included an interview with President Vladimir Putin — with journalistic tips he gleaned.


Lie about what your job is 
Lie about what your duty is
Disguise your deception and capitulation to power as moral and noble and based in freedom.

	Stewart described Carlson's demeanor while interviewing Putin as a mixture of "shame, arousal and irregularity." He then showed a clip of Carlson responding "of course" to Putin's description of how World War II was instigated.


	Stewart asked Carlson if great journalism could include field trips. Yes, it could.


	A clip of Carlson sneering at homeless people and taking a deep inhale of bread, of course, spurred some scorn from Stewart.


	Ultimately, Stewart slammed Carlson for failing to provide important context about economic hardship and political oppression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A legal analyst is concerned that the damages Donald Trump was hit with in the fraud trial only compounds his financial problems — and presents a major security threat.
On Monday, Allison Gill of "Mueller, She Wrote" joined with co-host Dana Goldberg on "The Daily Beans" and called the fraud trial fine of $355 million a "doozy." 
Goldberg explained that Trump is going to work on getting the amount down in an appeal, but for now "it's pretty beautiful."
"Plus interest!" Gill chimed in. "So if you take the $355 [million] that Trump owes ... plus 5 percent interest, plus what he owes E. Jean [Carroll], plus 9 percent interest, also in New York, you're looking at $550 million. So, it's going to be pretty difficult."
"All I can think though, is that there's classified documents missing," Gill cautioned. 
"Humm, I know. Highest bidder," agreed Goldberg. 
"How is he going to get this money?" asked Gill. "I mean NRC [National Republican Committee] is broke, NRA [National Rifle Association] is broke, Trump's Save America PAC is bleeding cash from legal representation not just for him but his adult children, and Jared and Ivanka. So, I mean, I guess he can borrow it from Jared?" 
Last month, Trump was hit with $83.3 million in damages after being found liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. He also faces millions in legal fees associated with his four ongoing criminal trials.

On Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron slapped the $355 million demand on him after finding that he and his company inflated the value of Trump Organization properties to secure favorable loans and interest. He has also been barred from conducting business in New York for three years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even the David gets dusty.
Every two months, Michelangelo's masterpiece completed in 1504 undergoes a careful cleaning at its home in Florence's Accademia Gallery, where it has resided for over 150 years.
Considered by many awestruck viewers to represent the perfect man, the 17-foot-high (5.1 metre) sculpture carved from a single block of marble stands alone under the skylight of the domed gallery on Mondays, when the museum is closed.
His personal restorer, Eleonora Pucci, climbs on a scaffolding for an up-close view -- part of a monitoring and cleaning ritual necessary for the preservation of the Renaissance icon visited by over two million visitors last year.
Despite David's good looks and Biblical heritage, the slayer of Goliath needs upkeep.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
