The Big Apple's expenditure on asylum seekers is already bigger than the entire budget of the city of Boston.

WNU Editor: It looks like CNN wants President Biden gone.
Update: This is why Democrats are worried.(see tweet below). The Reuters poll is here .... Biden weighed by economic concerns, age in potential 2024 rematch with Trump -Reuters/Ipsos poll (Reuters).

Here's the map with the Reuters poll numbers today

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NBC News: Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges

 
The president's son was indicted after a plea agreement on tax and gun charges fell apart in July and as House Republicans investigate his finances.  
Federal prosecutors have indicted Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, on gun charges, court documents show. 
Biden was indicted Thursday in federal court in Delaware on three counts tied to possession of a gun while using narcotics. 
Two counts accuse Biden of having completed a form indicating he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018. The third count alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic. The indictment says Biden certified on a federally mandated form "that he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.”

WNU Editor: I for one would not be surprised if these charges are dismissed before trial. Robert Barnes legal and political analysis is probably correct (see tweet below).

Goal here is to tie up Hunter such that he can't be subpoenaed to testify in any impeachment effort, and can claim the 5th. It's not a real effort to punish. https://t.co/wranfhrVkz

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One year ago this Saturday, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being arrested by Iran’s morality police for wearing her hijab "improperly". Her death led to massive anti-regime protests, known by their now-iconic slogan: “Woman, Life, Freedom”. The Observers team has been in regular contact with dozens of women across Iran over the past 12 months. Many of them have told us that it has become the “new normal” for millions of women in Iran to go out in public with their hair uncovered.

Bloomberg: Kim Jong Un Tours Russia Jet Plant as Kremlin Denies Arms Deals 
North Korean leader toured a Russian factory that makes fighter jets, as the US warned he is on a visit that could support the Kremlin’s assault on Ukraine. 
Kim arrived in the eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur on Friday to see a facility that makes high-tech fighter jets and other aircraft. 
He was shown planes including the Su-35 as well as the Su-57 stealth combat fighter, according to a Russian government Telegram channel. 
Kim’s limousine was later shown on social media being loaded onto the personal armored train that took him to Russia.

CNBC: Air Force chief sounds off on Musk’s Ukraine decision, tensions with China and the future of war 
* Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said that last year Elon Musk’s SpaceX was making “unilateral decisions” about its Starlink service in Ukraine. 
* The Air Force chief said the growing importance of space has increased collaboration between the military and the private sector. 
* He said the Air Force, like many parts of the government and private sector, is looking for ways to use AI. 
U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall does not shy away from commenting on controversy — even as it relates to the world’s richest person and a key Department of Defense contractor. 
Kendall weighed in Tuesday after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk acknowledged withholding Starlink satellite service to Ukraine as it planned a surprise attack on Russian forces last year. 
The disclosure sparked criticism of Musk, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for a probe into SpaceX.
The Air Force works with the company on a variety of missions, such as national security launches, but did not play a role in the use of Starlink in Ukraine when Musk made the decision last September.

* Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday praised Elon Musk, calling the Tesla and SpaceX founder a “talented businessman.” 
* Putin was discussing Russia’s space program after a failed moon landing last month. 
* His comments come after Musk said last week that he refused an emergency request by the Ukrainian government to extend coverage of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites to Sevastopol in Crimea. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday praised Elon Musk, calling the Tesla and SpaceX founder a “talented businessman.” 
Putin made the comments at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, as he spoke about Russia’s space program. 
“Elon Musk ... is undoubtedly an outstanding person. It must be admitted. I think the whole world admits it. He is an active, talented businessman,” Putin said, according to a Reuters translation. 
Putin said Musk does business with the support of the U.S. state.

The Senate Armed Services Committee is looking into national security issues raised by ’s decision not to extend the private Starlink satellite network to aid a Ukrainian attack on Russian warships near the Crimean coast. 
Chairman Jack Reed said in a statement that the reports on the use of Starlink exposed “serious national-security liability issues and the committee is engaged on this issue.”

“The committee is aggressively probing this issue from every angle,” he said Thursday. 
Musk’s SpaceX also has become a major US contractor, launching spy satellites for the Defense Department and operating the Starlink network. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

WNU Editor: This is the background on why the US Senate wants to probe Elon Musk's decision not to extend the private Starlink satellite network to aid a Ukrainian attack on Russian warships near the Crimean coast .... Elon Musk says he denied Ukraine satellite request to avoid complicity in "major act of war" vs. Russia (AFP). 
Elon Musk responds (see tweet below).

Much appreciated, Walter.
The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine. 
At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea.
Moreover, our terms of service clearly… https://t.co/jmNtScM5LY

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images taken by satellite show the physical devastation from a flood that killed at least 11,300 people in the eastern Libyan city of Derna.

        <updated>2023-09-14T20:00:00.016Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: Favorite Biden columnist: He "should not run again in 2024" 
President Biden, befitting his generation, loves newspapers and the classic columnists. David Ignatius, Tom Friedman and David Brooks top his list.

 
Driving the news: Ignatius, 73, a well-wired Washington Post foreign-affairs columnist who writes spy novels on the side, is out with a column (page A23 Wednesday) with the blunt headline: "President Biden should not run again in 2024."

 
Why it matters: Biden, 80, still sees himself as a young go-getter. Here's a respected voice he has known for 40+ years telling him that by plunging ahead, he "risks undoing his greatest achievement — which was stopping Trump."

Update #1: WaPo columnist argues Biden 'too old' to run again, should have stopped Hunter's 'attempts to impress clients' (FOX News)
 
Update #2: More Voices Call On Biden To Withdraw From The 2024 Race (Moon of Alabama)

 
WNU Editor: When you are a Democrat President and you lose David Ignatius. Yup .... you are in trouble.
Update #3: The poll numbers are certainly troubling (see below).

Just 28% of Americans think Biden inspires confidence, down 24% from two years ago or 7% from five months ago.
According to a CNN poll, only 26% believe "he has the stamina and determination to serve" as president pic.twitter.com/4lboXi09UK

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London-based sex worker Marin Scarlett and right-wing populist Nigel Farage might initially appear unlikely campaigning allies, but when it comes to the pitfalls of banking in Britain they share a common cause.
"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second-ranking US diplomat met Niger's military leaders on Monday to press to reverse a coup but reported no headway a day after an ultimatum from the West African bloc ECOWAS was ignored.
Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.
A source close to ECOWAS said an immediate military intervention to restore Bazoum was n…]]></summary>

The musician's funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

The US sailors and Marines entered the Red Sea on Sunday after transiting through the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the US Navy's Fifth Fleet said in a statement.
They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing "greater flexibility and maritime capability" to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.
The US military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>
