        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled sanctions against a network of companies and individuals Friday for facilitating illegal technology transfers from dozens of US firms to Iranian entities, including the country's central bank.
The sanctions relate to Informatics Services Corporation (ISC), the technology arm of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), the Treasury Department said in a statement.
It also sanctioned a number of alleged ISC subsidiaries and front companies based in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, and three individuals allegedly linked to them including Pouria Mirdamadi, a French-Iranian dual national.
Brian Nelson, the US Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the CBI "has played a critical role" in providing financial support to Lebanon's Hezbollah and the foreign arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, known as the Quds Force.
"The United States will continue to use all available means to disrupt the Iranian regime's illicit attempts to procure sensitive US technology and critical inputs," he said in a statement.
The Treasury's move freezes any US assets associated with the sanctioned individuals and entities, and generally prohibits Americans from doing business with them.]]></summary>

Fuelled by increased public spending – particularly military spending – other industrial sectors also benefited from the war in Ukraine, with the country's economic resurgence aided by continued revenue from oil and gas exports.
It's an electoral race without much suspense for the master of the Kremlin. Russia is holding a first round of presidential elections from March 15-17 that is widely expected to confirm a fifth-term victory for Vladimir Putin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In one of Mexico City's busiest neighborhoods on Friday, about 200 people took a collective nap in the middle of the street to celebrate World Sleep Day.
Lying in the heat on synthetic mats, their necks resting on pillows and their eyes covered by masks, participants tuned out the chaos of Mexico's capital as part of what organizers described as "a peaceful demonstration for the right to sleep."
"The idea is that sleeping well, or having this event attract attention, can help launch new public policies" to promote rest, said Guadalupe Teran, a doctor with the Center for Sleep and Neuroscience, which organized the event with the Mexican government.
"We have long working days, but there are no spaces at workplaces to guarantee the time for a siesta," she said.
Thanks to a guided meditation session, some nap participants sank into a deep sleep while others at least managed to relax for a moment.
"Sleeping and resting well is very good for mindfulness. I need to do it more, but I think this dynamic is very cool, it encourages rest," said Alexia Gonzalez, a 24-year-old psychotherapist from the central state of Morelos, who was visiting the capital.
Another napper, retiree Victor Sanchez from southern Mexico City, said he was interested in professional advice on how to get a good night's sleep.
"It's a bit far, but I had to come because it's important to me," the 64-year-old said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden was dealt a serious blow last month when FBI informant Alexander Smirnov was arrested and charged with lying to federal investigators about the president and his son.
However, a new report from CBS News claims that there was good reason for Republicans to have been skeptical of Smirnov's claims even before his arrest.
According to CBS News, "Federal prosecutors were put on notice as far back as 2016" that Smirnov was what one source described as a "liar and a fraudster" who had already been accused of fabricating evidence in an entirely separate court case.

Joseph Benincasa, a defense lawyer in the 2016 case that featured Smirnov as a witness, told CBS News that he struggled to understand why Smirnov remained in apparently good standing with the FBI afterward.
"Having seen how much he lies, it's kind of surprising that he has been able to do it for as long as he has without anyone in the government stopping him," he said. "They never should have used him again... it's shocking." 
ALSO READ: How come everything the GOP stands for involves other people dying?
Former Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Bromwich told CBS News that revelations about Smirnov could trigger massive headaches for the DOJ in terms of past cases that hinged on his credibility as a witness.
"I think a review has to be done, either internally by the FBI or, more advisedly, by the department to find out not only what happened here, but whether there is a systemic problem in the... supervision of informants," he said.
Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) last month also called for the DOJ to review its history of working with Smirnov, and he suggested that investigators had left themselves vulnerable for falling for foreign intelligence operations as "part of a deliberate attempt to launder foreign disinformation through the Department of Justice."]]></summary>

The first polls in Russia’s March 15-17 presidential election opened in the country’s easternmost Kamchatka Peninsula region at 8am local time Friday, with the vast voting exercise spanning 11 time zones set to finish in the westernmost Kaliningrad enclave at 8pm on Sunday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. ambassador to China said Friday that Beijing's position on a potential TikTok ban in the United States was "supremely ironic" given the ruling Communist Party's censorship of online platforms within its borders.
The US House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill on Wednesday that would force the wildly popular short-video app to break with its Chinese parent company or face a nationwide ban.
China has sharply criticized the approval, slamming what it called Washington's "bandit" mentality and accusing lawmakers of "unjustly suppressing foreign companies".
US ambassador Nicholas Burns offered a rebuke on Friday, saying Beijing's stance was unjustified given it blocks many Western web platforms from operating in the country.
"I find it supremely ironic that government officials here in China... have been criticizing the United States for the debate we're currently having on TikTok," Burns said during an online seminar held by the East-West Center, a US-based research organisation.
"They won't even let TikTok be available to 1.4 billion Chinese," he said in response to a question about the avenues for American public diplomacy in China.
China's government tightly controls the spread of information online and scrubs out social media content it deems politically sensitive.
Many Western platforms, including Google, Facebook and Instagram, are blocked from operating in the country.
TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance also runs a separate version of the app inside China called Douyin.
Some Western governments have voiced concern about TikTok's soaring popularity, alleging that the app's ownership makes it subservient to Beijing -- a claim TikTok denies.
The bill, which has also been criticized by TikTok creators and users, is expected to face a tougher challenge in the US Senate.
The White House has indicated that President Joe Biden would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea's "Squid Game" actor O Yeong-su has been found guilty of sexual misconduct, a local court said Friday, after he was charged with assaulting a woman in 2017.
The 79-year-old in 2022 became the first South Korean to win a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor in a series for his performance as a seemingly vulnerable old man in the mega-hit Netflix dystopian thriller.
The actor was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, the Seongnam Branch of the Suwon District Court told AFP.
He has been also ordered to complete 40 hours of classes on sexual violence, the court added.
The victim's own records of the assault and her claims are "consistent ... and appear to be statements that cannot be made without actually experiencing them," judge Jeong Yeon-ju said, according to the court.
O was indicted in 2022 without detention on charges of sexually assaulting a woman, who has not been identified, on two occasions.
The incidents took place when O was staying in a rural area for a theatre performance in 2017, on a walking path and in front of the victim's residence, respectively, according to the Suwon District Court.
"Squid Game," a series that depicts a dark world where marginalized individuals are forced to compete in deadly versions of traditional children's games, quickly gained immense popularity on Netflix.
Within less than four weeks of its release in 2021, it attracted a staggering 111 million viewers.
The show's success has amplified South Korea's increasingly outsized influence on global popular culture, following global fame won by the likes of K-pop band BTS and the Oscar-winning film "Parasite".
Multiple figures in South Korea's film industry -- including late filmmaker Kim Ki-duk and actor Cho Jae-hyun -- have faced sexual assault allegations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things got heated between Fox News host Brian Kilmeade and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) during a segment on Fox & Friends this Thursday as the two discussed the potential ban of the social media platform TikTok in the United States and whether or not the app is controlled by the Chinese government. 
According to Kilmeade, the app's alleged link to China is “national security issue" since its algorithm is controlled by the Chinese. But Paul countered that the app's alleged ties to China are not as straightforward as lawmakers and some in the media are suggesting. The conversation then turned tense as the two argued who the actual owners of TikTok are. 
“Who owns that company? ByteDance. ByteDance is owned by China,” Kilmeade said.
“No. It’s not. See, that’s a lie,” Paul replied, accusing Kilmeade of defaming the company and its owners.

“Who controls the algorithm? It’s not nonprofits. Who owns the algorithm!?” Kilmeade asked.
“TikTok owns the own algorithm and it’s not in China,” Paul replied, adding, “You just told a lie. You can’t say something on TV something that’s a lie by a company. That is an out and out lie and it is provably false." 
“What is a lie?” Kilmeade responded.
“They are not owned by the Chinese government! TikTok is owned privately,” Paul countered.
“ByteDance controls the algorithm. That’s all that matters!” Kilmeade said.
Kilmeade went on to accuse Paul of being “comfortable with TikTok influencing America." 
“I’m comfortable with the Constitution. You cannot take people’s property without due process,” Paul said. “If you believe there’s a national exemption to the Constitution then you believe that Fox News could be shut down, that Twitter could be shut down. That’s a terrible thing to believe.”

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
