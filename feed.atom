CNN: Navy proposes stringent blood testing for elite SEALs training program to address drug use  
Washington CNN  — Senior Navy officials are concerned about the use of performance enhancing drugs by Navy SEAL trainees and have asked the Pentagon to approve blood testing to detect potentially illegal or banned substances used by the elite forces. 
The request for more stringent blood testing comes after performance enhancing drug (PED) paraphernalia were found in the car of a SEAL trainee who died hours after completing the infamous “Hell Week” training program in February. 
In an interview with CNN, Regina Mullen, the mother of the dead trainee said that according to a toxicology report her son, 24-year-old Seaman Kyle Mullen, did not have PEDs in his system, but that he had told her that other trainees were using them. 
“There was more doing it than not let’s just say,” Regina Mullen told CNN.

North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile towards the Sea of Japan just days before US military drills and a visit by Vice President Kamala Harris to the region amid regional tensions, South Korea and Japan's leadership have said. 
South Korea's military have claimed North Korea fired a single, short-range ballistic missile fired from near the Taechon area of North Pyongyan Province just before 7am. 
Since the beginning of 2022, North Korea has dialed up its testing activities to a record pace - testing more than 30 ballistic weapons, including its first intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017 - as it continues to expand its military capabilities amid a prolonged stalemate in nuclear diplomacy.

Taiwan is located just 100 miles from China’s eastern coast, and it produces the vast majority of the advanced chips used in today’s electronics. The island is a democracy with its own government, and is home to more than 20 million people. Official…]]></summary>

The embassy warned that Russian-U.S. dual nationals could be conscripted by the Kremlin for military service. 
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow is urging American citizens residing in Russia to leave immediately amid Vladimir Putin’s escalation of the war in Ukraine. 
“U.S. citizens should not travel to Russia and those residing or traveling in Russia should depart Russia immediately while limited commercial travel options remain,” the embassy said in a security alert issued Tuesday. 
The alert comes just a week after Putin announced an escalation of Russia’s war in Ukraine on Sept. 21, when he partially mobilized the country’s reservists and hinted at resorting to nuclear warfare. 
Thousands of Russians have fled the country in recent days following Putin’s announcement.

But Washington worries that the first signs of a possible attack may come too late. 
U.S. and allied intelligence agencies are stepping up efforts to detect any Russian military moves or communications that might signal that Vladimir Putin has ordered the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, according to five current and former U.S. officials. 
But any indications that the erratic Russian leader has decided to unleash the unthinkable — in a desperate attempt to re-seize the initiative or bully the international community to meet his demands — could come too late, they warned.

WNU Editor: I do not know what they exactly mean by stepping up efforts. The U.S. is currently in an undeclared war against Russia via through Ukraine, and I am sure that the bulk (if not all) of US intelligence is now dedicated to trying to figure out what Russia is doing, and what Russia will be doing next.]]></summary>

Warzone/The Drive: Flying Saucer Appears On U.S. Aviation Intelligence Office Logo (Updated)  
An official flying saucer-adorned aviation intelligence unit logo has appeared drawing significant interest and speculation online.  
A new official logo for a U.S. Intelligence Community office focused on aerial threats and related security issues, particularly in the skies over the United States, is turning heads for its inclusion of a depiction of a flying saucer. This comes at a time of reinvigorated interest within the U.S. government, as well as the public at large, in unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, which are currently now referred to officially as unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP. Over the past year or so, the U.S. military, in particular, has been increasingly sparring with members of Congress about how best to respond to the potentially very real threats that UAP present.

CNBC: The U.S. and Europe are running out of weapons to send to Ukraine 
* NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg held a special meeting of the alliance’s arms directors to discuss ways to refill member nations’ weapons stockpiles. 
* But ramping up defense production is no quick or easy feat. 
* The U.S. has been by far the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, providing $15.2 billion in weapons packages to date since Moscow invaded its neighbor in late February. 
In the U.S. weapons industry, the normal production level for artillery rounds for the 155 millimeter howitzer — a long-range heavy artillery weapon currently used on the battlefields of Ukraine — is about 30,000 rounds per year in peacetime. 
The Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces go through that amount in roughly two weeks. 
That’s according to Dave Des Roches, an associate professor and senior military fellow at the U.S. National Defense University. And he’s worried. 
“I’m greatly concerned. Unless we have new production, which takes months to ramp up, we’re not going to have the ability to supply the Ukrainians,” Des Roches told CNBC.

"It is not a yes or no question. It is very much a question of what has he done…to make sure that cities…have the funding and have what they need to protect their community, and that is what the president has done," Ms Jean-Pierre responded.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Jean-Pierre for avoiding the question, and claimed she portrays Biden’s America as a “Mythical Place.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: It is interesting that President Biden threatened in February to “bring an end to” the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine.     
“I promise you we will be able to do it,” Biden responded when a reporter asked how the U.S. could put a stop to the pipeline, which was under German control. 
That is a rather damning video and one that Russian media is going to disseminate widely.   
Update #1: Moon of Alabama makes the case that the US was responsible for this attack, and the real target was Germany .... The War On Germany Just Entered Its Hot Phase (Moon of Alabama).   
Update #2: The CIA is now pushing the narrative that they warned everyone a few weeks ago that such an attack was possible .... CIA warned Berlin about possible attacks on gas pipelines in summer - Spiegel (Reuters). More here .... Germany warned by CIA of possible attack on Nord Stream gas pipeline weeks in advance: report (FOX News).
 Update #3: Poland’s former defense and foreign minister is convinced that the US is responsible for this attack .... US praised for Nord Stream explosion (RT).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC News: Nord Stream: Ukraine accuses Russia of pipeline terror attack 
Ukraine has accused Russia of causing leaks in two major gas pipelines to Europe in what it described as a "terrorist attack". 
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said the damage to Nord Stream 1 and 2 was "an act of aggression" towards the EU. 
He added that Russia wanted to cause pre-winter panic and urged the EU to increase military support for Ukraine.  Seismologists reported underwater blasts before the leaks emerged. 
"There is no doubt that these were explosions," said Bjorn Lund of Sweden's National Seismology Centre, as quoted by local media.

Update: Kyiv says gas leaks on Nord Stream pipelines are result of Moscow ‘terror attack’ -- AFP   
WNU Editor: Russia has nothing to gain by blowing-up its own pipeline. In fact they have a lot to lose by not having any leverage on countries like Germany when it comes to energy supplies. 
As I mentioned in a previous post ....      
.... It was almost two weeks ago that Russian President Putin told the EU that their energy crisis would be solved if they open Nord Stream 2 .... Putin tells Europe: if you want gas then open Nord Stream 2 (Reuters). 
With this interruption of two separate pipelines at the same time, coupled with seismic evidence pointing to two maybe three deliberate explosions, it is clear to me that someone does not want Putin's option on the table.]]></summary>

Demonstrators call for greater support from west and help communicating with outside world 
The EU and the US are considering further sanctions against Iran over the attempt to suppress demonstrations and strikes in universities over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in a police detention centre. 
Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, condemned Iran’s disproportionate use of force and said all options would be on the table at the next meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers. 
The main options are helping to prevent the internet being shut by Iran, and further economic sanctions. 
Demonstrators at the street protests – now in their 10th day – have also called for greater support from the west, as well as help in communicating with the outside world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: For the first time in 30 years, Asia’s developing economies are set to grow faster than China’s, ADB says 
* The Asian Development Bank now sees growth among emerging Asian economies of 4.3% in 2022 and 4.9% in 2023. 
* The ADB expects the rest of developing Asia excluding China to grow by 5.3% in both 2022 and 2023, while it now expects China to grow by 3.3% in 2022, lower than revised forecasts released in July. 
* This will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the report said. 
Asia’s developing economies may be showing signs of recovery, but the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cut its growth forecasts for them yet again — thanks to China’s prolonged zero-Covid policy. 
But this will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the Manila-based lender said in its latest outlook report released Wednesday. 
“The last time was in 1990, when (China’s) growth slowed to 3.9% while GDP in the rest of the region expanded by 6.9%,” it said. 
The ADB now expects developing Asia — excluding China — to grow by 5.3% in 2022, and China by 3.3% in the same year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde   
Politico:  ECB’s Lagarde expects technical recession this winter 
Central Bank estimates currently predict euro area growth to remain positive in 2023, albeit low at 0.9 percent.  The European Central Bank expects the euro area economy to contract in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter next year, its president said Monday. 
That fits the definition of a technical recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. 
"It is difficult to predict what the real outcome will be in 2023 but it will certainly be a difficult year of which the first quarter will most likely be negative, as we believe the last quarter of 2022 will likely be negative as well," ECB President Christine Lagarde told the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

Update #1: Europe's outlook 'darkening,' ECB head hedges on recession (AP) 
Update #2: EU central bank warns ‘outlook is darkening’ (RT)   
WNU Editor: ECB President Christine Lagarde blames Russia for this economic crisis, even though it is the EU that imposed sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine thereby precipitating the current economic crisis not the otherway around. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde is also predicting a short technical recession. 
I disagree. 
Europe's access to cheap and reliable energy from Russia has now come to an end. What this means is that Europe's business model, based on cheap energy, is now broken.
For the people in Europe this means expensive energy alternatives and supplies, the closure of businesses that are dependent on reliable and affordable energy, and the departure of businesses to other more affordable energy producing countries. 
Europe is not facing a short recession this winter. Europe is already in a recession, and it is going to get worse.]]></summary>

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz secured just one shipment of liquefied natural gas from the United Arab Emirates, with a non-binding agreement for more, as Europe’s biggest economy struggles to replace Russian supplies. 
The cargo -- 137,000 cubic meters -- will be delivered by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to German utility RWE AG by early 2023. ADNOC also signed a memorandum of understanding to make more deliveries next year. An ensuing trip to Qatar didn’t immediately yield any more deals. 
Securing additional supplies is crucial for Germany after the Kremlin shut down a key pipeline. Officials have grown increasingly concerned about blackouts and rationing this winter, and the economy is hurtling toward a recession. The deal announced Sunday shows how difficult it will be for the country to get more gas in the near-term.

The barge, which is festooned with radar reflectors, antennas, defensive launchers, and other gear, first appeared in model form a year ago. 
Pictures recently emerged on social media of an interesting Chinese barge covered in various radar reflectors and antennas, and also equipped with a pair of Type 726-series defensive launchers that are used on various People's Liberation Army Navy warships. By all indications, the barge's main purpose is to support countermeasure and electronic warfare and related test and training activities, which could also support the development of new and improved weapons, sensors, and countermeasures. In some ways, it looks similar to decoy target barges that were used by Russia in efforts to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge in Crimea earlier this year.

WNU Editor: It looks like the Chinese are conducting exercises in countermeasures and electronic warfare. And this barge does have similarities to a barge that the Russian navy has deployed around the Kerch Strait Bridge to protect it from Ukrainian missile attacks (see image below).

Xi Jinping must make his move within a generation, before a growing India, climate change-induced ecological costs, demographic weakness, or even further political liberalization in China put Taiwan beyond reach. 
The policy of strategic ambiguity maintained by the United States vis-à-vis the status of Taiwan is an absurdity that has lost its initially intended purpose of drawing Communist China away from the Soviet Union. It is not a subtle declaration, as its proponents in the U.S. government claim, intended to preserve peace because it appeals to some imagined political equilibrium. Taiwan has all of the desirable properties of a country that deserves the close protection of allies: it is a very liberal democracy, a key component of the world’s economic system, and a geostrategic cork against Communist China’s easy access to the Pacific Ocean.

WNU Editor: I know among my friends in China they have a different point of view. That time is on China's side when it comes to Taiwan. And I can understand this logic. 
Public opinion polls in Taiwan have always shown a certain level of support for closer ties, even reunification, with China .... Taiwan Opinion Polling on Unification with China (Jamestown /Foundation). As China continues to grow in influence and power, coupled with a more stable geopolitical environment, I can see a scenario where both countries will develop closer ties without Chinese military threats and coercion. It will take, but the Chinese are always looking at the long game.]]></summary>

CNN: US Navy sends its most advanced surface warship to east Asia  
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — The US Navy’s most advanced surface warship is showing its stealthy profile in the western Pacific on a mission that may set the stage for the eventual deployment of US hypersonic missiles to the region. 
The USS Zumwalt is the first in a class of three multimission guided missile destroyers the Navy says will “create a new level of battlespace complexity for potential adversaries.” 
In the Pacific, one of those potential adversaries is obviously China, and the Zumwalt will certainly get Beijing’s attention. 
“The presence of a stealth warship will draw a great deal of (Chinese) interest,” especially if the Zumwalt is outfitted with hypersonic weapons, said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.

WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. Once it arrives in East Asia the Chinese are going to be watching this warship very closely.

Expect higher inflation, higher interest rates, greater costs when it comes to debt servicing, and a lower stock market. Bottom line. Here comes a recession. 
As for the U.S.. While imports are now cheaper, their exports are being priced out of the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mermaid Inn, a perennially popular restaurant at 570 Amsterdam Ave.  for 15 years, will close on October 16.  Owners Danny Abrams and Cindy Smith said they had mutually agreed with the building’s new owners, a local partnership, to terminate their lease on the soon-to-expire New England-style seafood spot.
“We’re both very sad,” Smith said of her and Abrams after breaking the news to 90 employees.
Their new owner has unknown plans for the building and, “We didn’t want to have a restaurant surrounded by scaffolding,” Smith said.
But mermaid lovers can also expect a new location nearby, Abrams said. 
“We’re looking at two or three places to move to on the Upper West Side, and hope to be one by late spring or early summer,” he said.
Meanwhile, the duo are set to open a mammoth new Mermaid Inn at 127 W. 43rd Street near Times Square, the former site of HB Burger, where they partnered with Alicart Restaurant Group CEO Jeffrey Bank.
Abrams and Smith said Amsterdam Avenue employees would be offered jobs at the Times Square site.  Only about half of the planned 550 seats will open this fall, with the rest to follow early next year. 
The New England-style seafood spot will seek a new home on the Upper West Side, the owners said.James Keivom
“We haven’t built it yet,” Abrams explained.
This will be their fifth and biggest mermaid.  The oldest, at 96 Second Ave.  city ​​center, only reopened after two-year pandemic.  The others are in Greenwich Village (where it’s called the Mermaid Oyster Bar) and Chelsea.

Italy’s far-right turn has been years in the making.
 Giorgia Meloni, the founder of the far-right party Brothers of Italy, will be Italy’s first woman leader and the first far-right leader in decades, since the fall of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
Meloni’s party won about 26 percent of the vote in Italy’s snap general elections on Sunday, and will join with other right-wing parties to form a governing coalition with Meloni as prime minister.
Meloni’s rise to power and the retrenchment of far-right populism within her coalition is in some ways a res…]]></summary>

"The largest anti-government protests in Iran since 2009 gathered strength on Saturday, spreading to as many as 80 cities, even as the authorities escalated a crackdown that has reportedly killed dozens of people and brought the arrests of prominent activists and journalists, according to rights groups and news media reports," The New York Times reported. "In many cities, including Tehran, the capital, security forces responded by opening fire on the crowds."
State media is reporting 35 fatalities.

		It is also attracting criticism from the Kremlin's own official supporters, something almost unheard of in Russia since the invasion began.
	

		"It has been announced that privates can be recruited up to the age of 35. Summonses are going to 40-year-olds," the RT editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, railed on her Telegram channel.
	

		"They're infuriating people, as if on purpose, as if out of spite. As if they'd been sent by Kyiv."

It said this was in line with Washington's hostile stance towards Tehran.
"By reducing the severity of a number of communications sanctions - while maintaining maximum pressure - the U.S. is seeking to advance its goals against Iran," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying.

It's also a story that gets pretty deep in the weeds and one that bumps up against a basic reality: Although many millions of viewers watch the Summer and Winter Olympics and debate the internal or international drama hyped up by multibillion-dollar broadcast rights holder NBC, very few of them know or care anything about USOC's lords of the rings or their apparatchiks' day-to-day operations, far from the flag-waving captured on TV.

Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), called it a "heart-wrenching tragedy".
At least 14 people rescued were recovering in hospitals in Syria while six others were discharged, as search efforts continued, with several people still missing since the boat sank on Thursday.
"There are 89 victims, while 14 people are receiving treatment at Al-Basel Hospital, two of whom are in intensive care," Syria's official news agency SANA reported, quoting Iskandar Ammar, a hospital official.

Angry demonstrators have taken to the streets of major cities across Iran, including the capital Tehran, for eight straight nights since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.
The Kurdish woman was pronounced dead after spending three days in a coma following her arrest by Iran's feared morality police for wearing the hijab headscarf in an "improper" way.
"The number of people who died in recent riots in the country has risen to 35," state media said, raising the official toll from at least 17 dead, including five security personnel.

"Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction," Putin said, adding: "This is not a bluff."
However analysts aren't convinced the Russian president is willing to be the first to unleash nuclear weapons since the US bombed Japan in 1945.
AFP spoke with several experts and officials about the possible scenarios that could arise should Russia carry out a nuclear attack.
What would a Russian nuclear attack look like?
Analysts say Moscow would likely deploy one or more "tactical" or battlefield nuclear bombs.

		China's foreign ministry, in a statement on the meeting, said the United States was sending "very wrong, dangerous signals" on Taiwan, and the more rampant Taiwan's independence activity, the less likely there would be a peaceful settlement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had downed four Iranian-made "kamikaze" unmanned aerial vehicles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain Tehran was harming Ukrainian sovereignty and its citizens.
	

		Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied.
	

		"Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran," said a statement on the foreign ministry's website.
	

		"In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv."
	

		The message was handed to the acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
	

		Military authorities in southern Ukraine said in a statement they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the port of Odesa.
	

		Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who has fled his home country of Russia this week delivered a scathing portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership in an interview with The Atlantic.
The man in question, a 38-year-old IT manager named Anton Shalaev, escaped from Russia this week to the Armenian capitol of Yerevan, which is one of the few places that will still allow Russians into the country.
When asked specifically about Putin's decision making during the war, Shalaev did not hesitate to slam the man who has led his homeland for more than two decades.
"A few old men and an army of zombies are leading us to hell," he said. "I say that because people around me in Russia behaved as if they had been bitten by a zombie, dragging my entire country into a dreadful war. All I saw was Russian loser husbands beating their wives, while the entire rotting house of the state system has turned my people into an army of the dead."
IN OTHER NEWS: Insiders fear Letitia James is set to inflict 'the biggest political damage' to Trump with GOP voters: report
To put a fine point on it, Shalaev added, "They are my enemies."
Shalaev also had some unkind words for Russian state media operations.
"Russian propaganda is a weapon, and the bastards working there are war criminals," he said. "The greatest guilt in this entire tragedy belongs to a small bunch of old men at the top: KGB officers."
Various media outlets have reported that many Russian men of military age have been trying to escape the country even since Putin called for a mobilization earlier this week to rescue his war in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One viral video on Twitter says it all about Iranian protesters’ defiance of the “morality police”: a young woman throws her veil into a bonfire and dances.


	The official death toll from popular unrest in Iran shot up to 17 on Thursday as Raisi vowed that Amini’s death would be investigated. She died in a Tehran hospital on September 16 after falling into a coma following her arrest by the “morality police” which enforces the wearing of the veil.


Women are compelled to cover their hair in public in Iran, which as a Shiite theocratic state follows a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The morality police – officially known as the Gasht-e Ershad; or “guidance patrol” – are responsible for enforcing this dress code.
But the law does not precisely define the “correct” way to wear the veil…]]></summary>

The demonstrations followed the strongest warning from the authorities yet when the army told Iranians it would confront "the enemies" behind the unrest - a move that could signal the kind of crackdown that has crushed protests in the past.
Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as "Israel's soldiers", live state television coverage showed. They also shouted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel", common slogans the country's clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hilary Mantel, the first British novelist to win the Booker Prize twice and who sold millions of books around the world, has died aged 70, her publishers announced on Friday.
"We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel, and our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald," 4th Estate Books said.
"This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work," it added, providing no other details.

Fewer than 10 of the shiny black mammals are still alive on Ocean Beach, in remote western Tasmania, state wildlife services said.
About 30 of the animals were released into the ocean on Thursday, but some had beached themselves again, said Brendon Clark, incident controller with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.
Under cool drizzle, marine wildlife experts began to wrap up a complex days-long rescue operation that started with a large pod of the animals, which are part of the dolphin family, stranding on the beach mid-week.

When Silvia* was taken off the pill on medical grounds, her doctor did not mention the possibility of using other contraceptive methods. When she ended up with an unwanted pregnancy months later, the same doctor chose to ignore her request for an abortion.

Amini, 22, died after her arrest by the Islamic republic's feared morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab headscarf in an "improper" way, and news of her death sparked widespread outrage.
The official death toll rose to at least 17 on Thursday, including five security personnel, but the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said its sources put the figure much higher.
"On the 7th day of #IranProtest, officials admit to at least 17 deaths w/ independent sources say 36," the CHRI said in a Twitter post.

The media scion's lawyers claimed their client was defamed over a dozen times in the article, which accused "the Murdochs and their slew of poisonous Fox News commentators" of being "unindicted co-conspirators" in the Capitol riot.

		The United States will have an option to buy up to an additional 400 million shots for the program after this year.
	

		The drugmaker said it would have sufficient supply to deliver the full billion doses under the U.S. commitment, but "we are seeing reduced demand in some low- and lower-middle-income countries due to barriers in administration and vaccine hesitancy."
	

		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.
	

		Pfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.
	

		The vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world's poorer countries.
	

		The program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.
	

		COVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.

Nuclear threat

		The integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.
	

		After the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use "all means" to protect its territory.
	

		Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included "strategic nuclear weapons". He predicted the voting regions "will integrate into Russia".
	

		For most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.
	

		The referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.
	

		Election officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.]]></summary>

The Bermuda Weather Service said the center of Fiona was forecast to pass more than 110 miles (180 kilometers) to the west of the British territory on Friday morning at around 5:00 am (0700 GMT), but with a storm of that strength and size, residents were taking no chances.
"This storm is going to be worse than the last one," Richard Hartley, owner of the Torwood Home store in the capital, Hamilton, told AFP as he and his wife covered the shop's cedar-lined windows with metal sheets.
