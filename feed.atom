   Business Insider: 'I can't get my money out': Billionaire investor Mark Mobius says China is restricting flows of capital out of the country 
* Emerging markets investing veteran Mark Mobius says China is restricting capital outflows. 
* He told Fox Business' "Mornings with Maria' that he couldn't pull investment funds from his account in Shanghai.
* Mobius said he's been unable to get an explanation about the "crazy" restriction. 
Mark Mobius, a pioneer in emerging markets investing, said China is restricting investment outflows from the country, a move that would be taking place as the world's second-largest economy is trying to shake off pressure from COVID-19 lockdowns. 
"I'm personally affected because I have an account with HSBC in Shanghai. I can't get my money out. 
The government is restricting the flow of money out of the country," Mobius said on Thursday on the Fox Business show "Mornings with Maria". 
"So I would be very, very careful investing in China," the founder of Mobius Capital Partners said.

* Half of Americans say China is the United States’ greatest enemy 
* Since the pandemic, China has held the top spot as the greatest enemy 
* Democrats and Republicans have different views on who is the top enemy 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- For the third year in a row, Americans are most likely to mention China as the United States’ greatest enemy in the world today. When asked the open-ended question, 50% of Americans say China is their nation’s greatest enemy, with most of the rest, 32%, naming Russia. North Korea, which was viewed as the greatest enemy in 2018, is now a distant third at 7%. 
The latest results are from Gallup’s Feb. 1-23 World Affairs survey, coinciding with widespread reporting of China’s balloon-carried surveillance device being shot down over U.S. waters. There has also been growing concern in the U.S. about China’s alleged backing of Russia in the Ukraine conflict and its association with the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

VOA/AFP: Syria Condemns US Top General's Visit to Kurdish-Held Northeast  
Damascus, Syria — Syria's foreign ministry Sunday condemned a surprise visit by the United States' top military officer to an army base in the Kurdish-held northeast, dubbing it "illegal," state media said. 
In his snap visit Saturday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met U.S. troops stationed in areas of war-torn Syria under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 
About 900 U.S. troops are deployed in several bases and posts across northeastern Syria as part of the fight against Islamic State group remnants. 
The official news agency SANA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying, "Syria strongly condemns the illegal visit of the American chairman of the chiefs of staff to an illegal American military base in northeast Syria."

CSM: US-China conundrum: Can hotline diplomacy work if trust isn’t a goal? 
Shortly after the U.S. Air Force shot down a Chinese balloon that had traversed the continental United States for several days last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin placed a call to his counterpart in Beijing. 
At his disposal: a special hotline intended to help the two increasingly competitive global powers to prevent sudden tensions from deteriorating into full-blown crises. 
The call went unanswered. 
The Pentagon later lamented the lost opportunity for the two sides to talk out the balloon flare-up before it devolved, as it soon did, into a diplomatic imbroglio. 
For its part, China’s Defense Ministry confirmed that its chief, Wei Fenghe, had declined to take the call because the U.S. by its action had “failed to create a proper atmosphere” for a bilateral dialogue.

But bottom line. Both sides are not talking .... US defense secretary tells CNN he hasn’t spoken to Chinese counterpart for a ‘couple of months’ (CNN).]]></summary>

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is on a trip to the Middle East this week to meet with counterparts regarding regional tension and the global impact of Russia's war in Ukraine.

We Are The Mighty: The CIA says Xi Jinping ordered the Chinese military to invade Taiwan within four years 
When the latest delegation from the House of Representatives returned from Taiwan, they had one message for the rest of Congress: Taiwan needs weapons and training, now. The U.S., they believe, needs to speed up the number and power of armaments it promised to Taipei. 
The United States currently has a backlog of $19 billion in undelivered weapons.   The U.S. might have a little more time to deliver the weapons, but only a little. CIA director William Burns told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan in four years. And that’s not a full four years Taiwan has to prepare. Even after the weapons are delivered, the Taiwanese will still need to train with them.

Update: China increases military spending, CIA warns of invasion (News Nation)   
WNU Editor: Quoting CIA Director Burns .... 
.... “We do know, as has been made public, that President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan, but that doesn’t mean that he’s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well,” Burns said.  
Being able to invade Taiwan is one thing. A final decision to invade is another. But if I was Taiwan, I would definitely be preparing my defenses ASAP.]]></summary>

E tényezők egyike is elég lehet hozzá, hogy egész országok gazdasága drámaian visszaessen, illetve számos vállalat megroggyanjon, csődbe menjen, megszűnjön.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called the wave of suspected poisonings of schoolgirls in recent months an "unforgivable crime". 
"If there are any people involved in the matter, and there certainly are... the perpetrators must be given the most severe of punishments," he warned. 
More than 1,000 girls at dozens of schools have been affected by unexplained illnesses since November. 
Incidents were reported in at least 15 cities and towns on Sunday alone. 
Authorities have released very little information about their investigations and announced no arrests, but they have accused Iran's "enemies" of using the suspected poisonings to undermine the clerical establishment.

Bloomberg: Polish-German Tensions Expose Crack in Unified Ukraine Front 
(Bloomberg) -- As NATO allies make a show of unity in support of Ukraine, a rift between Germany and Poland risks undermining a joint effort to supply Kyiv’s forces.

   WNU Editor: I saw first hand how US diplomacy worked at an ICAO General Assembly in the early 1990s.

I was working for ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in Montreal at the time, and the main point of this particular General Assembly was to standardize all equipment used by airports around the world. 
Tens of billions of dollars were involved, and I saw first hand the US delegation pulling all the stops and whistles to make sure US companies were going to be selected to provide these standardized systems.The Japanese and a collection of European countries were offering what IMHO was an excellent alternative to what the US was offering, but I could tell at the time the US were more active behind the scenes (i.e. more banquets, parties, open bars, etc.) 
Yup. The arm twisting, threats, bribes, etc., that happened during this particular Assembly was quite an education for me.
Needless to say when the votes finally came in, the US delegation got everything that they wanted.]]></summary>

Her Reform party secured 31% against far-right’s 15% but Kallas must now form a coalition to govern 
The Reform party of Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, secured first place in Sunday’s parliamentary election, a result that should ensure Tallinn remains one of Europe’s most staunchly pro-Ukraine governments. 
Results with 98% ballots counted showed the far-right EKRE party in second place, with 16.1% versus 31.5% for Kallas’ liberal group, reflecting concerns among some voters over the rising cost of living in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Estonian PM Kallas' liberal Reform Party won 37 out of 101 seats — three more than the last election in 2019 — after results were announced in the early hours of Monday morning.
The right-wing nationalist EKRE party came in second with 17 seats, down two seats compared to the last election. 
Meanwhile, the Center Party, traditionally favored by Estonia’s sizable ethnic-Russian minority, came in third with 16 seats.

HAZEL GREEN, Ky. — As he claimed the first spot in a mile-long line for free food in the Appalachian foothills, Danny Blair vividly recalled receiving the letter announcing that his pandemic-era benefit to help buy groceries was about to be slashed. 
Kentucky lawmakers had voted to end the state’s health emergency last spring, by default cutting food stamp benefits created to help vulnerable Americans like Blair weather the worst of covid-19. Instead of $200 a month, he would get just $30.
 He crumpled up the letter and threw it on the floor of his camper.  “I thought, ‘Wow, the government is trying to kill us now,’” said Blair, 63, who survives on his Social Security disability check and lives in a mobile home with his wife after their house burned down five years ago. “They are going to starve us out.” 
Blair and his wife hop into their truck twice a month at 4 a.m. to ensure they get a few staples at the Hazel Green Food Project’s giveaway. On a recent Friday, they waited nine hours until local prisoners on work duty started loading bags of meat and vegetables, potato chips and cookies into vehicles in one of the nation’s most impoverished communities.

WNU Editor: The US is not alone. Food insecurity is becoming a bigger and more pressing crisis for almost every country in the world. There are many reasons for this, but IMHO inflation is creating a life affordability crisis for the globe, and with most governments facing debt levels that only keep growing, limiting their options to help.
On a side note. For me it is strange to watch people spending hours waiting in line for food in large pick-up trucks.]]></summary>

First lady Jill Biden pushed back on concerns about President Joe Biden’s age and dismissed a proposal by Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley for politicians over age 75 to take a mental competency test. 
“Ridiculous,” the first lady said, responding to Haley’s proposal during an interview with CNN, which will air as part of “CNN Primetime: Jill Biden Abroad” at 9 p.m. ET on Monday. 
Asked if her husband, who would be 82 at his inauguration if he’s reelected, would consider taking such a test, Jill Biden said, “We would never even discuss something like that.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday slammed International Atomic Energy Association chief Rafael Grossi for comments he made against a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, calling them “unworthy.” 
Grossi, who had just returned from a visit to Tehran, said on Saturday that “any military attack on a nuclear facility is outlawed, is out of the normative structures that we all abide by,” when asked by a reporter about threats from the United States and Israel to attack Iran if negotiations to curb its nuclear program are unsuccessful.

Daily Mail: China increases its military budget by 7.1% - $230BN – to ’boost combat preparedness’ for ‘major tasks’ amid fears it will launch an invasion of Taiwan 
* China plunges $230bn into its military budget to 'boost combat preparedness' 
* It reverses a two-decade trend where China has prioritized growth over defense 
* Concerns are mounting that China is set to launch an invasion of Taiwan 
China announced it will boost its military budget by nearly $230 billion this year amid concerns it will launch an invasion of Taiwan. 
The money is set to 'boost combat preparedness and enhance military capabilities,' claimed Premier Li Keqiang ahead of a draft budget presented to the National People's Congress in Beijing. 
It means China's military spending will grow at its fastest pace in four years and take up a larger share of its economy, marking the reversal of a two-decade trend which has seen the nation prioritize growth over its military capabilities.

France will significantly reduce its military presence in Africa, where its bases will be ‘co-administered’ with local army forces, the president said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Monday for his country to build “a new, balanced relationship” with Africa, as the former colonial power seeks to reduce its military presence on the continent. 
“The objective of this new era is to deploy our security presence in a partnership-based approach,” Macron said in a speech in Paris, ahead of a tour that will take him to Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Congo later this week. 
In the future, French military bases on the continent will be “co-administered” with local personnel, the French president said, while there will be a “visible decrease” in the number of French troops stationed in Africa over the next few months.

   Reuters: Russia's Wagner chief warns of frontline collapse if forced to retreat from Bakhmut 
(Reuters) - The founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said his troops now tightening their grip on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut were being deprived of ammunition and if they were forced to retreat the entire front would collapse. 
"If Wagner retreats from Bakhmut now, the whole front will collapse," Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video published over the weekend. "The situation will not be sweet for all military formations protecting Russian interests." 
Reuters could not independently verify when and where the video was recorded. The footage was published on a Telegram channel that has been disseminating Prigozhin news and has associated itself with the Wagner Group. The video was not published on Prigozhin's usual press service channel. 
Prigozhin on Friday said that his units had "practically surrounded Bakhmut," where fighting has intensified in the past week with Russian forces attacking from nearly all sides.  But on Sunday he complained that most of the ammunition that his forces were promised by Moscow in February had not yet been shipped.

Ukrainian forces are preparing a fighting withdrawal from Bakhmut in east Ukraine as Russian soldiers try to encircle them and capture the city.
Russian military bloggers and Western intelligence reports said that Russian troops had advanced in the destroyed city but that Ukrainian special forces were counter-attacking. 
“The Armed Forces of Ukraine are withdrawing forces from the central and western regions of Bakhmut,” said Rybar, a blogging unit that has close ties to the Russian armed forces and 1.1 million subscribers on Telegram.
“These efforts are only intended to buy time and delay the Russian units as much as possible. The battle for Bakhmut is close to its end.”

European Commission chief von der Leyen says the EU has seen ‘no evidence’ that China is considering sending arms to Russia. 
MESEBERG, Germany — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday said China had declared it won’t supply Russia with weapons for its war against Ukraine, suggesting that Berlin has received bilateral assurances from Beijing on the issue. 
 Scholz was speaking at a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told reporters that the EU has received “no evidence” so far from the U.S. that Beijing is considering supplying lethal support to Moscow. 
Senior U.S. officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have expressed deep concern in recent weeks that China could provide weapons such as kamikaze drones to Russia, which in turn triggered warnings to Beijing from EU politicians. Scholz himself urged Beijing last week to refrain from such actions and instead use its influence to convince Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself against a possible nuclear attack from Iran during a Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday.

Netanyahu was responding to remarks from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi after the IAEA and Iran reached agreement on Saturday on inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.
"International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi just said in Tehran that an Israeli attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities is against the law," Netanyahu said. "Against which law?"
He noted that Iran openly called for the destruction of Israel and said that it was clear that Israel was allowed to defend itself.
"I say this because nothing will deter us from defending our country and preventing our enemies from eliminating the state of the Jews," Netanyahu said.
On Saturday, the IAEA and Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI) announced that experts from the UN's nuclear watchdog would be permitted to carry out closer inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.
The IAEA's cameras would also to be put back into operation, after they and other monitoring equipment were dismantled last year, Grossi said.
Since the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal that restricted uranium enrichment, Iran has enriched uranium to a purity level of 60%, raising international concerns that it was close to being able to build a nuclear weapon.
Israel is convinced that Iran is working to develop a nuclear weapon and sees its existence as threatened. Israeli leaders have repeatedly said they will not allow Iran to become a nuclear power and have refused to rule out a preventive strike.]]></summary>

After two years of subdued revelry due to COVID-19, the Holi celebrations that began last week recreated the legend of the Hindu god Krishna spraying his consort Radha and her friends with red, yellow, green and saffron colors. The women were from Nandgaon, the hometown of Krishna, and the men were from Barsana, the legendary hometown of Radha.

The men wore turbans and held shields above their heads to protect themselves from the women's hits in the mock battle.

Polling stations reopened this morning in Estonia as the country votes in its first general election since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. 
The centre-right Reform Party of Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, one of Europe’s most outspoken supporters of Ukraine, is a favourite to win.
She faces a challenge from the far-right opposition Conservative People's Party of Estonia, or EKRE, which is seeking to limit the Baltic nation's exposure to the Ukraine crisis and is blaming the government for citizens' economic misery.

Republic World: China Calls US 'largest Nuclear Threat' To World, Says It Must Fulfill Key Duty To Disarm 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that the US was using the alleged nuclear threat posed by China as a pretext to expand its own arsenal. 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, stated that the United States needs to reconsider its security policy regarding nuclear weapons since it poses the world's largest nuclear threat. During a news briefing on Friday, Ning suggested that the US should prioritize its duty to disarm and take practical measures to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in its national security policy. Additionally, she emphasized the need for the US to take steps towards minimizing nuclear risks.
According to a report from TASS, her exact statement was "the United States is the world's largest source of nuclear threat. It should carefully rethink its nuclear policy, diligently fulfill its special and primary duty to disarm, thus reducing the role of nuclear weapons in the national security policy, and take meaningful practical steps to ease nuclear risks".

Business Insider: The German company that makes Leopard and Panther tanks wants to build a factory in Ukraine, report says

A German arms giant wants to build a tank factory in Ukraine, the Rheinische Post reported Saturday. 
"Talks with the Ukrainian government are promising and I'm hoping for a decision in the next two months," Armin Papperger, the CEO of Rheinmetall, told the newspaper. 
Rheinmetall makes an array of weapons and ammunition, including the Leopard 2 tanks that Germany finally offered to send to Ukraine in late January. 
Its latest battle-tank is the Panther KF51.  The company is headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany, but has factories in 33 countries.

US-NATO response to fall of Bakhmut is likely an assault on Crimea, which in turn will spark Russian attacks on Eastern Europe  
Ukrainian forces are pulling out of Bakhmut and the battle for the small Donetsk city is nearly finished. So what happens next?

The Russians say they have not seen any foreign fighters for about a month. Most of these were said to be from Georgia and Abkhazia. (Abkhazia is the area in Georgia carved out by the Russians and declared an independent entity.)

Reuters: U.S. Hosts War Games for Ukraine Ahead of Next Phase of Russia Conflict 
WIESBADEN, Germany (Reuters) - The United States is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through upcoming battlefield decisions, officials said on Thursday, ahead of the next phase of the year-old conflict with Russia. 
The multi-day, table top exercises have been carried out at a war-gaming facility at a U.S. Army base in Wiesbaden, Germany, where the top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, visited on Thursday. 
U.S. officials declined to talk through the potential battlefield scenarios that Ukrainian military staff were examining during the drills, which involve thought exercises to evaluate potential military courses of action.

Sergey Shoigu has visited a command center helping to direct Moscow’s forces in Ukraine  
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has inspected one of the command centers coordinating the military operation in Ukraine, the ministry said on Saturday. The minister flew by helicopter to meet with service members from the ‘Vostok’ (East) combat group at an undisclosed location in the “South Donetsk direction.” 
Shoigu discussed the work of medical units and broader supply issues. He emphasized the need to house troops in secure quarters, according to a statement from the Defense Ministry. The minister handed out medals, thanking soldiers and officers for “fighting admirably.”

WNU Editor: Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu is a high priority target for the Ukraine military. He would not be in Ukraine if the situation was a threat to him and/or the Russian military was not in complete control. This is a strong indication to me that the tide of the war may be shifting in Moscow's favor. 
On another note. You cannot tell much from a one minute video that has been heavily edited, but it looks like the war has significantly aged the Russian Defense Minister. He had the appearance of a man who is always in meetings 24/7, making life and death decisions that will impact thousands.

KYIV (Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, the shelves of the Novus supermarket chain in Kyiv quickly emptied as its supply chains - domestic and overseas - collapsed.
Fresh produce became scarce and panic buying spread.  Oleksiy Panasenko, deputy director general for operations at the popular outlet, recalls how the business reeled before Novus, like many other large retail chains, managed to adapt. 
"On the second day (of the war), there was already fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv," he told Reuters. "In February and March, our shops became more than a place to buy food: they were a place to meet, to communicate; so-called islands of stability."

WNU Editor: Aside from the retail sector, there is no Ukraine economy. The industrial base has been more or less destroyed. The official inflation rate is around 30%, but everyone I know in Ukraine is telling me the rate is significantly higher. The official unemployment rate is over 35%, but again everyone I know in Ukraine is telling me that it is much higher. The entire country is dependent on Western aid and debt at a level that is simply not sustainable. And as for investment. Not going to happen as this war grinds on.

RFI: France holds largest-ever military drills amid bloody backdrop of Ukraine war 
France is staging its biggest military exercises to date – an operation involving 12,000 troops including NATO allies. 
The first leg of the Orion 2023 war games started on 23 February and will last until 11 March. The drills come one year after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. 
"The geopolitical context justifies this exercise," says Yves Metayer, commander of the troop deployment division at the French chiefs of staff. 
He adds that the plan has been in the works since 2020 and builds on the French Ministry of Defence's 2017 Strategic Review of Defence and National Security.

DPA: US, South Korea to hold new military field exercises later this month 
The United States and South Korea are planning to hold new military exercises starting on March 13 for an 11-day period, the US Forces Korea (USFK) said on Friday. 
Field exercises will be integrated into the staff exercise, which is based on computer simulations, according to USFK. 
A series of field exercises, called Warrior Shield FTX, are already underway, a USFK spokesman said. 
It was initially unclear how many soldiers would be deployed in the exercises, which seek to improve military cooperation between the two countries' armed forces through "air, land, sea, space, cyber and special operations," he said.

Milley believes an "enduring defeat" of ISIS is possible, but didn't say how far away that is.   Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, made an unexpected visit to U.S. forces in Syria. 
The top general visited American troops in the country’s northeast to hear from them about how the fight against ISIS is going. The visit also comes after recent attacks on bases housing American soldiers. 
Milley was asked by reporters if the mission in Syria was worth the risk, per Reuters. He directly connected U.S. presence in the country with the nation’s national security. 
“If you think that that’s important, then the answer is ‘Yes,’” he said. ”I happen to think that’s important.”

FOX News: NATO member urges allies to pay more after Ukraine war anniversary, claims 'crisis' in UN 
Estonia led charge calling for tribunal to examine potential Russian war crimes 
UNITED NATIONS, New York — Estonia has criticized NATO allies for not doing enough to continue supporting Ukraine as Russia’s invasion drags on past the one-year mark, and it also raised concerns that the U.N. may not be able to fulfill its duty in holding those in power responsible for alleged war crimes. 
"Members have not done enough," Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. 
"This is my comprehensive assessment."  "The Western camp has supported weapons aid, given around 50 billion euros approximately, and this is far from being satisfying," Reinsalu added. "If we want to invest to Ukrainian victory, not only to invest to Ukraine, that they can survive and not lose, we have to change the paradigm of our support."

Thomas Meaney, New York Times: In Ukraine, the United States Is In Over Its Head 
The greatest blunder President Vladimir Putin may have made so far in Ukraine is giving the West the impression that Russia could lose the war. The early Russian strike on Kyiv stumbled and failed. The Russian behemoth seemed not nearly as formidable as it had been made out to be. The war suddenly appeared as a face-off between a mass of disenchanted Russian incompetents and supercharged, savvy Ukrainian patriots.

President Volodymyr Zelensky was once a member of the peace-deal camp in Ukraine. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,” he declared one month into the conflict. Now he calls for complete victory: the reconquering of every inch of Russian-occupied territory, including Crimea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday he was "surprised" that companies licensed to sell cocaine to pharmacists or hospitals seemed to signal Canada would soon allow legal sales of hard drugs to the public.
Earlier this week, several companies announced that Canada's federal health agency had allowed them to produce and sell cocaine.
The announcement came a month after the province of British Columbia launched an experimental decriminalization process meant to address an opioid overdose crisis that has killed thousands.
The province decriminalized the possession -- but not sale -- of small amounts of cocaine and other hard drugs, under a three-year pilot project, with the aim of removing the stigma associated with drug use that keeps people from seeking help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scores of disemboweled sharks have washed up on a South African beach putting the spotlight on a pair of shark-hunting killer whales whose behaviour has fascinated scientists and wildlife enthusiasts.
Marine biologists were alerted to the find by beach walkers who stumbled upon the grim sight last week in Gansbaai, a small fishing port 150 kilometers (93 miles) south east of Cape Town.
"The dead sharks are torn open at the pelvic girdle, they have Orca teeth marks known as rake marks on their pectoral fins and their liver is missing," said Alison Towner, 37, a shark scientist with the Dyer Island Conservation Trust.
All evidence points to "Port" and "Starboard", an infamous pair of killer whales spotted off Gansbaai only three days earlier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Olive oil, fragrant rose and orange blossom: the special "chrism" or holy anointing oil for the coronation of Britain's King Charles III has been blessed in Jerusalem's Old City.
Friday's ceremony was carried out at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe Jesus was buried.
"The chrism oil which will be used to anoint His Majesty The King on May 6 2023 has been consecrated in Jerusalem," Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
The unique mix was "perfumed with essential oils", and also included extracts of sesame, jasmine and cinnamon, it added.
Based on the same ingredients as the oil used at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, it is based on a formula "which has been used for hundreds of years", the palace said Friday.
The oil, which will also be used to anoint Queen Consort Camilla, the wife of King Charles III, was consecrated in a special by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, and the Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum.
Now stored in an ornate silver flask, the oil came from the Mount of Olives, the ridge overlooking the walled Old City.
The olives were harvested from two groves, the Monastery of the Ascension and the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, where Charles III's grandmother is buried, Princess Alice of Greece.
The olives were pressed just outside the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican church, said the coronation oil reflects Charles III's "personal family connection with the Holy Land", the palace statement added.
Welby, who will carry out the coronation service, said the oil signified the "deep historic link between the coronation, the Bible and the Holy Land".
"From ancient kings through to the present day, monarchs have been anointed with oil from this sacred place," he said.

Russia and its ally Belarus have been sidelined from most Olympic sports since Russian forces invaded Ukraine last February.
However, in January the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was seeking a "pathway" for Russians to take part in the Games.
Following that announcement, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) offered athletes from both countries the chance to compete in this year's Asian Games.
That was a significant move because they could gain qualifying marks in competition in Asia to allow them to compete in Paris.
Africa has now followed suit.

Researchers believe they have found the earliest evidence of horseback riding, by the ancient Yamnaya people in Europe some 5,000 years ago.
Their conclusions, based on an analysis of human skeletal remains found in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, were published on Friday in the journal Science Advances.
Domestication of horses for milk is widely accepted to have begun around 3500 BC to 3000 BC, the study said, but the "origins of horseback riding remain elusive."
The researchers from the University of Helsinki and other European institutions date the earliest horsemanship to 3000 BC to 2500 BC among members of the Yamnaya culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rafael Vinoly, a Uruguayan-born and New York-based architect known for designing landmark buildings around the world, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Friday.
Vinoly's death Thursday was announced by his son Roman on the website of the family firm, Rafael Vinoly Architects.
"He was a visionary who will be missed by all those whose lives he touched through his work," the son's statement said.
Vinoly's sometimes controversial work features more than 600 structures around the world, including office and residential buildings, hotels, concert halls, stadiums and airports.
One of his better known works is the so-called Walkie Talkie building in London -- an almost cartoonish skyscraper that is broader at the top than the bottom and looks like it is sagging. 
Britain's Manchester City football team, for which Vinoly designed its training ground, called City Football Academy, expressed its condolences on Twitter.
Some of Vinoly's projects have drawn criticism.
One is 432 Park Avenue, an 85-floor residential building in Manhattan, some of whose multi-millionaire tenants have sued over what they say are banging and creaking noises and vibrations coming from the building.
In London, the Walkie Talkie building at 20 Fenchurch Street raised eyebrows in 2013 because sunlight reflected off its mirrored concave side melted various parts on a Jaguar car parked nearby.
"He leaves a rich legacy of distinctive and timeless designs that manifested in some of the world's most recognizable and iconic structures," Roman Vinoly wrote.

The German-language World War I film comes from Netflix, which had a roster of far more expensive "prestige" movies primed for Academy Award pushes, from Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's "Bardo" to the star-studded "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery."
But while those have largely fallen by the wayside, with one nomination each, "All Quiet" has emerged from the crowded trenches of awards season hopefuls as an Oscars frontrunner, with nine nods, including for much-coveted best picture honors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann has resolved to remove any remaining terms from the Nazi era from the statute books.
In a letter to his departmental colleagues, he recently pointed out "that there are still laws and ordinances that use terminology from the Nazi era or in which the 'Reich' is mentioned," the lawyer told Sunday's edition of Die Welt newspaper in comments seen in advance by dpa.
The linguistic remnants appear in laws ranging from those on banking to practitioners of alternative medicine, he said.
"My goal is to eliminate these pre-constitutional remnants," the politician from the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) continued. For example, he said, there are still formulations in the criminal code for the offences of murder and manslaughter that go back to a "National Socialist theory of types of perpetrators."
"In general, I have set myself the goal this year of bringing the entire special section of the criminal code up to date," the justice said.
In the end, it is always up to the legislators to decide. However, he sees "a great openness" in the ruling coalition in which his party is the junior partner with the Greens and the Social Democrats (SPD).]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
