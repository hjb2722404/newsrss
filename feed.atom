        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian service members are seen next to armoured vehicles near the frontline town of Bakhmut, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, February 25. REUTERS/Yan Dobronosov   
Insider: All 500 original members of a Ukrainian battalion were killed or wounded in fighting with Russia, commander says 
* Ukraine's defense is being hindered by the loss of experienced soldiers, The Washington Post reported. 
* One commander said all 500 original members of his battalion had been killed or injured. 
* Soldiers with significant combat experience "are all already dead or wounded," the commander said. 
The war in Ukraine is bleeding both sides, with each suffering more than 100,000 military casualties (killed and wounded) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year. 
But with Moscow able to draft fighters from a population that dwarfs that of Ukraine, there is growing concern that Kyiv is less capable of suffering sustained losses — and that this will jeopardize its ability to strike back this spring, The Washington Post reported on Monday. 
The gravity of the situation is illustrated by the experience of Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade.
A commander of a battalion within the brigade told the Post that he'd lost every one of the 500 people he commanded back in February 2022, leading them to be replaced with fresh recruits far less capable on the battlefield.

WNU Editor: The key part of the Washington Post article is here .... 
 .... After a year of war, Kupol, a lieutenant colonel, said his battalion is unrecognizable. Of about 500 soldiers, roughly 100 were killed in action and another 400 wounded, leading to complete turnover. Kupol said he was the sole military professional in the battalion, and he described the struggle of leading a unit composed entirely of inexperienced troops. 
The Washington Post article is here .... Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow.]]></summary>

Politico: ‘Ukraine doesn’t have any time to waste’: U.S. races to prepare Kyiv for spring offensive  
Washington is increasingly concerned about Ukraine’s dwindling supply of ammo and air defenses. 
The U.S. military is rushing equipment to the battlefield and training Ukrainian forces at a rapid pace, ahead of a major offensive against Russia expected by late spring. 
 Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin projected a sense of urgency on Wednesday after a virtual meeting of the multinational Ukraine Defense Contact Group, saying that “Ukraine doesn’t have any time to waste.” 
“We have to deliver swiftly and fully on our promised commitments,” Austin said. “That includes delivering our armored capabilities to the battlefield and ensuring that Ukrainian soldiers get the training, spare parts and maintenance support that they need to use these new systems, as soon as possible.”

WNU Editor: There has been a number of US main stream news publications in the past week painting a more realistic (albeit gloomy) assessment of the war. The above Politico is another article that is shifting the media narrative on what are the prospects in this war. 
As to the above Politico article quoting US officials that Ukraine will be launching a counter-offensive in May. My own sources in Ukraine doubt it. They are all telling me the same thing. Ukraine does not have enough experienced soldiers to conduct such an operation, let alone not enough artillery, equipment, and ammo to push forward. 
One more note. The Politico article quotes US officials that 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in this war. My sources in Ukraine say the number killed are 125,000+. But what is more shocking is that there are 50,000+ reported as missing, and because they are listed as missing they are not categorized as dead.]]></summary>

Reuters: Poland to Send Ukraine 4 MiG-29 Jets in Coming Days 
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland will send Ukraine four MiG-29 fighter jets in coming days, the president said on Thursday, making it the first of Kyiv's allies to provide such aircraft.

It has said that any transfer of jets would be as part of a coalition. 
"Firstly, literally within the next few days, we will hand over, as far as I remember, four aircraft to Ukraine in full working order," Andrzej Duda told a news conference. 
 "The rest are being prepared, serviced."  On Tuesday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that deliveries could be made in four to six weeks.

Officials have speculated that US drone debris has already sunk too far for recovery, after collision with Russian fighter jet 
Russian vessels have already arrived at the drone crash site in the Black Sea, a U.S. defense official tells Fox News.

WNU Editor: Russian media is saying that the US MQ-9 drone crashed not far from major Russian naval bases. If true, I can then understand why Russian ships quickly arrived to the crash site. This region is also regarded as a war zone, so I would not be surprised if Russian military vessels were already in the region when the crash occurred.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: In the above video the Military Summary Channel breaks down the history of US drones always being in the area when Ukraine launched major strikes on targets in Crimea. It is a long list, and you have to wonder why Russia has done nothing until now to stop it. 
As to what is my take on this incident. It is hard to say because there is a lot of information that is still unknown. 
But what is known is that a US military drone, with its transponder turned off, was flying towards Crimea and had entered Russia's Air Identification Zone with no warning. Besides entering a region that Russia has designated as a war zone that all civilian aircraft are prohibited from flying in, it also ignored all air traffic control calls. Russian jets were then scrambled to intercept it, and the rest is history.]]></summary>

There is one big difference between this video and the one that the Pentagon released early this morning (link here). The skies are cloudy in the above video, but in the Pentagon video the skies are mostly clear. But this could be because the Russian jets followed the drone from a cloudy section of the Black Sea, to one where the clouds were dissipating. We just do not know.

I am sure both sides have more footage of this encounter, and we can hope that these videos will be made public soon.]]></summary>

North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) just hours before the leaders of South Korea and Japan were due to meet for landmark talks. 
Both Japanese and South Korean officials confirmed the long-range missile's launch on Thursday morning. 
It flew about 1,000km (620 miles) landing in waters west of Japan.  It is Pyongyang's fourth missile launch in a week and comes as the US and South Korea hold joint navy drills. 
The other missiles launched - last Thursday, on Saturday and on Monday - had been short-range ballistic missiles.

First Republic Bank, the San Francisco-based lender that was cut to junk by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings on Wednesday, is exploring strategic options including a sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 
The bank, which is also weighing options for shoring up liquidity, is expected to draw interest from larger rivals, said some of the people, all of whom requested anonymity discussing confidential information. No decision has been reached and the bank could still choose to remain independent, they said. 
A spokesperson for First Republic Bank declined to comment.  First Republic said Sunday that it had more than $70 billion in unused liquidity to fund operations from agreements that included the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Still, its stock fell 21% Wednesday in New York trading to a decade-low of $31.16, giving it a market value of $5.8 billion.

Mark Milley, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Celeste Wallander, attend a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Wednesday, March 15, 2023, at the Pentagon in Washington. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/Pool via AP) 
CNN: Austin says US will continue to fly drones over Black Sea and condemns Russian downing as ‘aggressive’ 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed on Wednesday that US aircraft will continue to “fly and to operate wherever international law allows,” one day after Russian aircraft hit a US drone over the Black Sea, forcing it to be brought down in international waters. 
“This hazardous episode is part of a pattern of aggressive, and risky, and unsafe actions in international airspace,” Austin said at the beginning of a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.

The Cradle: Saudi Arabia will cut oil supply of nations that impose price cap: Energy Minister  
The Saudi official also criticized efforts by US lawmakers to pass the NOPEC bill, which would allow sovereign states to be sued in federal court 
 Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on 14 March said that Riyadh will stop selling oil to any country that imposes a price cap on its supplies. 
“If a price cap were to be imposed on Saudi oil exports, we will not sell oil to any country that imposes a price cap on our supply, and we will reduce oil production, and I would not be surprised if others do the same,” the senior Saudi official said in an interview published by Energy Intelligence. 
Bin Salman stressed that price caps – whether imposed on a country or a group of countries – would lead to “individual or collective counter-responses with intolerable consequences in the form of massive volatility and instability.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Swiss National Bank says it will provide Credit Suisse with liquidity if necessary 
* A statement from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the SNB said that Credit Suisse “meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks” and that the central bank will step in if the situation changes. 
* Credit Suisse’s stock was under pressure after the disclosure of “material weakness” in financial reporting and the bank’s biggest backer saying it would not provide additional financing. 
* The American depositary receipts of Credit Suisse pared losses after the announcement from regulators. 
The Swiss National Bank said Wednesday that Credit Suisse  is currently well capitalized and that the central bank will provide additional liquidity if necessary, as regulators on both sides of the Atlantic tried to calm fears of a spreading crisis. 
A statement from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the SNB said that Credit Suisse “meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks” and that the central bank will step in if the situation changes. 
The regulators also said that the failure of two U.S. regional banks in the past week does not pose a “direct risk of contagion” to Swiss banks.

WNU Editor: As predicted by WNU earlier today .... Europe's Banking Crisis Worsening. Credit Suisse Shares Hit An All Time Low.
Credit Suisse is too big to fail, and it is failing. The Swiss Central Bank had to intervene. The last thing that the EU banking system needs right now is a liquidity crisis.    
Update #2: I disagree with the tweet below that was made yesterday by the German Chancellor. We should all be concerned and worried.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's coast guard entered the waters around disputed East China Sea islets on Wednesday to counter what it called the incursion of Japanese vessels into Chinese territorial waters. 
Disputed East China Sea islets claimed by China and Japan have long been a sticking point in bilateral ties. China calls the islands Diaoyu while Japan calls them Senkaku. 
China Marine Police spokesperson Gan Yu said in a statement that coast guard vessels entered the waters of the Diaoyu for a "normal rights protection patrol" calling it a "routine move".

The Kremlin said that relations with the US are 'lamentable' and at the lowest level after the US called out the reckless Russian pilots that downed the American Reaper drone into the Black Sea. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that there had been no high-level contact with Washington over the incident, but said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialog. 
The US military said on Tuesday that a Russian fighter plane had clipped the propeller of one of its spy drones as it flew over the Black Sea in international air space, causing it to fall into the water.

A 'suspicious object' has been discovered beneath the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Black Sea, Danish investigators have said. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said a ship rented by Russian energy company Gazprom had found an antenna-like object about 19 miles from where the Nord Stream pipelines exploded last year. 
He claimed that the object could be an explosive device as he warned that a new explosion could occur on the pipelines.

* US military said a Russian fighter jet clipped the propeller of the MQ-9 drone 
* Crash forced the US drone down over the Black Sea in a total loss of the aircraft 
The United States is in a race against time to find an American drone downed by a Russian fighter jet in the Black Sea before it falls into Moscow's hands, as fears mounted today that the war in Ukraine could escalate further. 
The MQ-9 Reaper drone crashed after being intercepted by two Russian fighter jets on Tuesday morning, in what US officials have said was a deliberate act to take it out the skies.

* He criticised Biden and said president was acting like 'a deer in the headlights' 
* Added that Russia knew they would get away with it because of US weakness 
Senator Lindsey Graham called for Biden to 'hold Russia accountable' for downing a US drone and threatened to shoot Putin's war planes if they approach American assets even over international waters. 
South Carolina GOP Senator Graham said the US should gun down Russian warplanes that approach an American asset in the airways over international waters after two Russian fighter jet pilots had forced down an unnamed US aerial vehicle (UAV) over the Black Sea yesterday, March 14. 
According to military officials, the Russian pilots repeatedly dumped fuel onto the drone and flew in front of it in a 'reckless' and 'professional' manner before a collision caused the American UAV to crash.

Russia has warned the United States to cease “hostile” activity near its border after the dramatic incident involving an American drone over the Black Sea. 
Ukraine said Wednesday that the episode — the first known direct confrontation between the two superpowers since the war began last year — illustrated the Kremlin’s desire to expand the conflict. 
A Russian fighter jet harassed and then collided with the propeller of an MQ-9 Reaper drone on Tuesday, forcing the U.S. to bring the drone down in international waters, the U.S. military said. 
Washington said it was a “brazen violation of international law” and summoned Moscow’s envoy to lodge a protest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Sunday, adding that he hoped the exchange would take place soon.
"Regarding the issue of prisoner swaps between Iran and the U.S. we have reached an agreement in the recent days and if everything goes well on the U.S. side, I think we will witness a prisoner exchange in a short period," Amirabdollahian said.
"On our part everything is ready, while the U.S. is currently working on the final technical coordination."
One of several Americans held in Iran is Siamak Namazi, a businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, who was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government.
Emad Sharghi, an Iranian-American businessman was first arrested in 2018 when he was working for a tech investment company, is also jailed in Iran, as is Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship.
Iranian sources told Reuters that two regional countries were involved in the series of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington for the release of prisoners.
For years, Tehran has sought the release of more than a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the glitz of Sunday's Oscars, the first Irish language film to earn a nomination is sparking renewed interest in a native tongue spoken by so few it is considered endangered by the United Nations cultural agency.
Competing for best international feature, "An Cailín Ciúin" (The Quiet Girl) last year became the first Irish language film to gross more than 1 million euros ($1.06 million) at the UK and Irish box office. It has remained a fixture in cinemas across English-speaking Ireland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court's powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.
As the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.
"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids," said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.
The protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.
National police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.
The now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and "will not yield to any political pressure on the matter".
Netanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.
"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister'," said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.

Greece has asked for others to imitate the Vatican Museums after they agreed this month to return three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon. London and Athens are in talks over the Parthenon Sculptures held by the British Museum.
The Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis in Athens, was completed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the goddess Athena, and its decorative friezes contain some of the greatest examples of ancient Greek sculpture.

The 20-year-old man suspected of keeping 11 people hostage in a pharmacy for five hours on Friday in Germany's south-western city of Karlsruhe has been taken into custody, authorities said on Saturday
According to the public prosecutor's office and the police, a judge issued an arrest warrant on charges of hostage-taking.

Day and night there are these attacks, Zelensky said in his nightly video message broadcast in Kiev on Saturday. "Rockets and artillery, drones and mortars: The vicious state uses a variety of weapons with the one goal of destroying life and leaving nothing human behind," Zelensky said.
"Ruins, rubble, craters where missiles hit are the self-portrait of Russia that it paints where life exists without Russia," the Ukrainian head of state said. The country stands for evil, he said. "It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment."
Zelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long considered side players, the key role of women in the Sicilian Mafia was highlighted by the arrest of Matteo Messina Denaro's sister, accused of managing his affairs while the mobster was a fugitive.
Rosalia Messina Denaro was arrested earlier this month not far from Palermo, where her godfather brother was caught on January 16 after 30 years on the run.
She is accused of issuing orders, keeping the books and transmitting secret messages for her sibling while he was in hiding.
For many years, women linked to the Cosa Nostra Mafia seemed born to become widows, portrayed in films as black-veiled Madonnas, leading funeral processions in sorrowful dignity.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China's premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity's sclerotic stock market.
Li's back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.
In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai's new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China's hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.

The four US citizens, two of whom died, were snatched at gunpoint after crossing the border into crime-plagued Tamaulipas state on Friday in a minivan, apparently so that one could have cosmetic surgery.
Tamaulipas prosecutor Irving Barrios said that a warrant had been executed for five people for the crimes of kidnapping and homicide.
They are the same five men who were found Thursday with their hands bound on a street in the city of Matamoros, apparently dumped by fellow members of the Gulf Cartel, a source in the prosecutor's office told AFP.

The body bags are carefully placed in hearses before being driven away and the man with the bouquet leaves with his flowers still in hand.

As reported by CBS News' Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a "bigger war" in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was "done" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while "America First" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow on Friday accused foreign countries of fomenting days of mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia's borders.
Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial "foreign agent" legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
