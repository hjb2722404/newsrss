        <updated>2023-04-06T17:03:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protesters started a fire at one of French President Emmanuel Macron's favorite restaurants in Paris on Thursday during clashes with riot police at the upmarket left-bank brasserie.
Staff at La Rotonde in the Montparnasse area of the city were forced to put out flames on the awning of the restaurant where Macron held a victory party during his successful 2017 election bid.
An AFP journalist saw a group of men dressed in black fire fireworks and throw stones in the direction of the eatery.
The fire was caused by a flare thrown on to the fabric awning, with firefighters needed to extinguish it.
Ranks of riot police formed to protect the business on the 11th day of national protests and strikes against Macron's widely unpopular bid to increase the retirement age to 64 from 62.
The red velour sofas and soft lighting of La Rotonde, a Belle Epoque hang-out once frequented by Picasso, have long been a favorite of Macron and his wife Brigitte.
The former investment banker held strategy meetings there as he prepared his bid for the presidency in 2017 and has been known to eat there with his wife since winning power.
In a decision criticized as elitist by his opponents at the time, Macron used La Rotonde to host staff and political allies for a party after he topped the first round of voting in 2017.
The restaurant has been targeted before because of its association with the 45-year-old president.
In 2020, during violent anti-government protests by so-called "Yellow Vests", a suspected arson attack left its entrance damaged.
"When there are marches and so on, you hear people saying 'Death to the Rotonde, Death to Macron'," Gerard Tafanel, who owns the bistro with his brother Serge, told AFP at the time.
"It happens all the time: anonymous phone calls, people who enter in the middle of the day saying 'Death to Macron'."

But in 1976 the French capital hosted the great man himself when his 3,000-year-old mummy was brought to Paris for a once-in-a-deathtime makeover.
The story of how France literally saved the skin of Ramses II, while hosting a major exhibition on his legendary rule at the Grand Palais museum, is one of the little-known chapters in Egyptology.
Then French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing convinced his Egyptian counterpart Anwar Sadat to temporarily part with the mummy by promising Ramses a reception "fit for a king".
And he meant it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sydney (AFP)  Forget the Hollywood thriller "Snakes on a Plane", an Australian man is in trouble for taking a platypus on a train.
Police launched a public appeal after the 26-year-old man, accompanied by a woman, was spotted on a suburban train with a wild platypus swaddled in a towel.
The man, who faces court Saturday over alleged animal protection offenses, is accused of removing the elusive critter from a waterway in northern Queensland and taking it on a train trip to a shopping centre.
"It will be further alleged the pair were observed showing the animal to members of the public at the shopping centre," Queensland police said in a statement.
Railway officers nabbed the man, and they have spoken to the woman who was with him, police said.
But the platypus' fate is a mystery.
"Police were advised the animal was released into the Caboolture River and has not yet been located by authorities," police said.
"Its condition is unknown."
CCTV photos from Tuesday showed a man in flip-flops strolling along a train platform north of Brisbane while cradling the platypus -- about the size of a kitten -- under his arm.
The man and his female companion then wrapped it in a towel, "patting it and showing it to fellow commuters", police said.
Under Queensland's conservation laws, it is illegal to take "one or more" platypus from the wild, with a maximum fine of Aus$430,000 (US$288,000).
"Taking a platypus from the wild is not only illegal, but it can be dangerous for both the displaced animal and the person involved if the platypus is male as they have venomous spurs," police said.
"If you are lucky enough to see a platypus in the wild, keep your distance."
With stubby tails like a beaver and the bill of a duck, platypuses were famously seen as a hoax by British scientists encountering their first specimen in the late 18th century.
Platypuses are native to Australia's freshwater rivers and are part of a rare group of mammals -- the monotremes -- that lay eggs.

"I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses and everyone to the negotiating table," the French head of state told Xi during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.
And in a joint statement following those talks, the two leaders reaffirmed their call for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow "as soon as possible".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) - There is no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl between China and Mexico, China's foreign ministry said on Thursday, responding to a letter from the Mexican president asking Beijing to help limit illicit flows of the deadly drug.
China has not been notified by Mexico about any seizure of fentanyl from China, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing.
"U.S. needs to face up to its own problems and take more substantive measures to strengthen regulation within its borders and reduce demand," Mao said, referring to drug abuse as a problem "made in the U.S.".
Mexico's president said on Tuesday he had written to Chinese president Xi Jinping, urging him to help control shipments of fentanyl as he fended off criticism in the U.S. that Mexico is not doing enough to stop trafficking of the synthetic opioid.
Fentanyl, widely used in hospitals during anaesthesia and for pain relief, has become a major black market narcotic in the United States. Mexican drug cartels have increasingly taken part in the illegal business.
Overdoses of the opioid killed more than 100,000 people in the 2022 U.S. fiscal year, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended in the March 22 letter efforts to curb supply of the drug, while rounding on U.S. critics, some of whom want Washington to intervene militarily in Mexico.
The letter and China's response did not mention supplies of the precursor chemicals used to make the powerful sedative.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says both finished fentanyl and precursors are transported from China to Mexico, the United State and Canada, often by international mail.

After years of hostility that fuelled conflicts across the Middle East, Tehran and Riyadh agreed to end their diplomatic rift and re-open embassies in a major deal facilitated by China last month.
Beijing's secret role in the breakthrough between Tehran and Riyadh shook up dynamics in the Middle East, where the United States was for decades the main mediator, flexing its security and diplomatic muscles.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Poland for its "historic" help in rallying Western support for Ukraine during a visit to Warsaw and said Ukrainian troops were still fighting for Bakhmut in the east but could withdraw if they risked being cut off.
Poland has provided vital weaponry to Kyiv since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year and taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees. During Zelenskiy's visit, Warsaw announced it would send 10 more MiG fighter jets to Kyiv on top of four provided earlier. 
Polish President Andrzej Duda said Warsaw was also working to secure additional security guarantees for Ukraine at a NATO summit to be held in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July.

The show at the capital's Design Museum features hundreds of thousands of objects collected by the Chinese artist since the 1990s, from Stone Age tools to Lego bricks, and draws on his love of artefacts and traditional craftsmanship.

Nikkei Asia: China weighs export ban for rare-earth magnet tech

 
Beijing looks to strike back after Washington's chip restrictions 
BEIJING -- China is considering prohibiting exports of certain rare-earth magnet technology in a move that would counter the U.S.'s advantage in the high-tech arena. Officials are planning amendments to a technology export restriction list, which was last updated in 2020. 
The revisions would either ban or restrict exports of technology to process and refine rare-earth elements. There are also proposed provisions that would prohibit or limit exports of alloy tech for making high-performance magnets derived from rare earths.

In all, there are 43 amendments or additions in the draft list first announced in December by the commerce and technology ministries. 
Officials have finished taking public comments from experts, and the changes are expected to go into force this year.

High performance magnets are used in a wide range of applications, such as motors for electric vehicles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marketwatch: Here’s what is really behind OPEC+ oil-production cuts, say energy analysts 
An unexpected production cut announced on Sunday by OPEC+ oil producers complicates strained relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with investors seeing signs of geopolitical posturing in the decision. 
However, some market analysts contend the cuts were less about sending a message to Washington and more about stabilizing oil prices amid fears of recession, as well as protecting the supply and demand balances. 
Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday announced they would slash a further combined 1.16 million barrels per day of oil production from May until the end of 2023. Russia, stinging from price caps and embargoes on its energy products as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, said it would extend its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut through year-end. Together OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, make up the group known as OPEC+.

 
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The US was caught completely off-guard by this OPEC+ decision to cut oil production. This is a surprise because China, India, and a few other big oil consumers were given a heads-up that this was going to happen. 
I see this as another indication on how strained U.S. - Saudi ties have become, and how furious the Saudis are with the Biden administration's determination to bring down the price of oil via through price caps and selling America's strategic oil reserve on the open markets. 
Bottom line. 
Expect $100/barrel in the coming months, and a return to higher gas prices by this summer .... Gas prices will surge in coming weeks after OPEC cuts production, analysts say (FOX News).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sarcophagus of Ramses II left Egypt for the first time in 1976 for France, where the mummy was treated against fungal decay.
Now the ancient Egyptian ruler is back in France to go on display in Paris as part of the travelling exhibition "Ramses and the Gold of the Pharaohs."
The exhibition, which has already stopped in San Francisco and Houston in the US, is the only site where the sarcophagus will join the tour.
France greatly appreciates this trust by Egypt, said French Minister Rima Abdul Malak on Monday at the unveiling of the sarcophagus.
The fact that it is back in Paris after more than 40 years is also proof of the excellent relationship between the two countries, she added.
The wooden coffin was taken out of a high-security transport crate at the Grande Halle de la Villette, where it will be the highlight of the exhibition from April 7 onwards.
Until September 6, over 180 objects from the reign of Ramses will be presented, including royal masks, statues and jewellery. Ramses II is considered one of the most important pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.
He was born around 1303 BC and died in 1213 BC. Ruling for 66 years, he was one of the longest reigning heads of state in the world. He had numerous palaces and temples built, such as the temple complex of Abu Simbel.
In 1976, the sarcophagus was received like a head of state - with a red carpet and much pomp. While the wooden coffin was on display in the Grand Palais in Paris, scientists treated the mummy with radiation against its increasing decay caused by bacteria and moisture.]]></summary>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday traveled to Poland, marking his first formal visit to Warsaw since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February. 
“A meeting of neighbors, a meeting of allies, a meeting of partners, a meeting of friends,” Zelensky said in a Telegram post, accompanied by a photo of the Ukrainian president shaking hands with Polish President Andrzej Duda. “For the sake of our nations. For their future.”

WNU Editor: A lot of speculation floating around on this visit. My gut tells me that Zelensky traveled to Warsaw to engage in talks on the upcoming spring offensive, and Poland's growing role in the Russia - Ukraine war. Because of the sensitivity of these discussions, the decision was made to have face to face talks to avoid any possibility of Russia intercepting their communications. 
But in this backdrop of these discussions, there are growing problems in the Polish - Ukraine relationship .... Zelenskyy’s Warsaw visit overshadowed by political blowup (Politico).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, former President Bill Clinton said that he feels personally responsible for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, due to his role in convincing Kyiv to surrender nuclear weapons in the aftermath of the Cold War, Newsweek reported. 
"I feel a personal stake because I got them [Ukraine] to agree to give up their nuclear weapons," Clinton said "None of them believe that Russia would have pulled this stunt if Ukraine still had their weapons," he said.
As Newsweek points out,  in 1994 Ukraine gave up the stockpile of nuclear weapons it had collected since the Cold War. "...some experts have disputed whether nuclear weapons remaining in Ukraine would have diverted the course of the current war," Newsweek's report stated. "Clara Guest, a research assistant in proliferation finance at King's College London, U.K. wrote in March 2022 that 'Ukraine would never have been able to maintain its nuclear weapons and facilities or manufacture and produce new components' given the lack of funds for the newly-independent country."
Clinton went on to say that he knew Russian President Vladimir Putin "did not support the agreement [then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin] made never to interfere with Ukraine's territorial boundaries—an agreement he made because he wanted Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons." 
"When it became convenient to him, President Putin broke it and first took Crimea," Clinton said. "And I feel terrible about it because Ukraine is a very important country."]]></summary>

Emmanuel Macron has arrived in China for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who dominated politics for decades, was in intensive care on Wednesday for heart problems, a member of his entourage told AFP.
The 86-year-old media mogul and senator, who has been in and out of the hospital in recent years, is currently in Milan's San Raffaele Hospital, the source said.
Italian news agency Ansa said he was admitted early Wednesday and that his current condition was "stable".
Berlusconi, the billionaire leader of the right-wing Forza Italia party, spent four days last month at the same hospital for what Italian news reports called heart issues, before being discharged on March 30.
After dominating Italian politics for two decades, the "Cavaliere" as he is widely known in Italy, now appears visibly diminished on the rare occasions he is seen in public.
Long gone are the days of his infamous erotic "bunga bunga" parties with young starlets, which he has always insisted were nothing more than elegant dinners.
Berlusconi was in hospital for 11 days for Covid-related pneumonia in September 2020, after contracting the virus while on holiday in Sardinia, describing it as "perhaps the most difficult ordeal of my life."
The following year, Covid-related complications caused a series of hospital stays.
Berlusconi, who served as prime minister three times after entering politics in 1994, had open heart surgery in 2016 and surgery on his intestine three years later.
Forza Italia is a member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition government, although the party attracts only about 10 percent of voters.
Berlusconi won a seat in Italy's Senate during general elections in September, nine years after he was kicked out from the upper house of parliament after a conviction on tax fraud.

Defense News: Macron sends $438 billion military budget plan to French parliament 
STUTTGART, Germany — France’s government is pouring hundreds of billions of euros into shoring up its military apparatus via its newest military programming law, which, if enacted, would support new capability efforts and ongoing programs through the end of the decade. 
Officials unveiled the proposed 2024-2030 military programming law (LPM) on April 4, ahead of presenting it to France’s legislative bodies. 
The five-year programming law has been in development since spring 2022, and was honed during top-level meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, said Army Col. Yann Latil, director of the ministry’s strategic capability cell, during an April 3 media briefing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French unions Wednesday said a last-ditch meeting with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne seeking to ease tensions over a divisive pension reform was a "failure" after she refused to revoke the changes.
President Emmanuel Macron is facing the biggest challenge of his second term over his flagship pension overhaul, which includes hiking the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64.
Unrest erupted across the country after Borne on March 16 invoked a controversial executive order to ram the bill through parliament without a vote despite months of mass protests against it.
Unions warned ahead of Wednesday's meeting with Borne that they would storm out if she refused to discuss going back on a minimum retirement age of 64.
"It's clearly a failure when the prime minister won't even allow a way in to that discussion," said Cyril Chabanier, speaking on behalf of the country's eight main unions after barely an hour-long meeting.
"We again told the prime minister that the only democratic outcome could be the text's withdrawal. The prime minister replied that she wished to maintain the text, a grave decision," he added.
He and other union heads called for French people to take to the streets and strike en masse on Thursday during an 11th day of coordinated nationwide action against the bill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Rescue teams made final checks on Wednesday for anyone still trapped in an avalanche that swept down on a road in the Indian Himalayan state of Sikkim the day before, killing seven people.
Rescue teams pulled 20 survivors from the snow that engulfed the road to the Nathu La pass, between Sikkim and the Chinese region of Tibet, before calling off their search as bad weather closed in and darkness fell on Tuesday evening.
"Rescue operations have resumed this morning because we want to make sure that we haven't left anyone behind. We will scour the area properly before we call them off," Tenzing Loden Lepcha, a police official in the northeastern state, told Reuters by telephone.
Avalanches have killed at least 120 people in the Indian Himalayas over the past two years.
A study in the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded in 2018 that climate change had increased avalanche risks in the Himalayas.
The cause of Tuesday's disaster were not immediately clear.
Tourists flock to Sikkim, located below Mount Khangchendzonga, also known as Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world.
Nathu La serves is a route for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage to Mount Kailash in China, considered one of the holiest pilgrimages in Hinduism.

PJ Media: Pentagon Study: 77 Percent of Military-Age Americans Too Fat, Mentally Ill for Service 
According to a recent Pentagon study, the state of America’s youth is not conducive to military service. 
Via American Military News:

    
A Pentagon study revealed that 77 percent of young Americans do not qualify for military service without a waiver due to being overweight, drug use, or mental or physical problems.
“When considering youth disqualified for one reason alone, the most prevalent disqualification rates are overweight (11 percent), drug and alcohol abuse (8 percent), and medical/physical health (7 percent),” the Pentagon’s 2020 Qualified Military Available Study of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 read.

Update: 77% of young Americans too fat, mentally ill, on drugs and more to join military, Pentagon study finds (American Military News).

 
WNU Editor: To be fair. This has been a problem for a long time. Here is a study from 2013 saying basically the same thing .... Pentagon Says More Than Half Of The US Military Is Overweight (Business Insider).]]></summary>

Costa runs one of 52 "solidarity kitchens" launched in Brazil by Gastromotiva, a charitable organization that provides volunteers in poor communities with culinary training, ingredients and a mission: not just feed the hungry, but delight their palates and bring some happiness to those who need it most.

Paredes is one of 17 children aged six to 14 -- one of them a girl -- learning the tricks of the bullfighting trade at a torero school in Merida, a city in the Venezuelan Andes where the tradition persists despite protests by animal rights campaigners.
One day "I want to leave (the ring) through the big door as a great bullfighter," the boy told AFP.
It is in Cesar's blood: his older brother is a bullfighter and their pursuit is encouraged by their mother, an avid fan of the controversial pastime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fresh images from inside a crippled reactor at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant revealed heavy damage to its foundation and significant debris, its operator said.
Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) on Tuesday released a series of video clips from a robotic survey inside Fukushima Daiichi plant's Reactor 1, one of three that suffered core meltdowns in 2011.
"There were areas that we could not see. But we believe (damage) is spread across large areas," a TEPCO official told a briefing.
The video showed damaged concrete walls exposing steel rods embedded inside, with debris piled roughly 50 centimetres (20 inches) high.
The video illustrated the daunting task ahead to decommission the plant after it was hit by a huge tsunami triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake.
TEPCO and the government expect to spend 30 to 40 years removing molten fuel from the facility and cleaning the area.
Similar video surveys have been conducted in the two other reactors that went into meltdown.
The new video comes as local residents voice worries about the safety of the precarious structure in an earthquake-prone region.
Fukushima governor Masao Uchibori pressed TEPCO to conduct an earthquake resistance evaluation for the facility to ensure the safety of the project to dismantle the plant.
"Because of the high radiation levels inside the reactors, I understand that robots that use semiconductors do not function as well as they are designed," he told his regular press conference on Monday.
"The biggest and most difficult task is the removal of the debris (molten fuel). We demand TEPCO and the government carry out the decommissioning project safely and steadily."
TEPCO has said it will conduct a seismic resistance survey in a few months, but previous surveys have indicated that the facility remains relatively stable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Racism has been experienced by players at all levels of elite rugby in England, according to a survey published by the Rugby Football Union.
It comes as an independent investigation found that former England centre Luther Burrell was the victim of racial abuse during his time at English top-flight club Newcastle.
Burrell, who is of Jamaican descent, said he was subjected to comments about slavery, bananas and fried chicken, adding that "racial banter" had become "normalised" among team-mates.
The investigation said Burrell's claims were true "on the balance of probability", finding that his evidence was "reliable".
RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney said Burrell's revelations had prompted Twickenham to fast-track implementation of a strategy to promote inclusivity.
"Luther was very brave to come forward and share his experiences of racism and classism in the game and he has the continued support of the union," Sweeney said.
"We must be clear that racism, classism or any form of discrimination has no place in rugby."
Research commissioned last year by the RFU, Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players' Association found that racism remains widespread.
"In every area of elite rugby -- men's and women's, national team, clubs and academies -- players had experienced some form of racism," the study, published late Tuesday, said.
It found that classism continues to cloud rugby and "fuels an elitist perception".
The three rugby bodies have published an "inclusion and diversity" plan for the elite game.
"There's no place for racism in our society or the game of rugby," said Premiership Rugby chief executive Simon Massie-Taylor.
"We understand the issues around us and have pledged to educate our game and implement change through the action plan that has been announced.
"As part of the action plan we can confirm that mandatory training will involve all players, coaches and staff at Premiership Rugby clubs -- starting before the end of the season."

Ardern, who thanked her family, her political party and her supporters, had stepped down as prime minister in January saying she had "no more in the tank" to lead the country.
She had burst onto the global scene in 2017 when she became the world's youngest female head of government at age 37. She gained further international attention when she took her baby to a United Nations meeting.

“Then our give up on energy independence and even energy dominant –our raging crime statistics if you look in Democrat-run cities, numbers the likes of which we’ve never seen before, the open threats by various countries of the use of nuclear weapons.”]]></summary>

According to Front Line Defenders' annual global analysis, at least 401 human rights defenders (HRDs) in 26 countries were victims of targeted killings in 2022, up from 358 people murdered in 35 countries the previous year.

The report notes that five countries—Colombia, Ukraine, Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras—accounted for over 80% of HRD murders in 2022, with Colombia alone accounting for 46% of the total with at least 186 killings documented and verified. Indigenous and environmental defenders made up 48% of last year's victims.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
