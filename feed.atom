And I found, to my surprise, that learning about baby equipment forced me to learn more about babies themselves – what they like, what they don’t like, to how old they grow and come out of certain behaviors.  As my due date approached, I felt more prepared and less unhappy than many other future dads I met in our birthing classes, many of whom had outsourced equipment decisions to their wives.

They have overcome boardroom clashes, investor power struggles and regulatory landmines.
But this summer, some of them encountered their most threatening adversary yet: multi-family townhouses.
Their battle took place in one of the most exclusive and affluent cities in Silicon Valley: Atherton, California., a 4.9 square mile enclave just north of Stanford University with a population of 7,500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a long-term gamble on liquid natural gas, but it paid off and turned the United States into a major exporter of fossil fuels.
Journalist Jake Bittle delves into the career of Charif Souki, the Lebanese-American entrepreneur whose appetite for risk changed the course of America’s energy sector.
The article describes how Mr. Souki went from restaurant owner in Los Angeles to co-founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy, an oil and gas company specializing in liquefied natural gas, and provides insight into his process of reflection: “According to Souki,” writes Mr. Bittle, “the need to provide energy to the world in the short term outweighs the long-term demand to act on carbon emissions”.


At a time of acute climate anxiety, Mr. Souki’s rationale might seem outdated, even brazen.  The world may be facing energy and climate crises, Mr Souki told The New York Times, “but one is going to happen this month, and the other is 40 years from now.”


“If you tell someone, ‘You’re going to run out of power this month,’ and then you tell the same person about what’s going to happen 40 years from now,” he said, “they say, ‘What do you care about in 40 years?’  »

“I went to review my membership at The Shed, and they said I had to come to this event tonight.  They said I looked great.  That’s how it is in New York.  – Michael Anthony Pegues at the shed

In other words, the clay would be a bad choice.  This is where the term feet of clay comes from, connoting a weak foundation, a flaw that could bring down a person of honor.  Which brings us to Fernando Tatis Jr.
When the San Diego Padres signed Tatis to a 14 years, $340 million contract in February 2021, he matched the boldness of their investment with an equally bold statement: “I want the statue.”  Then Tatis led the National League in home runs and nearly won the Most Valuable Player award, all before his 23rd birthday.

Elon Musk: US ‘passed peak inflation’ after Tesla sold 90% of Bitcoin

The flowers that a family had brought were beginning to wilt.  The babies were crying.  The crowd was huddled in the shade, greetings and laughter alternating with silence, their excitement cut by the tension.

Hanna Oneshchak, 12, on accordion, accompanied the other seven as they sang a Ukrainian folk song, “Ta nema toho Mykyty”, about a man who decides to leave the country to seek a better job, but looks then towards the mountains and, struck by their beauty, changes his mind.


“Whatever sorrow we have”, they sang in Ukrainian, “I will not go to American soil”.
The children, students of the Open-Minded Kids Studio theater school in Lviv, were rehearsing the song ahead of two weekend performances of the play ‘Mama Po Skaipu’ (‘Mom on Skype’) at the Irondale Center in Brooklyn.  It will be the American premiere of the 80-…]]></summary>

These are concerns that are, in essence, legal, but really more philosophical and moral.  Acknowledging a source of inspiration, direct or indirect, is good business practice but also, in the age of internet-centric hyperresponsibility, something akin to playing offense as well as defense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the pandemic closings hit the real estate sector, showings were halted, homes were taken off the market and municipal offices that process closing documents were closed.  As a result, in March 2020, almost 18% of purchase contracts in the United States were canceled – although it took only a few months to return to normal levels.
But in 2022, the frequency of canceled transactions started to rise again, reaching almost 15% in June – the highest rate since the peak of the pandemic, according to a recent report by red finwhich represents approximately 60,000 failed home sales across the country.
The likely culprit: rising mortgage interest rates.  The journey between the accepted offer and the closing day can take up to two months or more, and interest rates sometimes change in the meantime.  Buyers can lock in rates for certain periods, but not all do, and even a small increase can stretch monthly payments out of reach and kill a deal.  And the rate increases this year have been substantial.  Consider, for example, that the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose from 3.79% in January to 5.3% in July.  This change would increase a monthly payment approximately $90 for every $100,000 borrowed.


The places with the highest percentage of deals failed in June – including many in the south and southwest – are among the most popular with buyers.  In Las Vegas, just over 27% of trades failed in June, the highest rate of any market, according to Redfin.  Preferred Florida destinations followed, including Lakeland, Florida at just under 27% and Cape Coral, Florida at just under 26%.


This week’s chart shows the US metropolitan markets where the highest share of trades failed in June.

I’m a librarian in my late twenties, and due to a wave of retirements, I’ve risen through the ranks very quickly.  My supervisors like me and I recently applied and was offered a job that puts me in charge of my own library.  It’s just another person and myself working there.  The other librarian has been in the business almost as long as I’ve been alive, and I know she applied for the job.
It created some awkwardness and that’s something we didn’t discuss.  We barely talk to each other.  She was very surprised and upset that she was not chosen for the job.  I think she can eve…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the summer sun is blazing, the mere idea of ​​turning on the oven – even for the most wonderful dish – is revolting.  Sure, you might have air conditioning, but why heat the kitchen if it’s not necessary?  (You came inside to escape the stickiness and sweat!) You could cleverly put together a salad or put together a meal without cooking – and we have so many beautiful ones here and here – but ultimately, you’re going to want a hot meal.  Enter the slow cooker.
The recipes below are the simplest type of slow cooker recipe, the fix and forget type.  There’s no pre-searing or sautéing, and very little prep.  Just throw the ingredients in the slow cooker and let it simmer while you head to the beach or to work, or just curl up with a good book in front of the air conditioner.  A few hours…]]></summary>

Then on Friday, New York City health officials announced they had found the virus in sewage samples, suggesting polio was likely circulating in the city again. 
Parents of young children have wondered —  perhaps for the first time in their lives and collectively for the first time in generations — how worried they should be about polio.
Anabela Borges, a designer who lives in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood, said she has friends whose children are likely unvaccinated.  After Friday’s announcement, she said she planned to “raise awareness among her friends.”

About three hours from Manhattan and accessible by short car ferry from Greenport or North Haven, the 8,000-acre island is bordered by the Peconic River to the west and Gardiners Bay to the east.

Her Seattle Storm teammate Natasha Howard had preceded her as a wide receiver, as she usually did whenever Bird was leading the offense in transition.  Howard realized it was open under the basket and stiffened.  Bird, she knew, would find her as always.  She just didn’t know how.
Bird slipped into the lane, drawing in a defender.  Then, without looking, she whipped the ball above his head and in Howard’s waiting palms.
