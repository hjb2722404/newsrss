Finnish authorities raised a ship anchor on Tuesday from the seafloor in the area where an underwater gas pipeline was damaged earlier this month, saying a Hong Kong-flagged vessel appears to have caused the incident. 
The National Bureau of Investigation displayed pictures at a news conference of what it said was a 6-ton anchor that appears to be missing one of its arms, potentially belonging to the Hong Kong-flagged vessel “Newnew Polar Bear.” 
An investigation is proceeding into whether the damage was intentional, officials told reporters in Vantaa, just outside of Helsinki.

Sweden welcomes the move, though the length of the Turkish approval process remains unclear. 
BRUSSELS — The Turkish government on Monday submitted Sweden's NATO accession bid to the country's parliament for ratification, ending a months-long guessing game over whether Ankara intended to postpone its approval process further.
"The Protocol on Sweden's NATO Accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey," the presidency posted on social media platform X. 
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson hailed the move. Welcome that President Erdoğan signed Sweden’s ratification protocol to NATO and submitted it to the Grand National Assembly of [Turkey]. Parliamentary procedures will now commence. We are looking forward to becoming a member of NATO," his office posted on the same platform.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Washington this week, the State Department said Monday, the highest-level visit by a Chinese official since tensions spiked early this year after a Chinese spy balloon floated across American airspace. 
The three days of meetings, starting Thursday, are the latest sign that Beijing is laying the groundwork for a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in San Francisco next month, which would be his first trip to the United States since 2017.

WNU Editor: There is a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in San Francisco next month, a summit that a Chinese leader would usually attend. But my gut is telling me that President Xi will not attend this summit even though the media is saying otherwise .... A top Chinese diplomat will visit Washington ahead of a possible meeting between Biden and Xi (AP). Current U.S. - China relations are in the toilet, and the leadership do not want to give any credit to the Biden administration, and they certainly do not want to meet President Biden. 
But in the event that President Xi does go to the US next month, I will see this as a signal that the Chinese are seeing the entire global order unraveling, and are making this trip as a last attempt to reverse this deterioration of global relations.

USA Today: Poll: Americans overwhelmingly back aid to Israel and Ukraine but split on US role in the world

 
The debate over military aid and global leadership has opened a generation gap and a partisan divide, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk poll finds. 
Most Americans support sending additional military aid to Israel and Ukraine, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but a divide is deepening between those who see U.S. global leadership as crucial and those who want to pull back from the world to focus on problems at home instead. 
The survey found double-digit support for aid to Israel in its battle against the terrorist group Hamas, 58%-35%, and majority support for sending more aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, 51%-43%. 
Additional military aid to Taiwan, which faces a continuing threat from China, was backed by a smaller margin, 43%-39%. 
The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Oct. 17-20 by landline and cell phone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Top spokesperson laughs off media reports that Russian president is seriously ill. 
The Kremlin has brushed off claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ill, after speculative media reports that he’d suffered a cardiac arrest.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also dismissed speculation that Putin has used body doubles to cover for him in public appearances. 
“Talk of Vladimir Putin’s health problems is another canard,” Peskov said, according to Russian state-owned news agency Ria.ru, adding that “everything is fine with him.”

The stakes are high, given the tensions following Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Biden administration is preparing for the possibility that hundreds of thousands of American citizens will require evacuation from the Middle East if the bloodshed in Gaza cannot be contained, according to four officials familiar with the U.S. government’s contingency planning. 
The specter of such an operation comes as Israeli forces, aided by U.S. weapons and military advisers, prepare for what is widely expected to be a perilous ground offensive against Hamas militants responsible for the stunning cross-border attack that has reignited hostilities. 
The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail internal deliberations, said Americans living in Israel and neighboring Lebanon are of particular concern, though they stressed that an evacuation of that magnitude is considered a worst-case scenario and that other outcomes are seen as more likely.

Axios: Scoop: Marine Corps 3-star general advising Israeli military on Gaza ground operation 
The Biden administration recently sent a Marine three-star general and several other U.S. military officers to Israel to help advise the Israeli military's leadership in its operation in Gaza, according to two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials briefed on the issue.

 
Why it matters: The move reflects the Biden administration's deep involvement in the war in Gaza and how much visibility it has in Israel's military planning. 
Behind the scenes: The Marine Corps officers sent include Lt. Gen. James Glynn, according to a senior Israeli official. Glynn previously headed the Marines' special operations and was involved in the operations against ISIS in Iraq.

The number of people killed in Gaza has exceeded 5,000 according to latest reports from de facto authorities there, amid intensifying Israeli airstrikes in response to Hamas attacks, while humanitarians repeated urgent calls for a ceasefire and more aid convoys. 
Echoing that message, UN health agency (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus issued a new appeal on Monday for “sustained safe passage” for medical essentials and fuel to keep health facilities open. 
“Lives depend on these decisions,” he insisted on social platform X.

Latest media reports citing the Gaza Ministry of Health indicate that the number of people killed in Gaza since 7 October has risen to 5,087.

Women and children have made up more than 62 per cent of the fatalities, while more than 15,273 people have been injured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a press conference in Israel on Monday, Cohen noted that he was both an American and Israeli citizen. And he thanked Graham for supporting Israel. Graham is in Israel as part of a bipartisan US Senate delegation.

	"But it starts at home," Cohen said. "And I'd like to ask any Democrat senator here that would like to speak to Rashida Tlaib. She still has a tweet up condemning Israel for a hospital attack."
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

	"We are here together, not to talk about the problems at home, which are many," Graham shot back.


	"You're not going to screw this up!" Graham shouted.


	"Get this guy out of here!" Graham exclaimed.


	"I'm an American," Graham said, pounding on the podium.

	"And I believe in free speech," Graham continued. "I don't believe what the squad has to say at all. But I came here with Democrats and Republicans to let everybody in the world know."


	Graham later apologized after his temper cooled.

KYIV — The cluttered car carrying a mother and her 12-year-old daughter seemed barely worth the attention of Russian security officials as it approached a border checkpoint. 


But the least conspicuous piece of luggage — a crate for a cat — was part of an elaborate, lethal plot. Ukrainian operatives had installed a hidden compartment in the pet carrier, according to security officials with knowledge of the operation, and used it to conceal components of a bomb. 


Four weeks later, the device detonated just outside Moscow in an SUV being driven by the daughter of a Russian nationalist who had urged his country to “kill, kill, kill” Ukrainians, an explosion signaling that the heart of Russia would not be spared the carnage of war.

Final results show sizeble gains for the far-right Swiss People’s Party, and important losses for the Greens. 
The far-right and euroskeptic Swiss People’s Party (SVP) came out as a clear leader in Switzerland’s national elections, according to final results released late Sunday. 
The SVP, which has centered its campaign on anti-immigrant rhetoric in an election dominated by domestic issues, has won 28.6 percent of the vote in the Parliament’s lower chamber, the National Council — up from 25.6 percent four years ago — winning 62 seats, nine more than in 2019. 
While the centrist The Center party maintained its score at 14.6 percent (29 seats), the liberal FDP party suffered a small loss, losing one seat.

Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza following Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an open warning against Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon, discouraging them from invading Israel as his country is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza. 
The expected ground invasion follows Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities.

While visiting troops in northern Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu said if Hezbollah were to launch a war and invade Israel, "it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating."

The Biden administration has pressed Israel to delay its imminent invasion of Gaza to allow for the release of more hostages held by Hamas and for aid to reach Gaza, according to two sources briefed on the discussions. 
The release of two Americans held by Hamas Friday signaled that more of roughly 200 people believed to be kidnapped by the militant group may be freed after they were taken during the group’s deadly attacks launched against Israel two week ago. 
“The [administration] pressed Israeli leadership to delay because of progress on the hostage front,” and the need to get trucks of aid into Gaza, one person familiar with the discussions said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is pushing for a major American foreign policy change in his second administration that would likely upend decades of global national security infrastructure.
Sources tell Rolling Stone that Trump is planning to pull the United States entirely out of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance unless it caves to his demands that include one that would seem to undermine the entire purpose of the alliance.
In addition to his standard calls for other NATO countries to chip in more for their defense spending, Trump also reportedly wants to rip up the strategic doctrine that an attack on one NATO country represents an attack on all NATO countries.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"When he was in office, Trump would repeatedly scoff at this collective-defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, known as Article 5," the publication writes. "One former senior administration official recalls to Rolling Stone a moment in the Oval Office in mid-2018 when the then-president started reading from a written list of smaller NATO countries, some of which he argued most Americans had never even heard of before."
Tearing up Article 5 would be a major boon for the likes of Russia, which attacked non-NATO member Ukraine in 2022 but notably has not attacked other NATO members on its border such as Estonia and Latvia.
Dr. Aaron Stein, a Black Sea Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, tells Rolling Stone that Trump's plan would be a "tremendously stupid endeavor" and added that "trading away allies based on ignorance, and Trump is ignorant about this issue, is just silly for broader U.S. national security."]]></summary>

With tensions mounting, Washington also announced Sunday it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq.
"We are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks against our own personnel, our own people," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS News. "We expect there is a likelihood of escalation."
"No one should take advantage of this moment to escalate to further attacks on Israel or, for that matter, attacks on us on our personnel."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The organiser of the Web Summit, one of the tech sector's leading events, announced his resignation Saturday following a backlash over his online posts following the Hamas attacks on Israel.
"Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event," Paddy Cosgrave of Ireland explained in a brief statement sent to AFP.
"I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused," added the co-founder of the tech mega gathering created in 2009 in Dublin but held in Lisbon since 2016.
A spokesperson for the organization said: "Web Summit will appoint a new CEO as soon as possible, and Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon will go ahead as planned."
This year's edition from November 13 to 16, is set to bring together some 2,300 startups and more than 70,000 participants, say organizers.
Several companies, including tech giants Google and Meta, which is behind Facebook and Instagram, as well as event headliners have announced they are boycotting the gathering since Cosgrave's remarks.
He had written on X, formerly Twitter, that he was "shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments" in support of Israel.
"War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are," he wrote on October 13.
Since shock Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, which left 1,400 dead, Israel has launched devastating air and ground bombardments of Gaza. The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.
The boycott by Meta and Google followed other exits by companies and tech figures, including Intel, Siemens and US comedian Amy Poehler and X-Files actor Gillian Anderson.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A first anniversary in office is normally a moment for a leader to celebrate, but Britain's Rishi Sunak hits the milestone this week with a mountain to climb to retain power in a general election expected next year.

Two by-election losses to the main opposition Labour Party on Thursday underscored how Sunak, 43, has failed to revive the Conservatives' beleaguered fortunes during his first 12 months in charge.
"The more people see of Sunak, the less they like him in some ways," Tim Bale, author of a book about the right-wing Conservatives since Brexit, told AFP.
"He doesn't really project authority, he doesn't necessarily give the impression that he's in control of events.
"He looks, in part, as if he's sort of lurching from one policy initiative to another in a desperate attempt to curry …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: 'I am a Zionist': How Joe Biden's lifelong bond with Israel shapes war policy 

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Joe Biden met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet during his visit to Israel, the U.S. president assured them: "I don't believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, and I am a Zionist." 
The politicians and generals gathered in the ballroom of the Tel Aviv hotel nodded in approval, according to a U.S. official knowledgeable of the closed-door remarks, even as Israel bombarded Gaza in retaliation for a devastating attack by Palestinian Hamas militants and with a ground invasion looming. 
Biden, who is of Irish Catholic descent, has used similar words in the past to profess his affinity for Israel. But the moment, which has not been previously reported, illustrates how Biden's decades as one of the leading "Friends of Israel" in American politics seem to be guiding him during a defining crisis of his presidency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aboriginal Australian leaders ended their vow of silence on Monday to denounce millions of their compatriots for rejecting a landmark push for Indigenous rights, saying that the referendum result would be "etched into Australia's history forever".
Simmering racial divisions were exposed earlier this month when just over 60 percent of Australians voted against a referendum to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders within the 1901 constitution.
In the wake of the result, many Indigenous leaders embarked on a "week of silence", asking for time to grieve what they saw as a crushing rejection at the hands of Australia's white majority.
Some leaders ended that silence in a scathing open letter addressed to the government, criticizing the "appalling and mean-spirited" outlook of milli…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A teenage Iranian girl, who fell into a coma earlier this month following an alleged encounter with officers over violating the country’s hijab law, is said to be "brain dead", Iranian state media reported on Sunday.
"Follow-ups on the latest health condition of Armita Geravand indicate that her health condition as brain dead seems certain despite the efforts of the medical staff," the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said.
Iranian authorities have denied claims by rights groups that the 16-year-old was hurt after a confrontation on Oct. 1 with officers enforcing the mandatory Islamic dress code in the Tehran metro.

The report on Geravand could revive nationwide protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini last year in the custody of morality police.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Norma slammed into Mexico's northwestern coast Saturday afternoon as a Category 1 storm, bringing dangerous rain and flooding, authorities said.
The storm came ashore about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of the resort city of Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California coast, gradually weakening from a Category 3 as it approached land.
Norma was moving northeast at 9 kph, packing winds of up to 130 kph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported at 2100 GMT. 
Norma was expected to bring rainfall of up to 45 centimeters (18 inches), producing "flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain," the NHC said.
"Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions" would affect the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for the next couple of days.
Hotel employees in Cabo San Lucas urged guests to stay indoors until authorities give the all-clear, Gustavo Matamoros, a hotel worker, told AFP.
Local authorities say about 60,000 tourists are staying in the area, most of them international visitors.
Footage from Milenio TV showed flooded streets as Norma arrived. No casualties have been reported by authorities.
Norma should continue to weaken to a tropical storm as it moves toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday.
Two people died last week when Hurricane Lidia struck the western states of Jalisco and Nayarit.

Stars and Stripes: Nearly 70% of US troops are overweight or obese, research report says  
WASHINGTON — Almost seven out of every 10 U.S. troops are either overweight or obese, according to a new report, which also warns the growing trend could compromise military readiness and undermine national security. 
The American Security Project, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that studies modern national security issues, conducted the study and found 68% of active-duty service members fall somewhere between overweight and obese on the body mass index, which is a long-used but controversial method of assessing a person’s body classification by height and weight. 
A person between 25 and 30 on the BMI is considered clinically overweight and more than 30 is considered obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.

This comes after earlier this month, former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted. 

“If we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern, and every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” Republican Representative Michael McCaul said.

The decision to remove the sanctions clears the way for the Prime Minister to visit Beijing next month.

Mr Tyrrell said Chinese wine consumption has dropped by about 60 per cent because “they can’t get the wine that they really like to drink”.

“As more and more Chinese people have travelled over the last 10 years, they’ve got to know Australia, they like Australia, they like Australians and got a great taste for Australian wine, so we really need to be back in that market,” he told Sky News Australia.

FOX News: McConnell calls China, Russia, Iran new 'axis of evil' that US must deal with: 'This is an emergency' 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says Israel-Hamas war is a 'worldwide problem' posing 'immediate threat' to US

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Sunday deemed China, Russia and Iran the new "axis of evil" amid wars in Ukraine and Israel, while addressing U.S. funding of allies' responses to those duel conflicts. 
In a new sit-down interview with "Fox News Sunday" host Shannon Bream, McConnell, the highest-ranking Senate Republican, agreed with fellow Republican Kentuckian Sen. Rand Paul that the $1.5 trillion deficit is "entirely too big." 
But while Paul remarked last month that the U.S. under the Biden administration was borrowing heavily from China just to send aid to Ukraine, McConnell instead emphasized Sunday that the deficit also expanded during the prior administration under former President Donald Trump.

With tensions mounting, Washington also announced Sunday it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ABC News: US moves carrier to Middle East following attacks on US forces 
There have been incidents involving drone and rocket attacks on U.S. bases. 
The Pentagon announced late Saturday that it will send an aircraft carrier and air defense systems to defend U.S. military troops in response to a growing number of attacks on U.S. facilities, presumably by Iranian-backed groups as tensions mount amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. 
Additional U.S. military forces in the U.S. have also been placed in a higher state of readiness for a possible future deployment to the Middle East on short notice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A secret recording revealed by "60 Minutes Australia" exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. 
Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a "favor" for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do," admitting not only to the bribery but also that it's frequent behavior for him. 

"It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings," The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

 * Israel is now waging war on three fronts — the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and Syria. 
 * As the conflict spreads, the US is beefing up its military presence in the region. 
 * US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it was in response to "recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces." 
Following the Palestinian militant group Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on the group. 
Now, that conflict is spilling over into the neighboring countries of Lebanon and Syria as Israel ramps up airstrikes on the two Arab states. 
The US has sent more military assets to the region to bolster Israel's forces following what US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called "recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists at the University of Bristol have used supercomputer climate models to predict the formation of a future supercontinent called Pangea Ultima, which is expected to occur 250 million years from now. This continent will bring extreme temperatures, rendering it uninhabitable for mammals. The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth's climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.]]></summary>

Hamas fighters and Israeli forces engaged in limited clashes inside Gaza on Sunday as the Israeli military ramped up airstrikes on the Palestinian enclave ahead of what its spokesperson described as the “next stage” of its war on the militant group. 
Hamas claimed its fighters had destroyed two Israeli military bulldozers and a tank in an ambush near the Gazan city of Khan Younis, forcing Israeli troops to retreat without their vehicles. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed its forces had been operating inside Gaza during the incident, and said an IDF tank struck militants who had fired on its troops.

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?be allowed to run for office?


	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration's decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	"And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that's beyond the pale, isn't it?" the ABC host asked.


	"There's no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost," Scott opined.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
