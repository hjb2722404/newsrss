        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Game 3, the Celtics reclaimed that advantage.
“We had to do it,” Smart said of the physicality with which Boston outplayed Golden State.  “Match 2, they brought us the heat.  For us, it left a bad taste in our mouths because what we hang our hats on is defensive effort and being a physical team.
Golden State couldn’t match it, not long enough anyway.
Golden State outscored Boston by 43 points in the third quarter of this series and took the lead in Game 3, 83-82, on a 3-pointer from Curry.  This basket had followed a rapid sequence of 7 points without Boston taking possession.  Curry was fouled shooting a 3-pointer, and since the foul was flagrant, Golden State recovered the ball and scored another 3.
But late in the quarter, Golden State’s grip on the game slipped.
“Take the hits, keep fighting,” Williams said was the message in the group after the third quarter.  “Obviously they’re a great team that do runs, lots of runs, but just take the hit.”
Golden State couldn’t get through the defense or stop the Celtics from getting a second chance.  Hustle games usually went to Boston.
At one point in the fourth quarter, several players got tangled up on a loose ball, and Smart found it before Draymond Green pushed it.  It was Green’s sixth foul, and the crowd laughed at him after spending the night shouting curses at him.
Golden State’s Klay Thompson complained about fans swearing at “kids in the crowd.”
“Really classy.  Good job, Boston,” he said.

In the second period, Sergachev beat Igor Shesterkin from the good run in goal traffic to give the Lightning their first lead of the night.
Brandon Hagel added an empty-netter with 59 seconds left to seal the Lightning’s third straight win and first road win for a team in this series.  Tampa Bay goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 24 shots.


Ryan Lindgren scored for the Rangers, who had won eight straight playoff games at home after losing Game 1 of the first round to the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Shesterkin finished with 24 saves.

Should the NFL suspend Deshaun Watson, the quarterback who landed a $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns, even though he’s been accused of harassment and assault by an ever-growing list of massage therapists feminine?
Of course, the league could, and given the bucket of allegations, it wouldn’t be surprising if it did.  But should he?
If you go to the Browns message boards, scroll through Twitter, or just talk to women, a lot of people argue that Watson, the former Houston Texans quarterback, should never throw an NFL pass again.

The long hair is still there, even though the 100-mile-per-hour fastball has become a memory after two years lost to injury.  But during Syndergaard’s first year with the Los Angeles Angels, a new teammate helped reinvent the Texan into something decidedly more Californian.

Daily Mail: Inflation surges to new 41-year high of 8.6%: Groceries jump 12% and gasoline soars 49% as rising prices cause misery for consumers 
* The consumer price index rose 8.6% on May from a year ago, the fastest increase since December 1981 
* Increase was larger than economists expected and topped the recent peak set in March 
* Soaring food and energy prices drove the increase, with groceries up 11.9% and gasoline rising 48.7% 
* But core inflation, excluding food and energy, was also higher than expected at 6% annual rate 
* It is the strongest signal yet that inflation has not yet peaked, as Biden previously claimed 
* On Friday Biden plans to speak at the Port of Los Angeles to highlight supply chain initiatives 
Annual inflation in the US has jumped to a 41-year high of 8.6 percent, blowing past expectations and dashing any hopes that consumer price increases had peaked. 
The new figures released on Friday suggested that the Federal Reserve could continue with its rapid interest rate hikes to combat inflation, and markets reacted swiftly, with the Dow shedding more than 700 points in early trading. 
The Labor Department's report showed that the consumer price index jumped 1 percent in May from the prior month, for a 12-month increase of 8.6 percent.

The Guardian: We’re almost out of ammunition and relying on western arms, says Ukraine 
Exclusive: Deputy head of military intelligence says it’s an artillery war now and ‘everything depends on what the west gives us’  Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has said Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay. 
“This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”. 
“Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” said Skibitsky. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.”

BBC: Ukrainian casualties: Kyiv losing up to 200 troops a day - Zelensky aide 
A senior Ukrainian presidential aide has told the BBC that between 100 and 200 Ukrainian troops are being killed on the front line every day. 
Mykhaylo Podolyak said Ukraine needed hundreds of Western artillery systems to level the playing field with Russia in the eastern Donbas region. 
He also said Kyiv is not ready to resume peace talks with Moscow. 
Ukrainian troops are under relentless bombardment as Russian forces attempt to take control of the whole of Donbas. 
"The Russian forces have thrown pretty much everything non-nuclear at the front and that includes heavy artillery, multiple rocket launch systems and aviation," Mr Podolyak said.

Update #1: Ukraine says up to 200 of its soldiers die daily as battle in east intensifies (LA Times)  
Update #2: Ukraine: 100-200 soldiers die daily, new plea for more arms (AP)   
WNU Editor: President Zelensky said last week that Ukraine was losing 60 - 100 soldiers a day. Ukraine's defense minister said a few days ago that Ukraine was losing 100 soldiers a day. And now a senior aide to the President is saying that Ukraine is losing 100 - 200 soldiers a day. 
I posted two weeks ago that non-government Ukrainian sources were saying that the army was losing anywhere from 200 - 300 soldiers a day. It looks like the real number is around 200/day, and I can only speculate on how many are being injured. 
Ukraine is saying that they are killing 200 Russian soldiers per day .... Ukraine’s army says Russian army lost around 200 soldiers killed in action over last day (Voice of Ukraine).]]></summary>

He was 95 years old.
His death was confirmed by Lee Gi-nam, the producer of a 2020 documentary about Mr. Song’s life, which charted a tumultuous journey reflecting South Korea’s modern history through war, division , abject poverty and meteoric rise.  No cause of death was given.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: The Pentagon has a supply-chain problem 
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, no weapon has been more effective against Russian forces than the Javelin anti-tank missile. Drawing on a supply of roughly 7,000 US-made Javelins, Ukraine’s fighters have destroyed at least 400 Russian tanks and hundreds more armored vehicles. The weapon’s potency has helped foil President Vladimir Putin’s plans to overrun the country. There’s just one problem: The US stockpile is now running out. 
The war has already consumed as much as one-third of the US military’s inventory of Javelins. Within months, the Pentagon will be unable to deliver new ones without emptying out its own supply. The war has also consumed one-quarter of the US inventory of Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles; Raytheon, which makes the Stinger, says it could take up to a year to restart production. (The Army has issued a $625 million contract to Raytheon to do so.) At the current usage rate, supplies could be nearly exhausted by next year.

(Reuters) - Russia warned the West on Thursday that cyber attacks against its infrastructure risked leading to direct military confrontation, and that attempts to challenge Moscow in the cyber sphere would be met with targeted countermeasures. 
The warning comes after Russia's housing ministry website appeared to be hacked over the weekend, with an internet search for the site leading to a "Glory to Ukraine" sign in Ukrainian. 
In a statement, the foreign ministry said that Russia's critical infrastructure and state institutions were being hit by cyberattacks and pointed to figures in the United States and Ukraine as being responsible. 
"Rest assured, Russia will not leave aggressive actions unanswered," it said. "All our steps will be measured, targeted, in accordance with our legislation and international law."

 Russia does not plan to stop natural gas supply to more customers in Europe, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. 
Customers that have refused to pay for gas under the new rules Russia has imposed are already cut off, and no new halts in supply are planned, Peskov told reporters at a regular briefing, as carried by Russian news agency TASS. 
Russia has already stopped gas supply to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands, and customers in Denmark and Germany that have refused to pay in rubles for gas. Russia wants the countries it considers "unfriendly" – the whole of the EU, its biggest gas customer, the U.S., and UK, and many other U.S. allies – to pay in rubles for gas. Some have refused, fearing that they would not have guarantees and saying the new currency demand is a breach of contracts the gas importers have with Russian gas giant Gazprom.

WNU Editor: The Kremlin are confident that there will be no more cuts. But as the war continues to grind on in Ukraine, the situation can change very quickly.]]></summary>

(JOE KLAMAR / AFP)   
Politico:  Iran nuclear deal nears potential ‘fatal blow’ as Tehran removes cameras, watchdog chief says  
Dismantling the cameras poses a ‘serious challenge’ to the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
VIENNA — Iran will remove surveillance cameras from key nuclear sites, the U.N. nuclear watchdog head said Thursday, leaving international observers in the dark and imperiling a deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. 
Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said dismantling the cameras poses a “serious challenge” to the agency’s work in Iran. Speaking to journalists in Vienna, Grossi warned the agency will be unable to maintain a “continuity of knowledge” about Iran’s nuclear program in about three to four weeks.

* The pilot of the Soviet-era Su-25 was forced to take evasive measures in Donbas 
* Cockpit footage shows the plane quickly tilting left and right and firing off flares 
* Below, fields and forests are shown zooming past as the jet flies at high-speeds 
* Eventually, the pilot was able to escape the reach of the Russian target lock 
This heart-stopping video shows a Ukrainian fighter pilot almost skimming tree tops in a death-defying game of cat-and-mouse to evade rockets fired by Russian forces from the ground. 
In the 'Top Gun'-style cockpit footage, shared on social media, the pilot of the Ukrainian Su-25 attack jet can be seen performing sharp evasive manoeuvres as the forests, roads and fields of the country's eastern Donbas region zoom past below. 
The Soviet-era Su-25 is first seen flying over a road, as what appear to be military vehicles pass underneath.

The Guardian: Huge scale and impact of Israeli incursions over Lebanon skies revealed 
Study documents at least 22,000 overflights in past 15 years as well as psychological effect on country 
For decades, the roar of Israeli jets, and the hum of surveillance drones have been regular features in the skies above Lebanon, buzzing towns and cities at will – and acting as constant reminders that war is never far away. 
Research, which was published on Thursday, demonstrates just how pervasive that presence has been, with at least 22,000 overflights being documented in the past 15 years alone. Those numbers have made warplanes an abiding soundtrack to Lebanese life and the ever present threat of violence a part of the country’s collective psychology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday compared his current actions to Peter the Great's conquest of the Baltic coast during his 18th-century war against Sweden.
After visiting an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great, Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs that "you get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn't taking anything, he was taking it back".
When Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg and declared it the Russian capital "none of the countries in Europe recognised this territory as belonging to Russia," Putin said.
"Everyone considered it to be part of Sweden. But from time immemorial, Slavs had lived there alongside Finno-Ugric peoples," the Russian leader added.
"It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen," Putin said, in an apparent reference to Russia's offensive in Ukraine.
"Yes, there have been times in our country's history when we have been forced to retreat, but only to regain our strength and move forward," he said.
The defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700-1721) made Russia the leading power in the Baltic Sea and an important player in European affairs.
But with ties Russia's ties with the West currently shattered by the Ukraine invasion, Moscow authorities are downplaying Peter's affinity for Europe and focusing on his role in expanding Russian territories.
More than three centuries after he sought to bring Russia closer to Europe, Russians on Thursday marked the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great with the country deeply isolated over the Ukraine conflict.
Peter I reigned first as tsar and then as emperor from 1682 until his death in 1725.

Ukrinform: Ukraine Army’s daily death toll up to 100 - Defense chief calls to speed up heavy arms supply 
The situation at the front remains difficult, with Ukraine losing up to a hundred servicemen killed and up to 500 wounded every day.  That’s according to Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, who addressed the issue on Facebook, Ukrinform reports. 
According to the minister, "Russian monster still has many means to devour human lives to satisfy his imperial ego."  That is why Ukraine emphasizes the need for heavy weapons to be supplied as quickly as possible. 
"We have proved that we have no fear of the Kremlin, unlike many others. But we, as a country, cannot afford to bleed out, losing our best sons and daughters," Reznikov said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A libel lawsuit brought by Prince Harry against one of Britain's biggest newspaper groups had its first court date Thursday in the latest legal action taken by the US-based royal.
The Duke of Sussex is suing Associated Newspapers -- which publishes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and MailOnline -- over an article alleging he had sought to keep a request for British police protection under wraps.
The lawsuit relates to coverage in the Mail on Sunday and online of a separate court challenge he is pursuing against the UK government over his security arrangements when he is in Britain.
Harry, 37, and his wife Meghan Markle, 40, live in California after stepping down from royal duties in 2019, which caused them to lose their UK taxpayer-paid protection.
The prince's lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, told the High Court in a written submission that the February article was "defamatory" because it suggested Harry had "lied" and "improperly and cynically" tried to manipulate public opinion over the issue.
Associated Newspapers' legal team is disputing that there was "any meaning defamatory" of him in its coverage.
In the legal claim against the government, the duke has appealed to the High Court for a review of the interior ministry's refusal to allow him to pay for police protection himself, arguing the decision means he cannot return home safely.
The government has dismissed the offer to pay for police protection as "irrelevant," writing to the court earlier this year that personal "security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis".
The cases come after the royal couple launched legal action in recent years against a number of publications, alleging invasion of privacy.
Markle won a long-running case against Associated Newspapers last year over the publication of a letter she wrote to her estranged father.
Judge Matthew Nicklin, who is hearing the new libel claim, will rule on a number of preliminary issues that he is considering following Thursday's hearing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 100 people have sought medical treatment this week after suspected exposure to a pollutant in an area known as the "Chilean Chernobyl" for the environmental impact of heavy industry.
Local authorities declared an environmental emergency in the area, suspending classes and banning physical activity, after the Quintero Air Quality Station reported a concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the air five times the norm on Monday.
A total of 105 people -- among them 50 children -- have sought help in the towns of Quintero and Puchuncavi in the Valparaiso region, complaining of headaches, itchy eyes and throats, and nausea, the SMA environmental agency said late Wednesday.
The Quintero prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the incident.
Quintero and Puchuncavi, two coastal towns with some 50,000 inhabitants combined, have been deemed "sacrifice zones" since 1958, when the Chilean government converted what was an fishing and farming community into an industrial hub.
Today it houses four coal-fired thermoelectric plants and oil and copper refineries.
Environmental group Greenpeace dubbed the area the "Chilean Chernobyl" after hundreds of people sought medical help for symptoms ranging from dizziness and headaches to vomiting blood and paralysis of the extremities in an episode in 2018.
On Wednesday, Chile's environmental superintendent Emanuel Ibarra ordered six companies operating in the area to "limit their productive activity, without harming the primary supply."
The companies include Chile's principal fuel company, Copec.
On Tuesday, the regulator also ordered measures to reduce pollution from the operations of state mining company Codelco -- the world's largest copper producer -- and the Aes Andina thermoelectric plant in the area.
Codelco, which is responsible for eight percent of the world's copper supply, said in a statement that its Ventanas smelter halted operations on Monday and will "maintain a voluntary suspension of operations" for maintenance.

WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has provided near-daily updates of Russia’s invasion on social media; viral video posts have shown the effectiveness of Western weapons in the hands of Ukrainian forces; and the Pentagon has regularly held briefings on developments in the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Prince William was on Thursday snapped on the streets of London selling copies of homeless magazine The Big Issue, whipping out a card machine to lure potential buyers.
The future king wore the magazine's official red baseball cap and jacket as he tried to tempt passers-by in the Westminster area into buying a copy.
Richard Hannant, 47, posed for a picture with the prince that his brother-in-law, Matthew Gardner, shared on LinkedIn.
"What an honor to have a private moment with our future king who was humble and working quietly in the background, helping the most needy," wrote Gardner.
"The finale to this unique occasion was when Prince William asked my brother-in-law if he wanted to buy the Big Issue, to which he replied: 'I have no change'.
"At this point William produced a mobile card machine. You cannot teach that!"
Cab driver Neil Kramer also shared a photo with the prince selling the magazine.
The outing comes after Britain on Sunday concluded four days of celebrations honoring his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II's record-breaking 70 years on the throne.
William has long worked on homelessness issues and has been a patron of the Centrepoint charity, which works on the issue, since 2005.
In December 2009, he joined Centrepoint's CEO spending a night sleeping on the street to deepen his understanding of the challenges young homeless people face, the charity said.
The 39-year-old is the most popular royal behind the queen, with 66 percent favorability, according to YouGov, with the public warming to his low-key manner and charity work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Israel Sends Navy To Escort Drilling Rig In Disputed Gas Field 
* The focus of the most recent rift between Israel and Lebanon is an offshore field called Karish. 
* While Lebanon has yet to make a commercial find of gas in its waters, Israel is already producing from a couple of giant fields. 
* The Israel-Lebanon dispute could lead to a delay in the development of East-Med gas resources. 
At a time when the world's gas supply is having to catch up with demand, two prospective gas majors in the eastern Mediterranean have locked horns over a disputed field that could delay the development of local resources. Israel and Lebanon have been at odds about their maritime border ever since gas was found. The issue seems to be of particular importance for troubled Lebanon: a big gas find could change the country's quite grim fortunes. It is also important for Israel, however, as it eyes the position of a regional gas major.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny scolded Google and Meta Platforms Inc on Thursday for shutting down advertising, a step he said had undermined the opposition and thus was a gift to President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny, by far Russia's most prominent opposition leader, casts Putin's Russia as a dystopian state run by thieves and criminals where wrong is cast as right and judges are in fact representatives of a doomed lawless country.
In a written address to the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, Navalny, who is currently in a Russian jail, said technology was being used by the state to arrest dissidents but that it also gave an opportunity to get to the truth.
"The Internet gives us the ability to circumvent censorship," Navalny said in the address, a copy of which…]]></summary>

Born into a lineage of whirling dervishes, Mohamed Adel, 20, takes great pride in the uniquely Egyptian interpretation of the centuries-old ritual known colloquially as "tanoura", or skirt in Arabic.
"I choose the colrs and the shapes that are sewn into the skirts," Adel said, pointing to the folds of his purple skirt with green and yellow appliques moments before stepping on stage to perform at a folk art festival.
The kaleidoscopic performance is a world away from the UNESCO-listed whirling dervishes of Turkey, who trace their origins to the teachings of Sufi poet and mystic Jalal al-Din Rumi.

Carrie Lam's five-year tenure as chief executive coincided with massive and often violent pro-democracy protests, Beijing's imposition of a draconian national security law and a coronavirus outbreak that left more than 9,000 dead.
She is on track to depart at the end of June with the lowest approval ratings of any Hong Kong leader since the city's handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
At her last appearance in Hong Kong's legislature, an emotional Lam told lawmakers: "I can boldly say I have delivered a report card I am not ashamed of, and have put a full stop to my 42 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thai authorities have seized 200 kilograms of crystal meth hidden inside a replica Easter Island statue awaiting shipment to Taiwan, police said Thursday.
Southeast Asia's so-called Golden Triangle -- the notorious border region of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand -- has long been an infamous hotspot for drug production and trafficking.
Thai drugs officers working with Taiwanese police raided a shipping company in the port city of Laem Chabang, some 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Bangkok, to examine six statue heads made from cement and metal frames.
Officers used an angle grinder, hammers and chisels to cut a hole in one statue, uncovering the drugs hidden inside in plastic bags, according to footage shown in local media.

The migrants had set up a temporary camp on a basketball court in the southern Mexican town of Huixtla, some 40 kilometers from where they began their journey on Monday close to the Guatemala border.
Immigration authorities in Huixtla began slowly processing temporary visas for the migrants Wednesday, which will allow them to stay in Mexico for 30 days without fear of being deported, said Luis Garcia Villagran, a coordinator with the Human Dignity Center NGO that is accompanying the caravan.
A Mexican government official confirmed to AFP that humanitarian visas were being issued to the migrants, but Garcia said the process was slow.

Moscow's forces are concentrating their firepower on the strategically important industrial hub as part of efforts to capture a swathe of eastern Ukraine.
After days of raging street battles, Ukrainian officials conceded that Russian troops control a large part of Severodonetsk, and that their forces might have to pull back due to constant shelling.
In his evening address to the nation, Zelensky said the battle for the city was "very fierce... very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war.

* OPEC+ is currently pumping 2.6 million barrels per day below its target. 
* Since OPEC+ started reversing last year the record cuts from April 2020, the group has been consistently struggling to meet its production quota. 
* OPEC+ compliance to production cuts has now increased to more than 200%. 
The OPEC+ group is currently pumping 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil below its target, and efforts to boost output per the monthly plans are "not encouraging," the energy minister of one of OPEC's top producers, the United Arab Emirates, said on Wednesday.  "
According to last month's report, we have seen the conformity (to output cuts) of the OPEC+ group and the conformity was more than 200%," the UAE's Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said at an energy conference in Jordan as carried by Reuters.

Along with almost every other black woman of childbearing age I knew, I read the article and talked about it constantly. Trapped in the American narrative of individualism, I learned the same ineffectual lessons that Villarosa espoused in Essence: “to work within the medical system and get all you can out of it”, not to “challenge that system “but for” self-advocacy for fair treatment. I did all of this during my own pregnancy, with Landrum’s story in mind. I took prenatal vitamins religiously; I followed doctor’s orders even when they suggested I should lose weight during my pregnancy I hired a doula, found a doctor who looked like me, and chose a hospital with a reputation for low C-section rates.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent months, however, the housing market has begun to slow in response to rising interest rates.  Since March, the Bank of Canada has raised its key rate by 175 basis points — the equivalent of 1.75% — in an effort to contain inflation.  “You see some households taking a bit of a step back because they have to reposition themselves in the market,” Mercer said.  “They may need to find a cheaper house, a different location, or time to save more on a down payment.”
Mr Powell added: “We are on a break – things have changed a lot over the last month.”
The real estate board reported 7,283 sales in the Greater Toronto Area in May, down 39% from May 2021 and 9% from the previous month.  The overall average selling price for all property types was C$1.21 million ($962,000), down about 7% from the previous two months.
Both trends suggest a more balanced market, which should allow “a bit more bargaining power for people still active in the market,” Mercer said.
Toronto’s major central neighborhoods, including Rosedale, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill, remain highly competitive as they suffer from a chronic shortage of available housing, said Cailey Heaps, President and CEO of the Heaps Estrin team.  According to the Real Estate Board, a detached house in the city currently averages just under C$2 million ($1.59 million), while a condo averages around C800,000 ($635,000). .
Additionally, the luxury market in general continues to perform “exceptionally well”, Ms. Heaps said.  “Buyers understand the scarcity of the product they are looking for.”
In Port Hope, the average selling price for the 38 homes sold in April and May was 909,000 Canadian ($723,000), up 28% from a year ago, according to Zolo, a classifieds site. real estate.

The U.N. atomic agency cameras are part of an inspections regime that Iran agreed to under the 2015 nuclear deal. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal. 
Iran says it has turned off two U.N. cameras monitoring its nuclear work, just as the United States and European governments were poised to rebuke Tehran over the regime’s failure to cooperate with an international probe of its nuclear program. 
The move cast fresh doubts on efforts to restore a 2015 nuclear deal designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and underscored rising tensions between Tehran and Washington. 
Iran announced the step through state television and other media outlets, saying two cameras from the International Atomic Energy Agency had been deactivated, but did not specify which nuclear site was affected or offer further details.

Freight Waves: US import demand is dropping off a cliff  
Inbound container volumes to the US are reverting to pre-pandemic levels 
The latest ocean container bookings data reveals that despite the strong levels of inbound cargo during the first five months of 2022, import demand is not just softening — it’s dropping off a cliff. Because capacity on the trans-Pacific has remained relatively stable, Freightos’ container spot rates from China to the West Coast have plunged 38% month-over-month to $9,630.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The above chart shows the countries that are most dependent on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine. This is why I am not surprised that the UN is now leading intense negotiations with Russia to unblock Ukrainian ports and release tens of millions of tonnes of grain to avert a global food crisis. 
In the above graph I noticed that Turkey gets 90% of its grains from Russia and Ukraine. I guess that explains why Turkey is doing everything in its power to get Russia and Ukraine to cooperate on resuming grain exports .... Turkey struggles to push Russia, Ukraine into grain deal to avert food crisis (Reuters), and why Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is in Turkey ....  Russia open to Ukraine grain exports but demands conditions (AP). More here .... Turkey, Russia discuss efforts to restart Ukrainian grain exports (Al Jazeera). 
Unfortunately the talks are not succeeding .... No Progress at Russia-Turkey Talks on Ukraine Grain Exports (Moscow Times/AFP). 
A prediction. 
I expect Turkish President Erdogan is going to try and cultivate better ties with Putin. He sees the EU is in a panic over the Russia - Ukraine war .... Turkish President Erdogan Says There Is Now Panic In Europe Over The Russia - Ukraine War (June 6, 2022), and my gut is telling me that Erdogan has made the decision that Russia is going to win the Ukraine war, or at least get what it wants out of this conflict. 
This situation may also explain Erdogan's objections to Sweden and Finland from joining NATO. He wants to be on the winning side, and he certainly does not want to jeopardize grain shipments from Russia that his country is completely dependent on. What better way to guarantee these shipments by supporting the Kremlin. If not publicly, at least privately and through his actions on an issue that the Kremlin sees is critical to its national security.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foo Fighters announced Wednesday they will play a pair of tribute concerts in honor of the band's late drummer Taylor Hawkins this fall.
The first show in London will take place September 3, with a second staging slated for September 27 in Los Angeles.
The 50-year-old Hawkins was found dead in a hotel in Bogota shortly before a planned performance on March 25.
Dave Grohl -- the former Nirvana drummer who founded Foo Fighters -- along with Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett, Pat Smear and Rami Jaffee will participate in the concerts.
"My deepest thanks and admiration go out to the global Foo Fighters community and Taylor's fans far and wide for the outpouring of love each and every one of you have shown our beloved Taylor," wrote the late artist's wife, Alison Hawkins, in a statement posted on social media.
"Your kindness has been an invaluable comfort for my family and me during this time of unimaginable grief."
Preliminary toxicology tests found that Hawkins had drugs including opioids in his system before he died, but Colombian investigators did not specify whether the mix caused his death.
As part of one of the world's most influential and critically lauded alternative rock bands, Hawkins was known for his on-stage charisma and classic rock-inspired beats, which he once said were influenced by legends like Phil Collins and Queen's Roger Taylor.
The Foo Fighters celebrated their 25th anniversary last year in a pandemic-delayed tour and had most recently produced "Studio 666," a rock-and-roll horror movie.

(Bloomberg) -- Developing nations are suffering the biggest hit from this year’s oil shock. Many are dependent on imported fuel and are being crushed by a combination of high international prices, weak currencies and competition from rich nations whose economies are rebounding from the pandemic.
Higher fuel bills are exacerbating inflation in countries that are already struggling with soaring food prices. The combination is leading to unrest and protests from citizens, which democratic governments know from experience is one of the surest ways to lose popularity and power. 
Sri Lanka, Laos, Nigeria and Argentina are among emerging economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America that have seen long queues at some filling stations in the past weeks because of fuel shortages.

WNU Editor: With high fuel prices how will goods be transported that will make economic sense for the farmer/store to sell, and for the customer to buy? In the industrialized rich countries we will adjust. But for everyone else, it is now a crisis. 
A regular reader of this blog in Kenya emailed me yesterday that almost half of his government salary (he is a teacher) is now spent on food!?!?!? This is not sustainable, and you do not have to be a genius to know that in the coming months the situation is going to get worse.]]></summary>

The Summit of the Americas — an event bringing together leaders of countries from Chile to Canada this week — was supposed to be a chance for the White House to demonstrate its leadership on big regional issues such as migration, climate change and recovering from the pandemic. 
But the agenda has been overshadowed by who won't be at the table. Several leaders, including Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, turned down the chance to meet with President Biden in Los Angeles.

WNU Editor: Mexico's no-show is embarrassing. Brazil making demands before agreeing to go to the summit is not surprising (link here). So much for the White House trying to demonstrate its leadership on big regional issues such as migration, economic development, climate change and recovering from the pandemic.

A Genial/Quaest poll found that 46% of voters would support Lula in a first-round vote, giving him a 16-point lead over Bolsonaro, who garnered 30%—a two-point decline since April.
Should the two candidates meet in a head-to-head runoff as expected, Lula would defeat Bolsonaro by a margin of 54% to 32%, said the polling firm, which conducted in-person interviews with 2,000 voters between June 2 and June 5.

German mass-circulation newspaper Bild had reported on the letter earlier. According to the newspaper, the driver's motive was not political.
Bild quoted an investigator as saying: "Definitely not an accident - a homicidal maniac, a stone-cold killer." A police spokesperson did not confirm this at first.
According to dpa information, the perpetrator was driving a car belonging to his older sister. He is said to have been known to the police before, but not in connection with extremism.
A car is seen crashed into the window of a store on Tauentzienstrasse. According to the fire brigade, one person was killed and at least eight injured after a car struck pedestrians in a busy shopping district in the German capital of Berlin on Wednesday. Christoph Soeder/dpa

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This restriction is unlikely to limit Rob Walton, Greg Penner and their families.  Walton, 77, is the oldest child of Walmart co-founder Helen and Sam Walton.  Rob Walton was president of Walmart from 1992 to 2015. His cousin is Ann Walton, niece of Sam Walton and wife of E.  Stanley Kroenke, owner of the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, NBA’s Denver Nuggets, NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and Premier League’s Arsenal FC, among other teams.
Penner is married to Rob Walton’s daughter, Carrie, and has been president of Walmart since 2015. 
Walton-Penner’s offer, if approved, would end nearly four decades of Bowlen family ownership.  The Broncos joined the AFL in 1960 and were dismal on the field for their first decade and a half, although they were popular with fans in the Rocky Mountain states.  But after Bowlen bought the club in 1984, the Broncos had 21 winning seasons, 13 division titles, nine conference championship berths and seven Super Bowl appearances.
His failing memory, Bowlen retired from team management in 2014, and left several administrators, including Ellis, to oversee the franchise.  The administrators were tasked with deciding which of his children should become the majority owner – or whether the franchise should be sold, if they thought it was in the best interests of the family.
Beth Bowlen, Bowlen’s second daughter from his first marriage, worked at the club and was interested in becoming the main owner.  But she left the team several years ago.
Brittany Bowlen, a daughter from Bowlen’s second marriage, was named as a potential replacement.  The seven Bowlen children could not come to an agreement on who should take charge, so the team was put up for auction.
Now another family, this time with even richer pockets, is likely to take over.

Iga Swiatek claimed her second French Open title on Saturday, extending her winning streak to 35 games by beating Coco Gauff, 6-1, 6-3.
In Sunday’s men’s final, Rafael Nadal is in the hunt for his 14th French Open singles title against No. 8 seed Casper Ruud, the first Norwegian to reach a Grand Prix singles final. Slam.
In the end, both matches will have attracted massive and nearly equal public attention, but women’s tennis has yet to engage in a fight for a level playing field.  We’ve seen this play out again on red clay at Roland Garros over the past two weeks (more on that later).  Yet professional tennis sets the standard for popularity and viability in women’s sports – and it’s not even close.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 100 German school children and teachers had to be rescued, most of them airlifted to safety, after getting stuck on an Alpine hiking trail, described online as a "classic after-work tour," police said Wednesday.
Dozens of rescuers using two helicopters had to extract the 99 students aged 12 to 14 and eight teachers Tuesday after the path they were on became increasingly difficult and it started to rain, they said.
Two pupils within the group, from the southwestern German city of Ludwigshafen, had slipped, suffering minor injuries, and some were panicking, a police statement said.
The teachers alerted the emergency services.
Police said the group had checked online and had believed the trail in Vorarlberg state in western Austria would be easier than it turned out to be.
"Due to a query in an internet search engine, the teaching staff decided on a route that was no longer signposted," police said in the statement.
The challenging route was "described on the internet as a classic after-work tour", it added.
"The path is no longer in official tour guides... it was relatively difficult and exposed," state police spokesman Wolfgang Duer told AFP.
"The unusual part was the amount of people having to be rescued."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mexico President López Obrador mocked Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) after the American politician was seen fleeing from a reporter who asked about gun control in the wake of a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Obrador noted that both Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have alleged that he has links to illegal cartels.
He demanded that the senators "present evidence" of their claims.
Obrador went on to slam Cruz for taking money from gun manufacturers and lobbyists. He noted that Cruz has received thousands of dollars from the National Rifle Association (NRA).
The Mexican president also took time to present a video of Cruz fleeing from a Sky News reporter who wanted to know why school shootings are prevalent in the United States.
"You've got your political agenda," Cruz said as he fled from the reporter. "God love you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAN DIEGO — They were hired to great fanfare during the offseason and received rave reviews in Major League Baseball for their early work with their new teams.  Both have won three Manager of the Year awards and, if things continue, they would also be strong contenders for this year’s vote.
But before they became dugout peers and quick friends, Mets manager Buck Showalter and his San Diego Padres counterpart Bob Melvin shared a moment together under different circumstances.  He arrived at Yankee Stadium in 1994, when Showalter, then 37, was a third-year manager guiding the Yankees under owner George Steinbrenner.  Melvin, who was 32 at the time, was an aging receiver in his final season.
“Bobby saved my job,” Showalter said, explaining that he had three catchers on the roster at the time a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANAHEIM, Calif. — Joe Maddon has become the latest Angels coach to fail to deliver on team owner Arte Moreno’s vision of achieving glory with Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani.  He was fired Tuesday afternoon.
The move came after the Angels lost 12 straight games, a streak that reached 13 with a 6-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night.
The Angels went from a 24-14 record on May 16, when they tied for first place in the American League West with the Houston Astros, to a 27-30 mark and a 9.5 game deficit in the division.  With Tuesday’s loss in extra innings, Los Angeles set a franchise record for its longest single-season losing streak, surpassing a 12-game streak since 1988.
Prior to the match, Phil Nevin, previously the team’s third baseman coach, had taken over as caretaker manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scrutiny is baffling for Ms Young, 33, who recalled how after the Parkland shooting she brought a leather belt to put in her classroom first aid kit in case she needed a tourniquet for a pupil.
“It’s literally entrusted to their life,” she said, “but not entrusted with choosing the program.”
Teachers in public schools earn an average of about $65,000 per year and were among the most trusted professionals, alongside nurses, doctors, soldiers and scientists.  But as schools closed and the social fabric frayed during the pandemic, trust in teachers has declined.
For some, the competing pressures were enough to drive them away.
“I needed a change,” said Kathy Macken, 62, a math and science teacher in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, who quit the classroom after 19 to do intensive tutoring with smaller groups of students.
After being out of school earlier in the pandemic, her fifth graders returned this year in dire need.  Even when she tried to help them academically, Ms. Macken said, she spent much of her time trying to keep them calm and focused: Take out a pencil.  Write your homework in your diary.  Please no iPads during story time.
She had to cut back on a favorite science project — where students build terrariums to take home — because she didn’t have time.
And in the last week of school, a lockdown interrupted an outdoor field day.  Amid the fierce struggle and bouncy house fun, the students were shoved inside.  Ms Macken huddled with her students on the floor of her dark classroom while police investigated a report of a teenager walking down the street with a gun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney will not release blockbuster animation "Strange World" in French cinemas, it said Wednesday, in protest against the country's strict streaming rules.
Under French law, the company's streaming platform, Disney+, would have to wait 17 months to show the movie after its release in cinemas, which had been due in November.
Disney told AFP it would instead send "Strange World" straight to streaming and skip cinemas entirely, confirming reports by movie website Deadline and French paper Les Echos.
Helene Etzi, Disney France president, told Les Echos that France's rules were "unfair, constraining and poorly adapted to audience demands."
"Strange World" is one of its most-anticipated releases of the year, with Jake Gyllenhaal voicing the lead character in the English version of the fantasy a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Officially it is just a research vessel, but China's newly unveiled drone carrier is a clear sign Beijing is rushing to deploy an autonomous swarm of unmanned devices in its push for military supremacy in the Pacific Ocean.
State media last month showed the launching of the Zhu Hai Yun -- "Zhu Hai Cloud" -- capable of transporting an unspecified number of flying drones as well as surface and submarine craft, and operating autonomously thanks to artificial intelligence.
The 89-metre (292-foot) ship would be operational by year-end with a top speed of 18 knots, vastly increasing China's surveillance potential of the vast Pacific area it considers its zone of influence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One person was killed and eight injured when a car drove into a group of people in central Berlin on Wednesday, the fire service said.
A police spokeswoman said the driver was detained at the scene after the car plowed into a shop front along busy shopping street Tauentzienstrasse.
It was not clear whether the crash was intentional, police said.
The accident happened just across Breitscheidplatz, where an Islamic State group sympathizer plowed a truck through a Christmas market in 2016, killing 12.
Dozens of police officers have been deployed to the scene.
The country has seen several such attacks since the deadly 2016 assault, with most carried out by people who were found to have psychological issues.
In December 2020, a German man plowed his car through a pedestrian shopping street in the southwestern city of Trier, killing four adults and a baby.
Earlier the same year, a German man rammed his car through a carnival procession in the central town of Volkmarsen, injuring dozens of bystanders, including children. He was sentenced to life in jail last year.
In January 2019, another German national injured eight people when he drove into crowds on New Year's Eve in the western cities of Bottrop and Essen. He was later taken into psychiatric care.
In April 2018, a German man crashed his van into people seated outside a restaurant in the city of Muenster, killing five before shooting himself dead. Investigators later said he had mental health problems.
During the football World Cup in Germany in 2006, a German man rammed his car into crowds gathered to watch a match at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, injuring some 20 people. The driver was later committed to a psychiatric hospital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian forces may have to retreat from the eastern city of Severodonetsk which is being shelled by Russian troops "24 hours a day", an official said Wednesday, following days of raging street battles.
The strategic city has become the focus of Russia's offensive as they seek to seize an eastern swathe of Ukraine, after being repelled from other parts of the country.
Moscow claimed Tuesday they had full control of residential areas while Kyiv was still holding the industrial zone and surrounding settlements, but Ukrainian officials insisted the Russians were not in control of the city.
On Wednesday Sergiy Gaiday -- governor of the Lugansk region, which includes the city -- said Ukraine's forces might have to pull back.

In June 2018, Banksy created a mural of a veiled female figure in a mournful pose on a fire exit door of the concert venue, where 90 people were killed in attacks by Islamist gunmen that caused 130 fatalities in Paris and its outskirts.

Pyle and running mate Kathleen Garrison of Haysville would need 5,000 petition signatures to be on the November general election ballot.


	In addition to Schmidt, the Republican Party’s primary for governor includes Arlyn Briggs of Kincaid. Kelly is seeking reelection to a second term against Emmett resident Richard Karnowski, a Democrat. The Libertarian Party’s gubernatorial candidate is Seth Cordell of Lyons.


	During the 2022 legislative session, Pyle was among Republican senators stripped of committee assignments for refusing to vote for the congressional redistricting map supported by Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover.
