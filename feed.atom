        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A view from a session of the Grand National Assembly of Türkiye (TBMM) General Assembly in the capital Ankara, Türkiye, Oct. 4, 2022. (AA Photo)   
BBC: Turkey approves Finland Nato membership bid 
Finland will become the 31st member of Nato after Turkey's parliament voted to approve its application. 
Turkey had delayed Finland's bid to join the West's defensive alliance for months - complaining the Nordic nation was supporting "terrorists". 
Sweden, which applied to join Nato at the same time last year, is still being blocked by Ankara over similar complaints. 
Any Nato expansion needs the support of all its members. 
Finland will now be formally admitted into Nato at its next summit, taking place in July in Lithuania.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Trump hit with criminal charges in New York, a first for a US ex-president -New York Times 
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury after a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, becoming the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges even as he makes another run for the White House, a law enforcement source said on Thursday. 
The charges, arising from an investigation led by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, could reshape the 2024 presidential race. 
Trump previously said he would continue campaigning for the Republican Party's nomination if charged with a crime. 
The specific charges are not yet known and the indictment will likely be announced in the coming days, the New York Times reported. Trump will have to travel to Manhattan for fingerprinting and other processing at that point.

US officials said they were in touch with the family of detained journalist Evan Gershkovich as well as the newspaper and that the State Department had contacted Russia.
"The targeting of American citizens by the Russian government is unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the strongest terms," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
"I want to strongly reiterate that Americans should heed the US government's warning to not travel to Russia. US citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately."

* Trump leads DeSantis 54% to 24% in new Fox News poll 
* That is double from last month     * Pollster says voters showing their support to Trump amid indictment reports 
Donald Trump has doubled his lead in the Republican presidential primary amid reports he'll be indicted by the Manhattan district attorney's office, a new poll finds. 
Voters see the case as politically motivating, pollster Daron Shaw said, and it's bringing them back to Trump's corner. 
The Fox News poll found Trump has doubled his lead since February and is up by 30 points over Ron DeSantis, 54% to the Florida governor's 24%.  Last month, Trump led DeSantis by 15 points: 43% to 28%.

On the northwestern fringes of the Ukrainian capital, Bucha had been occupied by Russian troops for about a month, taken as they swept toward Kyiv at the start of the invasion of Ukraine that began in late February 2022. When they withdrew, they left behind scenes of horror.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Bakhmut is 'a slaughter-fest for the Russians' who are 'getting hammered' by Ukrainian forces in the area and 'not making any progress whatsoever' 
* US General Mark Milley said late last night that Russia was suffering major losses 
 * Hard fighting in and around Bakhmut has inflicted huge casualties on both sides 
Russian forces are 'getting hammered' in the battle for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in fighting described as a 'slaughter-fest' by senior US officials. 
Chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley told lawmakers late last night: 'The Russians have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut. 
'It's a slaughter-fest for the Russians. They're getting hammered in the vicinity of Bakhmut and the Ukrainians have fought very very well.'

WNU Editor: The media narrative from the West continues to stay same. The battle for Bakhmut is going their way, and Russian forces are getting slaughtered .... Ukrainians in a Hidden Command Post See Bakhmut Going Their Way (DNYUZ/New York Times). But the problem with this narrative is that if the Russian forces are facing massive losses that would cripple any army, how come they continue to advance and seize more territory .... Ukraine controls a third of Bakhmut, says presidential adviser (Straits Times).

Israel is suspected of carrying out numerous attacks against Syrian and Iranian military targets in Syria this year. 
Two Syrian soldiers were injured in a suspected Israeli missile attack early Thursday morning. 
Syria's official news outlet SANA reported that the missiles hit unspecified targets outside of Damascus at 1:20 a.m. local time (6:20 p.m. ET Wednesday). The missiles were fired from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Syrian air defenses downed some of the missiles. Two Syrian soldiers were injured in addition to material damage, according to SANA. 
Videos spread of social media purportedly showing the Israeli strikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[new video posted to his Truth Social platform on Thursday, former President Donald Trump went after Gov. Ron DeSantis for being purportedly disrespectful to Russian despot Vladimir Putin.
"Calling Russia 'a gas station with a bunch of nuclear weapons' or calling Putin a, quote, 'authoritarian gas station attendant with some legacy of nuclear weapons from the old Soviet Union' is exactly the kind of simple-minded thinking that has produced decades of failed diplomacy and war," said Trump. "Where is that war going? Those such as Mitt Romney and Ron DeSantis ... who insist on arrogantly treating Russia as deeply inferior to the other nations of the world, with no history or culture or pride, are not only ignorant and foolish, but that attitude makes it impossible to negotiate peace, absolutely impossible."
Trump went on to accuse DeSantis of "rude" treatment of Putin, even while claiming that his administration was "tougher on Russia than any administration before."
"This kind of neocon rhetoric mocking Russia's nuclear weapons, along with implying that Putin must be tried and presumably executed as a war criminal, only increases the risk of deadly, nuclear escalation," said Trump, parroting a frequent Kremlin talking point.

In fact, it is Russia that has made unprovoked threats of nuclear war, in response to the lack of progress in their assault on Ukraine.
This comes after DeSantis, who came under fire from fellow Florida Republicans for dismissing the Ukraine invasion as a "territorial dispute" the United States can't be perpetually involved in, backpedaled and put out a statement fiercely criticizing Putin.]]></summary>

Al Jazeera: Colombian rebels kill nine soldiers in blow to peace talks  
Preliminary military assessment has identified the left-wing ELN as responsible for the attack in a northern province. 
An attack by the Colombian rebel group known as the National Liberation Army (ELN) has allegedly killed nine government soldiers, in a blow to the government’s efforts to negotiate a truce with armed groups and curb violence in the country. 
The attack, one of the deadliest to occur in the last several months, took place on Wednesday in the rural state of Norte de Santander, near the border with Venezuela. It came more than two weeks after the government and the ELN held a second round of ceasefire negotiations in Mexico City.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon will testify about his bank allegedly profiting from Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, Law&Crime reported. 
According to the Virgin Islands government, Dimon knew about Epstein’s crimes by at least 2008, which was the year Epstein was convicted. JPMorgan has insisted that Dimon is “not relevant” to the lawsuit, saying that he wasn’t involved in any decisions related to Epstein’s account.
Senior U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has denied the bank's motions to dismiss the case, saying there's sufficient evidence that JPMorgan knew Epstein was sex trafficking minors while they were doing business with him.
"Since being sued, JPMorgan filed a third-party lawsuit against their former senior executive Jes Staley, who later became the CEO of Barclays Bank. Staley has been under pressure after British regulators scrutinized the 1,200 emails that were exchanged with Epstein from 2008 through 2012," Law&Crime's report stated. "The communications showed that Staley appeared to visit Epstein’s island Little St. James, while Epstein was still incarcerated. Epstein sent Staley multiple emails with photographs of a young woman, and regulators say he sent transfers of money to women with Eastern European surnames timed around Staley’s visits to his properties."

The Virgin Islands government argues that JPMorgan can’t make Staley the scapegoat for everything. 
“If Staley is a rogue employee, why isn’t Jamie Dimon?” Virgin Islands attorney general’s private counsel Mimi Liu asked on March 16, saying the key question in the litigation isn’t “whether or not Mr. Staley raped any young women in the Virgin Islands.”
“The question is: What did he know?” Liu continued. “And Jamie Dimon knew in 2008 that his billionaire client was a child sex trafficker. Staley knew, Dimon knew, JPMorgan knew.”

Here are some of the medical problems the pontiff has had during his life, from an operation in his youth to remove part of a lung, to the knee issues that have forced him to use a wheelchair.
Lung operation

According to biographer Austen Ivereigh, surgeons removed three pulmonary cysts and a small part of his upper right lung in an operation followed by a long and painful recovery.

The announcement marks a serious escalation in the Kremlin's efforts to silence perceived critics, a crackdown that gained momentum following Russia's military operation in Ukraine last year.
The FSB said they had "halted the illegal activities of US citizen Evan Gershkovich," saying the Wall Street Journal reporter was "suspected of spying in the interests of the American government".
The Wall Street Journal said it was "deeply concerned for the safety of Mr. Gershkovich" and the international media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said it was "alarmed by what looks like retaliation".
RSF said Gershkovich "was investi…]]></summary>

The chances of uncovering anyone alive were dwindling but rescuers continued their tireless search for the 67 people missing after cascades of mud, earth and vegetation buried parts of the town of Alausi, some 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of the capital Quito.
Following torrential rain, a massive chunk of a mountainside broke loose late Sunday and slid onto the community of some 45,000 inhabitants, destroying or damaging at least 163 homes, the SNGR risk management secretariat said.

The far-right ex-army captain, who skipped town two days before Lula's inauguration on January 1, is due to arrive back in Brasilia on a commercial flight from Orlando, Florida at 7:10 am (1010 GMT).
It is a high-stakes bet for the former president, who is facing legal trouble on various fronts in Brazil -- notably for his alleged role in inciting supporters who rioted through the halls of power on January 8 in a failed bid to oust Lula, the veteran leftist who beat him in a divisive election in October.

Nine US service members were killed after two helicopters with the 101st Airborne Division crashed late Wednesday in southwestern Kentucky, officials said. There were no survivors. 
The two HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters crashed around 10 p.m. in Trigg County near the Tennessee border, officials at nearby Fort Campbell said early Thursday. They were taking part “in a routine training mission when the incident occurred,” the base said in a statement on Facebook. 
The helicopters were medical evacuation aircraft, and it’s believed the crash happened while they were flying and not during a medical evacuation drill, Brig. Gen. John Lubas, deputy commander of the 101st Airborne Division, said during a Thursday morning news conference at Fort Campbell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Number of usable nuclear warheads increased in 2022 — report  
The world's stockpile of usable nuclear warheads increased by over 130 in 2022, Norwegian People's Aid has reported. The authors have warned of the risk that nuclear weapons pose to humanity. 
The number of nuclear warheads that states could deploy reached a total of 9,576 at the beginning of 2023, up from 9,440 the previous year, according to a report published by the NGO Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) on Wednesday. 
The Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor report said that the weaponized nuclear power amounted to a "collective destructive power of more than 135,000 Hiroshima bombs."
The issue of nuclear weapons has become its most prominent since the end of the Cold War thanks in part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent aggressive rhetoric, as well as fears over Iran's nuclear program and North Korea's renewed missile tests.

WASHINGTON: The United States has told Russia it will cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces following Moscow's refusal to do so, the White House said on Tuesday (Mar 28), calling this a response to Russia's suspending participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty. 
While Russian President Vladimir Putin has not formally withdrawn from the treaty, which limits the two sides' deployed strategic nuclear arsenals, his Feb 21 suspension imperils the last pillar of US-Russian arms control. 
Between the two of them, the United States and Russia hold nearly 90 per cent of the world's nuclear warheads - enough to destroy the planet many times over.  "Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia's breaches of the New START Treaty by taking proportionate and reversible countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations," a spokesperson for the National Security Council said.

        <updated>2023-03-29T23:07:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[United States Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) published an editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal on Wednesday in which he voiced opposition to a ban on the popular app TikTok that passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently being debated in the Senate.
Paul, a libertarian conservative, attacked the proposal as a surefire way to alienate young voters and assailed it as an affront to Republicans' supposed aversion to censorship.
"This GOP strategy comes while polls indicate that 71% of young women and 53% of young men voted for a Democrat candidate for Congress. Now admittedly, many Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for this ban but like most such issues, the blame will stick to Republicans more," Paul wrote. "The banning TikTok strategy also comes while the GOP simultaneously complains of liberal U.S. social media companies canceling and censoring conservatives. So, without a hint of irony, many of these same 'conservatives' now agitate to ban a platform owned by an international group that includes several American investors."
Paul warned that prohibiting Americans from accessing Tiktok means that the US may "emulate China’s speech bans," noting that the app is already banned in China.
Paul also wondered, "does TikTok do the Chinese government’s bidding?" noting that "videos are all over TikTok that are critical of official Chinese positions."
After reiterating his fear of censorship, Paul concluded that "if you don't like TikTok or Facebook or YouTube, don't use them. But don't think any interpretation of the Constitution gives you the right to ban them."]]></summary>

Milley testifies before the House Appropriations Committee-Defense on the 2024 DoD Budget in the Rayburn House Office Building, March 23, 2023, in Washington D.C. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Alexander Kubitza)   
Military.com: Not Stopping Russia in Ukraine Would Force 'Doubling' of US Defense Budget, Milley Says 
The top general in the U.S. military warned Thursday that not supporting Ukraine now would lead to a massive increase in future defense budgets -- and global conflict that has been avoided since World War II ended. 
 "If that rules-based order, which is in its 80th year, if that goes out the window, then be very careful," Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley testified to Congress on Thursday. "We'll be doubling our defense budgets at that point because that will introduce not an era of great power competition. That'll begin an era of great power conflict. And that'll be extraordinarily dangerous for the whole world." 
Milley's remark at a House Appropriations Committee defense subcommittee hearing comes amid growing skepticism from Republicans about the price tag of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Milley was testifying alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about the Biden administration's $842 billion request for Pentagon spending for fiscal 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The public face of Pope Francis' efforts to root out child sex abuse in the Catholic Church has quit his position after growing "increasingly concerned" over how the papal advisory body works, Agence France Presse reported.
Hans Zollner's resignation from the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors comes as the agency continued to be dogged by controversy. 
“The protection of children and vulnerable persons must be at the heart of the Catholic Church’s mission,” he wrote in a statement. “Over the last few years, I have grown increasingly concerned with how the commission, in my perception, has gone about achieving that goal, particularly in the areas of responsibility, compliance, accountability and transparency.”
Contradicting Zollner's statement, Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors head Cardinal Sean O’Malley claimed that Zollner resigned because of his busy workload. 
"Zollner was the last remaining founding member of the group, which was set up by Pope Francis in 2014 as he strove to rid the Catholic Church of the scourge of sex abuse by clerics," AFP's report states. "Problems emerged as early as 2017, when abuse survivor Marie Collins resigned as a member of the commission, saying the body was under-resourced and faced fierce resistance within high echelons of the church. Fellow commission member and survivor Peter Saunders also quit later that year."]]></summary>

The Guardian: ‘This is very bad for them’: months of leaks rattle Canada’s low-profile spy agency  
Allegations of attempted meddling by China put uncomfortable spotlight on publicity-shy CSIS 
Most Canadians have no idea where the country’s spy agency is located, nor do they know much about its daily operations. This is not because the Canadian Security Intelligence Service operates in a particularly clandestine fashion, it’s because most Canadians don’t care. 
The CSIS, a civilian-run organisation based in a triangular structure of concrete and glass on the outskirts of Ottawa, lacks the intrigue of Britain’s MI5 and the notoriety of America’s Central Intelligence Agency. 
“I look nothing like Daniel Craig, and I did not arrive here in an Aston Martin. I’m just as disappointed as you are – on both fronts,” its director, David Vigneault, said in a speech in 2018, poking fun at the service’s largely uncharismatic reputation. “Most of you remember the movie Fight Club. And you will know that the first rule of Fight Club is ‘don’t talk about Fight Club’. Well, the first rule of CSIS has always been ‘don’t talk’. Period.”

But it is clear that there is at least one person in the national security bureaucracy who is not satisfied with the complete lack of response from the Canadian government on intelligence reports that China is interfering in Canada's elections.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico: Zelenskyy to Xi Jinping: Come to Ukraine 
'We are ready to see him here,’ Ukrainian president says. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to Ukraine, for what would be the first direct communication between the two leaders since the beginning of Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. 
“We are ready to see [Xi] here,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with the Associated Press, a U.S. newswire, on a train to Kyiv, adding, “I want to speak with him.”  “I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have [contact],” Zelenskyy said.

Update #1: Zelensky invites China’s Xi to visit Ukraine (The Hill)  
Update #2: Zelensky invites Xi Jinping to Ukraine (Ukrinform)   
WNU editor: I personally would not mind if Chinese President Xi goes to Kyiv. Anything to get the peace process moving forward should be supported. But I also know the Chinese do not operate like this. The will want Zelensky to first fly to Beijing to meet Xi. I also know the Chinese will first want to enter into talks before any official announcement is made. 
Beijing will not want President Xi to fly to Ukraine, or President Zelensky flying to Beijing, just for a photo-op. Beijing will want something concrete in return, but the problem is that I do not see Ukraine President Zelensky willing to compromise on anything right now.   
Update #3: This is not a good sign. The Chinese Foreign ministry does not know what the Ukraine President is talking about .... China’s MFA has no information about possible Zelensky–Xi meeting (Ukrinform).]]></summary>

RFE: Bulgaria's Pro-Kremlin Leader Refuses To Send Soviet-Era Fighter Jets And Tanks To Ukraine  
With its stockpile of Soviet-era weapons, Bulgaria, home to a thriving arms industry, could be a key ally of Ukraine, which is trained on and equipped with such arms, in its war against invading Russian forces. 
But with parliament now dissolved ahead of elections on April 2, the fifth snap poll in two years amid political uncertainty, the caretaking government is in no mood to provide lethal aid to Kyiv, appointed as it was by President Rumen Radev, who is known for his pro-Kremlin leanings.

Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam Museum, in eastern England, is acting on the advice of a government-appointed expert panel, which investigates claims for Nazi loot.
For more than a year, the panel probed the history of "La Ronde Enfantine", an oil landscape dating from about 1862 that has been lying in the museum's storage.
In a report published Tuesday, it concluded that the evidence supported the restitution claim made by the heirs of its one-time owner, Robert Bing, a French Resistance hero during World War II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A woman in northern France is to be put on trial on charges of insulting President Emmanuel Macron after describing him as 'filth' in a Facebook post, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.
The woman, risks a fine of 12,000 euros but not prison if convicted at the trial due to be held in June.
She was arrested on Friday and held in custody for questioning after the state's local administrative office filed a complaint over her Facebook post, the prosecutor in the northern town of Saint Omer, Mehdi Benbouzid, told AFP.
The complaint focused on a post on her Facebook page made on March 21, the day before Macron gave a lunchtime interview to TF1 television to defend his controversial pension reforms that have sparked nationwide protests.
"This piece of filth is going to address you at 1:00 pm... it's always on television that we see this filth," she wrote.
The woman, in her 50s, had been a supporter of the 2018-2019 "Yellow Vest" protests that shook Macron during his first mandate.
She stands accused of "insulting the president of the republic" and will stand trial on June 20 in Saint Omer, the prosecutor said.
"They want to make an example of me," the woman told La Voix du Nord regional newspaper which first reported the accusations.
The woman, named by the paper as Valerie, said she was astonished when she answered the knock on the door on Friday morning to find police had come to arrest her.
"I asked them if it was a joke, I had never been arrested," she said. "I am not public enemy number one."
The months-long protest movement against the pension reform has sent social tensions spiraling in France and Macron and his government refuse to give way.
New clashes between police and protesters erupted Tuesday and unions have announced a new day of strikes and protests on April 6.

ABC News: Russian jets of newer generation increase 'dominance' in combat zone, Ukrainian official says   

Ukrainian officials said Russia has replaced ageing jets with updated Su-35s.  
Newer generation fighter jets are giving Russia "increasing dominance" in the skies over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, according to a senior Ukrainian official. 
It is a potentially worrying shift for the United States and its allies because Russia’s inability to achieve total air superiority throughout the course of the war has been key to Ukrainian successes on the battlefield. 
In a briefing last week with journalists, a Western official downplayed the concern, stating that Russia’s ability to control the skies has been limited by air defense and surface-to-air missiles. 
"We’re not seeing a huge change in that situation," the official said. 
The senior official in Kyiv, who spoke exclusively to ABC News, said Russia had replaced older models of aircraft with its more modern Su-35.

Politico:  Russia removes submarines from Crimea to avoid Ukraine’s firepower, UK says 
British intelligence says relocation is highly likely due to ‘a change in local security threat.’  Russia has “almost certainly” removed its submarines from Crimea, British intelligence said Tuesday. 
The Kremlin’s move comes as a reaction to Ukraine’s new “long-strike range capability” and repeated attacks on the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula, from where the Russian Black Sea fleet has now “almost certainly relocated its KILO-class submarines” to Novorossiysk in southern Russia, the U.K. said. 
In a statement, the British defense ministry said that the submarine relocation is “highly likely” due to the “change in local security threat level,” after the fleet headquarters and main naval aviation field were attacked in recent months.

WNU Editor: This UK report makes sense. The expectation in Moscow is that NATO will soon be transporting even longer range weapon missile and drone systems to Ukraine. It is why anti-air platforms are being installed around Moscow, and why assets like Russia's strategic bomber fleet are being moved farther away from Ukraine. I guess submarines are now being included on the list.]]></summary>

CNN: New US drone routes over Black Sea ‘definitely limit’ intelligence gathering, says US official
 The US decision to fly its surveillance drones further south over the Black Sea after a Russian jet collided with a US drone earlier this month “definitely limits our ability to gather intelligence” related to the Ukraine war, a senior US military official tells CNN. 
Flying drones at greater distances reduces the quality of intelligence they can gather, a US military official explained, noting that spy satellites can compensate to some degree but have shorter times over targets, again reducing effectiveness relative to surveillance drones. 
After the Russian jet collided with a US Reaper drone earlier this month, the US began flying its surveillance drones further south and at a higher altitude over the Black Sea than previously, placing them further away from airspace surrounding the Crimean peninsula and eastern portions of the Black Sea.

The U.S. military wants to reinvent itself to prepare for a possible conflict with China, a country which many experts believe poses the greatest threat to U.S. national security. But how do Chinese leaders assess the strength of the People’s Liberation Army relative to the U.S. military? Researchers sought to answer that question in a recent report. 
The RAND Corporation report is one of the first analyses to study how the PLA understands and assesses military balance, in contrast to previous research that focused on quantitative aspects, such as how many pieces of equipment the PLA has and how its capabilities compare to those of the U.S. 
Specifically, the report focused on how the PLA views itself in four areas Chinese president Xi Jinping is worried about: political reliability, mobilization, fighting and winning wars, and leadership and command.

WNU Editor: In Asia, China's military is definitely up to matching what the US can deploy. But when looked globally, China's lack of infrastructure to deploy forces and materials is limited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amsterdam launched a campaign on Tuesday to discourage tourists planning drug- and alcohol-fueled parties -- starting with young British men.
The Dutch capital has long been trying to curb rowdy behavior such as stag parties, especially near the famed red light area where sex workers operate.
The new campaign, dubbed "Stay Away", will involve people searching online for some getaways in Amsterdam receiving special warnings.
"The campaign will commence in Great Britain, aimed at males in the age category of 18 to 35 years," Amsterdam city council said in a statement.
"This online discouragement campaign is aimed at nuisance tourists who want to visit Amsterdam to 'go wild', with all the ensuing consequences."
It would be expanded to "potential nuisance-causing visitors from the Netherlands and other EU-countries" in the coming year, it said.
People searching for terms such as "stag party Amsterdam" or "pub crawl Amsterdam" will be shown warning advertisements," it said.
The ads would show the "risks and consequences of anti-social behavior and excessive drug and alcohol abuse" including fines, arrest, criminal records, hospitalization and health issues.
Amsterdam recently announced a ban on smoking cannabis in the Red Light district, coupled with further restrictions on alcohol consumption and earlier closures for cafes, bars and sex clubs.
Authorities are also looking at moving sex workers to large "erotic centers" to the outskirts of the city.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
