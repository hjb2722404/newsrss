The move puts Canada in line with key intelligence allies like the United States, which have expressed concerns about the national security implications of giving the Chinese tech giant access to key infrastructure. 
The government is also banning ZTE, another Chinese state-backed telecommunications firm. 
A government policy statement posted online says companies will have until June 28, 2024, to remove or terminate 5G equipment from Huawei and ZTE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scott Ritter, Energy Intelligence: Ukraine War Has No End in Sight  
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is grinding its way toward its inevitable conclusion, namely Russian control over the Donbas region. But this will not end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has expanded in scope and scale beyond the capabilities of the Russian military resources originally allocated. With no diplomatic off-ramp on the horizon, the war risks becoming a permanent state of conflict between Russia and Ukraine — with unknown consequences. 
As the Ukraine conflict enters its third month, the Kremlin looks likely to achieve its major military objective of securing physical control over the eastern Donbas region. Peripheral territorial acquisition of the strategic southern city of Kherson, as well as a swath of territory connecting Crimea to the Donbas and the border of the Russian Federation, also looks likely.

WNU Editor: I agree with Scott Ritter's assessment that Moscow will achieve its military goals in this war, but politically there is no roadmap to end the war. Especially now as the US and NATO continue to arm and train the Ukraine to continue the conflict.

A few weeks into the war this blog predicted that the Russia - Ukraine conflict will continue into 2023. But it will end when Europe, deeply suffering from the economic impact of the conflict, will tell Kyiv to agree to Russia's terms and if not the EU will cut-off political and economic aid. I am still sticking with that prediction.]]></summary>

Three-fifths of US Hispanics dislike the job President Biden is doing, according to a new survey out this week — yet another sign of widespread discontent as Americans grapple with the ongoing border crisis, baby formula shortage and skyrocketing inflation. 
The Quinnipiac University survey published Wednesday found that just 26% of Hispanics approve of Biden’s performance, while 60% disapprove and 13% said they did not know or had no opinion.

There are many reasons for these poor poll numbers. Inflation. Crime. Broken borders. High fuel prices. But I am willing to venture that America's growing involvement in the Russia - Ukraine war is also raising deep concerns, worries, and opposition. 

The fact that President Biden is also avoiding the Press, even the friendly and loyal press, is not helping him in getting his message out there .... Triple digits: Biden hits 100 days without a media interview (Washington Examiner).]]></summary>

Euronews: NATO now has 40,000 soldiers on Europe's border with Russia 
The number of troops under NATO command stationed across the alliance's eastern flank has reached 40,000, nearly 10 times what it was last year. 
According to data from NATO, there were 4,650 troops under direct NATO command in February 2021 or a year before Russia launched its attack against Ukraine. These troops were stationed in four multinational battlegroups located respectively in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. 
Then Russia started deploying its troops and capabilities along its shared border in Ukraine, accelerating these moves at the end of last year and in January, arguing it was a defensive move over Ukraine's NATO aspiration and the trans-Atlantic alliance's eastern expansion since the 1990s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mychal Moultry Jr. Funeral and Burial Assistance Act was signed into law on Tuesday. It provides up to $10,000 in burial funds for families who lose children under 17 to gun violence.
In the time of sky-high inflation, every governor is trying to find ways to help residents of their state.  Ron DeSantis is giving Florida residents a months-long tax holiday.  Gavin Newsom is giving out free abortions.  And JD Pritzker of Chicago is now subsidizing… funerals.
“Collins pointed out that ‘firearm violence is a leading cause of death for children and teenagers in Illinois,” and among Black Illinoisans, the rate is disproportionately high.”
As homicides in Chicago show no sign of stopping, the demand for funerals is now bigger than the demand for baby formula.  Just like a war-torn country, Chicago has now introduced curfew.  It is safer for the kids to be on the streets of Ukraine or Afghanistan than take a walk in South Side of Chicago.
While Lori Lightfoot fights racism by refusing interviews to white journalists, the city’s black population is getting exterminated by the black drug gangs.  Apparently, Lori believes Tucker Carlson is not only responsible for the Buffalo shooting but also for black gangs indiscriminately spraying bullets on the streets of Chicago.
This government only cares about murder that can be blamed on “white supremacy.”   When it comes to black people shooting each other they take a Whoopi approach:  “ya’ll go fight amongst yourselves!”
Instead of saving lives by asking the President to pay attention, increasing police presence or moving the national guard in, the Chicago authorities decided to go the “compassionate” route of making it cheaper for parents to burry their children who fell victims to incompetent and criminal government.]]></summary>

The New Voice of Ukraine: If war lasts longer than a year, 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty – UN 
According to the analysis, the Russian army has damaged an estimated at $100 billion worth of Ukrainian infrastructure. But the UN says this cost might eventually climb to a sum 5-6 times more.
“Ukraine: ruined buildings, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and this costs at least $100 billion,” the UN’s analysis reads. “Half of all businesses are completely shut down, the other half are experiencing major obstacles. A long-term conflict might lead to nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling below the poverty line,” the UN said.

Dmitry Medvedev blamed the looming global food crisis on the “cosmic cretinism” of the West 
Russia will not export food to the detriment of its own market, Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council and former president Dmitry Medvedev said, adding that the West has to blame its own “cosmic cretinism” for the looming crisis.
In a lengthy Telegram post, Medvedev commented on recent statements by Western leaders about food security. As Russia and Ukraine are major wheat suppliers, accounting for some 30% of global exports, the prices have significantly grown since the launch of the Russian military offensive in the neighboring state and the subsequent sanctions imposed on Moscow by the US, the EU, the UK and some other Western nations. On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that fertilizers and food products from Russia should be available to the world markets without obstacles.

DUBAI — Iranian security forces fired live rounds and tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters in several provinces on Thursday, according to posts on social media, as protests triggered by rising food prices continued to spread. 
Iranians took to the streets last week after a cut in food subsidies caused prices to soar by as much as 300% for some flour-based staples. 
The protests quickly turned political, with crowds calling for an end to the Islamic Republic, echoing unrest in 2019 which began over fuel prices hike.  Social media footage not verified by Reuters showed at least six people killed and dozens injured in past days. 
There has been no official comment on any death toll.

Investing.com/Bloomberg: China in Talks With Russia to Buy Oil for Strategic Reserves 
(Bloomberg) -- China is seeking to replenish its strategic crude stockpiles with cheap Russian oil, a sign Beijing is strengthening its energy ties with Moscow just as Europe works toward banning imports due to the war in Ukraine. 
Beijing is in discussions with Moscow to buy additional supplies, according to people with knowledge of the plan who asked not to be named as the matter is private.

BBC News: Israeli coalition government in crisis as MP quits 
The future of Israel's government has been plunged into uncertainty after a member quit, leaving it as a minority in parliament for the first time. 
The Arab member of the coalition resigned, saying she could not tolerate its leaders' "right-wing stances" towards her section of society. 
The unexpected move means the coalition commands only 59 seats out of 120. 
The most diverse coalition in Israel's history has been in power for just under a year. 
Led by nationalist Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, it brought together eight parties from across the political spectrum, some with major ideological differences. 
Significantly, the government included an independent Arab party for the first time since the state was founded in 1948.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ABC News: Biden backs Sweden, Finland joining NATO as Turkey threatens to block the historic bids  
Finland and Sweden submitted their historic applications on Wednesday. 
President Joe Biden welcomed Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö to the White House on Thursday to discuss their historic bids to join NATO. 
All three leaders called for swift acceptance of the applications amid resistance from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who announced Thursday that his country will oppose Finland and Sweden joining the alliance.

Update #1: Biden cheers Finland, Sweden NATO plans as Turkey balks (Reuters)  
Update #2: Biden pushes Finland and Sweden to join NATO as future of European security questioned (Yahoo News)   
WNU Editor: The US Senate will approve Sweden's and Finland's NATO application .... Senate on track to approve NATO bids of Finland and Sweden (Politico). Turkish President Erdogan is another story .... Erdoğan doubles down on threat to reject Finland and Sweden's NATO bids (Axios).
Update #3: Hmmmm .... I am now hearing growing opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO from opposition leaders in Italy and Bulgaria. Is this the reason why Biden had to go publicly today to show his support to Finland and Sweden to join NATO? After-all. If this was a done deal, why make this White House statement by the US President. 
As for Turkey's opposition. I am now hearing that Erdogan was not consulted on Finland and Sweden's NATO bids. And he is not alone. I am hearing other countries were also not consulted. If true, this is showing a lot of amateurism from the White House who first pushed and green-lighted this NATO bid by Finland and Sweden.]]></summary>

* The measure brings the total U.S. funding of the conflict to $54 million in two months 
* The bill passed 86-11 but a handful of Republican objectors complained that there were more pressing problems at home to tend to and 
* They also said the funding did not have adequate oversight 
* Biden is expected to quickly sign the bill, as he and Ukraine sounded the alarm that the nation would run out of aid by Thursday if Congress did not act

Yang said Washington should “have a clear understanding of the situation,” according to a statement posted online by his nation’s Foreign Ministry. “China will certainly take firm action to safeguard its sovereignty and security interests,” he added.

The Senate approved a massive military, economic, and humanitarian aid package.
 The Senate voted 86 to 11 to pass a $40 billion Ukraine aid package Thursday in the latest bipartisan signal of Washington’s deepening commitment to Ukraine’s grinding war against Russia.
The bill includes a huge one-time outlay of military and security assistance, along with funding for mounting economic and humanitarian needs. This latest legislation comes in addition to the $13.6 billion in emergency assistance for Ukraine that Congress approved in March, bringing the total of the United States’ Ukraine aid to a historic $53 billion since the start of the war.

Politico: Biden resists Ukrainian demands for long-range rocket launchers 
Officials in Kyiv say the weapons could help in the fight against Russia, but the White House is worried about escalating. 
Ukrainian officials are growing frustrated with the Biden administration’s resistance to providing U.S.-made long-range rocket systems, a weapon Kyiv says is critical to outgunning Russia in the heavy artillery duels raging across the Donbas. 
Officials across the Ukrainian government have pleaded with the U.S. for months to send the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. But three people familiar with the issue say the Ukrainians are concerned that the White House is holding back over worries the weapon could be used to launch strikes inside Russia, thereby expanding and prolonging the conflict.

Irina Borogan & Andrei Soldatov, CEPA: The Shadow War: Putin Strips Spies of Ukraine Role  
Behind-the-scenes maneuvering signals continuing battles for power among the Russian security forces, the siloviki. 
Vladimir Putin has removed Russia’s biggest intelligence agency, the FSB, from its role as the primary spy agency for the war in Ukraine and handed responsibility to a heavily militarized branch of military intelligence, the GRU. 
The new lead officer, Vladimir Alekseyev, the first deputy head of the GRU, is heavily implicated in several of Putin’s most serious attacks on the West over the past decade. He is accused by the UK and the European Union of overseeing the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury in 2018. An experienced special forces officer, he is also sanctioned by the US for direct cyber interference in the US 2016 election.

Update #2: Putin sacked the FSB and put the secretive GRU spy agency in charge of Ukraine intelligence after a string of failures, top Russian journalists say (Business Insider)   
WNU Editor: No one is really privy to how the Kremlin is conducting its war in Ukraine. But what we do know is that Putin's inner circle is still around him, particularly his top intelligence and military officials, and the military campaign continues in Ukrraine.]]></summary>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest loss since 2020 on Wednesday after another major retailer warned of rising cost pressures, confirming investors’ worst fears over rising inflation and rekindling the brutal 2022 sell-off. 
The Dow shed 1,164.52 points, or 3.57%, to 31,490.07, the average’s biggest decline since June 2020. It was the lowest close for the Dow since March 2021. 
The S&P 500 traded 4.04% lower to 3,923.68, also the worst drop since June 2020. 
The Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.73% to 11,418.15, which is the largest fall in the tech-heavy index since May 5. 
The selling was broad and intense on Wall Street with just eight members of the S&P 500 in the green.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FILE PHOTO: A view shows an armoured convoy of pro-Russian troops outside Donetsk   
Reuters: With troops in Ukraine, Russia's defence spending leaps 40% 
(Reuters) - Russia's defence spending was up nearly 40% in the first four months of the year, according to preliminary data released by the finance ministry on Wednesday, almost three months into Moscow's large-scale military campaign in Ukraine. 
Russia spent 1.7 trillion roubles ($26.4 billion) on defence between January and April, almost half the 3.5 trillion roubles, or 2.6% of GDP, budgeted for all of 2022. 
The ministry had initially forecast a budget surplus of 1% of GDP, or 1.3 trillion roubles, for 2022, but now expects a deficit of at least 1.6 trillion roubles, allowing for support payouts to counter the effect of an unprecedented barrage of Western economic sanctions.

Politico:  US to end Russia debt servicing allowance, says Treasury chief Janet Yellen  
She also floated the idea of imposing a tariff or price cap on Russian oil exports — which has yet to catch on in Brussels. 
BONN, Germany — Washington is willing to let a provision allowing Russia to make bond payments expire, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Wednesday — a move that increases the chance Moscow will default on its foreign debt. 
The clause, which falls under the U.S. sanctions regime, has allowed Russia to service its foreign debt so far with the approval of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It's set to expire on May 25. 
"The expectation was for it to be time limited. It’s reasonably likely to expect that the license will be left to expire," Yellen said, speaking to reporters in Bonn, Germany, ahead of a G7 finance ministerial meeting. "A final decision hasn’t been taken yet, but I think it’s unlikely that it would continue."

Update: US ‘likely’ to scrap Russia debt payment exemption: Yellen (AFP) 
WNU Editor: Russia's next debt payment is on May 27, two days after Moscow will be blocked from making a payment. My gut tells me that international financial markets are going to go through a roller coaster ride next week and beyond. 
On a side note.  After U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made her remarks, the Dow Jones tumbled 1,000 points (as of 14:00 EST). The blame is on poor results from Target and Walmart, but I think it is more than just that.]]></summary>

Reuters: Yellen: Not legal for U.S. to seize Russian official assets 
BONN, Germany (Reuters) -The United States does not have legal authority to seize Russian central bank assets frozen due to its invasion of Ukraine, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, but talks with U.S. partners over ways to make Russia foot the bill for Ukraine's post-war reconstruction are underway. 
Yellen also said it is likely that the special license granted to allow Russia to make payments to its U.S. bondholders would not be extended when it expires next week, leaving Russian officials a fast-narrowing window to avoid its first external debt default since the Russian revolution.

Update #1: Janet Yellen says 'it would not be legal now' for the US to seize Russian government assets to pay for Ukraine reconstruction (Business Insider)  
Update #2: Seizing Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine illegal – US (RT) 
WNU Editor: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was very careful in what she said. She said "it would not be legal now", meaning it may become legal in the future. My gut tells me that the decision to not return these seize assets has already been made, regardless on what happens in Ukraine or in Russia, and what Yellen said today was to not escalate the current tensions between the US and Russia.]]></summary>

   Daily Mail: Pentagon clears ITSELF over Syria war crimes: Review finds US troops did not deliberately kill 56 civilians including a woman and three children in airstrikes in 2019 and claims one child had taken up arms 
* Pentagon on Tuesday released findings from probe into 2019 strike on Baghuz 
* Four civilians were confirmed killed by US bombs as ISIS made its final stand 
* Now the Pentagon claims that the military did not violate the laws of war 
* Review acknowledges 'procedural mistakes' in the aftermath of the airstrikes 
* But no one, including the ground force commander, was disciplined 
A Pentagon investigation has determined that US troops did not commit war crimes or deliberately kill civilians in 2019 airstrikes in Syria that killed dozens of people, including women and children. 
The strikes on Baghuz, where desperate ISIS fighters were holed up and making their final stand, killed at least four civilians, but were kept secret for years until they came to light last fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US State Department announced a new unit Tuesday to research, document and publicize alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine.
The Conflict Observatory will "capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine," the department said.
The Observatory will collect publicly and commercially available information, including what is seen on social media and commercial satellite imagery, for use in current and future civil and criminal legal processes.
Nearly three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv says it has identified thousands of suspected war crimes cases.
Most notorious have been the allegations of wanton murder of scores of civilians in Bucha, just outside Kyiv.
The Observatory will create an online platform "to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses," the department said.
The Observatory will be a joint effort by the department; Esri, a mapping software company; Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab; the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai, which combines artificial intelligence-based analysis with satellite imagery and other data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US investigators believe someone on board deliberately crashed a China Eastern flight in March, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, in what was China's deadliest air disaster in decades.
China Eastern flight MU5375 was travelling from Kunming to Guangzhou on March 21 when it inexplicably plunged from an altitude of 29,000 feet into a mountainside, killing all 132 people on board.
So-called black box flight data recorders recovered from the site were sent to the United States for analysis.
That data shows that someone -- possibly a pilot or someone who had forced their way into the cockpit -- input orders to send the Boeing 737-800 into a nosedive, according to Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the probe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed guests at the Cannes Film Festival via video link on Tuesday as the annual event got under way.
Speaking during the opening ceremony, Zelensky drew a comparison to Charlie Chaplin's film "The Great Dictator" as he called on world cinema not to "remain silent" in the face of Russia's attack on Ukraine.
"Hundreds of people are dying every day," he said. "They will not get up after the final applause."
Afterwards, actress Julianne Moore officially opened the film festival, and the first film "Coupez!" (Final Cut) was screened.
The film by Michel Hazanavicius is a comedy set in a disused factory where the filming of a low-budget zombie film gets a little out of hand.
US Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, 60, also received a honorary Palme d'Or at the opening ceremony. Whitaker will present his film "For the Sake of Peace" in the French resort. It is about people who are working for peace in South Sudan.
The walls of shops and streets in Cannes are lined with film posters and a large "Top Gun" installation has been set up in front of the Grand Hôtel.
A giant pilot helmet points to one of the most anticipated screenings at the festival.
On Wednesday, Tom Cruise is scheduled to present "Top Gun: Maverick" - the sequel to the cult film from 1986.
The official poster for the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, which was designed as a homage to The Truman Show, is seen on the facade of the Palais des Festivals. The festival will take place from 17 to 28 May 2022. Frederick Injimbert/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa]]></summary>

Later repaired, the red Gibson's destruction at the French capital's Rock en Seine festival in 2009 was "a cult moment" in music history, said Jonathan Berg, a guitar expert and cofounder of the Artpeges gallery that held the auction.
With a starting price at 150,000 euros ($160,000), the auctioneers said bids for the guitar could have reached as high as 500,000 euros.
A flagship of the 1990s Britpop movement built around the notoriously fractious Gallagher brothers, Oasis scored global success, selling 60 million albums and birthing hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back In Anger".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power, air conditioning and railway service: such are the amenities of a sophisticated tunnel the length of five football fields, used to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the United States, said officials who made the shock discovery.
Federal authorities in California discovered the underground passageway last Friday as part of an investigation that led to the arrest and charging of six people, according to a Department of Justice criminal complaint.
Stretching from Tijuana, Mexico to a warehouse in Otay Mesa, south of San Diego, it is thought to be 1,744 feet (530 meters) long, 61 feet deep and four feet in diameter, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California said in a statement Monday.
Underground, officials found "reinforced walls, a rail system, electricity and a ventilation system."
Six people were charged with conspiring to distribute 1,762 pounds (800 kilograms) of cocaine, and officials also seized 164 pounds of methamphetamine and 3.5 pounds of heroin.
US Department of Homeland Security agents conducting surveillance on a suburban San Diego home tracked suspects to a stash location some 300 feet from the border. While inspecting the building, the agents discovered the tunnel access point, dug right out of the cement floor.
"There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel," US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a the statement. 
"We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities."
Cross-border tunnels are frequently used by traffickers who smuggle migrants lured by the "American dream," or drugs, into the United States, the world's largest consumer of South American cocaine. 
According to US figures, more than 90 tunnels have been discovered in southern California alone since 1993, including another "sophisticated" underground passageway located in March 2020.]]></summary>

The West has also put in place an unprecedented regime of sanctions with the goal of hampering Russia's economy and undermining the country's war machine.
During an event in Moscow on Tuesday, Peskov characterized the ongoing conflict as "a diplomatic war and a political war" between Russia and the Western nations backing Ukraine with economic and military support as well as intelligence.
"There are attempts to isolate us in the world. It's an economic war," said Peskov. "It is true that we keep referring to them mildly as unfriendly st…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Secret Service documents obtained by The Daily Dot show that agents charged with protecting former President Donald Trump feared that he would have a milkshake hurled at him during a 2019 trip to the United Kingdom.
Ahead of the trip, anti-fascists activists in the U.K. started a campaign called "Splash the Fash" that targeted far-right political figures such as Trump ally Nigel Farage with milkshakes.
To protect the then-president from the threat of getting pelted by a delicious summer treat, the Secret Service monitored social media accounts that fantasized about dousing him with milkshakes.
"We’ll have to keep an eye on SplashThe[Fash],” one Secret Service official wrote in a message obtained by The Daily Dot. “I’m sure it will get a lot of attention. I’ll pass it along to the person monitoring the trips.”

The official added that they would "not waste a milkshake" by using it to attack Trump.
At other points, the agents acknowledged that it would be very hard for them to contain all potential milkshakes that could potentially be lobbed at the president.
“At some point on this trip, one of the 4 of us is getting 'Milkshaked,'" one person in the Presidential Protective Division wrote in another message obtained by The Daily Dot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christina Bobb, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, struggled to explain this week why her boss would endorse Mehmet Oz for Senate if the candidate would not falsely say the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
In an interview with Bobb, Real America's Voice host Ed Henry explained that host David Brody had asked Oz why he had refused to call the election "rigged" or "stolen."
"I want to be careful," Oz replied.
Henry seemed shocked by the answer.
"As you know, Oz was a very controversial endorsement by your boss, Donald Trump," the anchor told Bobb. "And now you add to it, when asked by David Brody -- again, not in a gotcha way -- do you think the last election was stolen? He basically wouldn't answer."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were midway through their set when Islamist militants sprayed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris with gunfire, cutting down revelers, frontman Jesse Hughes recounted before a French court on Tuesday. 
Guitar technician Eden Galindo's first thought had been that the sound system was exploding, but Hughes said he knew instantly the venue was under attack.
"Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gun shots," Hughes told the trial of Salah Abdeslam, the only suspected surviving member of the squad that killed 130 people at several locations on November 13, 2015.
"I knew that death was coming," he said.
The assailants burst through the music hall's main entrance and blasted automatic gunfire into the crowd as the band played.
"We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming," Galindo told the court. "After a while they reloaded and a technician told us, 'next time they stop, we run'."
The band escaped through a side door but their tour manager was killed.
The attackers took hostages inside the music hall during an hours-long assault that claimed 90 lives and ended after police shot dead one militant and the two others detonated their suicide vests.
Survivors have recounted playing dead for hours, or hiding in cupboards, not knowing if their friends or relatives were still alive. They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.
Abdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.

He told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.
Six years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.
"Evil did not win," he said. "You can't kill rock and roll."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - His doctors probably don't agree but Pope Francis thinks a shot of tequila just might help his painful knee.
While his popemobile stopped in St. Peter's Square at his last general audience, a group of Mexican seminarians shouted out to him, asking how his leg was doing.
"It's being naughty," the Argentine pope replied in Spanish. A flare up of pain in his knee and existing leg problems have forced the pope to use a wheelchair at times recently.
One of seminarians then thanked the seated pope for continuing to carry out his duties despite the pain, telling the 85-year-old Francis that his persistence was an example for them as future priests.
Noting that they were Mexican because of the flag they were carrying, the pope said: "Do you know what I need for my leg? A bit of tequila."
After much laughter, one of them shouted back: "If one day we go to Santa Marta, we'll bring you a bottle," referring to the guest house where Francis lives in the Vatican.
One of the seminarians, Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, posted the exchange, which took place at the general audience last Wednesday, on TikTok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported that Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine is still running strong in Russia, with a Kremlin spokesperson telling the Russian people that invasion of Ukraine will "make life better" for them.
This is in spite of the fact that the ensuing embargo by western nations has caused the Russian economy to implode, with a leaked internal Kremlin forecast projecting the economy to shrink by 12 percent just this year alone.
""We are in fact now living in the conditions of a perfect storm and the moment of truth, that very storm and moment of truth that will ensure and protect our interests, and make it so that your lives are better, more comfortable, more stable, and more secure," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to Daily Beast reporter Allison Quinn. 
Peskov also claimed that "our president knows where he is leading our country" and that 'the whole country supports him.'"

Quinn skeptically notes that "the war that the Kremlin has depicted as a heroic crusade against nonexistent neo-Nazi leaders in Ukraine has led to hundreds of foreign companies cutting ties with Russia, killed as many as 27,000 Russian troops, and, according to Ukrainian intelligence, left Putin’s military in shambles."
Meanwhile, experts believe Russia's military has taken such heavy losses that their war aims may have to be scaled back again. Even Russian military analysts appear to be more pessimistic in their reports on state TV.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's extremely rare for a Russian military expert to criticize the performance of the country's armed forces. 
But according to Mikhail Khodaryonok, a defense analyst, his country's war in Ukraine isn't going according to President Vladimir Putin's plan -- and likely is failing.
The BBC's Francis Scarr, who regularly monitors Russian state TV, posted a subtitled video clip on Twitter in which Khodaryonok offered his bleak assessment of the war effort in Ukraine.
"First of all, we shouldn't take information tranquilizers," he said, "because sometimes information is spread about some morale and psychological breakdown in the Ukrainian armed forces, which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis of morale and so on. All of that, to put it mildly, is false."

Khodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, "despite the resistance of a single senator." Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.
"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future," Khodaryonok said. "and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse."
Watch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.

In an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation. It's fairly long but worth your time so I've added subtitles.pic.twitter.com/0mr7WAgSx6

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The number of people reported missing in violence-wracked Mexico has exceeded 100,000, according to official data, with rights groups calling for "immediate" action from the government to locate the disappeared.
The country's National Registry of Missing Persons -- which has been tracking disappearances since 1964 -- said that as of Monday, the whereabouts of 100,012 people are unknown. About 75 percent are men.
Disappearances have skyrocketed in the wake of mounting drug violence that has rocked the country for 16 years.
The Movement for Our Disappeared warned Monday that the figure was "certainly well below the number" of cases that are reported daily, calling for the government to "deal with this crisis in a comprehensive and immediate manner."

"Some existing fossil fuel licenses and production will need to be revoked and phased out early."
Led by Kelly Trout of Oil Change International, the study estimates that 40% of fossil fuel reserves at currently operational development sites across the globe must be left in the ground if the world is to have a 50-50 chance of adequately slashing carbon emissions and limiting warming to 1.5°C or below.

(Reuters) -Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies have lost their majority in Lebanon's parliament in a general election, a Reuters tally of final results showed on Tuesday, a major blow to the heavily armed group that reflects anger with Lebanon's ruling elite.
The Shi'ite Muslim movement and factions that support its possession of arms won around 62 of parliament's 128 seats in Sunday's election, a reversal of the 2018 result when they secured a majority of 71.
In the first election since Lebanon's economic collapse and the Beirut port explosion of 2020, reform-minded political newcomers won about a dozen seats, making an unexpectedly strong breakthrough into a system long dominated by the same groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sandstorm engulfed Saudi Arabia's capital and other regions of the desert kingdom Tuesday, hampering visibility and slowing road traffic.
A thick grey haze made iconic Riyadh buildings such as Kingdom Centre nearly impossible to see from more than a few hundred metres (yards) away, though there were no announced flight delays or cancellations.
The kingdom's meteorology centre forecast "surface dusty winds" in the country's east and in Riyadh, "reducing horizontal sight", according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
Dusty conditions were also expected farther west in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to the forecast.
Electronic signs along Riyadh's highways warned drivers to reduce their speed because of the lower visibility.
In central Riyadh, sand layered cars and buildings, and residents struggled to keep it out of their homes.
"Working outside is very difficult because of the dirt," a Pakistani construction worker who gave his name as Kalimullah told AFP as he installed tiles.
"I try to wash my face from time to time," the 30-year-old added, wrapping a piece of cloth around his face to block the sand.
Saudi office worker Abdullah Al-Otaibi said he was grateful he works indoors.

"Dust storms are part of our culture and we are used to it, but some of them are severe," said Al-Otaibi, 39, rubbing his eyes as he hurried into his office building.
Parts of Saudi Arabia typically see sandstorms between March and May, with varying intensity. The frequency of the storms has increased in recent months in the region.
Neighboring Iraq has experienced eight sandstorms since mid-April, a phenomenon fueled by soil degradation, intense droughts and low rainfall linked to climate change.
In Iran on Tuesday, government offices and schools and universities were closed in many provinces due to "unhealthy weather" and sandstorms, state media reported.

Last year, Maria Consuelo Porras was included in the list of "corrupt and anti-democratic actors" published by the U.S. State Department, singled out for thwarting corruption investigations with arrests and other actions.
"This wasn't a simple decision taken lightly," Giammattei said.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet late on Monday that "Attorney General Porra's corrupt acts undermine democracy in Guatemala," and called on Guatemalans to encourage accountability, respect and the rule of law.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Jean Castex handed in his resignation, paving the way for a cabinet overhaul after Macron's re-election in April.
Macron, who needs to show he has heard the frustrations of voters expressed by low turnout and big support for the far right and far left, has been looking for a premier with green and social policy credentials.
