        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox News’ Outnumbered have blasted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being “delusional” and making “patently false” comments about New York City’s rising crime in subway stations.

On Tuesday, AOC commented on the rising crime in New York City’s subway stations which is up by 44 per cent in 2022.

"Subway crime is up. But let's also note that subway crime is up after they committed so many more officers to the subway system. So that also tells us from a policy perspective, adding more cops to the subway isn't solving this problem,” the New York representative told a radio station.

The panel from Fox News’ Outnumbered blasted AOC for the comments, accusing her for not being “fit to serve”.

"It's absolutely, patently false for her to be saying that police presence does not deter crime and to blame violent attacks or rise in crime on our New York City's finest,” Emily Compagno said.

"She’s delusional," Co-host Lisa Kennedy added.

“She’s flat-out wrong. If she believes it, she’s not fit to serve”.]]></summary>

WNU Editor: The U.S. pushed for this meeting. Also nothing has been prepared. That is why I expect nothing will come out of this face-to-face talk. There is no common ground between the two sides on the major issues, and China has also made it very well known since the summer that they do not trust the Biden administration. 
Bottom line. 
I see this as nothing more but a photo-op, and a hope from the White House that a "personal bond" between the two leaders will come out of this brief meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - A Russian court on Thursday ordered the deportation of U.S. citizen Sarah Krivanek, who spent almost 11 months in detention in Russia on charges of assaulting her partner.
The decision was taken at a hearing in the city of Ryazan where Krivanek complained she had endured conditions "like hell" in a penal institution similar to the kind of prison colony to which U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner is currently being transferred.

Daily Mail: Iran has built a hypersonic weapon that can fly five times the speed of sound, move in and out of the atmosphere and strike advanced anti-missile systems, Tehran claims 
* Iran has built a hypersonic ballistic missile, General Amirali Hajizadeh claimed 
* Weapon can travel at high speed and manoeuvre to avoid defences, he said 
* Achievement is 'generational leap' in Iran's missile technology, general bragged 
* Russia is known to possess hypersonics while China and the US are testing them 
Iran claims to have developed a hypersonic missile that is unstoppable by all current anti-air defences. 
General Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the IRGC's aerospace unit, said Thursday that Tehran now possesses a ballistic missile that moves at 'high speed and can manoeuvre in and out of the atmosphere' - making it harder to shoot down. 
General Hajizadeh said the missile is designed to target enemy anti-air systems and is a 'generational leap' forward in terms of Tehran's military technology.

WNU editor: I am skeptical of these Iranian reports. This technology is not easy to develop. The U.S. is playing catch-up on this technology, and the only other two countries that are developing these type of missiles are Russia and China.

Reuters: Ukraine seizes stakes in strategic companies under wartime laws 
KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine said on Monday it had invoked wartime laws to take control of stakes in a top engine-maker and four other strategic companies from some of the country's richest men. 
It was the first time the government had used martial law for such a move since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the move was needed to help meet the defence sector's urgent needs during the war. 
It was also the government's most dramatic intervention of the war into big business, touching companies linked to tycoons whose political power Zelenskiy's team has long sought to curb.

WNU Editor: There is going to be long term consequences from this action. No one will want to invest in Ukraine knowing that its government could seize it assets at a moment's notice. 
This is why Putin has resisted demands from hardliners to seize the assets of Western companies that have left. He knows by not seizing their assets keeps the door open for them to eventually return to Russian once the war is over.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NBC News 
WNU Editor: I can say with confidence that if there was any hope in some foreign capitals that the US midterm elections would signal a change in US foreign policy .... sighhhh .... those hopes were all but extinguished this morning. 
Bottom line.
The US midterm elections results were not a repudiation of President Biden's foreign policies or decisions. I would even say that for a majority of Americans it was not even on their top 10 issues of concern. 
The debacle and surrender in Afghanistan. The war in Ukraine. Growing tensions with China. Worsening tensions with North Korea. The fracturing of the global order into multi-polar blocs that are hostile to US interests. The weaponization of the US dollar's status as the world's global reserve currency. All of these issues were not raised, debated, or discussed. 
What this means is that there will be no personnel changes or changes in policies when it comes to the Pentagon and national security issues, imposing financial and economic sanctions as a tool of US foreign policy, the war in Ukraine, and raising tensions against China.
My biggest worry is that there are probably some in the White House who will see the elections results as a green-light to double down on their policies. 
What this means is even more support and involvement, maybe even direct involvement, in the war in Ukraine. The weaponization of the dollar. A more aggressive posture against China. And an even more aggressive approach towards countries like Saudi Arabia to not divert away from the American sphere of influence as they try their best to distance themselves away from Washington DC (i.e. Saudi Crown Prince Salman meeting Chinese President Xi next month to foster closer ties).
I do not see any lessening of tensions in 2023. In fact. I see it becoming far worse as the US does what it feels it must do to maintain its status as the world's global super-power.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities in western Iran went on strike Wednesday in solidarity with mourners marking 40 days since security forces killed dozens in a crackdown on protests in the country's strife-torn southeast, a rights group said.
Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.
The crackdown on nationwide protests since her death has killed at least 304 people, including 41 children and 24 women, according to a combined toll issued…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama attend a campaign for Democratic senatorial candidate John Fetterman and Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Picture: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
WNU editor: President Biden and the White House should be happy. Correction. They should be overjoyed!
All the expectations of a red wave fell flat.

Keeping control of the US Senate will mean his court and executive office appointees will still be approved.
There is an outside chance that the Democrats may still keep control of the House of Representatives. But even if they do lose the House, the Republican majority will be so small, maybe by a seat or two, that blocking the President's agenda will be challenge for the Republican leadership. 
Within the Democrat party itself, the push to convince President Biden to not run in the 2024 Presidential race is going to fall silent. 
President Biden, at least publicly, has stated that he will run in 2024. Unless there is a change in his physical health by then, he and Kamala Harris will be on the ticket for 2024. 
And as to questions on President Biden's mental capacity to run in 2024. As John Fetterman's Senate victory in Pennsylvania has shown. Being mentally impaired after suffering a stroke and facing years of rehabilitation was not an obstacle for him to run for office and to win convincingly. 
So what do I expect from the White House in the next two years?
I expect the White House, with help from the media, to say that this election cycle validated President Biden's policies, and he has mandate to continue on. 
Policy wise the White House and the Democrats in Congress are going to double down on their domestic agenda and policies. Ditto on foreign policy.]]></summary>

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.

The Cradle:  US to establish new military base in northeastern Syria 
US troops recently set up another military base in Naqara village, just three kilometers from the northeastern province of Hasakah 
The US-led international coalition forces operating in northeastern Syria intend to establish a new military base in their controlled areas in the countryside of Raqqa. 
Local sources said that a convoy of US forces, including several armored military vehicles, arrived in Raqqa city as part of preparations to install a new base in the area. 
On the field, the illegal troops began transferring the logistical equipment and necessary gear to the specified location, coinciding with heavy surveillance drone activity.

The standard practice of inscribing serial numbers during inspections turns out to be counterproductive. 
A maintenance procedure used by Air Force mechanics to document inspections likely damaged hundreds of C-130 propeller blades over a decade, according to service officials. 
Maintenance technicians examining the propeller blades for cracks or other damage scratched permanent marks on each blade to document the inspection had taken place. 
 “The process used to engrave serial numbers on the propellers likely contributed to cracks that are being found on the C-130Hs,” Maj. Beau Downey, an Air Force spokesperson, said in an email. “That process, which involved an electric arc pen to incise digits into the surface of the metal, was stopped about six months ago and will not be used going forward.

* For this winter, Europe’s gas storage is more than 90% full, according to the International Energy Agency, providing some assurance against a major shortage. 
* But a large proportion of that is made up of Russian gas imported in previous months, which likely won’t be available at all by winter of 2023. 
* This could lead to significant social unrest — already, small to medium-sized protests have cropped up around Europe. 
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Politicians and governments around the world are bracing for potential civil unrest as many countries grapple with mounting energy costs and rising inflation. 
The global economy is facing an onslaught from multiple sides — a war in Europe, and shortages of oil, gas and food, and high inflation, each of which has worsened the next.
Concerns are centered on the coming winter, especially for Europe. Cold weather, combined with an oil and gas shortage stemming from Western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, threatens to upend lives and businesses.

WNU Editor: The above Bloomberg video summarizes what I have been saying for the past 3 months. Europe's decision to cut-off Russian natural gas after filling its reserves means higher energy prices this winter. 
But next year, with no access to Russian gas, will mean a rush to obtain energy supplies on the global market. This means only one thing. Even higher prices next winter, and the very real possibility of shortages.]]></summary>

To replace Russian gas, Europe is buying up fuel that used to go to developing countries. 
(Bloomberg) — Bills will be high, but Europe will survive the winter: It’s bought enough oil and gas to get through the heating seasons. 
Much deeper costs will be borne by the world’s poorest countries, which have been shut out of the natural gas market by Europe’s suddenly ravenous demand. 
It’s left emerging market countries unable to meet today’s needs or tomorrow’s, and the most likely consequences — factory shutdowns, more frequent and longer-lasting power shortages, the foment of social unrest — could stretch into the next decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: There is no red tsunami. The predictions were wrong. 
The Republicans have lost two Governor-ships. Massachusetts and Maryland. It also looks like Kari Lake will not win the Governorship in Arizona as many Republicans were hoping. 
In regards to the US Senate. Georgia is headed to a run-off election. Pennsylvania is trending towards Democrat John Fetterman, but there are still a lot of votes to count outside the big cities. If all other trends continue, Georgia may decide who will be the majority party in the US Senate. 
I am also looking at the Senate race in Alaska. Because of how the vote is decided, the Democrats may actually win the state. 
The Republicans will win the House of Representatives. They have already flipped 5 seats, and leading in a number of others. This is the big story of the day.

Bottom line. I expect gridlock in Washington. The key is the US Senate. If Republicans win 51 seats, President Biden's appointees are not going to be easily approved.]]></summary>

Axios: Zelensky sets high bar for any peace talks with Putin 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Monday that Ukraine is prepared to negotiate with Russia if certain conditions are met, including the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, punishment of war criminals and compensation for Kyiv for the invasion. 
Between the lines: U.S. officials have reportedly been privately urging Zelensky — who said in September that he'd only negotiate with Russia's next president, not Vladimir Putin — to signal openness to talks. 
Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's several conditions for any such talks and one of his top aides denied Tuesday that Kyiv felt any pressure to negotiate.

Who will be the next NATO chief in the coming ear? Chrystia Freeland is more suitable for the post of the NATO chief according to some NATO officials. 
Chrystia Freeland, the deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Canada could replace Jens Stoltenberg as a NATO secretary general unless his term is extended, an American newspaper reported on Friday, citing a US official familiar with the debate. With the tenure of NATO’s current chief, Jens Stoltenberg, scheduled to end next fall, who among the allies should replace him? Besides Chrystia Freeland, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova, and ex-Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, who also was Croatia's ambassador to the US and an assistant secretary general for public diplomacy at NATO, are named as strong contenders from the European Union, according to the report. UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace is another contender for the post, the newspaper cited UK officials as saying.

Deep into a seven-hour congressional hearing on Sept. 21, Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, pressed Dimon on whether his bank would sever ties with Russian companies including energy giant Gazprom PJSC. 
Banks like Dimon’s, Sherman argued, were exploiting a sanctions loophole to keep doing business in Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine.  “We are following the instructions of the American government as they asked us to do it,” Dimon responded before Sherman cut him off, setting his sights on Citigroup Inc.’s Jane Fraser with a similar inquiry.
The exchange put on display how the country’s largest banks are caught in the push-pull between the Biden administration and Congress on sanctions. Behind the scenes, the Treasury and State Departments have urged banking giants including JPMorgan and Citigroup to keep doing business with certain strategic Russian firms, according to people familiar with the situation.

"I would tell you things about him that won't be very flattering — I know more about him than anybody — other than, perhaps, his wife,” the former president told Fox News Digital.

The comments come after Donald Trump last week referred to the Florida governor as "Ron DeSanctimonious" when reacting to his re-election campaign advertisement.

Both Ron DeSantis and the former president continue to be seen as the two most favoured candidates for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2024.

While neither Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis have declared a run for the White House, the former president told his supporters he has a “big announcement” coming on November 15.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

Daily Express: World’s largest nuclear submarine leaves Gibraltar to make way for Black Sea

The world’s largest nuclear submarine has been spotted leaving Gibraltar under intense protection from the Royal Marines as it reportedly heads towards the Black Sea.

Update: U.S. nuclear submarine dubbed ‘rider of the apocalypse’ enters the Mediterranean -- Asia Markets   
WNU Editor: I am skeptical that Turkey will permit the USS Rhode Island to cross the Bosporus Strait to Enter the black Sea. Turkey has made it very clear that they will permit no warships to cross the strait with the current war now underway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
