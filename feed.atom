The United States, Germany and several other European countries are lining up to send Kyiv dozens of advanced combat tanks over the next few months to help boost Ukraine's military capacity as the war approaches the 12-month mark.

* Risk of conflict between Chinese, US militaries has increased as both sides boost deterrence capabilities, experts say 
* Top US commanders have predicted military conflict with China may happen in the near future 
A warning by a US air force commander that a military conflict with mainland China could come as early as 2025 implies the American military is gearing up combat readiness over Taiwan, according to analysts, who said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would also boost its deterrence capabilities. 
The latest warning was from Mike Minihan, the head of the Air Mobility Command, who said war over Taiwan might happen as soon as 2025. 
In an internal memorandum that first emerged on social media on Friday, Minihan, a US four-star general, urged his commanders to push their units to achieve maximum operational battle readiness this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Blinken reaffirms need for two-state solution as he lands in Israel 
TEL AVIV (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel and Palestinians to calm tensions as he visited on Monday during the worst violence in years, reaffirming a long-stalled peace vision as the "only path" forward. 
While focusing censure on a Palestinian gun spree outside a synagogue that has put Israel on high alert, Blinken also cautioned against any celebration or avenging of such bloodshed. 
Seven people were shot dead in Friday's attack by an East Jerusalem man who was himself killed by police. Lionised by many fellow Palestinians, he had no known links to militant groups. 
A day earlier, Israel carried out an unusually deep raid on Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing 10 residents, most of them gunmen. At least 35 Palestinians, including fighters and civilians, have died in violence surging since Jan. 1, medical officials say.

WNU Editor: The US and Israel have just completed the largest joint military exercise ever. The CIA Director was in Israel just a few days ago. And now U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives for a two day visit. Something is obviously up.

— Bloomberg (@business) January 30, 2023
    Reuters: Azerbaijan to evacuate embassy in Iran on Sunday after fatal shooting 
BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan will evacuate embassy staff and family members from Iran on Sunday, the foreign ministry said, two days after a gunman shot dead a security guard and wounded two other people in an attack Baku branded an "act of terrorism". 
Police in Tehran have said they had arrested a suspect and Iranian authorities condemned Friday's incident, but said the gunman appeared to have had a personal, not a political, motive. 
The incident came amid increased tensions between the neighbouring countries over Iran's treatment of its large ethnic Azeri minority and over Azerbaijan's decision this month to appoint its first ever ambassador to Israel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico/AP:  Drones reportedly attack convoy in east Syria coming from Iraq  
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack on the convoy in the border region of Boukamal. 
BEIRUT — Drones attacked a convoy of trucks in eastern Syria Sunday night shortly after it crossed into the country from Iraq, Syrian opposition activists and a pro-government radio station said. 
There was no immediate word on casualties. 
The strike comes amid heightening tension between Iran and its rivals in the region.  It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack on the convoy in the Syrian border region of Boukamal, which is a stronghold of Iran-backed militias. 
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said the drones appear to have been from the U.S.-led coalition, adding that they targeted six refrigerated trucks. The group said there were casualties and ambulances rushed to the area.

The Wall Street Journal came out with a similar report, stating that Israel and the Mossad were behind the attack, citing US officials. 
There were four large explosions at the military industry factory, documented on social media, against a facility developing advanced weapons. The damage goes far beyond the “minor roof damage” that the Islamic Republic claimed earlier Sunday and has falsely claimed in past incidents.

Officials say an explosion at a mosque in Peshawar, northwestern Pakistan, has caused multiple casualties. 
More than 40 people have been killed and about 150 others wounded in a suicide bomb attack targeting police at a mosque in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, according to officials. 
Sarbakaf Mohmand, a commander for the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack on Twitter. The main spokesman for the group was not immediately available for comment. 
Earlier, a Lady Reading Hospital spokesperson in Peshawar, Muhammed Asim, told Al Jazeera at least 32 people were killed and more than 70 injured people were brought in for treatment. A Peshawar police official told Al Jazeera about 150 people were wounded in total.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo Source: Official Twitter page of German chancellor Olaf Scholz    
The Hill: Germany warns against arms race as Ukraine pushes for missiles, jets 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is warning against a race to arm Ukraine with high-powered weapons as Ukraine ramps up its calls for fighter jets and long-range missiles. 
Scholz engineered a breakthrough with President Biden to send modern tanks to Ukraine earlier this month, but has said fighter jets is a non-starter. 
“I can only advise against entering into a constant competition to outbid each other when it comes to weapons systems,” Scholz said in an interview with German news outlet Tagesspiegel. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued pleas over the weekend for long-range missiles and fighter jets as he seeks to strengthen the country’s air defense.    But Germany has insisted the country will not be equipping Ukraine with the warplanes.    
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I understand the German Chancellor's concerns. But what I find so astounding about the recent announcements from the West to ship weapons and ammunition to Ukraine is how small it actually is, and the time to deliver them. 
Case in point. The US will only be able to send Ukraine 31 Abrams tanks later this year?!?!?! You would think that with the defense budget that the US has, sending 31 tanks could be done much faster. 
And then there is artillery. This conflict is primarily a war being conducted by artillery. Making promises to send Ukraine about 90,000 artillery shells is pathetically small. This is what the Russian army uses up in 5 days. 
So are "high-powered" weapons the only option left. F-16s and long-range missiles that can strike deep in Crimea and Russia?  It looks like the answer is yes, because there is nothing else left.]]></summary>

Reuters: Zelenskiy: Ukraine needs more weapons, faster 
Ukraine needs new weapons and faster deliveries to confront a "very tough" situation of constant attacks by Russian forces in the eastern Donetsk region, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday. 
"The situation is very tough. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other sectors in Donetsk region -- there are constant Russian attacks. There are constant attempts to break through our defences," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. 
"Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We have to speed up events, speed up supplies and open up new weapons options for Ukraine." 
The General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces said earlier on Sunday that its forces repelled an attack near Blahodatne in the eastern part of the Donetsk region, while Russia's Wagner private military group said it took control of the village. 
A later military statement made no mention of Blahodatne.

CAIRO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the Middle East on Sunday, beginning a three-day visit as violence flares between Israelis and Palestinians, and with Iran and the war in Ukraine high on the agenda. 
After a stop in Cairo Blinken will head on Monday to Jerusalem, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new right-wing government has stirred concern at home and abroad over the future of Israel's secular values, frayed ethnic relations and stalled peace talks with the Palestinians. 
There has also been a spate of deadly violence in recent days, heightening fears that already spiralling violence will further escalate.

   Newsweek: Did Alexa 'Predict' World War III Start Date in Viral Video? 
A viral video purports to show Amazon assistant Alexa giving the exact date for a Russian attack on Germany that it says will mark the beginning of the new World War. 
"World War III starts on November 23, 2023 at 6:05pm, when Russia launches an attack against Germany," the voice-activated gadget appears to say, in response to a question about the start of World War III. 
The video, or versions of it, have been shared on TikTok and on Twitter, with just one post gathering more than 200,000 engagements in just a day. 
"I'll give it to you again  "Alexa is World War 3 November 23, 2023  "From 6:05 pm  "Answer: Russia will attack Germany," the caption says.

WNU Editor: It is a hoax. But what I find fascinating are the hundreds of thousands of views from people who want to know when will World War III start (myself included).]]></summary>

EurAsian Times: $108B Not Enough! Germany Says Its Defense Budget Insufficient To Overhaul Military Amid Russia-Ukraine War 
The new German Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has made alarming observations about Berlin’s ambitious defense spending just days after taking over the reins after Christine Lambrecht’s resignation. 
Boris Pistorius recently said in an interview that the special defense fund of 100 billion euros ($108.5 billion) would not be sufficient for Germany to modernize its military and pay for equipment maintenance.
“The 100 billion euros will not be enough,” the SPD politician told the Süddeutsche Zeitung. “We also have new maintenance costs with every new system. So with every new device, there are new and higher running costs.”

SANTIAGO DE CHILE (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a new, expanded commodities partnership with Chile on Sunday during a tour of South America that Berlin hopes will help secure more access to critical minerals key to the transition to a green economy. 
Europe's largest economy has fallen behind in the race for critical minerals in part due to a distaste for the dirty business of mining as well as faith in the open market, German government officials say. 
That has led to a reliance on China, which has invested widely in the mining sector in resource-rich South America and in processing commodities.

WNU Editor: The German government needs access to secure supplies of lithium if it ever wants to achieve its goal of a "green economy". Hence the German Chancellor's visit to Argentina and Chile (see above graph).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: German chancellor says he won't send fighter jets to Ukraine 
The German chancellor has ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine, just days after committing to supplying tanks. 
In an interview with a German newspaper, Olaf Scholz warned against a bidding war for weapons. 
But Ukraine has asked allied nations to create a "fighter jet coalition" to bolster their capabilities. 
The US said it would discuss the idea of supplying jets "very carefully" with Kyiv on Thursday. 
In an interview with Tagesspiegel, Mr Scholz said his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks. 
"The fact we've only just made a decision [on sending tanks] and the next debate is firing up in Germany, that just seems frivolous", he said.

WNU Editor: German Chancellor Scholz has said numerous times in the past year that Germany will not send to Ukraine certain weapons, but once put under pressure caved-in and sent it anyway. I predict the same will happen with fighter jets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A top Republican in the U.S. Congress on Sunday said the odds of conflict with China over Taiwan "are very high," after a U.S. general caused consternation with a memo that warned that the United States would fight China in the next two years. 
In a memo dated Feb. 1 but released on Friday, General Mike Minihan, who heads the Air Mobility Command, wrote to the leadership of its roughly 110,000 members, saying, "My gut tells me we will fight in 2025." 
"I hope he is wrong. ... I think he is right though," Mike McCaul, the new chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, told Fox News Sunday.

Douglas Macgregor, American Conservative: This Time It’s Different 
Neither we nor our allies are prepared to fight all-out war with Russia, regionally or globally. 
Until it decided to confront Moscow with an existential military threat in Ukraine, Washington confined the use of American military power to conflicts that Americans could afford to lose, wars with weak opponents in the developing world from Saigon to Baghdad that did not present an existential threat to U.S. forces or American territory. This time—a proxy war with Russia—is different. 
Contrary to early Beltway hopes and expectations, Russia neither collapsed internally nor capitulated to the collective West’s demands for regime change in Moscow. Washington underestimated Russia’s societal cohesion, its latent military potential, and its relative immunity to Western economic sanctions. 
As a result, Washington’s proxy war against Russia is failing. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was unusually candid about the situation in Ukraine when he told the allies in Germany at Ramstein Air Base on January 20, “We have a window of opportunity here, between now and the spring,” admitting, “That’s not a long time.”

Even the RAND Corporation in its latest report on the Russia - Ukraine war is acknowledging that the US better start searching for an off ramp to this conflict, and soon ....

Daily Mail: Now they're coming from CANADA: Northern border sees 743% spike in illegal migrants trying to cross in a year due to 'easier entry than Mexico' - as cops release eerie images of asylum seekers trudging through 12F snow 
* Between October 1 and December 31, the Border Patrol's Swanton Sector - covering Vermont and New Hampshire - saw a surge in migrant encounters 
* Agents reported a 743 percent increase in apprehensions and encounters compared to the same period the year prior 
* Border Patrol officials say they are worried that migrants are unaware of how cold it can get, and say people traffickers are exploiting their desperation 
Border Patrol working in the north of the US have reported a 743 percent rise in migrant encounters compared to the same period a year ago.

He warned traffickers are exploiting desperate asylum seekers with potentially lethal consequences, amid freezing temperatures and dangerous passages.

WNU Editor: While many of these migrants do travel to cross the border from Canada to the US, many stay in Canada. I live in Canada, and as long time readers of this blog know, I have been warning of Canada's migrant crisis for years. The difference now is that the illegal surge is beyond what it has been in the past, and it is impacting Canadians directly from the lack and/or high cost of of rental housing units, to low wages in the job market. And here is an easy prediction. It is going to get worse. Much worse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global Research: Zelenskyy Regime to Forcibly Conscript Hungarians in Transcarpathia 
Ultranats terrorize Transcarpathians by kidnapping and throwing them into the Russian meat grinder. 
The Zelenskyy regime is desperate. It is reportedly losing more than 300 soldiers a day in eastern Ukraine. The latest effort by the doomed regime to throw men and foreign war materiel at a slow and overpowering Russian advance in Donbas will completely fall apart. 
The regime is now busy abducting potential bullet stoppers in the Zakarpattia Oblast (Ruthenia), situated in the Carpathian Mountains of southwestern Ukraine, between Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. 
“Due to heavy losses, which exceed all previous ones, radical methods are used to replenish the numbers [of troops]. According to local sources, the Ukrainian authorities plan to call up 10,000 people from Transcarpathia by spring,” Hungarian journalists told EuroWeekly.

Update: Are Transcarpathian Hungarians taken by force to die against the Russians? (Daily Hungarian)   
WNU Editor: Ukrainian officials and the media are calling these reports a Russian "disinformation campaign" .... Transcarpathian Hungarians respond to Szijjarto's claim about their alleged forced mobilization (Ukrinform). And I understand it from their point of view. If you are in Ukraine and you are a citizen, you will be conscripted. 
And as for reports that Ukrainian "press gangs" are very active in grabbing men off the streets throughout Ukraine. This is sadly very true. Ukraine is running out of soldiers, and they need to replenish what they have lost ASAP.]]></summary>

The SUN: SHOCK & ROLL Army hammering out emergency plan to keep Putin’s hands off top secret British armour if tanks are damaged in Ukraine 
THE Army is thrashing out emergency plans to recover British tanks if they are damaged in Ukraine — to stop their top secret armour and technology falling into Russian hands. 
The fearsome Challenger 2s are protected by world-beating Chobham armour made from a secret blend of ceramics, steel and shock-absorbing compounds.  Britain led the world by pledging 14 Challenger 2s to Ukraine — but defence sources say it would be a nightmare if one was captured by Vladimir Putin’s invaders. 
His military scientists would then be free to study the armour and how to defeat it.  A source explained: “The British armour is the best in the world. 
“In the history of Challenger 2s only one has been destroyed in battle and that was by friendly fire in Iraq.

Warzone/The Drive: Ukraine Situation Report: Kyiv Improving Airfields Anticipating Western Fighters  
Ukraine’s Air Force spokesman says work is underway to upgrade airfields for Western fighter jets even though none have been promised yet. 
Unlike the recent influx of promises for western tanks, Ukraine has yet to receive any solid offers of modern fighter jets from allies like the U.S., France, the Netherlands, Denmark and others. But it’s preparing airfields across the country in anticipation of deliveries of multi-role jets like U.S.-made F-16 Fighting Falcons or French Mirage or Rafale fighters. 
To integrate jets like those into the Ukrainian Air Force would not only require training for pilots and maintainers, but it would also require making sure more modern jets have safe places to operate from. 
“We have to prepare the airfield infrastructure so that pilots could land safely on the airstrips,” Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Col. Yuri Ignat told reporters Friday at a press briefing in Ukraine. “The works are in progress in different regions of Ukraine with the support of the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Defense and other government agencies to support us in the creation of this airfield network.”

Reuters: Ukraine in talks with allies about getting long-range missiles - aide

After missiles and fighter jets, Ukraine will be demanding the stationing of NATO troops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al Jazeera: Peru Congress rejects president’s early elections request  
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7. 
Peru’s Congress has rejected a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership. 
Lawmakers agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024. But in a plenary session held during Saturday’s early hours, Congress rejected the proposal, with 45 votes in favour, 65 against and two abstentions.
Left-wing parties demanded that the advancement of elections be accompanied by a constitutional convention – something protesters have repeatedly called for. 
“With this vote, the constitutional reform proposal for the advancement of elections is rejected,” Congress President Jose Williams said, after more than seven hours of debate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Petr Pavel: Ex-general beats populist rival in Czech election 
Retired Nato general Petr Pavel has been elected as the new president of the Czech Republic, seeing off his populist challenger Andrej Babis. 
The 61-year-old took 57.6% of the vote, initial results released by the state statistics office showed. 
Mr Babis - who served as prime minister between 2017 and 2021 - conceded defeat in a speech to supporters soon after the results were announced. 
The ex-general will replace Milos Zeman, whose second term ends in March. 
The second-round runoff between Mr Babis and Mr Pavel was portrayed as a contest between populist oligarchy and liberal democracy. 
The elections' results follow an ill-tempered campaign marred by alleged death threats and disinformation.

The Central Intelligence Agency is using artificial intelligence and machine learning to parse through data and alert officials to global developments, but one of the agency’s top analysts doesn’t see ChatGPT or any other bots giving the president’s daily brief anytime soon. 
Linda Weissgold, deputy director for analysis at the CIA, said the agency has made “a lot of progress” in using artificial intelligence and machine learning, with the agency developing many tools in-house.
“I think one of the most difficult things we have as analysts right now is the amount of data that’s out there, and how do you make sure that you don’t miss something?” Weissgold said during a Jan. 24 event hosted by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic's presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society's political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

Politico:  Nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula are accelerating dramatically  
As the global security environment becomes more challenging, the need to adapt alliances increases as well. 
 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has sent a nuclear shot across the bow, declaring earlier this month that if problems get worse, “our country will introduce tactical nuclear weapons or build them on our own.” 
And his remark should send alarm bells ringing in Washington and allied capitals across Europe and Asia. 
Yoon’s statement — which he emphasized didn’t constitute official policy — came in response to a highly belligerent speech by North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un in December. Already following a year in which North Korea tested more missiles of all ranges than in any previous 12-month period, Kim announced that Pyongyang would start “mass-production of tactical nuclear weapons,” leading to “an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal.” And few would be surprised if he decided to conduct a seventh nuclear weapons test this year.

WNU Editor: I am sure South Korea, if it wants, can build nuclear weapns very quickly. But this will contravene international law, break anti-proliferation treaties, and result in sanctions.    
Update: With all the problems and crisis in the world, why is this US politician bringing this up .... US Navy Warship ‘Seized’ By North Korea During Intelligence Gathering Mission Must Be Returned: US Lawmaker (EurAsian Times).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination," Murangira said.
"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB."
"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime."
Rwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.
In the face of relentless protests, Bolu…]]></summary>

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children's hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.
The vast majority of children are suffering from "moderate to severe malnutrition," complicated by other ailments including pneumonia, malaria and the stomach flu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”
“Fine, but first let’s distinguish between a sin …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the "toxicity" of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, "and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes", Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was "now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire", Cumming said.
"So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!"
The queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man was crushed to death by a "telescopic" urinal in central London on Friday, despite the efforts of ambulance crews, an air ambulance and firefighters.
Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London's West End, the city's theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a "telescopic urinal" when he became trapped, police said.
"We're sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene," Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
"Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration," said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence," added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a "quagmire."
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran's government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
"The victim publicized (the) Iranian government's human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution," Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A British teenager was on Friday sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for videos promoting racist violence that have been linked to two mass killings in the United States.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, "highly dangerous" and a "propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology".
"You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you," Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

For generations, the young religious zealot -- hanged the following year -- was roundly despised as the archvillain of India's long struggle to free itself from British colonial rule.

Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.
Phew.
The rock, which was spotted for the first time on Saturday by an amateur stargazer in Crimea, came closest to the southern tip of South America at around 0029 GMT Friday, according to scientists who were tracking it.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS," he wrote. "SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!"
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES," Trump said. "Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!"
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a "genius" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.]]></summary>

The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
"Before encountering Earth, the asteroid's orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth's orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun," NASA said in a statement. "After its encounter, the asteroid's orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth's and Mars' orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days."
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.]]></summary>

I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969).
