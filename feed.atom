Business Insider: The US Navy now knows why the water on an aircraft carrier looked and smelled strange. It had wastewater in it. 
* The US Navy found last month that the water on an aircraft carrier had an "odor and cloudy appearance." 
* The service said early last week it didn't know why the water looked and smelled strange. 
* An inspection has since concluded that wastewater had entered the system. 
A month after sailors on the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln first noticed their water looked and smelled strange, the service has finally determined that it was polluted with wastewater that leaked into the water supply. 
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and USS Abraham Lincoln personnel inspected the potable water tanks and determined on October 20 that "bilge water entered one of the potable water tanks through a hole that was found in the tank's air vent line, causing the cloudy appearance and odor in the ship's potable water," the Navy said in a recent statement.

* Footage posted online showed scenes of devastation at the site of the festival, reportedly attacked by two jets 
* The festival was celebrating anniversary celebration of the Kachin ethnic group's main political organisation 
* Local reports said at least 60 people were killed and more were injured, but true figure could be higher 
* If confirmed, the casualties represent most deadly attack by military junta since seizing power in 2021 
 * The military coup ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was thrown in prison 
Air strikes by Myanmar's military junta on a music festival killed dozens of people on Sunday, members of an ethnic minority group and rescue workers said. 
Singers and musicians were among those killed in the strikes apparently targeting an anniversary celebration of the Kachin ethnic group's main political organisation, in the country's north. 
The attack, reported to have been carried out by two Myanmar military jets, comes three days before Southeast Asian foreign ministers are to hold a special meeting in Indonesia to discuss widening violence in Myanmar.

The Conservative Party has picked its next leader. Now comes the hard part. 
 After a week — or, really, months — of tumult, the United Kingdom will have a new prime minister: Rishi Sunak. 
When Sunak, the son of immigrants of Indian descent, officially becomes prime minister, in the next 24 hours, he will be Britain’s first prime minister of color. It’s a historic victory, and Conservatives are celebrating what they hope will be his steadying tenure in an incredibly difficult moment for Sunak’s party and country.

The exercises, called “Mighty Iran,” began on October 17. The exact location has not been specified, but Iranian media placed them in between Iran’s provinces of Ardabil and East Azerbaijan, the part of Iran across the Aras from Azerbaijan’s Fuzuli region. One expert on open-source intelligence, however, analyzed photos of the pontoon crossing and placed it across from Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan.

The International Monetary Fund has said that it expects inflation pressures to be significant around the world in 2022. Inflation is predicted to be worse in developing economies, where price increases are projected to reach 9.9 percent on average over the course of this year. In developed nations, this number was put at 7.2 percent by the IMF.

WNU Editor: There is a lot of manipulation in these statistics. Shadowstats sees (link here) US inflation at around 16%, not between 5% - 9.9%.

Here we go again.  Anyone who’s ever been around a toddler understands that if you respond to the tantrum with a reward – giving them the toy or the cookie or whatever they ask for – you’re essentially training the child to have tantrums. .  And that’s exactly what’s happening now, with the international media tricking climate protesters into throwing food and sticking to walls in order to publicize their manifestos.
The latest group of climate protesters having a food fight over priceless artwork were two Germans who threw mashed potatoes at a painting by the French impressionist Claude Monet“Cereal wheelsat the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, Germany, then stuck their hands on the wall near the painting, shouting about climate change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far back as 2015, there were rumors that Trump was having trouble with powerful women. He doesn’t like them. Women will be judged 1-10 on The Howard Stern Show. John Barron called a New York Post reporter to talk about who Trump was with. Trump doesn’t like powerful women who can confront him face-to-face. Nancy Pelosi can remove anyone, including Donald Trump. For that reason, she certainly knew that if she called him a chicken, she could greatly improve Trump’s chances of responding to a committee subpoena, no — more specifically, not “manly” enough. After all, “Alpha Male” is everything at MAGA.
When asked if Trump would show up, she tried it out today on MSNBC’s Sunday show:
“I don’t think he’s man enough to show up. I don’t think his lawyers would want him to show up because he has to testify under oath. But I don’t think he’s manly enough, – we’ll see if he’s manly enough Show up and the public can make a judgment.”
“No one is above the law! If we believe that, then they should be judged on how he responds to this request.”
proficient. She did not question whether Trump was “strong enough.” Typically, Trump is seen as a “strong” leader. This time, however, he was challenged by a woman. Again, he doesn’t like strong women. Challenging his masculinity was the unapologetic, strong woman who won her power in Washington for decades.
Who can forget this photo?

Everyone remembers this photo of Nancy Pelosi standing in front of Donald Trump, but not everyone remembers what she said during the shoot.
According to Speaker Pelosi herself, she said:
“With you, all roads lead to Putin.” pic.twitter.com/5aN1PBD1Br
— Trump Taxes (@TrumpsTaxes) February 24, 2022

If there was any challenge enough to bother Trump to appear and show his “manliness,” this is probably it.
She is very nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has proposed a plan that would move the city’s large numbers of homeless people to three campgrounds while banning camping elsewhere in the city.
The three campgrounds will initially allow 150 people into each campsite and will eventually accommodate up to 500 residents. 
More than 3,000 people live on Portland’s streets across 700 camps, a 50 percent increase from 2019, the mayor said. 
The camping ban will be phased in over 18 months, and the city plans to begin construction of 20,000 affordable housing units by 2033, Willamette Weeks reported. 
“The truth is, over the past eight months, we’ve added alternative camping options without the ban, and for full transparency, it hasn’t worked,” Mr Wheeler told a news conference on Friday.

Rebuilding Ukraine is a "generational task that must begin now," said Germany's Olaf Scholz and the EU's Ursula von der Leyen. Ukrainian and German experts are meeting in Berlin to discuss support for the reconstruction. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have called for a strategy to rebuild Ukraine after the war as experts meet in Berlin for an economic forum.

The two described the reconstruction of Ukraine as a "generational task that must begin now."

   i24 News: Zelensky urges West to hit Kremlin if Russia attacks his office 
'If you do this, then in a second ... there will be a strike on the decision-making center of your state' 
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview with Canadian media on Sunday said that the West should strike the Kremlin if Russia attacks the presidential office in Kyiv. 
Speaking with Canadian CTV News and CBC Television, Zelensky said that Russia “doesn’t understand anything other than force.”

Update: Nuke Kremlin, Zelensky Demands To West; Says Attack Russia If Putin Launches Nuclear Attack on Kyiv (IBTimes) 
A part of me wonders if some Western governments have given Zelensky a commitment that they will intervene if Russia uses a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. And is this the reason why Russia is worried that a false flag nuclear operation in Ukraine will be used by the West as the reason to intervene ....  Russian Defense Minister In Phone Calls With His Counterparts From The U.S., Britain, France And Turkey Says Ukraine Is Preparing A 'Dirty Bomb' False Flag Attack (October 23, 2022). 
Ukraine President Zelensky's complete CBC/CTV interview is below. His answers are unfortunately not translated. 

A personal observation on President Zelensky appearance. There are many points in the interview where he has a wild look in his eyes. I hope I am wrong, but I have the impression that with the destruction of the country's power grid currently unfolding and the war claiming hundreds of lives everyday, he now has the look of a man who has just been told that the war is now escalating uncontrollably into a new and destructive phase.]]></summary>

NBC: Vladimir Putin 'could be showing signs of cancer' as IV marks spotted on his hands 
Vladimir Putin "could be showing signs of cancer" as marks thought to be from IV treatment were spotted on his hands. 
The Russian president, 70, launched an ongoing military invasion of neighbouring country Ukraine in February but now Kyiv Post correspondent Jason Jay Smart has claimed that he could be showing signs of having had intravenous chemotherapy and pointed out marks on his hands. 
Alongside screenshots of Vladimir's appearance on Russian news, he tweeted: "Videos released by Russian government Government news show what could be track marks, from IVs, on the hand of Putin. For the same event, the Kremlin released two videos: One with tons of watermarks (making the hand harder to see), the other without any shot of his hand."

Politico:  Slovenia heads for runoff in presidential election 
Conservative candidate Anže Logar won the most votes in Sunday’s ballot but not enough to avoid a second round against his center-left rival. 
Conservative candidate Anže Logar appeared poised to win the most votes in Slovenia’s presidential election on Sunday, but he will face his center-left rival in a runoff, partial results suggested. 
Logar, Slovenia’s former foreign minister, won about 34 percent of the vote in the first round, with about 80 percent of ballots counted, Reuters reported, citing preliminary results from the State Election Commission. 
His main opponent, lawyer Natasa Pirc Musar, won 27 percent of the vote.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made the allegations in phone calls with his counterparts from the United States, Britain, France and Turkey. 
Russia's defence ministry said Mr Shoigu voiced concern about "possible Ukrainian provocations involving a 'dirty bomb'," a device that uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste over a wide area.

Chinese President Xi Jinping secured an unusual third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party, the country's most powerful position, after a weeklong Party congress session that ended on Sunday, according to Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency. 
Why it matters: With Xi as China's unchallenged leader for another five-year term, Beijing is likely to continue its current trajectory of confrontation with the West. 
* Xi, 69, has surpassed the informal retirement age of 68 and could be in a position for life-long rule. 
 * His selection paves the way for him to again be named the country's president at the annual legislative session in March.
