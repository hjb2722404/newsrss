        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have offered to rent an apartment in Kensington Palace to "make amends" with the Royal Family, according to an insider.

"Harry doesn't want to become a prisoner of the palace. He and Meghan are offering to rent an apartment at Kensington Palace and … hopes that will please William and show that they're serious about coming back," the insider told OK! magazine.

Daily Mail Columnist Richard Eden said the Sussexes will need to "apologise".

"The only hope there could be is that Harry and Meghan apologise and say we're really sorry for all the damage we've done, and we'd like to make amends. Unless that happens, I can't see any kind of reconciliation."]]></summary>

 Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Says Intercepted U.S. Drone Over Black Sea 
Russia said Saturday it scrambled an Su-30 fighter jet to "prevent a violation of the Russian state border" by a U.S. Reaper MQ-9 military drone over the Black Sea. 
"As the Russian fighter approached, the foreign reconnaissance drone performed a U-turn away from the border," the Russian Defense Ministry said. 
The ministry said the drone belonged to the U.S. Air Force.

"The Russian aircraft returned safely to its airbase, there was no violation of the border," it added. 
Incidents involving Russian and Western aircraft have multiplied over the Black Sea and Baltic Sea in recent months, as Moscow pursues its offensive in Ukraine.

Moscow may cancel its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to be on par with the US, Kommersant has reported  
Elements within the Russian government are reportedly advocating a withdrawal of Moscow’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), an international agreement to suspend all nuclear-weapons tests. The 1996 document has never come into force because some nations, including the US, have not ratified it. 
The proposed move to withdraw its ratification would be symbolic rather than practical, rendering Russia’s stance regarding CTBT as the same as the US’ stance, according to the business daily Kommersant, which reported the deliberations on Thursday. The discussion is at an early stage, news outlet also said.

Update: Press review: Moscow may pull test-ban treaty ratification and intervention risk for Niger (TASS)

 
WNU Editor: I believe there is a very real chance that the Kremlin may withdraw from the treaty. 
Russia has called upon the US to finally ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), a treaty that Washington has never ratified. There has been no response from the White House.

According to the Russian business daily Kommersant, Russian government officials have already suggested withdrawing Moscow’s ratification of the treaty to ensure that Russia is on par with Washington and to send a message to the West on their involvement in the Ukraine war. 
The eight countries that have not ratified the treaty are .... China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified the Treaty; India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it. (Wikipedia).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC News: Imran Khan: Pakistan ex-PM given three-year jail sentence 
Ex-Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for nationwide protests after he was handed a three-year jail sentence over corruption allegations. 
Mr Khan was found guilty of not declaring money earned from selling gifts he received in office. 
He denies the charges and says he will appeal. 
After the verdict, Mr Khan was taken into custody from his home in Lahore.

In a pre-recorded statement posted after the verdict, he urged supporters to fight against the ruling. 
 "I have only one appeal, don't sit at home silently," he said in a video address posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. 
"I am struggling for you and the country and your children's future," he added. 
The former cricketer-turned-politician, 70, was elected in 2018, but was ousted in a no-confidence vote last year after falling out with Pakistan's powerful military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firefighters from Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia teamed up with French colleagues as the blaze ravaged some 435 hectares (1,100 acres) of land, with an estimated 2,500 hectares threatened.
Local people were evacuated overnight from several villages as a precaution hours after the fire was declared to the south of Portbou, whose railway station connects Spain with France.
Catalan forest rangers said on Twitter, rebranded X, that an investigation was under way into the cause of the fire.
In a statement on the Catalan regional government website, they added the blaze "remains active" and that their priority was to prevent it encroaching on the nearby tourist resort of Llanca to the south.
Strong winds had helped the fire to spread overnight and prevented water-bombing planes from taking off to aid a firefighting operation complicated by the hilly terrain affected.
The Catalan fire service said it expected airborne operations to be able to start Saturday afternoon following helicopter reconnaissance beforehand.
They added that as well as evacuating around 135 local people, several hundred more had had to spend the night confined in their villages or at campsites which at this time of year typically welcome thousands of tourists.
Catalan Red Cross volunteers were aiding the rescue operation.
Catalan civil protection officials said some 4,000 people were without electricity and that rail traffic had been suspended between Portbou and Figueres, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. The main road into Portbou and to the French border was also closed.
Joining some 80 Catalan firefighting units were a dozen fire engines from the French side of the border.
Last year, some 500 blazes laid waste to more than 300,000 hectares in Spain, a record for Europe, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis).
To date this year has seen some 70,000 hectares destroyed, according to Effis.

(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine attacked an oil tanker it said was supplying Russian forces and warned that ports, including commodity hubs, may be at risk in the latest escalation in the area around the Black Sea. 
The hull of the tanker was pierced after an attack by a sea drone in the Kerch Strait, Russia’s Federal River and Marine Transportation Agency said on Telegram. 
There were no casualties and the vessel is still afloat, the agency said. Ukraine’s state security service was responsible for the drone strike, according to a Ukrainian official familiar with the matter.

RT: Russia becomes Europe’s biggest economy – report 
The country’s GDP in PPP terms is outperforming that of Germany, according to World Economics 
Russia was among the world’s five largest economies and the largest in Europe in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) as of the end of 2022, despite Western sanctions, the latest World Economics report has revealed. 
According to estimates based on official country data published by the World Bank and the IMF, Russia's gross domestic product was $5.51 trillion in PPP terms at the end of last year. The figure is 38% larger than the official estimate of $3.993 trillion, the report noted. 
It also showed that the Russian economy was ahead of Germany’s when measured in purchasing-power parity, with the latter’s GDP at $5 trillion.

WNU Editor: Some in the West are speculating that this is a bubble .... A Spending Boom Fuels Russia’s Wartime Economy, Raising Bubble Fears (Mew York Times). In certain areas maybe, but overall I see this economic boom continuing even after the war is over. 
The world does not only need Russia natural resources, but it is dependent on it. Sanctions have put a break on the Russian economy, but on the plus side hundreds of billions of dollars no longer leave Russia each year. There is also the expectation that when the war is eventually over the lifting of sanctions will follow, and when that happens the economic expansion that will then follow will be massive.]]></summary>

Reuters: Exclusive: Russia doubles 2023 defense spending plan as war costs soar 
LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has doubled its 2023 defence spending target to more than $100 billion - a third of all public expenditure - a government document reviewed by Reuters showed, as the costs of the war in Ukraine spiral and place growing strain on Moscow's finances. 
The figures shed light on Russia's spending on the conflict at a time when sector-specific budget expenditure data is no longer published. 
They show that in the first half of 2023 alone, Russia spent 12%, or 600 billion roubles, more on defence than the 4.98 trillion roubles ($54 billion) it had originally targeted for 2023. 
Defence spending in the first six months of 2023 amounted to 5.59 trillion roubles, 37.3% of a total 14.97 trillion roubles spent in the period, the document showed. Russia's budget plan envisages 17.1% of total funds spent on "National Defence".

WNU Editor: I think this number is a low-ball number. I think the decision was made in August/September of last year that since a negotiated end to the war was not going to happen, the Russian economy was to be put at a war time footing. The entire country is now completely focused on the war. and I see no signs of it ending anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: CNN Poll: Majority of Americans oppose more US aid for Ukraine in war with Russia 
Most Americans oppose Congress authorizing additional funding to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, as the public splits over whether the US has already done enough to assist Ukraine. 
Overall, 55% say the US Congress should not authorize additional funding to support Ukraine vs. 45% who say Congress should authorize such funding. And 51% say that the US has already done enough to help Ukraine while 48% say it should do more. A poll conducted in the early days of the Russian invasion in late February 2022 found 62% who felt the US should have been doing more. 
Partisan divisions have widened since that poll, too, with most Democrats and Republicans now on opposing sides of questions on the US role in Ukraine.

WNU Editor. There are other surprises in this poll (link here). Here are two eye-opening poll results .... (1) 56% oppose President Biden's Russia policy. (2) 57% oppose President Biden's China policy.]]></summary>

Newsweek: Top Russian General Leaks Number of Elite Casualties in Ukraine War 
The commander of Russia's elite airborne troops, General Colonel Mikhail Teplinsky, leaked the number of casualties sustained by his unit since President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, prompting the Kremlin to scramble to delete his announcement. 
In a video now deleted by Russia's Defense Ministry, Teplinsky, commander of the Russian Airborne Forces (the VDV), revealed on Wednesday that 8,500 Russian paratroopers have been wounded since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. 
The figure marks the highest number of casualties among a single type of military force mentioned by a Russian military official since the war began, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
