The 11 contenders vying to replace Boris Johnson will require the backing of at least 20 MPs - and win 30 votes from colleagues - to enter the race.
  
Nominations will open and close on Wednesday - with backbenchers hoping to shorten the list to two candidates as quickly as possible. 

Mr Johnson has refused to say who he will be backing for the top job position.]]></summary>

“It's one I witnessed firsthand just over a week ago on what some have called my holiday to Kyiv,” he said. 

Mr Albanese said it was a “very confronting experience” to witness the damage Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.

He added having a look first-hand at the challenge Russia’s aggression represents does “threaten the peace and stability in which the post-World War II era has been based upon”.]]></summary>

RT: Russia offers fast-track citizenship to all Ukrainians 
All Ukrainians, as as well as citizens of the two Donbass republics, may now apply using a simplified procedure 
Any Ukrainian national may now apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified scheme, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Monday. 
The measure also applies to stateless persons permanently living in Ukraine as well as to citizens of the two Donbass republics, recognized earlier by Russia as independent. 
Ukrainians may now file the relevant request without the need to live in Russia for five years, to have a source of income or to pass a Russian-language test – something foreigners are normally required to do before they can apply for Russian citizenship.

WNU Editor: Kyiv has responded .... Ukraine Condemns Russian Decree Allowing Ukrainians Expedited Citizenship (RFE). 
There is a Russian law that permits the children of former Soviet Union citizens to apply to become a Russian citizen even though they were born in another country. But this new decree apparently makes the entire process simpler and more quicker to apply for.

 CNBC: India set to overtake China as the world’s most populous country in 2023, UN says 
 * “India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country during 2023,” the U.N. says. 
* According to the U.N., its latest projections show that the global population could reach roughly 8.5 billion in 2030 and 10.4 billion in 2100. 
* In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres talks of a “shared responsibility to care for our planet.” 
India is on track to overtake China as the planet’s most populous country next year, according to a U.N. report published on Monday. 
The report, from the population division of the U.N.’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said China and India were each home to over 1.4 billion people in 2022. 
“India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country during 2023,” the U.N. said. 
The Indian government’s census for 2011 put the country’s population at more than 1.2 billion.

National Post/Reuters:  France prepares for total cutoff of Russian gas  
The government is also looking company by company to see which can be forced to lower production to save energy if necessary  
AIX-EN-PROVENCE — The French government is preparing for a total cutoff of Russian gas supplies, which it sees as the most likely scenario in its forward planning, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. 
With about 17 per cent of its supply coming from Russia, France is less dependent on Russian gas than some of its neighbours, but the government has been preparing contingency plans. 
A cutoff is particularly problematic now because France’s nuclear power generation would struggle to pick up the slack as many reactors are currently down for maintenance.

Update #2: UN: Russia and Ukraine Share Blame for Nursing Home Attack (VOA/AP)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Voters in Japan overwhelmingly back slain ex-prime minister Shinzo Abe’s party, handing the Liberal Democrats a parliamentary SUPER-majority that could now see the world’s third-richest country greatly expand its army and global role 
* Ruling party the Liberal Democrats - who have been in government 62 of the past 67 years - are set to gain 
* Added seats could allow Shinzo Abe's proposed constitutional changes to pass, sealing late ex-PM's legacy 
* Mr Abe, 67, was shot dead with an improvised shotgun while campaigning in Nara, western Japan last Friday 
 * Queen was 'deeply saddened' by 'sudden and tragic' loss of Abe, who served as Japan's PM from 2012 to 2020 
* Suspect Tetsuya Yamagami was escorted out of Nara Police Station to be taken to the local prosecutor's office 
* GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: This story contains graphic content which some readers may find distressing 
The Japanese Liberal Democrats won a landslide victory at national elections held two days after Shinzo Abe, the party's ex-leader and Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was assassinated at a campaign event. 
Prime minister Fumio Kishida's ruling party - which has governed Japan for 62 of the past 67 years - was set to win more than 70 of 125 seats in the upper house alongside right-wing allies Komeito. 
Though a change in government via the more powerful lower house was not at stake, today's elections are thought to be a referendum on Japan's leaders - and the legacy of its slain ex-PM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The problem is that Kim’s ideals aren’t wrong,” she said.  “But the way she does it is.”
In five and a half seasons, Kim’s long slide to perdition has become undoubtedly the narrative keystone of the series.  It has not always been so.  When it started, “Saul,” a prequel to “Breaking Bad,” seemed mostly focused on transforming slippery but fundamentally decent Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Albuquerque’s sleaziest lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Kim’s ultimate role was then uncertain, even for the screenwriters.
“We had no idea when we started how important his character was going to be,” said showrunner and co-creator Peter Gould.  “If you watch the pilot of the show, she probably has three lines of dialogue.”
It soon became clear, however, that the character of Seehorn, who started (outwardly) as a straight arrow with a promising legal career, would be an integral part of Jimmy’s makeover.  Like Jimmy, Kim was breaking badly.  Unlike Jimmy, however, Kim never appears in “Breaking Bad,” leading many fans to assume the worst.  The stakes were always potentially higher for her than for the guy with her name in the title.
That seems like a lot to bear, given that “Saul” is one of TV’s most critically acclaimed series.  But if so, Seehorn, 50, who has been performing on screens and on stages since the ’90s, handles it with grace.  Unlike the purse-lipped, inscrutable Kim, Seehorn isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, either professionally or, ultimately, in conversation.  She has no problem, for example, talking at length about a rash.  She’s funny and has a blinding, spontaneous smile that made me wonder if I’d ever seen Kim Wexler’s teeth (despite all those teeth-brushing scenes).

WASHINGTON — When President Biden leaves Tuesday night for a four-day swing through the Middle East, he will presumably be more rested than he would have been had he followed the original plan. 
The trip was initially tacked onto another journey last month to Europe, which would have made for an arduous 10-day overseas trek until it became clear to Mr. Biden’s team that such extended travel might be unnecessarily taxing for a 79-year-old president, or “crazy,” as one official put it. 
Aides also cited political and diplomatic reasons to reorganize the extra stops as a separate trip weeks later. But the reality is that managing the schedule of the oldest president in American history presents distinct challenges. And as Mr. Biden insists he plans to run for a second term, his age has increasingly become an uncomfortable issue for him, his team and his party.

ONEOK said it is unaware of any injuries at its plant. 
Authorities are urging people to evacuate after a large fire ignited at a natural gas plant in Oklahoma. 
The Grant County Sheriff's Office advised anyone who lives within a 2-mile radius of the ONEOK plant in Medford to evacuate Saturday afternoon. It is unclear when people will be able to return. 
"Please avoid any travel into or through Medford on U.S. Highway 81 at this time," the sheriff's office said earlier, citing an "active incident' at the plant.

Orthodox Times: Canada has imposed sanctions on Patriarch of Moscow Kirill 
Canada has imposed sanctions on Patriarch of Moscow Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, as part of a series of measures the country took to target “agents of Russian disinformation and propaganda” over the invasion of Ukraine. 
These measures were immediately criticized by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who stated that “sanctions against the Patriarch would only be imposed by Satanists.” 
Patriarch Kirill has put the Church at the service of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he calls a “miracle” as he shares his vision of a conservative, sovereign Russia and supports the war in Ukraine. 
In addition to Canada, the United Kingdom also imposed sanctions on the 75-year-old Patriarch in June.

CNBC/Reuters: Canada to return repaired Nord Stream 1 turbine, expand sanctions on Russia 
* Canada will return a repaired turbine to Germany that is needed for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, its minister of natural resources said. 
* The repaired turbine could help to ensure continued flows of energy until Europe can end its dependency on Russian gas. 
 * In addition to the special permit for the turbine, Canada said it would expand sanctions against Russia’s energy sector to include industrial manufacturing. 
Canada will return a repaired turbine to Germany that is needed for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline and could help to ensure continued flows of energy until Europe can end its dependency on Russian gas, Canada’s minister of natural resources said. 
The Canadian government said in a statement on Saturday it was issuing a “time-limited and revocable permit” to exempt the return of turbines from its Russian sanctions and also announced new measures against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

By John Taylor Williams

There is something ineffable about the appeal of the far reaches of Cape Cod for generations of writers, artists and architects.  Maybe it’s just that, as Thoreau observed, “one man can stand there and put all of America behind him.”  Perhaps – and this was certainly true for the first part of the 20th century – it was the remoteness and isolation of the place, the feeling that as the land stretches out towards the Atlantic, in one long, twisting branch, the current conventional world slips away, allowing you to rethink, reinvent, and get away with all sorts of things.

This observation came to mind on Thursday during Momix’s “Alice,” a mundane and busy 85-minute show now at the Joyce Theatre. Not that anything particularly wonderful is happening;  rather the opposite.  At this point in the show, the idea of ​​just going out into the city at night — to watch the traffic, the sunset, or the people on the streets — was more appealing than any fantasy portrayed on stage.
Known for its illusionistic extravaganzas, Momix, which was founded 42 years ago by choreographer Moses Pendleton, drew inspiration from Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice in Wonderland’ for its latest.

DW: US, China top diplomats hold first talks since October 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Chinese counterpart Wang Ji have held their first talks in months. 
The two discussed tension over Taiwan as well as Beijing's stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailed the "constructive" hourslong talks with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Saturday. 
Coming on the heels of a G20 summit, it was the first in-person talks directly between the two countries since October.
"Despite the complexities of our relationship, I can say with some confidence that our delegations found today's discussions useful, candid and constructive," Blinken said after the talks that lasted five hours.

It’s a weighty role – Killer is the story’s sacrificial lamb – but Caan, working with Coppola, imbues the role with a subtle, persuasive innocence that doesn’t protect the character or sanctify her disability.  As an actor, Caan could certainly go big and exteriorize a character’s inner workings (he does a lot around the eyebrows), and Kilgannon has his outsized moments.  Yet what makes the character work is the poignant deadpanness that conveys how brutally life has hollowed him out.

Prior to that statement, Putin’s aggression had already spurred Washington to increase U.S. military personnel in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000 (mostly non-combat) troops, some of whom will now be staying in the region in one fashion or another (A detailed yet simplified outline of the U.S. force structure in Europe can be found below).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice," he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden signed a new weapons package worth up to $400 million for Ukraine on Friday, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and more ammunition. 
The new U.S. aid is meant to bolster Ukraine as it confronts heavy pounding by Russian artillery.
Since the Feb. 24 invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a big chunk of territory across Ukraine's southern flank above Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Russia is slowly pushing Ukrainian forces out of two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine which it has recognized as independent states. 
A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the additional HIMARS would bring the total number of these systems to 12.

 Sri Lanka’s ongoing political and economic crises once again reached a fever pitch as thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday and some stormed the president’s house and offices. 
Sri Lanka’s president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has apparently agreed to step down July 13, although he has not yet personally confirmed the announcement made by the speaker of parliament, as he is reportedly in hiding. Following the speaker’s announcement, protesters also set fire to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s residence, who also stated he was resigning after just months on the job.

The last episodes of the last season of “stranger thingswhich debuted Friday on Netflix, included several tragic send-offs.  One of the most powerful was the farewell between Millie Bobby Brown’s Eleven and her “Daddy”, the white-haired mad scientist Dr. Martin Brenner, played by Hollywood veteran Matthew Modine.

A side effect is porpoising, a violent up and down motion caused by airflow blockage under cars, which can also be affected by bouncing when they hit the ground repeatedly.
It was difficult for the drivers.  AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly said he feared “finding himself with a cane at 30” if changes were not made.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

The ConocoPhillips project, known as Willow and located in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, was originally approved under the Trump administration and later backed by the Biden administration, but was later blocked by a judge who said the environmental review did not sufficiently consider its effects on climate change and wildlife.
On Friday, the Biden administration released a new environmental analysis.

Wade, President Biden issued an executive order on Friday aimed at ensuring access to abortion drugs and emergency contraception while preparing for legal battles ahead.
But the order is vague on how the president hopes to achieve those goals, leaving the details largely to Xavier Becerra, his health and human services secretary, who said the administration has “no quick fixwhich can restore access to abortion.
And Mr Biden’s order falls well short of demands from abortion rights advocates, who have faulted him for not moving quickly to act after the court decision two weeks ago.

Tetsuya Yamagami, an unemployed 41-year-old, identified as the suspect on suspicion of murder on Friday after a man was seen in videos repeatedly shown on Japanese television calmly approaching Japan's longest-serving prime minister from behind and firing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister is not just a portentous political event. His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.
Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…]]></summary>

Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whizzing helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.
"We found 16 bodies so far and at least 40 are missing," an official from the state disaster response agency told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the "stoning of the devil" ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year's expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in a 38-page ruling, wrote that a federal law setting rules for when a sovereign foreign entity could be sued in U.S. courts doesn’t allow any part of the lawsuit filed by Schmitt in April 2020 to continue.

“All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh wrote.

Schmitt’s office filed a notice of appeal immediately after Limbaugh made his ruling.

When Schmitt filed the lawsuit, he claimed China was responsible for allowing the novel coronavirus to cause a global pandemic by covering up the initial infection…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's main opposition Labour party on Friday threatened to call a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get him to quit immediately, after he was forced to resign by a cabinet revolt.
Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain's departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world's fifth-largest economy in the interim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday's shocking assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stunned the world and drew immediate condemnation, with world leaders praising Abe's "global leadership" and slamming a "cowardly attack".
Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:
