In 2020, the couple welcome  a boy named Edward.  Then, six months later, they announced  the birth of their sixth child via surrogacy, a daughter named Lucia.  Hilaria had already opened up on social media about suffering two miscarriages.
Alec also has a 26-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger.
Hilaria was on a social media break for several weeks before announcing her pregnancy.  She had already moved away from social media last fall, when Alec was holding a gun that dispensed  on the set of the movie “Rust”, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.

There is also a slide with the QAnon slogan “WWG1WGA”, an acronym for “where let’s go one, let’s all go” and a man wearing Trump’s red tie with a “Q” pin in his lapel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Saturday criticised a U.S. move to make exceptions to sanctions in order to help provide internet to Iranians during nationwide protests, state media reported.
It said this was in line with Washington's hostile stance towards Tehran.
"By reducing the severity of a number of communications sanctions - while maintaining maximum pressure - the U.S. is seeking to advance its goals against Iran," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying.

		The brass lettering on the stone reads "George VI 1895-1952 / Elizabeth 1900-2002" on the top two lines, followed by a garter star and then "Elizabeth II 1926-2022 / Philip 1921-2021" on the bottom two lines.
	

		Queen Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, is also interred at the chapel, at Windsor Castle west of London.
	

		Elizabeth died on Sept. 8 at Balmoral Castle, her summer home in the Scottish highlands, after 70 years on the throne. Her son Charles has become king.

A dozen teenagers and young adults gather around instructor Alex Flaherty. They don't want to miss any of the traditional hunter's precise gestures as he carves a fish or lights a fire.
"Our culture has changed so much in the last 50 years when people used to live in igloos... the change is happening so fast, (and) we are losing our culture," he tells AFP.
Flaherty blames the societal shifts for a series of social ills such as violent crime, substance abuse and a high rate of suicide.

Angry demonstrators have taken to the streets of major cities across Iran, including the capital Tehran, for eight straight nights since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.
The Kurdish woman was pronounced dead after spending three days in a coma following her arrest by Iran's feared morality police for wearing the hijab headscarf in an "improper" way.
"The number of people who died in recent riots in the country has risen to 35," state media said, raising the official toll from at least 17 dead, including five security personnel.
Protests were held around the Islamic republic on Friday, with online videos show…]]></summary>

"Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction," Putin said, adding: "This is not a bluff."
However analysts aren't convinced the Russian president is willing to be the first to unleash nuclear weapons since the US bombed Japan in 1945.
AFP spoke with several experts and officials about the possible scenarios that could arise should Russia carry out a nuclear attack.

The CIA launched its first episode of its new podcast 'The Langley Files' on Thursday 
CIA Director William Burns called Russia a "declining" power in the first episode of the intelligence agency's new podcast, while warning that China is a "central geopolitical challenge" for the U.S. 
The CIA's podcast, "The Langley Files," launched Thursday and featured Burns as its first guest. 
The podcast comes during the CIA’s 75th anniversary — a time, Burns said, for the agency to "reflect on how we need to organize ourselves to navigate successfully what is an incredibly complicated international terrain." 
Burns warned that terrain features a "major power competition with rising powers like China," which he referred to as a "central geopolitical challenge."

Reuters: EU's von der Leyen delivers veiled warning to Italy's right wing 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has warned Italy of consequences should it veer away from democratic principles, issuing a barely veiled threat ahead of Sunday's election that a rightist bloc led by Giorgia Meloni is expected to win. 
The comments highlighted concern in some European capitals over the forthcoming election and suggested that relations between Brussels and Rome could get turbulent if Meloni and her partners secure victory. 
"My approach is that whatever democratic government is willing to work with us, we're working together," von der Leyen said at Princeton University in the United States on Thursday, responding to a question on whether there were any concerns with regard to the upcoming elections in Italy. 
"If things go in a difficult direction, I've spoken about Hungary and Poland, we have tools," she added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had downed four Iranian-made "kamikaze" unmanned aerial vehicles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain Tehran was harming Ukrainian sovereignty and its citizens.
	

		Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied.
	

		"Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran," said a statement on the foreign ministry's website.
	

		"In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv."
	

		The message was handed to the acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
	

		Military authorities in southern Ukraine said in a statement they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the port of Odesa.
	

		Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets.

		It would also "enable a global just transition for every worker, community and nation with fossil fuel dependence," said the leader of the carbon-negative country.
	

		A U.N. climate science panel - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - has warned that global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5 degrees C warming limit and reach some 3.2 degrees C by the end of century.

Packed rally in Rome closes campaign for group forecast for landslide victory in polls on Sunday 
A conservative coalition forecast to glide into power in the Italian general election on Sunday has wrapped up its campaign to a packed square in central Rome, filled with supporters old and new, young and not so young, a smattering of anti-abortion activists and a descendant of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. 
The trio – led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, and including Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia – has experienced loud and robust support over the past months and remained relatively close-knit, in stark contrast to a campaign by its main rival, the centre-left Democratic party, that has been so lacklustre it managed to breathe new life into the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) in southern Italy.

CNN: Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister have 'direct and honest exchange' on Taiwan 
New York (CNN)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi "had a direct and honest exchange on matters related to Taiwan" Friday, a US senior administration official said. 
The two diplomats met for nearly 90 minutes in New York, and their conversation primarily focused on Taiwan, the official said. 
The meeting was held amid a period of heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing and capped a busy week of diplomacy for Blinken at the UN General Assembly, where he met with a series of fellow diplomats from around the world and delivered remarks rebuking Russia's war in Ukraine at a UN Security Council meeting Thursday. 
It also came as Blinken grieves an immense personal loss -- his father, Donald Blinken, died Thursday evening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who has fled his home country of Russia this week delivered a scathing portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership in an interview with The Atlantic.
The man in question, a 38-year-old IT manager named Anton Shalaev, escaped from Russia this week to the Armenian capitol of Yerevan, which is one of the few places that will still allow Russians into the country.
When asked specifically about Putin's decision making during the war, Shalaev did not hesitate to slam the man who has led his homeland for more than two decades.
"A few old men and an army of zombies are leading us to hell," he said. "I say that because people around me in Russia behaved as if they had been bitten by a zombie, dragging my entire country into a dreadful war. All I saw was Russian loser husbands beating their wives, while the entire rotting house of the state system has turned my people into an army of the dead."

To put a fine point on it, Shalaev added, "They are my enemies."
Shalaev also had some unkind words for Russian state media operations.
"Russian propaganda is a weapon, and the bastards working there are war criminals," he said. "The greatest guilt in this entire tragedy belongs to a small bunch of old men at the top: KGB officers."
Various media outlets have reported that many Russian men of military age have been trying to escape the country even since Putin called for a mobilization earlier this week to rescue his war in Ukraine.

	The official death toll from popular unrest in Iran shot up to 17 on Thursday as Raisi vowed that Amini’s death would be investigated. She died in a Tehran hospital on September 16 after falling into a coma following her arrest by the “morality police” which enforces the wearing of the veil.


Women are compelled to cover their hair in public in Iran, which as a Shiite theocratic state follows a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The morality police – officially known as the Gasht-e Ershad; or “guidance patrol” – are responsible for enforcing this dress code.
But the law does not precisely define the “correct” way to wear the veil…]]></summary>

Vladimir Putin wants the restoration of the USSR, and people are only expendable material for him, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with famous French actor Alain Delon, shown on the air of the telethon. 
"He [Putin] understands perfectly well what he is doing. He knows how many people are dying. But for him this is an integral part of the plan," Zelensky said. 
At the same time, he believes that Putin has made the majority of the nation believe in what he is doing. 
"There are social networks. We understand how people react. Many have been brainwashed by the information war, dirty information. Many have gone crazy and rejoice when they kill us. It looks scary," Zelensky said.

WNU Editor: Unfortunately you have to click on the above video to go to Youtube to watch it. It is also in French, and there is no close-captions or translation. 
Fortunately I speak French, and while it is a repeat of what he has been saying for the past few weeks, Zelensky did mention 2 important points. One .... he was "shocked" at Israel’s lack of support, and (2) he remarked that Ukraine is losing 50 soldiers a day. 
This is a hard to believe number, especially when Zelensky himself admitted a few months ago that Ukraine was losing 60 - 100 soldiers a day .... President Zelensky Says 60-100 Ukrainian Soldiers Are Being Killed Per Day And Around 500 Wounded (June 1, 2022), and his top aid admitted losses between 100 - 200 soldiers a day .... Senior Aide to President Zelensky Says Ukraine Is Losing 100 - 200 Soldiers Each Day (June 10, 2-22). My sources in Ukraine tell me that the number runs in the hundreds per day.]]></summary>

The demonstrations followed the strongest warning from the authorities yet when the army told Iranians it would confront "the enemies" behind the unrest - a move that could signal the kind of crackdown that has crushed protests in the past.
Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as "Israel's soldiers", live state television coverage showed. They also shouted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel", common slogans the country's clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

Some Russian men have rushed to leave the country after President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation, with traffic at border crossings with Finland and Georgia surging and prices for plane tickets from Moscow skyrocketing. 
Mr Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's first mobilisation since World War II and backed a plan to annex swathes of Ukraine, warning the West he was not bluffing when he said he would be ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory. 
Prices for flights out of Moscow soared above $US5,000 ($7,000) for one-way tickets to the nearest foreign locations, with most air tickets sold out completely for coming days.

WNU Editor:  There is some exaggeration .... Debunked: Russians were not in a 35km queue at Finland border  (Euronews), but there is no question in my mind that with this mobilization many Russian males now want to be outside of Russia until this is all over.

"We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel, and our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald," 4th Estate Books said.
"This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work," it added, providing no other details.
Mantel won the Booker Prize for "Wolf Hall" (2009) and "Bring Up the Bodies" (2012) and had been tipped to win again in 2020 with "The Mirror & The Light," the third in the trilogy.

A B-2 Spirit has been ferried to Plant 42 in California for restoration a year after it ended up wing-down in the dirt. 
A U.S. Air Force B-2 bomber nicknamed the Spirit of Georgia has touched down at Plant 42 in Palmdale California just over a year after skidding off the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Today, the aircraft flew to Plant 42 after receiving temporary repairs at Whiteman, and will now undergo a more substantial restoration so that it can return to the fleet. The War Zone was the first to report on the initial mishap, which took place on September 14, 2021, and publish satellite imagery showing the bomber lying on the grass.

Amini, 22, died after her arrest by the Islamic republic's feared morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab headscarf in an "improper" way, and news of her death sparked widespread outrage.
The official death toll rose to at least 17 on Thursday, including five security personnel, but the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said its sources put the figure much higher.

Exiled dissidents, rebel military leaders and deserters from the Burmese army speak out and denounce in particular the growing and decisive Russian support for the junta.]]></summary>

OilPrice.com: Russia’s Oil Exports Are Set To Plunge Next Year 
* Russia’s oil exports have been resilient since it invaded Ukraine, falling just 400,000 bpd below pre-war levels despite international sanctions. 
* The EU's embargo on crude oil this December and its embargo on oil products in February will displace 2.4 million bpd of oil. 
* While Russia may be able to find buyers for roughly half of that supply, it seems inevitable that its exports will fall dramatically. 
Nearly seven months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil exports have been quite resilient and just 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) below pre-war levels. 
But come December, Russian oil supply could plunge by more than one million bpd after the EU embargo on Russian oil imports by sea enters into force. 
In February, another one million bpd could then come offline due to the EU’s fuel embargo.

WNU Editor: The West will need to find alternative oil suppliers, and Russia will need to find new customers. I predict both will succeed, but the disruption in supply chains will only mean higher prices for consumers. 
The only respite that we may have when it comes to oil prices is if the global recession deepens. And in that case it will only mean one thing. We are all suffering.]]></summary>

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, there has been a whopping $15.8 billion “in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden Administration, including more than $15.1 billion since the beginning of Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion on February 24.”

The Biden administration generally has decided to keep warnings about the consequences of a nuclear strike deliberately vague, so the Kremlin worries about how Washington might respond, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations. 
The attempt by the White House to cultivate what’s known in the nuclear deterrence world as “strategic ambiguity” comes as Russia continues to escalate its rhetoric about possible nuclear weapons use amid a domestic mobilization aimed at stanching Russian military losses in eastern Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hill: Trump responds to Putin’s warning that nuclear threat ‘not a bluff’ Former President Trump responded Wednesday to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hinting at being willing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying that the conflict should never have happened and that it could lead to a world war. 
Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that the conflict would not have come to pass if he were still in the Oval Office.   “But as I have made very clear for quite some time, this could now end up being World War III,” he said.

Update #1: Trump says Ukraine war wouldn’t have happened if he were president and boasts he could end it (The Independent)  
Update #2: Trump issues World War III warning (RT)   
WNU Editor: Would Trump have made a difference if he was still President? I do not know. 
But I do know that it has been 20 months since Biden assumed the Office of the President, and since the fall of Afghanistan last year there is now a perception in the Western world that everything is rapidly descending into political/social/and economic chaos. 
What also does not help is that it appears the US President is not in control of his own faculties. Another "brain fog" incident happened again yesterday (see below):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Hong Kong’s leading convenience store chain 7-Eleven renews its collaboration with Pei Ho Counterparts to provide free meals to the less privileged groups most impacted in these testing times  Serving Hong Kong for more than four decades, 7-Eleven has become one of the most recognised retailers across the city’s neighbourhoods. It offers round-the-clock conveniences to the population and pledges to play an active, good corporate citizen role by helping those in need.  Since 2017, for example, the franchise has supported Pei Ho Counterparts, a social enterprise associated with distributing free meals to the underprivileged in some of Hong Kong’s neediest districts. To date, 7-Eleven has donated a total of 250,000 free meal boxes, water, and goodie bags to the conscientious social enterprise, benefitting groups such as the homeless, the elderly, and struggling families.  Recently, 7-Eleven announced its continued collaboration with Pei Ho Counterparts in a new Sik Tak Fan La campaign. Literally, “the meal is ready” in Cantonese, the new campaign aims to raise HK$2 million for the social enterprise. The sum will support the organisation’s work in providing free meals and supplies for the less privileged communities most in need on a more regular basis.  Mobilising 7-Eleven network and resources  By making the most of its robust, 1000-plus store network, 7-Eleven is well positioned to create a synergetic effect within individual neighbourhoods. The company’s network makes a compelling case for engaging the broader community in support of the campaign that is for a good cause.   “As part of the Hong Kong community and as an organisation that prioritises corporate social responsibility, we are committed to contributing to society,” said Choo Peng-chee, chief executive officer of DFI Retail North Asia, the operator of Hong Kong’s leading convenience store chain.   “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe impact,…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: US Air Force Academy in Colorado is blasted for holding woke 'diversity and inclusion' summit that saw cadets ordered to ditch 'gendered' language including mom, dad, boyfriend and girlfriend 
* A recent training seminar at the US Air Force Academy aimed to teach cadets about diversity and inclusion 
* The presentation included messages recommending that gendered terms be kicked to the curb 
* 'Colorblind' and 'I don't see color' were also recommended to be abandoned 

 * Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida has called the teachings 'destructive' 
The US Air Force Academy is under fire for holding diversity and inclusion training that urges cadets to use non-gendered language, scrapping words like 'mom,' and 'dad', as well as 'girlfriend' and 'boyfriend.' 
According to screenshots from the seminar, obtained by FOX News Digital, Air Force training officials are asking recruits to use generic terms like 'partner' instead of 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend,' and 'parent' or 'parents' instead of 'mom' and 'dad.' 
The slides shared by FOX News prompted outrage from many across the country, including Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pfizer said it agreed to reduce the number of doses it will deliver by year end to 600 million, down from the billion-dose commitment the U.S. government made a year ago.
	

		The United States will have an option to buy up to an additional 400 million shots for the program after this year.
	

		The drugmaker said it would have sufficient supply to deliver the full billion doses under the U.S. commitment, but "we are seeing reduced demand in some low- and lower-middle-income countries due to barriers in administration and vaccine hesitancy."
	

		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.
	

		Pfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.
	

		The vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world's poorer countries.
	

		The program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.
	

		COVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.

Nuclear threat

		The integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.
	

		After the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use "all means" to protect its territory.
	

		Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included "strategic nuclear weapons". He predicted the voting regions "will integrate into Russia".
	

		For most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.
	

		The referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.
	

		Election officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.]]></summary>

But this week has been insane. There is no longer enough hours in a day for me to do the things that I want to do. And it all has to do with the Russia - Ukraine war, tensions with China, and the fracturing of the national and global economy. 
Let me explain.
