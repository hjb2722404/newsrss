        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Ukraine: NATO plans to increase ammunition-making capacity 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said alliance members had agreed to ramp up industrial production to replenish NATO and Ukraine's stockpiles. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said  alliance defense ministers gathered in Brussels had agreed on a need to expand industrial capacity for producing munitions. 
The gathering included discussions on Finland and Sweden's membership bids, support for Ukraine and NATO's attempts to stock up on weapons and ammunition.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: When you look at the details, this announcement is a disappointment. The US, France, Germany, Norway are the only countries that have signed contracts to increase their ammo-making capacity .... At least four states strike ammunition production deals - Stoltenberg (Ukrinform), and these deals will not kick in until later this year. 

For the past few weeks I have been hearing and reading reports from Ukraine that they are limiting their use of ammunition, and if the current rate of use and re-supply from the West continues, they will be out by July. To say that this is going to be a disaster for Ukraine is an understatement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France 24: Iran-based Egyptian Saif al-Adel is new al Qaeda chief, says US 
Saif al-Adel, an Iran-based Egyptian, has become the head of Al-Qaeda following the July 2022 death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the US State Department said Wednesday. 
"Our assessment aligns with that of the UN – that al-Qaeda's new de facto leader Saif al-Adel is based in Iran," a state department spokesperson said. 
The United Nations report released Tuesday said that the predominant view of member states is that Adel is now the group's leader, "representing continuity for now." 
But the group has not formally declared him "emir" because of sensitivity to the concerns of the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, who haven't wanted to acknowledge that Zawahiri was killed by a US rocket in a home in Kabul last year, according to the UN report.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russia battered Ukraine with multiple missile strikes on Thursday as its troops sought to advance in the east, Kyiv said, while Western allies pledged to keep military aid flowing for an intended Ukrainian spring counter-offensive. 
Following a pattern of heavy bombardments at times of Ukrainian battlefield or diplomatic advances, Russia launched 32 missiles in the early hours, Ukraine's Air Force said.  Half were shot down, it added, a lower rate than normal. 
Among them, air defences in the south downed eight Kalibr missiles fired from a ship in the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials said. 
Other missiles struck northern and western Ukraine as well as the central regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Kirovohrad.

Politico:  Blinken: Crimea a ‘red line’ for Putin as Ukraine weighs plans to retake it 
The secretary of state, in a private call with experts, expressed his hesitation about a possible Ukrainian offensive for the peninsula. 
A Ukrainian attempt to retake Crimea would be a red line for Vladimir Putin that could lead to a wider Russian response, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a Zoom call with a group of experts Wednesday. 
The Russian president sees Crimea as fully part of Russia, not Ukraine, and would be loath to see the peninsula ripped from his clutches — even though that’s precisely what he did to Ukraine nearly a decade ago. 
Republican and Democratic administrations have since then said repeatedly that “Crimea is Ukraine.” 
The top diplomat’s comments, sure to frustrate Kyiv, came after someone on the private call asked if the U.S. is willing to help Ukraine realize its long-term goal of retaking the territory seized by Moscow.

WNU Editor: If true, this is a major reversal from what the US was saying only a few weeks ago .... U.S. Willing To Help Ukraine Target Crimea (January 19, 2023). So why the sudden change in policy? That is the question that should be asked right now.

NBC: Biden plans to deliver his most extensive remarks yet about the aerial objects the military shot down 
Biden will explain how the administration is forming rules to deal with other objects in the future. 
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden plans to deliver his most extended public remarks yet — as early as Thursday — about the unidentified objects that the U.S. military has been shooting down, three people familiar with the matter said. 
Biden will explain how he has tasked his administration with setting parameters about how to deal with balloons and other aerial objects spotted in the future.

Newsweek: Russia-West Ties Reach 'Point of No Return' Amid Ukraine War: Lavrov 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed the U.S. and its Western allies for pushing ties with Moscow to the "point of no return" by supporting Ukrainian efforts to resist the Kremlin's ongoing invasion. 
Addressing members of the Duma—the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia—on Wednesday, Lavrov reeled off a list of grievances with Western nations, which he accused of seeking a "cordon sanitaire" around Russia. 
The West, Lavrov told Russian lawmakers according to the state-run Tass news agency, has a policy of "many years of containment of Russia" alongside "the transformation of fraternal Ukraine into anti-Russia, into a Russophobic military stronghold."
Lavrov complained about NATO expansion since the end of the Cold War; a long-term Russian gripe cited by Russian President Vladimir Putin as one of many justifications for years-long Russian aggression against Ukraine.

Meduza: Putin planning Federal Assembly address for February 21, followed by ‘large-scale concert-rally’ at Luzhniki Stadium on February 22 
Vladimir Putin will give his belated annual address to Russia’s Federal Assembly on or around February 21, and will participate in a large-scale concert and rally event at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium the following day, RBC reported on Friday, citing “three sources familiar with the discussion” of the Kremlin’s plans. According to RBC, the rally is expected to be a “continuation” of Putin’s address. 
A source from Russia’s parliament confirmed to RIA Novosti that a rally event is being planned for February 22, and added that 200,000 people, including Putin, are slated to attend. 
One of RBC’s sources said that Russian authorities want to ensure the address takes place as close as possible to the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Update #1: Putin to deliver State of the Nation Address to Federal Assembly on Feb 21 — Kremlin -- TASS  
Update #2: Media from unfriendly countries not invited to Putin’s State of Nation Address — Kremlin -- TASS   
WNU Editor: Putin's State of the Nation address will all be on the Ukraine war, the economy and sanctions, and threats from NATO. But what caught my eye was this report .... Russian parliament to hold extraordinary meetings on Feb 22: RIA (Reuters). 
This tells me that Putin will make a declaration/announcement during the State of the Nation address that parliament will then follow-up on the next day. Needless to say. No one is saying why parliament is being summoned the next day. But there is someone who I trust who told me earlier today that Putin may make a formal declaration of war against Ukraine, and parliament will then follow-up on the next day to make it legal. I hope he is wrong, but we shall know more on February 21.]]></summary>

(Bloomberg) -- German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius indicated that western allies are struggling to put together two full battalions of Leopard 2 tanks to send to Ukraine as promised. 
Germany and Portugal are the only two nations to commit to sending the A6 version of the Leopard 2, with 14 pledged by the government in Berlin and three from the Portuguese, Pistorius told reporters Wednesday after meeting NATO counterparts in Brussels. “We will not reach the size of a battalion,” he said. 
Poland has assembled about 30 units of the older A4 version of the Leopard 2, which is almost enough for the standard Ukrainian battalion of 31, but many of them are in poor condition and need repairs before they can be deployed, Pistorius said. Those tanks will only get to Ukraine at the end of April, he added.

FOX News: Ukraine killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops every day, eliminates 5,000 in single battle 
Ukrainian forces are killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops every day, and they eliminated 5,000 troops in a single battle in late January, according to U.K. officials citing data from Ukraine. 
Russian troops, including the elite 155th naval infantry, stormed the Ukrainian coal mining city Vuhledar near Dontesk in late January. Ukrainian forces repelled the offensive, however, and killed, injured or captured 5,000 Russian troops. 
Meanwhile, U.K. officials say the war is exacting a heavy toll on Russia, with 824 Russian troops dying each day, according to Ukrainian updates.
"The 155th brigade already had to be restaffed three times. The first time after Irpin and Bucha; the second time they were defeated near Donetsk – they recovered again," Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, a Ukrainian defense forces spokesman, told Politico. "And now almost the entire brigade has already been destroyed near Vuhledar."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico:  Lawmakers seize on spy balloon to inflate defense spending 
Lobbyists, meanwhile, are pitching new radars and other homeland defense systems to the Pentagon and Congress. 
Defense hawks in Congress cite many reasons to keep money flowing to the Pentagon: enemy fleets, hypersonic missiles, nuclear threats. 
Now they have a new one, and it was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean on Feb. 4. 
Lawmakers and lobbyists are pouncing on a Chinese spy balloon’s seven-day incursion over North America this month to push back against possible defense budget cuts — and make the case for even more funding — as Congress grapples with the growing threat from Beijing and doubts about the military’s ability to detect similar objects.

The Ukrainian Air Force has shot down a balloon launched by Russia: The Russian army used "several balloons with angular reflectors", as well as a reconnaissance drone over the sky of Dnepropetrovsk - AFU
— 🛰️ War in Ukraine 🍉 (@EUFreeCitizen) February 12, 2023
   EurAsian Times: Russia Is Launching ‘Military Balloons’ With Corner Reflectors Into Ukraine To Exhaust Its Air Defenses – Kyiv 
The Pentagon informed that an F-16 shot down the object, employing the same AIM-9X Sidewinder missile as in the last three shootdowns. 
Pentagon officials assured that none of these objects shot down appeared to pose a military threat. However, there has been a proliferation of balloons being sent to the continent. 
Intriguingly, even as the United States and Canada are actively fighting the menace of UFOs, Russia has now borrowed a fig leaf from this playbook and started infiltrating Ukrainian airspace with its balloons.  Ukraine alleges that the move is aimed at tiring out Ukrainian air defenses.

OilPrice.com: The IEA Expects Global Oil Demand Hit A Record High In 2023 
* The InternationEnergy Agency has raised its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2023 by 100,000 bpd from last month. 
* The agency’s new forecast sees global oil demand increasing by 2 million barrels per day from 2022 levels. 
* China’s resurgent oil demand will account for nearly half the projected increases this year. 
Global oil demand is set to increase by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, pushed up by growth in Chinese consumption after the reopening, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday as it raised its 2023 demand growth estimate by 100,000 bpd from last month’s forecast.
This year, world oil demand is set to average a record 101.9 million bpd, up by 2 million bpd from 2022, the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report today. 
The increase is 100,000 bpd higher than the 1.9 million bpd rise the agency expected at the time of the publishing of its January report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FOX News: Biden to sell 26 million barrels more from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is currently at its lowest level since 1983 
The Biden administration on Monday announced another sale of oil from the Energy Department's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with 26 million barrels set to be delivered to the market from April 1 to June 30, which will take the number of barrels in the reserve to a new low dating back to 1983. 
Unlike the largest-ever drawdown of the SPR that Biden announced in response to Russia's war in Ukraine, the latest release of 26 million barrels is in response to a requirement included in two laws enacted by Congress during the Obama administration under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. 
The announcement comes ahead of a potential uptick in gas prices as the U.S. nears the summer driving season.

WNU Editor: The Biden administration is trying to keep oil prices and the inflationary impacts that it can have as low as possible. Unfortunately, this is only a short term measure. The real solution is to expand domestic oil and gas production, but this is a policy that the Biden administration has all but discouraged since taking office.

* The Managing Director of the IMF warned we need to “think of the unthinkable,” as we live in “a more shock-prone world” impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the recent earthquakes affecting Turkey and Syria.
* “What we are very concerned [about] is the unexpected,” Georgieva said. 
* The global economy will grow 2.9% this year, according to forecasts by the financial organization. 
The Managing Director of the IMF warned that we need to “think of the  unthinkable,” as we live in “a more shock-prone world” impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the recent earthquake across Syria and Turkey. 
“We all have to change our mindset to be much more agile and much more oriented towards building resilience at all levels, so we can handle the shocks better,” Kristalina Georgieva said Tuesday, during a World Government Summit panel hosted by CNBC’s Hadley Gamble. 
 “What we are very concerned [about] is the unexpected,” Georgieva said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York Times/DNYUZ: Three objects shot down after Chinese spy balloon may be benign, White House says 
WASHINGTON — A top White House official said three unidentified flying objects shot down in the past several days might turn out to be harmless commercial or research efforts that posed no real threat to the United States.
John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said investigators had not yet found any evidence that the three objects were connected to China’s program of balloon surveillance similar to the balloon shot down over South Carolina’s coast this month. 
But he cautioned that officials had not yet been able to find and collect the debris from the three objects after they were shot down, and that a different conclusion could be reached if the debris was found and analyzed. 
Mr. Kirby said that military and intelligence officials had also found nothing to suggest that the three objects were part of an intelligence collection effort by another country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Science Alert: We've Forgotton The Potential Horrors of What a Nuclear Winter Would Be Like 
Under the shadow of the Cold War, many in the world feared the impending prospect of a nuclear winter. According to a new report, our focus has since drifted from its horrors, leaving us with a general lack of awareness that could be dangerous for the future of humankind. 
It goes without saying that the threat of a nuclear blast is no trivial event. Decades of pop culture have left society with a relatively strong association between global calamity and atomic weapons. 
But the exact details on exactly what we might expect from such an escalating conflict have become hazy in the past few decades. 
The facts themselves are fairly clear. Besides the many millions who would be killed directly from the blasts, climate models predict the debris resulting from nuclear war would block out much of our sunlight for up to a decade. The consequences for survivors would be devastating: a decline in global temperature, followed by widespread crop failure, and then mass starvation. 
In spite of this dark threat, just a small percentage of today's population claim to be well informed about the precise consequences of a nuclear war – and many of those people are relying on outdated information spread amid the political tensions between superpowers in the 1980s.

WNU Editor: I am in my sixties, and it was drilled into my head at an early age on what the impact of a nuclear war will look like. It looks like this "education" has been omitted for younger generations.

A pair of Dutch F-35 fighters were scrambled overnight to intercept a formation of three Russian warplanes near NATO member Poland. 
The Russian jets - one spy plane and two fighters - were met as they approached Polish airspace from the Russian-controlled enclave of Kaliningrad, and were escorted back out of NATO territory, the Netherlands' defence ministry said Monday. 
'The then unknown aircraft approached the Polish NATO area of responsibility from Kaliningrad,' according to Reuters' translation of the ministry's statement.

CHISINAU (Reuters) -Moldova briefly closed its air space on Tuesday to investigate reports of a balloon-like object in the sky, a day after the small east European country accused Russia of plotting to bring down its government. 
Russia denied the accusation by President Maia Sandu, who has repeatedly expressed concern about Russia's intentions towards the former Soviet republic since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. 
Moldova's civil aviation authority said it acted after receiving a defence ministry report that a small object resembling a weather balloon had been seen over the north of the country, close to the border with Ukraine.

U.S. warplanes intercepted four Russian aircraft operating near Alaska, the Department of Defense announced Feb. 14. But the U.S. stressed the Russian mission was not unsafe or provocative and the aircraft did not pose a threat. 
On Feb. 13, two Russian Tu-95 Bear-H strategic bombers and two Su-35 Flanker-E fighters entered the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said in a statement. 
The Alaska ADIZ serves as an early warning buffer for North America that includes international airspace, and NORAD said that Russian aircraft did not enter American or Canadian airspace.
“This Russian activity in the North American ADIZ occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat, nor is the activity seen as provocative,” NORAD said.

Oil supplies will pose a bigger issue than demand for global markets in 2024 as some countries struggle with production and investment, the United Arab Emirates energy minister said. 
Global oil markets are currently balanced, Suhail Al Mazrouei told Bloomberg TV in Dubai, adding to signals that the UAE and fellow OPEC+ producers will stick with current production targets this year. 
But he cautioned that, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners review plans for 2024 at the end of the year, the biggest quandary may be how the world will satisfy rising consumption.

(Bloomberg) -- NATO countries may agree as soon as this summer to spend at least 2% of their economic output on defense, a slight shift from the alliance’s 10-year-old pledge to “move toward the 2% guideline.” 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the alliance’s defense ministers will begin discussing the target when they meet in Brussels for two days starting on Tuesday, with the aim to agree on a revision by the next NATO summit in Vilnius in July. 
NATO countries have pledged to spend more on defense following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, but many nations — including Luxembourg, Canada and Italy — are still struggling to comply with the old guideline.

Article 5 is NATO’s mutual defense clause.]]></summary>

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic's presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society's political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination," Murangira said.
"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB."
"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime."
Rwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children's hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the "toxicity" of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, "and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes", Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was "now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire", Cumming said.
"So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!"
The queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man was crushed to death by a "telescopic" urinal in central London on Friday, despite the efforts of ambulance crews, an air ambulance and firefighters.
Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London's West End, the city's theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a "telescopic urinal" when he became trapped, police said.
"We're sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene," Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
"Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration," said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence," added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a "quagmire."
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran's government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
"The victim publicized (the) Iranian government's human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution," Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, "highly dangerous" and a "propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology".
"You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you," Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

For generations, the young religious zealot -- hanged the following year -- was roundly despised as the archvillain of India's long struggle to free itself from British colonial rule.

A truck-sized asteroid that suddenly loomed out of the darkness a few days ago -- with the Earth in its sights -- sailed harmlessly past us on Thursday, space scientists said.

Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.
Phew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump on Thursday evening claimed he could end the war between Russian and Ukraine in a single day were he still president.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS," he wrote. "SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!"
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES," Trump said. "Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!"
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a "genius" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.]]></summary>

Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, "It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age."

The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
"Before encountering Earth, the asteroid's orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth's orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun," NASA said in a statement. "After its encounter, the asteroid's orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth's and Mars' orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days."
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.]]></summary>

I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969).
