        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANU astrophysicist and cosmologist Dr Brad Tucker says the SpaceX Crew 5 mission launched early Thursday shows launches are “becoming quite regular” for the company.

“They’re doing this five-to-six-month rotations on behalf of NASA, so they send the astronauts up, they do experiments, conduct operations on the International Space Station,” he told Sky News Australia.

Dr Tucker said this mission marks the first time a Native American woman has gone into space and a Russian cosmonaut was on board.

“In the past, these missions, these, kind of, stays, have been taking Americans, Russians and a few other countries together,” he said. 

“Obviously, with the war in Ukraine tensions have been high – even in space – and we’ve seen Americans still going with the Russians on the Russian capsule but this is the first time a Russian has gone on a SpaceX capsule.

“It’s as much a good sign for science as it is international peace and diplomacy”.]]></summary>

The maker of electric trucks and SUVs, founded in 2009, said it is recalling about 13,000 vehicles because a fastener connecting the vehicle’s upper front control arm and steering knuckle may not have enough torque. 
There were seven reports potentially related to the problem, but no injuries were reported, Rivian said. 
“If you experience excessive noise, vibration or harshness from the front suspension, or a change in steering performance or feel, call immediately,” wrote Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe in a letter to vehicle owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamestown Foundation: Russia’s Skyrocketing Defense Spending, 2022–2023 
 1) Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine has forced the Kremlin to ramp up defense spending in a big way. 
2) The turbulence in Russian defense spending will probably increase in 2023. 
3) The skyrocketing defense budget means less flexibility and efficiency for Russian government spending. 
Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine and the Kremlin’s attempts to escalate the political situation and prevent defeat on the battlefield through mobilization, nuclear blackmail and possibly even sabotage on gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea raise the question: How do all these factors influence the Russian defense budget? 
Since May 2022, the Russian government has not released much data on the defense budget. Nevertheless, defense spending from January to April totaled almost 1.6 trillion rubles ($26.4 billion), with about 500 billion rubles ($8.3 billion) of spending per month for March and April. Considering these dynamics in comparison with Moscow’s defense spending in previous years—roughly 300 billion rubles ($5 billion) per month—and the fact that the original defense budget in 2022 was 3.85 trillion rubles ($63.6 billion), the true amount for Russian defense spending in 2022 may well reach as much as 5.5 trillion rubles ($90.9 billion) by the end of the year (Budget.gov.ru, May 2022).

WNU Editor: The last thing that is on the Kremlin's mind right now is balancing their budget. Their priority and focus right now is to win the war, and to spend what is necessary to achieve it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge/Remix News: Hungary Is Now The Only EU State Still Receiving Russian Gas 
With three of the four pipelines delivering Russian natural gas to Europe out of commission, Hungary is now the only EU member state still receiving Russian gas, Forbes Hungary writes. 
There are four pipelines that could supply Russian natural gas to Europe: 
1) Nord Stream 1, with a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year (deliveries on this one were halted by Russia); 
2) Nord Stream 2, with an identical capacity of 55 bcm (this one never became operational after the German government refused to approve it in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine). 
3) Yamal Europe, the longest pipeline (4,107 kilometers) supplies gas from the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia, terminating in Germany, and has a capacity of 33 bcm. Deliveries were halted by Russia in May. 
4) Turk Stream, delivering gas from Russia under the Black Sea and through the Balkans, has a capacity of 31.5 bcm and is the only pipeline still in operation. It terminates in Hungary, meaning that as of now, Hungary is the only EU member state still receiving Russian natural gas. 
Due to the huge income Russia has made from soaring gas prices, coupled with a massive reduction in other trade with Europe, Russia has no interest in completely shutting down these pipelines.

WNU Editor: If this continues Hungary will be the envy of Europe later this winter. The costs may be high, but they at least have natural gas.]]></summary>

Russia could restart the supply of natural gas to Germany and its neighbors via an undamaged section of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Russian media.

Is it because it destroys the media narrative that Russia is responsible for this attack? Or is it because the EU does not want the public to have a reason to protest for the opening of this pipeline as energy supplies decline and costs increase. Either way the lack of coverage of this news is perplexing.]]></summary>

French European Affairs Minister Laurence Boone said that after Italy’s new government takes power, France ‘will be very attentive to respect of values and the rule of law.’ 
 ROME — Italy’s prime minister-in-waiting Giorgia Meloni reacted with fury after French European Affairs Minister Laurence Boone said that after Italy’s new government takes power, France will monitor the rule of law in Italy. 
In an interview with Italian newspaper la Repubblica, Boone said: “We want to work with Rome but we will monitor respect for rights and freedoms” and “we will pay close attention to respect of values ​​and the rule of law. The EU has already shown that it is vigilant toward other countries such as Hungary and Poland.”
Meloni, who is expected to be appointed prime minister of Italy after her right-wing coalition won 44 percent of the vote in an election on September 25, called the comments “an unacceptable threat of interference in a sovereign state.”

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russian officials have begun to "prepare their society" for the possible use of nuclear weapons, but added he does not believe Russia is ready to use them.

   Endgadget: Frontline Ukraine troops are reportedly enduring Starlink outages  
The lack of internet access is said to be hampering efforts to drive back Russian forces. 
Ukrainian forces have reportedly been dealing with Starlink outages as they try to take back Russian-occupied areas. 
Some of the outages, which are said to have caused a severe loss of communication over the last several weeks, occurred as troops broke through the frontline into territory controlled by Russia as well as during battles, a Ukraine government official told The Financial Times. 
The cause of the apparent outages are not yet known. Engadget has contacted Starlink owner SpaceX for comment. 
Starlink outages were reported in the four regions that Russia annexed last month following referendums, the legitimacy of which have been disputed. 
As the Financial Times notes, there's a significant Ukrainian counteroffensive in those areas.

Daily Mail: From bare-chested brute to Bond-villain wannabe: The images that show Vladimir Putin's unpredictable nature across 70 years... as the Russian leader takes the world to the brink of Armageddon 
* Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70 on Friday amid his on-going invasion of neighbouring Ukraine 
* Putin has dominated Russia for nearly 23 years since being picked by President Boris Yeltsin as his successor 
* He cultivated an image at home as a strongman with adventure stunts, such as riding, fishing and shooting

US and Philippine marines stormed a beach near a disputed rocky outcrop in the South China Sea on Friday as part of joint military drills involving more than 3,500 troops. 
The KAMANDAG exercises - the Philippines' acronym for 'Cooperation of the Warriors of the Sea' - kicked off Monday and will be held across the country's main island of Luzon until October 14. 
Around 300 troops were involved in Friday's amphibious drills held on an uninhabited beach in Zambales province, about 150 miles east of Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012.

“The peace prize laureates represent civil society in their home countries,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee. “They have for many years promoted the right to criticise power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens.”

PARIS (Reuters) - France launched a national energy savings plan on Thursday, banking on a push to turn off lights and lower thermostats to avoid power and gas cuts over the winter. 
Although the country is less dependent on Russian gas than eastern neighbours like Germany, French nuclear power production has slumped as the sector struggles to bring more of its aging reactors online out of forced maintenance. 
The government has set a target of cutting France's energy consumption 10% by 2024 from 2019 levels, a first step in a longer-term plan to become carbon neutral by reducing energy use 40% by 2050.
"Our joint action will allow us to avoid taking more binding measures," Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said as she presented the plan.

Britain braces for potential energy blackouts this winter amid supply disruptions due to the war in Ukraine 
The U.K. national power operator has warned that citizens should brace for up to three-hour power blackouts this winter in the "unlikely" event that gas supplies fall short. 
The National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) announced Thursday that it has taken steps to establish precautionary measures to ensure gas supplies from October 31 to March 31, 2023. 
"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that overall, this is likely to be a challenging winter for energy supply throughout Europe," the national operator said in a statement that highlighted multiple scenarios where Brits could find their power shut off during peak use.

CNN: Hiking rates too quickly could trigger a ‘prolonged recession,’ IMF head warns 
The global economic outlook is darkening and the risks of recession are quickly rising: That’s the latest message from the International Monetary Fund, which said Thursday it will once again lower its growth projections. 
“We estimate that countries accounting for about one-third of the world economy will experience at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this or next year,” said IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva during a speech at Georgetown University. 
“And, even when growth is positive, it will feel like a recession because of shrinking real incomes and rising prices.”  The IMF anticipates that the world could lose $4 trillion in economic output between now and 2026.

        <updated>2022-10-07T00:00:00.020Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Kremlin seizes on Zelensky 'blunder' after Ukraine President demands NATO 'launch pre-emptive strikes' on Russia to stop Putin using nukes - before insisting he meant 'imposing sanctions' pre-invasion as Kyiv troops hammer Moscow forces into retreat 
* Zelensky appeared to suggest NATO should launch a series of preemptive strikes against Russian territory 
* Russia said the comments risked 'monstrous consequences' and appeared to call for 'yet another world war' 
* Kyiv later insisted Zelensky was referencing preemptive sanctions and 'would never call for use of nukes' 
The Kremlin has warned of potentially 'monstrous consequences' after Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to suggest NATO powers should bomb Russia to deter Vladimir Putin from using nuclear weapons against Ukraine. 
Russia said such comments risked starting 'yet another world war' after the Ukrainian president seemed to tell Australian think tank the Lowy Institute that he believed 'preemptive strikes' on Russian territory were necessary. 
However Kyiv later insisted he was actually calling for 'preemptive sanctions', just as he did 'before February 24', when the invasion was launched.

WNU Editor: These remarks are insane. This is how World War 3 will start.  The Ukraine government is walking back President Zelensky's remarks on a pre-emptive strike. But he was very clear on what he said and what he wants. 
The complete remarks by Ukraine President Zelensky at the Lowy institute is below:

The Hill: House Democrats propose end to US troop protection in Gulf after OPEC cut 
Three House Democrats have introduced legislation to end U.S. troop protection in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in response to news this week that OPEC and its allies will slash oil production. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which together comprise about 30 percent of global crude oil reserves, have some 5,000 U.S. troops stationed there. 
In addition to removing those troops and American missile defense systems from the two countries, the legislation introduced by Reps. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Susan Wild (D-Pa.) would move all U.S. technology and defense systems elsewhere in the region.

Quartz: OPEC’s oil cuts force the US to reconsider its foreign policy  
The US is accusing Saudi Arabia of "aligning with Russia" while seeking to restart Venezuelan oil production.

Saudi Arabia, which controls about one-third of OPEC’s oil reserves and is seen as a US ally, has not heeded president Joe Biden’s plea against taking such a drastic step.

Oil production cuts prompt backlash from Washington amid soaring energy inflation 
The White House has accused Opec+ of aligning with Russia after Saudi Arabia led the group in agreeing deep oil production cuts, prompting a backlash from countries battling surging energy inflation triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The Opec+ group said it would reduce production targets by 2mn barrels a day, equivalent to 2 per cent of global supply, following its first in-person meeting in two years in Vienna. The actual cut in output is likely to be closer to 1mn b/d as many weaker members have struggled to hit production targets in recent months.

WNU Editor: OPEC is seeing western countries impose oil sanctions, oil price caps, and hearing vows to transition away from fossil fuels.

Of course OPEC is going to circle the wagons and react in the way that they did. They see their economic survival at stake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.
Lead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.
Gahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.
"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil," he said of their 19th tour.
The band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words "Berlin 4.10.22".
Credited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, "Spirit", in 2017. "Memento Mori" will be their 15th studio record.
Depeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.
The band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as "Personal Jesus", "People Are People" and "Enjoy the Silence".
The group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

The question of reparations is closed, as far as the German government is concerned, the Green Party politician said on Tuesday, following consultations with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau.
Still, "Germany stands by its historical responsibility without any ifs and buts," Baerbock said. "It remains our eternal task to remember the millionfold suffering German inflicted on Poland."

Sceptics had expected glitches with the upgrade, known as "the merge", but it ended up being a "rather boring event", according to Alex de Vries of the Free University in Amsterdam.
De Vries, whose Digiconomist website models the energy use of Bitcoin and Ethereum, said consumption had indeed plummeted by more than 99 percent on Ethereum.

Charles has fled China and several of his activist friends are in jail.
"After 2015, the whole of civil society began to collapse and become fragmented," he told AFP, using a pseudonym for safety reasons.

Many of Australia's species are clinging to existence, their habitats shrinking from human activity and extreme events such as the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires, wildlife groups say.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government announced a new 10-year scheme to try and halt the slide into extinction of 110 "priority species" and shield 20 "priority places" from further degradation.
It aims to prevent any new extinctions of plants and animals while conserving at least 30 percent of Australia's land mass.

"The deserts and mountains of Saudi Arabia will soon be a playground for winter sports," the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said in a statement on the decision made during its general assembly meeting in Phnom Penh.
The Saudi bid was "unanimously approved", the statement said, noting that the megacity known as NEOM will be the first West Asian city to host the event.
First announced in 2017, NEOM has consistently raised eyebrows for proposed flourishes like flying taxis and robot maids, even as architects and economists have questioned its feasibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for "experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science", the award-giving body said on Tuesday.
The more than century-old prize, worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($902,315), is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week after Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday.
The prestigious prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in the will of Alfred Nobel, who made a fortune from his invention of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 with a some interruptions, primarily the two world wars.
The physics prize has often taken centre stage among the awards, featuring household names of science such as Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie, and rewarding breakthroughs that have reshaped how we see the world.
Last year, scientists Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi shared the physics prize for their work on
complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate, key in understanding global warming.
Announced over consecutive weekdays in early October, the physics prize announcement will be followed by awards for chemistry, literature, peace and economics, the latter added in 1969 to the original line-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nuclear-armed North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years on Tuesday, prompting a warning for residents to take cover and a temporary suspension of train operations in northern Japan.
The Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific Ocean.
It was the first North Korean missile to follow such a trajectory since 2017, and Tokyo said its 4,600 km (2,850 miles) range may have been the longest distance travelled for a North Korean test flight, which are more often "lofted" higher into space to avoid flying over neighboring countries.
The latest launch was Pyongyang's fifth in 10 days, amid military muscle-flexing by the United States, South Korea, and Japa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 15 prisoners died Monday in the latest unrest inside Ecuador's prison system, officials in the South American country reported.
The agency that manages Ecuador's prisons, SNAI, gave the death toll in a statement which also said 21 people were injured in the clashes between inmates.
It had earlier announced that tactical units conducted operations to regain control of the facility, located in the Ecuadoran city of Latacunga.
The prison houses about 4,300 prisoners and is one of the largest in the country.
Violence in Ecuador's prisons, where drug gangs vie for power, is often carried out with knives and sometimes involves beheadings. The violence has left more than 400 prisoners dead since February 2021.
On Monday, inmates climbed onto roofs while detonations were heard, according …]]></summary>

On Monday, Musk posted a proposed deal on Twitter that would end the war if Ukraine gave up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia had originally annexed in 2014.
This earned a profane reaction from at least one Ukrainian government official.
"The only outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing tesla crap. So good luck to you @elonmusk," said Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk. "F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you..."

"I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime, as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad," the supreme leader said.
Amini, 22, was pronounced dead on September 16, days after the notorious morality police detained the Kurdish Iranian for allegedly breaching rules forcing women to wear hijab headscarves and modest clothes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Orlene made landfall on Monday on Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and a risk of flooding and landslides, forecasters said.
Orlene came ashore south of the beachside city of Mazatlan in Sinaloa state as a Category One hurricane -- the weakest on a scale of five.
At 1500 GMT, the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour and moving inland toward the northeast, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Boats had been brought ashore in Mazatlan ahead of Orlene's arrival, and businesses boarded up windows and laid down sandbags in case of flooding.
Orlene had strengthened to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on Sunday in the Pacific, prompting warnings for inhabitants of at-risk areas to take refuge in temporary shelters.
But the storm gradually lost strength as it approached the coast and was expected to quickly lose its hurricane force after making landfall.
"Rapid weakening is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours as Orlene moves inland," the NHC said.
"Orlene is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by this afternoon, and dissipate tonight or early Tuesday," it added.
Tropical cyclones hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts, usually between May and November.
In October 1997, Hurricane Paulina hit Mexico's Pacific coast as a Category 4 storm, leaving more than 200 dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain on Monday scrapped plans to axe its top income tax rate just 10 days after a debt-driven budget sparked turmoil on markets and fierce criticism during a cost-of-living crisis.
On the second day of the ruling Conservative Party's annual conference, finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted he was "not proceeding" with the removal of the top 45-percent income tax rate, adding it had become a "distraction".
The announcement also marked the first major policy U-turn under British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office less than one month ago.
"It is clear that the abolition of the 45p tax rate has become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our country. As a result, I'm announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the ... rate.
"We get it, and we have listened."
The announcement also came after former cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Michael Gove voiced opposition over unfunded tax cuts unveiled by Kwarteng in his controversial mini-budget on September 23.
Kwarteng had proposed to remove the 45-percent rate applied to Britons earning more than £150,000 ($167,400) per year.
The so-called mini budget had sent the pound plunging to a record dollar low and sent bond yields spiking on fears of a borrowing splurge.
The budget included a costly freeze on energy bills for individuals and businesses, in an attempt to cushion fallout from key gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brazil’s presidential race will need to go to an October 30th second round after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fell short of the 50%+1 he needed to avoid a run-off with extremist incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.
Brazilians voted Sunday in a historic presidential election, with leftist front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led in the pre-election polls, winning but still short of the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff election.

There are fears the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will not accept a defeat after he warned that he will only leave office if he's "killed, jailed, or victorious" and has called on his base to "go to war" if the vote is "stolen."
Bolsonaro took an early lead as results started coming in but in 2014, when Lula's leftist party last won a presidential election, it only took the lead after two hours of vote counting. Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.
Lula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.

With 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:

With 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:


Lula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.
To win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.
Polls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.

STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) -Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for discoveries that underpin our understanding of how modern day humans evolved from extinct ancestors.
The prize, arguably among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($900,357).
It is the first of this year's batch of prizes. The Award committee officially gave Paabo the prize for "discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution."

Kurdish Iranian Amini, 22, was pronounced dead on September 16, days after the notorious morality police detained her for allegedly breaching rules forcing women to wear hijab headscarves and modest clothes.
Outrage over her death has sparked the biggest wave of protests to rock the Islamic republic in almost three years, as well as global solidarity rallies that saw people take to the streets in more than 150 cities at the weekend, with many symbolically cutting off their hair.

"We're committed to helping Taiwan develop the capability to defend itself," Austin said in an interview with CNN.
Washington has historically maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" on whether it would intervene militarily if Taiwan were attacked by China.
Asked in an interview with CBS last month whether US troops would defend Taiwan, Biden said "yes," if it were "an unprecedented attack."
Austin was asked by CNN host Fareed Zakaria whether the US military was preparing to send troops to Taiwan in line with Biden's comments, but he declined to answer directly.
