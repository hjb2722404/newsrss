        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico: Jens Stoltenberg to continue as NATO chief 
Current leadership will continue for another year. 
NATO allies have agreed to extend Jens Stoltenberg’s term as secretary-general by a year. 
“Honoured by NATO Allies’ decision to extend my term as Secretary General until 1 October 2024,” Stoltenberg tweeted. “The transatlantic bond between Europe & North America has ensured our freedom & security for nearly 75 years, and in a more dangerous world, our Alliance is more important than ever,” he added. 
The decision, ahead of a summit of NATO leaders in Vilnius next week, is seen as a reflection of how politically sensitive the current moment is for the alliance, as well as how difficult it is for allies to find a high-profile candidate who is both available and acceptable to all alliance members.

President Emmanuel Macron's government faced a backlash Wednesday after the centrist leader called for powers to "cut off" social media in case of widespread violence like riots over the past week. 
"We have to think about the social networks, about the bans we'll have to put in place. When things get out of control, we might need to be able to regulate or cut them off," Macron told a meeting of mayors on Tuesday according to media reports.
Macron and his ministers have singled out platforms like Snapchat, TikTok and encrypted messenger Telegram for their role in spreading images of the nights of violence following the June 27 police shooting of a 17-year-old teenager, Nahel M. 
"When (social media) becomes a tool for organising or for attempting to kill, it's a real problem," Macron said.

 Just weeks after hugely disruptive protests and strikes over pension reforms in France finally died down, businesses in the country are grappling with the fallout from a week of rioting. 
The riots, which were sparked by the fatal shooting of a teenager by a police officer last Tuesday, have already caused more than €1 billion ($1.1 billion) worth of damage, according to a French business association, MEDEF. 
Protesters have attacked nearly 400 bank branches and 500 corner shops, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told CNN affiliate BFMTV Wednesday. Speaking to CNN’s Isa Soares Tuesday, Le Maire put the total number of looted stores at 1,000, adding that the businesses were being supported by the government.

The US Navy intervened to stop Iranian Navy ships attempting to seize two oil tankers in separate incidents in the Gulf of Oman early on Wednesday morning, according to a US defense official. 
An Iranian ship opened fire at the tanker in the second seizure attempt, according to the official. 
In the first incident, an Iranian Navy vessel approached the TRF Moss, a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker, in international waters in the Gulf of Oman at approximately 1 am local time, the official said. The tanker was through the Strait of Hormuz and heading toward the Arabian Sea when the Iranian vessel approached.

JENIN REFUGEE CAMP — Israel ended Wednesday a two-day operation in the Jenin refugee camp that killed 12 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier, forced thousands from their homes, and created a new equation in the West Bank conflict for longer, deadlier reprisals to militant attacks. 
The operation, the biggest in two decades, cleared Jenin camp of hundreds of explosives and weapons and confiscated hundreds of thousands of dollars in “terror funds,” according to Israel. But the scars on the camp were everywhere with churned asphalt and pulverized cars, windows and doors smashed in by military bulldozers. Cartridge shells and burned tires littered the streets, while water and power supplies were cut.

 U.S. District Court Judge Terry Doughty also issueda sweeping preliminary injunction barring numerous federal officials and agencies — including Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and all employees of the Justice Department and FBI — from having any contact with social media firms for the purpose of discouraging or removing First Amendment-protected speech.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Tuesday that Ukraine had attacked Moscow with at least five drones that were all either shot down or jammed, though one of the capital's main airports had to reroute flights for several hours. 
Four Ukrainian drones were shot down by Moscow air defences while a fifth was jammed and crashed into the Odintsovo district of the Moscow region, the Russian defence ministry said. No one was injured. 
Russian news agencies reported that two drones were intercepted near a village 30 km (19 miles) southwest of the Kremlin. One drone was detected in the neighbouring Kaluga region.

Reuters: Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of plotting imminent attack on nuclear plant 
Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday accused each other of plotting to stage an attack on the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, long the subject of mutual recriminations and suspicions. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he told his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, about Russian "dangerous provocations" at the plant in southeastern Ukraine. 
Russian troops seized the station, Europe's largest nuclear facility with six reactors, in the days following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
 Each side has since regularly accused the other of shelling around the plant and risking a major nuclear mishap.

* Advisory comes after a 78-year-old U.S. citizen was sentenced to life in prison on spying charges in May

Reuters: EU weighs concession to Russian bank over Black Sea grain deal -FT 
(Reuters) -The European Union is considering a proposal for the Russian Agricultural Bank to set up a subsidiary to reconnect to the global financial network as a sop to Moscow, the Financial Times said on Monday. 
With the bank under sanctions, the move aims to safeguard the Black Sea grain deal that allows Ukraine to export food to global markets, the newspaper said. 
Russia last week said that it saw no reason to extend the grain deal beyond July 17 because the West had acted in an "outrageous" way over the agreement, though it assured poor countries that Russian grain exports would continue.

Israeli forces has launched what a military source said is its largest military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin in more than 20 years, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 50 others, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it launched an “extensive counterterrorism effort in the area of the city of Jenin and the Jenin Camp,” striking “terrorist infrastructure,” in a statement posted to Telegram in the early hours of Monday morning.
Residents in Jenin told CNN they heard explosions and heavy gunfire in the area, while video from the scene showed wounded Palestinians being evacuated by ambulance to Jenin Government Hospital.

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the United States pledged its “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.” This support has materialized in over $75 billion in security assistance to date, with the United States committed to aiding Ukraine until the fighting stops. As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in announcing a new installment of weapons to Ukraine: “The United States and our allies and partners will stand united with Ukraine, for as long as it takes.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of South Koreans brought rainbow pride to the streets of Seoul on Saturday for an annual celebration of LGBTQ rights, while demonstrators against them snagged a prime site marchers had used since 2015.
This year's Pride Parade, one of Asia's largest, was denied permission to congregate at the central plaza where the main festivities have traditionally taken place.
Instead, an increasingly vocal Christian-led opposition was granted the spot, highlighting the struggles South Korea's campaigners for LGBTQ rights face.
The heat, humidity and backlash still did not deter supporters from throning to Seoul's Queer Parade, which organizers estimated drew a crowd of around 50,000 people.

Biden was leaving a press conference on Friday on the US Supreme Court's decision to block his student debt relief program when a reporter asked if he admitted to mistakes during the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
"No, no. All the evidence is coming back," he replied, according to a White House transcript.
"Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said al Qaeda would not be there. I said it wouldn't be there. I said we'd get help from the Taliban. What's happening now? What's going on? Read your press. I was right."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's leader said the city must guard against "destructive forces engaging in soft resistance" as it marked the 26th anniversary of its handover from British to Chinese rule on Saturday.
Britain ceded the long-time colony to China in 1997 under a 50-year governance model known as "one country, two systems", which guaranteed key freedoms and a measure of autonomy.
These rights -- such as the freedom of assembly -- set Hong Kong apart from the mainland, and July 1 was once a day of demonstrations for the city's outspoken civil society.
But following huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019, China imposed a sweeping national security law that -- when combined with legal changes putting "patriots" in charge -- effectively stamped out most forms of dissent from Hong Kong …]]></summary>

Prigozhin attempted to rebel against the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin was enjoying himself at one of the country's "most popular" events, the Scarlet Sails festival, according to Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar.
In a New York Times op-ed published Friday, Zygar shares that after speaking with Putin allies, it's clear they believe "this is the clearest evidence yet that the president is divorced from reality."
And as a result of his failure to prevent the rebellion — if only he had talked to Prigozhin — many of those same allies are feeling "a growing appetite for change."
The former editor in chief of Russian independent TV news channel Dozed writes:
"First, he encouraged Mr. Prigozhin, tacitly allowing him to recruit widely — including …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Friday likened Donald Trump’s plight to that of disgraced Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro.
The far-right congresswoman suggested that special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump is politically motivated, but she did the former president no favors comparing him to Bolsonaro.
She isn’t the first to make the comparison. 
Both leaders are election deniers who inspired failed insurrections after spreading baseless theories of voter fraud. 
Bolsonaro was found guilty of abusing his power and misusing public media during last year’s election, and Brazil’s highest electoral court on Friday issued a ruling that bars him for running for public office until 2030.
Brazilian prosecutors alleged that Bolsonaro in July 2022 held a meeting with foreign ambassador in which he spread misinformation about Brazil’s electoral system. 
Trump is facing a 37-count indictment over allegations he mishandled classified documents. 
“That's EXACTLY what the American liberals are trying to do through the court system here,” Boebert tweeted.
“Unbelievable how liberals use lawfare since they can't win fairly.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Brazilian court on Friday reached the majority it needs to bar far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro from politics for eight years over unfounded claims against the voting system.
Four of the seven judges of the Superior Electoral Tribunal have voted to discipline Bolsonaro for alleged abuses of power, while one so far has found in his favor.
With two votes outstanding, the trial could yet be postponed to a later date for the final ruling.
The tribunal is trying the former president on charges he abused his office and state media in making unfounded allegations of security flaws in Brazil's electronic voting system.
Prosecutors have linked Bolsonaro's statements to his supporters invading the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court on January 8, a week after the inauguration …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis met Friday with the wife of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as he nears the "endgame" of his fight against extradition to the United States on espionage charges.
Francis, the head of the worldwide Catholic Church, "received in audience Ms Stella Assange, with family members," the Vatican said in a short statement.
On Twitter, Stella Assange said she and her children had been given a private audience with the 86-year-old Argentine pontiff, adding: "We are overwhelmed."
Julian Assange is in prison in Britain, fighting extradition to the US, where he faces trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010 related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could be sentenced to decades behind bars if found guilty.
During a protest in London against his extradition earlier this month, his wife said his transfer to the United States could be imminent.
"Julian could be a few weeks away from extradition. We don't have a clear timeline, but this really is the endgame," Stella Assange told reporters.
Supporters portray the Australian publisher as a martyr to press freedom.
The 51-year-old has been held since 2019 at the Belmarsh high security prison in southeast London.
He previously spent nearly seven years holed up in Ecuador's embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault.
He claimed the allegations were politically motivated, linked to the work of WikiLeaks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said Friday that the government was considering "all options" to restore order, including declaring a state of emergency, after a third night of rioting over a police officer's killing of a youth.
Asked by reporters if a state of emergency was a possibility, as some right-wing opposition parties have demanded, Borne replied: "I won't tell you now, but we are looking at all options, with one priority: restoring order throughout the country".
The prime minister, who was visiting a police station in Evry-Courcouronnes south of Paris, is to attend a crisis security meeting chaired by President Emmanuel Macron at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT).
A state of emergency would give authorities increased powers to declare localized curfews, ban demonstrations, and give police…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey was on Friday described as a "sexual bully", as prosecutors opened their case against him in London for a string of sexual offense charges.
"Kevin Spacey Fowler is an actor; many of you will already know that," lawyer Christine Agnew told a jury at Southwark Crown Court, using the star's full name.
"He is an extremely famous actor who has won a number of awards. He is also, the prosecution allege, a man who sexually assaults other men."
Agnew said Spacey, a two-time Academy Award winner for "American Beauty" and "The Usual Suspects", did not respect personal boundaries or space.
He was "a man who it would seem delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable, a sexual bully", the lawyer alleged in her opening speech.
"His preferred method of assault is it appears to grab aggressively other men in the crotch. On one occasion things went further than that."
Spacey, 63, denies three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault, and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He also pleaded not guilty to a further charge of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The alleged offenses, against four men who cannot be identified under English law, are said to have occurred between 2001 and 2013.
Agnew said Spacey had dismissed some of the allegations as "quite simply made up", and others that were consensual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Minister Hun Sen warned Friday he could block access to Facebook in Cambodia, after the company said it would remove a video in which he threatened to beat up political opponents.
The warning came ahead of a July 23 election that has been widely dubbed a sham after authorities denied registration to the chief challenger to Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
Facebook announced Thursday it would remove one of Hun Sen's videos in line with a ruling by the Oversight Board for Meta, Facebook's parent company, which also recommended his account be suspended.
Tech experts characterized the move as a "turning point".
The ruling said his speech contained "unequivocal statements of intent to commit violence" against opposition politicians.
Long a prolific Facebook user, Hun Sen announc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Thai doctor endorsing a dubious diabetes treatment, a Filipino physician touting crotch-enhancing underwear, a US doctor sparking off anti-vaccine conspiracies -- they are all victims of identity theft plaguing health professionals.
AFP's fact-checkers have exposed a slew of cases around the world in which fraudsters impersonated doctors, fabricating their comments or endorsements to push out bogus treatments and products or to peddle propaganda.
The trend underscores how medical professionals are often sitting targets for online scammers seeking to profit off disinformation, which leaves their reputations tarnished, provokes harassment and, in some cases, legal challenges.
For ordinary consumers, the growing wave of impersonation scams poses financial risks and often jeopardizes access …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drag queen Hurricane Kimchi has torn through Seoul's nightlife scene like their meteorological namesake for a decade, part of a burgeoning LGBTQ community fighting for their rights in socially conservative South Korea.
It's not the K-pop image that South Korea usually projects to the world.
Gay marriage is banned in the country, social pressure keeps many in the closet, and the annual Pride celebration attracts vicious Christian-led opposition.
But change is coming. Hurricane Kimchi told AFP when they first went to Seoul Pride more than a decade ago only a few hundred people were there.
More than 150,000 are expected this Saturday, according to organizers, despite a growing official backlash.
This year's celebration, one of Asia's largest, was denied permission to use the capital's central…]]></summary>

"Our constitution is the Koran," read a message on leaflets carried by the protesters, and a message sprayed on the compound's gate said "Yes, yes to the Koran".
The protest came a day after an Iraqi citizen living in Sweden, Salwan Momika, 37, stomped on the Islamic holy book and set several pages alight in front of the capital's largest mosque.
Swedish police had granted him a permit in line with free-speech protections, but authorities later said they had opened an investigation over "agitation".
"Within 10 days I will burn the Iraqi flag and the Koran in front of Iraq's embassy in Stockholm," Momika told a Swedis…]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
