Three people have died in the incident in Central Russia, with at least one injured, local authorities say 
An explosion has rocked a pipeline in Russia’s Chuvash Republic several hundred kilometers east of Moscow, causing a major fire, local officials said. The incident along the route, which is used to transport energy to Europe, killed at least three people and injured another one, while prompting gas prices in Europe to soar. 
The local administration’s press service said the blast occurred along the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline. It added that the operating company had been conducting maintenance work on the conduit before the fire broke out.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana on Monday suspended payments on most of its external debt, effectively defaulting as the country struggles to plug its cavernous balance of payments deficit. 
Its finance ministry said it will not service debts including its Eurobonds, commercial loans and most bilateral loans, calling the decision an "interim emergency measure", while some bondholders criticised a lack of clarity in the decision. 
The government "stands ready to engage in discussions with all of its external creditors to make Ghana's debt sustainable", the finance ministry said. 
The suspension of debt payments reflects the parlous state of the economy, which had led the government last week to reach a $3-billion staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Air Force Times: B-2 nuclear bomber fleet grounded amid search for safety defects 
All 20 of the Air Force’s B-2 Spirit bombers are grounded as the service hunts for potential safety defects, a spokesperson confirmed Monday. The stealth aircraft will be down until further notice. 
The Air Force paused the fleet’s operations after a bomber was damaged Dec. 10 at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. 
An undisclosed in-flight malfunction forced the crew to make an emergency landing on Whiteman’s runway, where firefighters extinguished flames at the scene, according to the 509th Bomb Wing. No one was injured.

CNN: Russia and China unite for live-fire naval exercises in waters near Japan  
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — China and Russia will begin a weeklong joint live-fire naval exercise in the East China Sea on Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, as the two partners step up cooperation in an increasingly tense western Pacific. 
“The active part of the exercise will include joint missile and artillery firing against air targets, artillery firing against sea targets, and practicing joint anti-submarine actions with practical use of weapons,” the Russian statement said. 
The exercises, dubbed Maritime Cooperation 2022, will feature Russia’s Pacific Fleet flagship – the missile cruiser Varyag – a frigate and two corvettes, the statement said, adding that China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy will send two destroyers, two patrol ships, a multipurpose supply ship, and a diesel submarine. 
Chinese aircraft would also take part, it said.

A high-ranking Ukrainian official believes that Russia is running out of missiles to target critical infrastructure. 
Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov told Ukrainian news outlet Pravda on Monday that Russia has "at most two or three, maybe four more to spare." 
"But then they will be completely without missiles, which is unacceptable, because they may have completely different challenges, and they have to leave at least some reserve," Danilov said.

The Biden administration is lying about maintaining contacts between the two countries, the Foreign Ministry says 
Washington’s “dangerous and short-sighted policy” has put it “on the brink of a direct clash” with Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Monday, responding to US State Department spokesman Ned Price, who blamed Russia last week for making relations between the two countries “unstable and unpredictable.” 
Moscow has “genuinely strived” to make relations with the US stable and predictable, even as Washington stokes tensions, Zakharova added.

UK prime minister says Kremlin must step back from ‘conquered territory’ before any real peace talks can start. 
The West should consider any Russian call for a cease-fire in its war against Ukraine “completely meaningless” in the current circumstances, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday. 
Speaking in Riga during a summit of leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), a military alliance of 10 Northern European countries, Sunak warned Russia would only use a halt in hostilities as an opportunity to regroup its forces. 
“We must be clear that any unilateral call for a cease-fire by Russia is completely meaningless in the current context,” he said. “I think it would be a false call.”

KYIV, Ukraine — Russia attacked Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities in the early hours of Monday with a horde of self-detonating drones — once again bombing critical infrastructure but with a sinister tactical shift that seemed intended to deprive Ukrainians not only of heat, electricity, and water but also of sleep. 
Air raids sirens rang out in Kyiv at 2 a.m., the shrill sound amplified by the emptiness of the capital’s streets during its overnight curfew.  Russia has been bombing Ukrainian cities relentlessly with missiles and drones since early October seeking to destroy the country’s energy grid and leave citizens without urgent services in the frigid winter, including a heavy missile barrage on Friday. 
But Monday’s strikes mark the first time Russia had sent such a large fleet of drones overnight — potentially a recognition by Russian commanders that their noisy, slow-flying Iranian drones are far easier to spot and shoot down during daylight.

In key countries around the world, 2022 was the year democracy proved it could fight back.
 On the night of February 23, the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, I attended a reading group with a number of prominent Washington foreign policy experts and journalists. We had convened to discuss the work of Carl Schmitt, an interwar German political theorist who believed — among other things — that politics is, at base, about violence. The fundamental political distinction, in Schmitt’s view, is between “friend and enemy”; the fundamental political act is killing one’s enemies. A peaceful democratic world is, in his mind, a fantasy; ultimately, politics would always return to brutality.

Daily Mail: Time's UP! Chief Twit Elon Musk is ordered to step down as head of Twitter by 57.5% of voters in his own poll: More than 17million votes cast in 12 hours – but will he listen? 
* Twitter CEO Elon Musk put his future with the company in the hands of its users  
* In a poll he asked if he should step down and swore to 'abide by the results' 
* More than 17.5million people voted, with 57.5% saying they wanted him to go  
Elon Musk might be on the way out as head of Twitter after nearly 60 per cent of users who voted in a poll want him to be sacked. 
After weeks of criticism for how he has run the website since he took it over at the end of October, the Chief Twit put a review of his performance to the people. 
More than 17.5million people cast their vote in a poll asking if he should quit his job as CEO.

Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested. 
If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.

They are among the thousands of protesters demanding not only Castillo's release but also the resignation of his successor Dina Boluarte, the dissolution of Congress and new elections.
"I came to take part in a protest march. My country is very ill ... we want to bring forward elections and close Congress, which does not represent us," Sanchez, 57, told AFP.

"Spinning together a counternarrative for tens of millions of viewers, Russian propagandists plucked clips from American cable news, right-wing social media and Chinese officials.

Now Eleusis -- known to Greeks as Elefsina -- aims to resurrect its flagging fortunes by becoming European capital of culture next year.
Roman emperors including Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus -- of "Gladiator" fame -- were among the glitterati of antiquity who came to be initiated into its secret death-defying cult based around Persephone, the queen of the netherworld.
But Eleusis long ago lost its glamour.
Its grim factories, steelmills, refineries and ship and breaker yards drew thousands fleeing the poverty of rural Greece over the last century.

Up to 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are holding a one-day stoppage from 0800 to 2000 GMT after rejecting a government pay offer.
Ameera, a senior nurse in London, told AFP that "we have not chosen industrial action lightly". The strike is the first in the Royal College of Nursing union's 106-year history.
"We're tired. We're fed up," added the nurse, who asked that her last name not be reported. "We need a pay rise now to make a living."
The UK is currently grappling with a cost-of-living crisis as spiraling inflation outstrips wage growth.

Harry, 38, and his wife Meghan, 41, have lifted the lid on their experiences in the institution in the new series, risking a further rift with his family.
As young boys, the brothers provided the enduring image from their mother Princess Diana's funeral, walking behind her coffin.
But they are reportedly now no longer on speaking terms since Harry and Meghan -- also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- left for North America, settling in California.
In the final three episodes of "Harry & Meghan", Harry recalled a family summit in January 2020 over their plans to move abroad.

(Reuters) -Tesla boss Elon Musk disclosed another $3.6 billion in stock sales on Wednesday, taking his total near $40 billion this year and frustrating investors as the company's shares wallow at two-year lows.
A U.S securities filing showed he unloaded 22 million shares in the world's most valuable carmaker over three days from Monday to Wednesday.
The sale is the second big chunk of stock he has cashed out since his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October. It isn't clear if the sales are related to the Twitter acquisition, but they are annoying investors who are upset by a perception he is diverting his focus and resources to Twitter ahead of Tesla.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the FBI arrested Alexey Brayman, a resident of Merrimack, New Hampshire who was using his Etsy craft store as a front to run a weapons-smuggling ring to the Kremlin.
Speaking to CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) emphasized that this operation is a sign of how dire a toll the global sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine is taking on their ability to procure weapons for their military.
"So, congressman, I do want to ask you about ... this Russian smuggling, Russian weapons smuggling ring here in the United States," said Burnett. "What does this tell you about Putin? I mean, why he would even be doing this, that he's going to such lengths to do something like this?"
"First, I would say that this is not unusual," said Himes. "For decades — for generations — we've been facing Chinese, Russian, other efforts to get our equipment. Your correspondent is exactly right that this is a sign of desperation, this is stuff that could ordinarily be bought on the open market by the Russian government. But it cannot be bought by the Russian government now that, of course, sanctions and prohibitions are in place."

Additionally, said Himes, "the FBI is exactly right. Obviously a guy with a trunk full of rounds, that's a guy who can assist in the creation of an awful lot of mayhem."
"But at the end of the day, there is no way in the world that you can restock, rearm, and refurbish the Russian military by guys driving cars across the border of Estonia," added Himes. "So, we need to continue to take this stuff really, really seriously. But it is a sign of desperation."

Ahmad Abouammo had been found guilty by a jury in August following a trial in federal court in San Francisco.

Testimony from the nine migrants suggests there were multiple kidnappings across several days in the northern state of Durango, with people taken to at least two main locations and held against their will while ransoms were demanded.
The kidnappings are a stark reminder of the dangers faced by migrants as they travel across Mexico, crisscrossing areas rife with drug violence and weak rule of law.

US officials said Monday there was "unanimous interest" among delegates to an IOC summit to come up with a pathway that would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to competition.
Russia and Belarus have been isolated from international sport ever since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.
However, Zelensky blasted the American moves, claiming that "since February, 184 Ukrainian athletes have died as a result of Russia's actions".
Zelensky told Bach he was disappointed with the presence of the president of the Russian Olympic Committee at the IOC summit on November 9
"One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored," he said in a statement.
Zelensky added that the only response is "the complete isolation of the terrorist state on the international stage. In particular, this applies to international sports events."
At this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country's Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.
However many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United Nations on Wednesday voted to remove Iran from a women's rights body over Tehran's brutal crackdown of women-led protests.
Following a campaign led by the United States, 29 members of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) voted to expel the Islamic republic from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW) for the remainder of its 2022-2026 term.
Eight countries voted against and 16 abstained. A simple majority was needed to adopt the move, which had been proposed by the United States.
The resolution says it strips Iran of its membership of the commission with immediate effect.
The text says the Iranian leadership "continuously undermine and increasingly suppress the human rights of women and girls, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine has announced that another American has been freed as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that a retired U.S. Air Force veteran Suedi Murekezi was captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine earlier this year, his family said. He has now been freed. 
"Another exchange of prisoners," tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. "We continue to return ours. 64 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, are going home. It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people - Murekez Suedi. The bodies of the 4 dead were also returned."
His brother said that Murekezi said in a call that he was being held in the Donetsk People’s Republic with two other American nationals. 
The Post report explained that a prisoner swap in September included two U.S. veterans. The latest swap adds up to 1,456 prisoners that have been released by Russia since the start of their invasion. 
"One prisoner of war told The Post he was beaten so badly that his ribs were broken and his kidneys were badly injured," the piece said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgraced crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried is being held in a jail in the Bahamas that's known for its poor conditions -- so poor that a warden described it as “not fit for humanity," the New York Post reports. 
Bankman-Fried is being held in Fox Hill Prison after failing to get bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. The prison is the only correctional facility in the region. As the Post points out, the prison was the focus of a report last year by the US Department of State which looked into possible human rights violations, including violence and abuse by staff.
“Inmates removed human waste by bucket,” the government report noted. 
“Some inmates developed bedsores from lying on bare ground,” the report said, adding that conditions included “overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care.”
“Sanitation was a general problem, and cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” the report noted. 
Bankman-Fried faces criminal charges in the United States, including securities fraud, campaign finance violations and money laundering, over the collapse of his FTX crypto exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A judge in Peru on Wednesday postponed by 24 hours a hearing to decide whether ex-president Pedro Castillo will be released from detention on charges of rebellion and conspiracy.
Castillo's arrest last week after he tried to dissolve parliament and rule by decree has sparked days of nationwide protests in which seven people have been killed.
Last week, a judge ordered Castillo to be held for seven days, and he was meant to be released on Wednesday.
However, prosecutors filed a request late Tuesday to hold him in pre-trial detention for 18 months.
Judge Juan Checkley on Wednesday postponed a hearing on the new request until Thursday after defense attorneys argued they had not received all documents from the public prosecutor.
He also ordered Castillo to remain in detention for another 48 hours.
Castillo, a leftist former school teacher, was in power for only 17 months in the South American nation that is prone to political instability and is now on its sixth president in six years.
His short period in office was marked by a power struggle with the opposition-dominated Congress, and six investigations into him and his family, mainly for corruption.
He was facing his third impeachment bid when, last Wednesday, he announced he was dissolving Congress and would rule by decree.
But lawmakers went ahead and voted to sack him and he was quickly arrested while trying to flee to the Mexican embassy and seek asylum.
Castillo's vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in as his successor, but has failed to calm tensions that have led to violent clashes between police and protestors in several parts of the country.

The Paris offices of US consulting giant McKinsey were also searched on Tuesday, the National Financial Prosecutors' Office said, confirming a report in Le Parisien newspaper.
The use of consultants by Macron's governments came under the spotlight in March after a French Senate inquiry concluded that public spending on them had more than doubled from 2018 to 2021, during Macron's first term.
"It's normal for the judiciary to investigate freely and independently to shed all the light on this subject," a Renaissance spokesman, Loic Signor, told AFP.

Former soccer player-turned-commentator Gary Lineker has been covering the World Cup in Qatar and spoke to the  “News Agents” podcast and discussed why Qatar was allowed to host the World Cup. 
“We pointed facts out at the beginning of the tournament; those facts remain. So, lots of people were killed doing the stadiums. Yes, the stadiums are extraordinary, but at a great price. Homophobia is an issue here, women’s rights are a little bit of an issue here," he said. 
“For me, it was always really more about the corruption side of it because, as I said previously, I think pretty much every country, including our own, has got issues,” he continued. “And we’re off to America in four years’ time, with Canada and Mexico, but obviously America’s an extraordinarily racist country.”

But campaigners warn that more executions will inevitably follow without tougher international action, with a dozen more people already sentenced to death over the protests and a similar number charged with crimes that could see them hanged.
"Unless the political cost of the executions is increased significantly, we will be facing mass executions," said Mahmood Amiry…]]></summary>

The ruling is a rare rebuke of authorities in a city where the public commemoration of Beijing's deadly 1989 crackdown has been virtually wiped out in recent years.
Chow, a 37-year-old lawyer and one of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy activists, led a now-disbanded group that used to organize the city's annual candlelight vigils to mourn those killed in Tiananmen Square when China sent troops to crush democracy protests.
Police have banned the last three vigils citing the coronavirus and security fears and the courts have already jailed multiple activists who defied those bans, including Chow.
