Government officials are set to hold a meeting in hopes of figuring out a solution for both sides to secure the border.

Reportedly, August recorded more than 232,00 migrant encounters – the highest ever on record, bringing the annual total to just over 2.2 million.

Border cities, such as Eagle Pass and El Paso have been completely overwhelmed.

Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales said, “things continue to get worse locally and by the way, these people aren’t staying in Texas, they’re going to all parts of the country”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuba's embassy in Washington was attacked by a man using two Molotov cocktails on Sunday night, the country's foreign minister said, describing the incident as a "terrorist attack".
"The Cuban embassy in the US was the target of a terrorist attack by an individual who launched 2 Molotov cocktails. The staff suffered no harm," said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.
This was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. 
The Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.
In New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel's presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.
"The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about," said Rodriguez after Sunday's attack.
In April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d'affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his "energetic protest" over what he called a "terrorist aggression" against his embassy.
That shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. 
US authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.
Alazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including "violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon", according to the US Justice Department.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Pablo Picasso masterpiece expected to fetch at least $120 million at auction went on show Monday in Dubai, kicking off a set of rare viewings outside the United States.
The 1932 portrait of Marie-Therese Walter, Picasso's mistress and "golden muse", is being exhibited for two days before heading to Hong Kong and London, a boon for the United Arab Emirates' bid to establish itself as a cultural powerhouse.
The viewing "marks the first time a painting of this calibre by the world-renowned artist has ever been exhibited in the UAE", Sotheby's Dubai said in a statement, noting it is the first time the portrait had been shown outside the US in half a century.
"Over the years the UAE has earned the status of being a global art destination, which receives a further boost as this rare Picasso is unveiled here," said UAE Culture Minister Sheikh Salem bin Khalid al-Qassimi.
The painting titled "Femme a la montre" will be sold in November as part of a two-day auction of late New Yorker Emily Fisher Landau's prestigious collection.
Walter met Picasso in Paris in 1927, when the Spaniard was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova, and while Walter was 17.
Walter, whose daughter with Picasso passed away last year, was also featured in "Femme assise pres d'une fenetre (Marie-Therese)", which sold in 2021 for $103.4 million by Christie's auction house.
Fifty years after his death in 1973 at age 91, Picasso remains one of the most influential artists of the modern world, often hailed as a dynamic and creative genius.
But in the wake of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault, the reputation of this workaholic with a vast output of paintings, sketches and sculpture has been tarnished by accusations he exerted a violent hold over the women who shared his life and inspired his art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A British nurse jailed for life for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six others will face a retrial on an outstanding charge of attempted murder, prosecutors said on Monday.
Lucy Letby, 33, was convicted last month of killing five baby boys and two baby girls, making her Britain's most prolific child serial killer in modern times.
But the jury in the months-long trial at Manchester Crown Court were unable to reach decisions on six counts of attempted murder relating to five babies.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which brings prosecutions in England and Wales, said it will seek a retrial on a charge that Letby attempted to murder a baby girl in February 2016.
A provisional trial date has been fixed for June 10 next year, also at Manchester Crown Court in northwest England.
Jonathan Storer, chief crown prosecutor with the CPS, said the decisions on whether to seek retrials were "extremely complex and difficult".
"Before reaching our conclusions, we listened carefully to the views of the families affected, police and prosecution counsel," he said.
"Many competing factors were considered, including the evidence heard by the court during the long trial and its impact on our legal test for proceeding with a prosecution," he added.
Letby was arrested following a string of deaths at the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England between June 2015 and June 2016.
She consistently denied all the charges against her.
Letby attended Monday's hearing via videolink from a conference room at a prison near Wakefield, northern England.
Sitting behind a desk, she only spoke to confirm her name and that she could see and hear the proceedings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While a handful of plus-size models such as Paloma Elsesser have grabbed media attention in recent years, the figures shows they remain a vanishingly small minority.
Vogue Business looked at 9,137 outfits unveiled during 219 shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris last season and found that 0.6 percent were plus-size -- defined as US size 14 or above, which is actually the average size for a woman in the United States -- and only 3.8 percent were size 6-12.
This means 95.6 percent of outfits presented were in US size 0-4.
Paolo Volonte, who teaches sociology of fashion in Milan, says brands use a few curvy models to deflect criticism.
"It's 'fat-washing'," he told AFP, comparing it to criticisms of cynical "green-washing" by which the industry is accused of making empty climate pledges.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France's conservative Les Républicains party was on course to extend its historic domination of the upper house of parliament following Senate elections on Sunday that marked another electoral setback for the ruling party of President Emmanuel Macron.
Unlike the lower house National Assembly, the Senate is not elected by direct universal suffrage but by around 150,000 voters known as "grands electeurs" who include elected regional and national officials.
As such, this electoral college represents a reflection of the results of local elections where Macron's Renaissance party – only founded for his 2017 presidential campaign and lacking grass roots – has consistently performed badly.
Only half the Senate is elected at any one time and on Sunday 170 of the 348 seats were up for grabs for a s…]]></summary>

Messina Denaro was one of the most ruthless bosses in Cosa Nostra, the real-life Sicilian crime syndicate depicted in the Godfather movies.
He was convicted by the courts of involvement in the murder of anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone in 1992 and in deadly bombings in Rome, Florence and Milan in 1993.
One of his six life sentences was also handed down for the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the 12-year-old son of a witness in the Falcone case.
Messina Denaro disappeared in the summer of 1993, and spent the next 30 years on the run as the Italian state cracked down on the Sicilian mob.

Alegado, thought to be the youngest athlete at the Games in Hangzhou and representing the Philippines, qualified for the "women's" park final and came seventh out of eight.
Japan's Hinano Kusaki, a comparative veteran at 15, won gold.
Alegado, who turned nine in March and reportedly comes from California, said she got into skateboarding when she saw her brother doing it while they were at a cousin's house.
"And I was like, 'Can I try? Can I try?'" she said. "And I got on the board and just loved it."
Talking on her feelings about taking part in a major international competition, Alegado said: "I was so excited because I was about to skate the Asian Games -- and I just did, so it was so fun!"
Asked if her brother still skates, she replied: "No because he was like, 'Oh dang, she's better than me now', so he stopped."
In the final, Alegado avoided the wooden spoon, which instead went to Taiwanese 11-year-old Lin Yi-fan.]]></summary>

So he made the difficult decision to emigrate to the United States -- a grueling odyssey that ended up taking two months and covering some 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) marked both by calamity and kindness.
"It seemed endless, very exhausting," he told AFP, choking with emotion, after finally crossing from Mexico to the Texas border town of Eagle Pass, where he first set foot on American soil.

The president's job approval rating is 19 points underwater. 
President Joe Biden's job approval rating is 19 points underwater, his ratings for handling the economy and immigration are at career lows. A record number of Americans say they've become worse off under his presidency, three-quarters say he's too old for another term and Donald Trump is looking better in retrospect -- all severe challenges for Biden in his reelection campaign ahead. 
Forty-four percent of Americans in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll say they've gotten worse off financially under Biden's presidency, the most for any president in ABC/Post polls since 1986. Just 37% approve of his job performance, while 56% disapprove. Still fewer approve of Biden's performance on the economy, 30%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has admitted she had hoped to do "better" on controlling irregular migration, which has surged since her far-right party won historic elections a year ago.
"Clearly we hoped for better on immigration, where we worked so hard," she said in an interview marking the win, broadcast late Saturday on the TG1 channel.
"The results are not what we hoped to see. It is certainly a very complex problem, but I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of it."
Meloni's post-fascist Brothers of Italy party was elected largely on a promise to reduce mass migration into Italy.
But the number of people arriving on boats from North Africa has instead surged, with more than 130,000 recorded by the interior ministry so far this year -- up from 70,000 in the same period of 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joerg Prophet flashed a brilliant white grin as he greeted voters at his campaign stand in Nordhausen, a small but prosperous city in the former East German state of Thuringia.
The mayoral candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has plenty to smile about. He is the clear favorite to win Sunday's run-off vote to lead the city of 40,000 people.
A win for the 61-year-old former entrepreneur would be a "catastrophe", said the keepers of a nearby concentration camp memorial.
Around 60,000 prisoners were held in the Mittelbau-Dora slave labour camp -- a subcamp of the notorious Buchenwald -- only six kilometres (3.7 miles) from central Nordhausen.
They were forced to make V-2 rockets in brutal underground conditions, with around one in three worked to death.
An AfD mayor would …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Olympic Council of Asia chief Raja Randhir Singh on Sunday defended the organisation's decision to allow North Korea to fly its flag at the Asian Games despite being banned from doing so over doping violations.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) declared the country's national anti-doping body "non-compliant" in 2021 and slapped it with sanctions.
They included not being able to fly the North Korean flag at any regional, continental or world sports event, excluding the Olympics and Paralympics.
Despite this the North Korean flag was carried by its athletes delegation into the Hangzhou Olympic stadium on Saturday for the Asian Games opening ceremony.
"We are in discussions with them (WADA) and North Korea has written to them as well explaining their position," said Singh, the OCA acting president.
"We are explaining from our side as well.
"At present, the North Korean flag is flying and we will look into it and see what the future says."
Singh added that "everyone should participate and have the opportunity to participate and if there are certain issues which happened through the pandemic, we should consider that and take it into account".
WADA sanctioned North Korea while its already tight borders were shut following the outbreak of Covid, which saw the Asian nation skip the Olympics in Japan.
It was then banned by the International Olympic Committee from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics for failing to take part in Tokyo.
But North Korea recently began slowly reopening and has sent a nearly 200-strong team to Hangzhou, ending its years-long isolation from the global sporting arena.]]></summary>

"You can call it anything you want, but they are fighting with us, they are straight-up fighting with us. We call it a hybrid war, but that doesn't change things," Lavrov told a news conference at the United Nations.
US President Joe Biden has repeatedly said he is seeking to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia, a fellow nuclear power, and will not send American troops. His administration has also distanced itself from Ukrainian attacks into Russia itself.
But Lavrov pointed to the billions of dollars in Western military equipment provided to Kyiv since Russia attacked last year, as well as US and British intelligence support an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tensions between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hezbollah are at their highest level in years.

Israel and Lebanon don’t have an agreed border but the United Nations patrols the boundary between the countries, known as the Blue Line.

Israel is currently divided by government plans to overhaul its judicial system and one theory is Hezbollah sees this as an opportunity to test Israel.

Lebanon has also accused Israel of regularly flying through its airspace without permission to bomb Iranian targets in neighbouring Syria.]]></summary>

There was "shared intelligence among Five Eyes partners" that informed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's public allegation of a potential link between the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen, United States Ambassador to Canada David Cohen confirmed to CTV News. 
 In an exclusive interview on CTV's Question Period with Vassy Kapelos airing on Sunday, Cohen confirmed "there was shared intelligence among Five Eyes partners that helped lead Canada to making the statements that the Prime Minister made." 
On Monday, Trudeau informed the House of Commons in a rare statement on a matter of national security that Canadian intelligence agencies were investigating "credible allegations" that agents of the Indian government were involved in the June death of prominent Canadian Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in B.C.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
