Michael Rubin, AEI/19fortyfive.com: Can Biden Deter a Russia Nuclear Attack on Ukraine? Yes, if He Gives Ukraine Tactical Nukes

WNU Editor: Michael Rubin is insane. Giving U.S. nuclear weapons to a regime that Moscow regards is run by Neo-Nazis will result in World War 3.

VOA/Reuters: Russian Attack Cannot Be Ruled Out, Says Swedish Parliamentary Report – SVT 
Stockholm — A Swedish parliament defense committee report said a Russian military attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out, Swedish public service broadcaster SVT said on Sunday, citing sources. 
Sweden has been scrambling to bolster its defenses and applied to join NATO last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sweden was invited to apply but Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify the application. 
The parliamentary report, due to be published on Monday, said that although Russian ground forces were tied up in Ukraine, other types of military attacks against Sweden could not be ruled out, SVT said, citing sources who worked on the report.

The Cradle: Taliban, China discuss banking cooperation

 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021 
The Taliban’s governor of the Afghan central bank Hidayatullah Badri met with Chinese envoy Wang Yu this week to discuss banking ties and business, the bank’s spokesperson informed Reuters on 16 June. 
“In this meeting, economy, banking relations, business and some related topics were discussed,” said Badri. 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held "candid" talks with his Chinese counterpart at the start of two days of meetings with officials in China, the US state department says.

His trip is the first by a top US diplomat to China in almost five years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Post: Afghanistan declares Aug 31 as national holiday to commemorate US troop withdrawal 
Afghanistan has announced that the country will observe August 31, the day US soldier departed from the country as a National Holiday. 
As stated on the Taliban government’s website, the withdrawal of foreign troops will be celebrated annually on August 31. 
The inaugural festivities were organized last year, with the authorities and supporters of the Taliban marking the first anniversary of the withdrawal. Taliban fighters held a rally on Massoud Square in Kabul, located outside the former US embassy.
On August 31, 2021, just before the withdrawal deadline expired, the final American soldier, US Army Major General Chris Donahue, boarded a military transport plane. This marked the conclusion of a challenging 20-year military campaign that incurred significant costs and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives.

RT: IEA warns of possible oil shortage

 
Global demand will rise by 6% between 2022 and 2028, according to the energy watchdog  
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has raised its outlook for world oil demand to a record high of 102.3 million barrels a day this year, saying it will be powered by faster-growing economies in the developing world. 
In its latest medium-term market report released this week, the IEA projects global oil demand to grow 6% between 2022 and 2028 to reach 105.7 million barrels per day (bpd), up 5.9 million bpd compared to 2022 levels. 
That growth will be supported by strong demand from the petrochemical and aviation sectors, it said.

The Intercept:  Pentagon’s Secret Service Trawls Social Media for Mean Tweets About Generals

 
A document shows the Protective Services Battalion uses sophisticated surveillance tools that can pinpoint anyone’s location.  
When the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley enters into his scheduled retirement later this year, one of the perks will include a personal security detail to protect him from threats — including “embarrassment.” 
The U.S. Army Protective Services Battalion, the Pentagon’s little-known Secret Service equivalent, is tasked with safeguarding top military brass. The unit protects current as well as former high-ranking military officers from “assassination, kidnapping, injury or embarrassment,” according to Army records. 
Protective Services’s mandate has expanded to include monitoring social media for “direct, indirect, and veiled” threats and identifying “negative sentiment” regarding its wards, according to an Army procurement document dated September 1, 2022, and reviewed by The Intercept. The expansion of the Protective Services Battalion’s purview has not been previously reported.

The Telegraph: Prepare for Ukraine's counter-offensive to falter 
Nato needs to brace itself for the prospect of Ukraine’s counteroffensive failing to achieve major success. Indeed, so far, Kyiv has attained only limited gains. But those who expected a lightning breakthrough were always going to be disappointed. This is not German panzers against Polish horse cavalry, nor is it American shock and awe against demoralised Iraqi forces in antiquated tanks with no air cover. 
Instead, we are seeing something closer to an attritional style of warfare, with attacking forces battering against heavily fortified defences. Current operations are at the stage of reconnaissance-in-force along four separate axes of advance, with Ukrainian units probing Russian positions to identify weak spots that can then be softened up with artillery and exploited by armoured reserve forces. Commandos and partisans are said to be working behind enemy lines to create confusion and disrupt command and control centres. Long range strikes are being used to hit headquarters.

Live Mint/Wall Street Journal: Kyiv Runs Into Russian Air Superiority

Now into its second week, Ukraine’s ambitious attempt to take back Russian-occupied land is proving to be a hard slog against dense minefields and well-prepared defenses. 
After Ukraine’s first probing attacks yielded mixed results, its forces have mostly paused their advances in recent days as commanders take stock of the past two weeks and analyze ways to punch through Russian lines without taking huge losses.

WNU Editor: According to the sources that I trust there was heavy fighting along the entire front today. Apparently the Ukraine Army made the decision to throw everything into the assault, and while some gains were made, the consensus that I am reading is that the casualties that Ukraine experienced today makes it the bloodiest day for the Ukraine military since the start of the war. 
Apparently what worked against the Ukraine army in today's assault was that the skies were clear, perfect conditions for Russian drones and attack helicopters to go into action. 
I hope all of these reports are false. And this is nothing but "fog of war". But if this disaster did happen today, expect a lot of videos being posted by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the next day or two.]]></summary>

BEIJING — Antony Blinken became the first secretary of state to visit China in five years on Sunday as he arrived in the country for two days of high-stakes meetings aimed at stabilizing a relationship under historic stress. 
His hosts previewed the tense visit with multiple rebukes of the United States, accusing Washington of engaging in “irresponsible bullying” and living under the “illusion” it could deal with China from a “position of strength.” 
China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Blinken that he should “show respect” during a pre-trip phone call, and made clear his view that Washington alone was responsible for the abysmal state of relations.

Kampala, Uganda CNN  — Armed rebels attacked a school in western Uganda, killing at least 41 people, mostly students, and abducting six others, Ugandan officials have said. 
Some were hacked to death with machetes while others died when their dormitories were set on fire, military spokesman Felix Kulayigye told CNN. 
About 20 members of the ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group attacked the Lhubirira secondary school late on Friday, according to Uganda’s military. 
The school is situated along Uganda’s border with Congo in the town of Kasese, and educates children between the ages of 13 and 18. Of the dead, 39 were students and two were from the local community, local officials said.

A high-ranking Space Force officer has spoken out slamming a slew of recent anti-LGBTQ state laws, saying they have a negative impact on military families and force readiness. 
Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt made the remarks in a fiery speech at the 12th Annual DoD LGBTQ+ Pride Event in Washington DC, saying that the laws sometimes forced her to choose 'less qualified' candidates for postings in those states. 
'Since January of this year, more than 400 anti-LGBTQ+ laws have been introduced at the state level,' said Burt, the Space Force's deputy chief of space operations.

Kyiv Independent: FT: US senators to propose bill to seize and transfer Russian assets to Ukraine 
U.S. senators with bipartisan backing are reportedly planning to propose a bill that would allow President Joe Biden to seize and transfer Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on June 15. 
Western countries have frozen around $300 billion of Russia's Central Bank assets since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The bill's proponents argue that since Russia bears the blame for the destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, it should also bear the financial costs of reparations. 
They also likely aim to alleviate the burden of Ukraine's support from U.S. taxpayers and allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants NATO member nations to commit to accepting Ukraine into the alliance when there is a resolution to the current conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: African leaders arrive for Ukraine talks with Russia's Putin 
(Reuters) - African leaders hoping to mediate in the Ukraine conflict were welcomed to a government palace near St Petersburg on Saturday by Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said after meeting the leaders in Kyiv on Friday that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdrew its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. 
He added that he could not understand what could be gained from the delegation meeting Putin.
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Kyiv that the leaders had come "to share the African perspective" and saw talks with Russia as part of the mission. 
The leaders from Senegal, Egypt, Zambia, Uganda, Congo Republic and the Comoro islands as well as South Africa were meeting Putin at the government's 18th-century Konstantinovsky Palace, on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.

WNU Editor: Sorry that the audio is out of sync in the above video, but it gives a good summary on what transpired. 
I have visited the Konstantinovsky Palace where these talks are being held. It is an incredibly beautiful place. Check out this aerial picture of the palace and the properties around it (link here). 
Update: When these African leaders met Ukraine President Zelensky the meeting was short, formal, and businesslike (link here). Check out the difference in body language when these same leaders met President Putin the next day (see tweet below).

In Finland's eastern Karelia region, home to boreal forests and wetlands, climate change is pushing local farmers into conflict with wildlife.

He and his three siblings walk at least a mile (1.6 kilometres) and wait, sometimes for hours, hoping to fill their jerry cans and make it back in time for school.
"My arms and my back hurt from the load I carry every day," Mohammad told AFP from the family's makeshift apartment, a former grocery store, in the city of Taez.
"We wake up in the early morning and leave home with our father, sometimes even at night, to collect water," he said.

Daily Mail: Vladimir Putin tells West to 'go to hell'as despot confirms that nuclear weapons have been moved to Belarus as a precaution for 'anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat' on Russia 
* Lukashenko said Belarus has started receiving Russian tactical nuclear weapons 
* It is Moscow's first move of such bombs outside Russia since fall of Soviet Union 
President Putin told the West to 'go to hell' on nuclear arms reduction as he confirmed he has moved nuclear weapons into Belarus, claiming it is a precautionary measure for 'anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat' on Russia. 
 Speaking at Russia's flagship economic forum in St Petersburg, Putin told those gathered that the first warheads had arrived in the country, but that this was only 'the first part' of the planned delivery. 
 He added: 'Just talking about this (the potential use of nuclear weapons) lowers the nuclear threshold. We have more than NATO countries and they want to reduce our numbers. Go to hell.'

WNU Editor: The Western press is saying Putin said 'go to hell'. Not really. I saw the video on what he said. He said the equivalent of 'f*** NATO' in Russian. This is the first time I have ever seen or heard Putin swear like this.

 Poland says racism was not a factor in its decision to refuse entry to South African presidential guards and media for more than 24 hours. 
The stand-off happened at Warsaw's Chopin airport. The aircraft will now be held there until Sunday, an airport spokesman told the BBC. 
About 120 people were stuck on the plane, who were all on their way to a peace summit in Ukraine. 
Some of the passengers are now disembarking and going to a hotel. 
Poland's actions have left President Cyril Ramaphosa, who travelled separately to Ukraine, without some of his security detail. 
This prompted a furious reaction from Mr Ramaphosa's head of security, Maj Gen Wally Rhoode.

Warzone/The Drive: Israel’s Merkava Tank Has Possible Export Customer In Europe

 
Israel is negotiating sales of Merkavas with two countries, including one in Europe, prompting speculation about a possible deal for Ukraine.  
The Israeli government says that it is in very active talks with two countries about what could be the first confirmed international sales of variants of the country's unique Merkava main battle tank. The identities of those nations have not been disclosed, but one of them is in Europe, which has already led to speculation that Merkavas may eventually be bound for Ukraine. 
Yair Kulas, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense's International Defense Cooperation Directorate, also known by its Hebrew acronym SIBAT, disclosed the potential foreign Merkava sales in a recent interview with the Calcalist newspaper. SIBAT work includes negotiating the sale of weapon systems and other materiel from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inventory.

Rightwing members of the Swiss parliament boycotted an address by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that called for war materiel export restrictions to be eased. 
Members of the Swiss People’s Party were absent from the parliamentary chamber in protest against perceived interference of Swiss affairs. 
Zelensky has in the past urged Switzerland to beef up sanctions against Russian oligarchs and now wants Swiss-manufactured weapons to be sent to Ukraine.

Update: Ukrainian leader boycotted in Swiss parliament (RT).

 
WNU Editor: President Zelensky wants more money and weapons from Switzerland .... Zelensky asks for arms in address to Swiss parliament (Kyiv Independent).
The Swiss People's Party is the political party that boycotted President Zelensly's speech. They make up 25% of the parliament. 
On a side note. The Swiss go to the polls later this year. Ukraine will be one of the election issues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Kissinger Sees War Over Taiwan Likely Unless US, China Back Down 
 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he believes military conflict between China and Taiwan is likely if tensions continue on their current course, though he still holds out for dialogue that will lead to deescalation — as he’s been urging. 
“On the current trajectory of relations, I think some military conflict is probable,” Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, when asked about the possibility that China would invade Taiwan. “But I also think the current trajectory of relations must be altered.” 
The remarks, delivered as Kissinger looked back on his life and career soon after his 100th birthday, were some of his most downbeat about the state of relations between China and the US, which has vowed to back Taiwan in the event China attacks. Kissinger said it was up to both Washington and Beijing to step back from their standoff, which he said was at “the top of a precipice.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have agreed that the Russian leader will visit Turkey "soon", Interfax cited a Kremlin aide as saying on Friday. 
The visit would be Putin's first to a NATO country since he ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has only rarely traveled outside Russia since the beginning of full-scale hostilities. 
 "There is an invitation from the president of Turkey. Putin and Erdogan agreed that the visit will be in the near future, but we have not yet talked about a specific day, specific dates," Interfax cited Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov as saying.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
