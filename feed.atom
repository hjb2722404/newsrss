        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treasurer Jim Chalmers is returning from the United States from an “eventful pre-budget trip,” Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says. 

“He was in one of the last meetings Kwasi Kwarteng had as UK Chancellor of the Exchequer before Kwarteng was sacked by Prime Minister Liz Truss in Britain,” Mr Clennell said. 

“Kwarteng appeared agitated and distracted during the meetings apparently - and some of the speeches at the G20 finance ministers forum must have been uncomfortable for him - given they all stressed having your budget in line with central bank policy, and the UK Chancellor, then UK Chancellor, had gone for some big unscheduled tax cuts.

“Our Treasurer met with the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell just hours after a surprise high annual inflation figure of 8.2 per cent was recorded in the US.”]]></summary>

West, or Ye as he prefers to be called now, sat down with Carlson after making headlines at a fashion show in Paris where he proudly wore a “White Lives Matter” shirt.  The ensuing outrage aligned nicely with Carlson’s quest to prove that white people are under attack, so Carlson invited West on his show to continue that mission.

In August, to my good surprise, President Joe Biden announcement    forgiveness of up to $20,000 in student loan debt for certain borrowers ― fulfilling a campaign promise that people like me noticed did not look like a priority    of his administration.

“People can finally start to get out of this mountain of debt to pay rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a house, starting a family or starting a business,” Biden said    at the White House in remarks detailing the plan.  “And by the way, when that happens, the whole economy gets better.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For high school teacher and mother Jennifer Shaffer, time and sleep are two precious assets.  So with the end of DST    approaching, the busy mother says she fears changing the clock. 
“It’s definitely going to mess us up and mess us up over the next few days, even a week,” Shaffer told CBS News. 
She is not alone.  according to one vote conducted by Monmouth University, six out of 10 Americans said they would rather make daylight saving time permanent — abandoning the practice of changing the clock twice a year created during World War I to save energy.

Turning our clocks back and forth may soon be a thing of the past – if a few lawmakers get their way.
This year, Congress brought the issue into the spotlight when the House energy committee heard testimony at a formal hearing about how changing the clock is linked to increased risk of depression, stroke and sleep disorders.  According to National Children’s Hospital sleep specialist Dr.  Tyish Hall Brown, changing watches can have an impact on the body.
“We have a kind of internal rhythm to our bodies and our health,” Brown said.  “And every time we move forward or backward, that too has to adjust.”
In March, the US Senate unanimously legislation passed    without warning to make DST permanent starting in 2023, if the US House and President agree.
Michigan Congressman Fred Upton said the effort will likely fall short in the House, in part because some people in the western section of the time zones say they are concerned that permanent daylight saving time could make mornings too dark and late. 
“Not only would [school buses] running in the dark, the kids would probably be in the second or third hour while it was still dark,” he said. 
Nearly 15 years ago, Upton championed an energy-saving law that extended DST    even later in November. 
“Particularly with global warming, climate change is real,” he said.  “Why not take advantage of this extra hour of sunlight?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a time when Republicans across the country are trying to downplay or flee Trump, Eric Trump went on TV to announce that the Republican Party is now Trump’s party.
video:

Eric Trump on Newsmax:
When we’re on that stage, we know you’re going to find out who your true friends are. My father was the first thing he said to our family, you know? I love fighting for this country. We use a surprising number of arrows, but we love red, white and blue. Well, I sure hope my dad does it again. 
I think he is the best president this country has ever had. He is willing to fight. No other Republican is willing to fight and I think he fundamentally changed the party. Republicans are no longer Republicans. This is the Trump Party.
Republicans are in a tight House race across the country. Swing district candidates are trying to pretend Donald Trump doesn’t exist, and here’s Eric Trump reminding America that voting for any Republican on the 2022 ballot is as good as voting for Donald Trump.
Republicans likely won’t win control of the Senate, as Trump’s Senate roster is a massive failure.
The GOP needs Donald Trump to leave on Election Day. His presence in the midterms hurt Republican voters. Instead, Eric Trump is touching his father’s ego and reminding every voter in America that the Republican Party that was once the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan now belongs to Donald Trump.

The study said federal generosity was insufficient, failed to target schools most in need, and was not associated with policy outcomes.
Analysts at the American Educational Research Association said schools may need $700 billion to address learning losses, mainly from remote instruction, but received about $189 billion in emergency relief funds for elementary and secondary schools in 2020 and 2021.
The funds, including the roughly $120 billion invested last year in President Biden’s massive pandemic relief bill, are aimed at measures such as increasing tutoring, offering extracurricular activities and buy…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A penthouse in Florida Rob Gronkowski praised during his time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he netted $5.4 million, The Post has learned. 
The former NFL party block sets a record as the building’s all-time most expensive listing, known as the Towers of Channelside in Tampa. 
Comprised of four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms, the luxury residence boasts 180-degree views of the bay and the Tampa skyline — stretching all the way to downtown St. Pete, according to the listing. 
Built in 2011, this is the first time this unit has come to market since it was built. 
Features include a private lobby and elevator entrance, plus your own private pool cabana. 
The unit features 10-foot floor-to-ceiling windows, a gourmet kitchen, and a 1,100-square-foot wraparound deck. 
The property includes a 24-hour concierge, clubhouse, and resort-style pool with heated spa and rock waterfall. 
The unit is in the luxurious Towers of Channelside building.

“An opulent oasis, each element has been designed to enhance its breathtaking views and provide functionality for every lifestyle.”  Listing agent Nick Janovsky, of Premier Sotheby’s International Realty, told the Post.  “It also presents a rare opportunity to own a penthouse in Tampa’s original luxury skyscraper.”
In the three years Gronk lived in the luxury unit, the team won the Super Bowl and qualified for the playoffs. 
Meanwhile, he still owns a five-bedroom, six-bathroom unit in Miami that spans over 3,770 square feet. He bought the 39th floor residence in 2019 for $1.7 million. 
Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time, Gronk, 33, announced his retirement for the second time on June 21, 2022.

— Pat Dennis (@patdennis) October 14, 2022

Walker said: “I believe in reducing insulin, but at the same time, you have to eat well because he may not know and I know a lot of people who are using insulin and unless you are eating well, insulin is not good for you. So you have to reduce food price.”
This is not how insulin works. People with diabetes cannot make their diabetes go away just by eating right.
Herschel Walker is a disaster in this debate. He’s not a good debater, but Walker has the standard Fox News talking points on these issues.  Herschel Walker thinks he won the debate by interrupting and yelling.
Walker’s actions came straight out of Donald Trump’s playbook in 2016.
Herschel Walker may be the country’s most extreme Senate candidate this year, and blaming insulin prices on diabetics is a new low.

The building of this now lost conclusion began with Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, trying to convince persistent skeptics of their work.  Thompson assured critics on Thursday that the committee’s findings were not part of a broad liberal conspiracy portrayed in conservative media. 

“When you look back at what came out of the work of this committee, the most striking fact is that all of this evidence comes almost entirely from Republicans,” Thompson said. Explain.

His answer is energy independence. Asked if he would cut military spending or social services spending, Walker said he would not cut energy bills.
Warnock was asked if he was responsible for the economic hardship facing Georgians, and Senator Warnock noted that businesses were making record profits and touted the biggest tax cut for working and middle-class families.

Reuters: Turkey backs Putin gas plan as Nord Stream faces long outage 
LONDON (Reuters) - Large sections of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines built to supply gas to Europe might need to be replaced, the head of Gazprom said, while Turkey on Friday backed Russian proposals to build a gas hub there as an alternative supply route. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin this week proposed Turkey as a base for gas supplies after the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged last month by blasts. 
The European Union, which previously turned to Russia for about 40% of its gas needs, is however seeking to wean itself off Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine in February.

Stone video:

Unreleased subpoena footage: Stone, angry at Trump for not granting him a second pardon, calls Ivanka Trump the daughter of an abortion bitch. pic.twitter.com/aAAOZLC5fu
— Christopher Gould Branson (@cguld) October 14, 2022

Stone said in the clip: “Jared Kushner has an IQ of 70. He’s going to come to Miami. We’re going to kick him out of Miami very quickly. He’s going to leave soon, very soon. He’s got a hundred guards. I’m going to have 5,000 security guards. Do you want to fight? Let’s fight. Fuck you. Fuck you, and your aborted bitch daughter.”
The Jan. 6 attacks, Trump’s coup plot, and narcissism fueled the perpetrators’ decision-making process, and a documentary film crew followed them, giving us an insight into how Trump and those around him operate.
Roger Stone was upset that Donald Trump refused to grant him a second pardon, ostensibly to cover up his activities in the 1/6 attack.
Here’s the Stone video from the documentary filmmaker who posted the above footage, released by the committee on Thursday, Jan. 6:

Recently, the select committee obtained footage of Roger Stone before and after the election. pic.twitter.com/6mRdWwMSmE
— January 6 Committee (@January6thCmte) October 13, 2022

Even before yesterday’s hearing, Zachary Petrizzo was the daily beast Stone ‘threatened to file a $25 million lawsuit against Danish filmmakers – Frederick Mabel and Christopher Gould Branson – who took his picture in November, saying’ Fuck the vote and let’s face violence.'”
Stone may return to the prison where he belongs. Trump’s longtime adviser is a go-between for the Trump campaign and Russia, and has performed the same functions for Trump on 1/6 with the militia.
The failed former president was surrounded by criminal associates like Roger Stone who were only interested in himself.

"He should be asked whether he is ready to hold such negotiations with me or not. To be honest, I don’t see any need by and large. There is no platform for any negotiations for the time being," Putin told the media on Friday, when asked about the possibility of a meeting with Biden at the G20 summit in Indonesia.

‘Nothing further is being planned’ after draft of 300,000 is complete, Russian president claims. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed his country’s so-called partial mobilization of reservists to fight in the Ukraine war, announced last month, will end in around two weeks. 
“This work is already coming to an end,” Putin said at a press conference in Astana, where he traveled to participate in a conference. 
“There are now 222,000 people mobilized in the troop formations, out of 300,000. I think that within about two weeks all mobilization activities will be completed.”  Putin also said that “nothing further is being planned … within the foreseeable future,” as his defense ministry had not requested further troops.

Business Insider: After years of headaches, the US Navy's first stealth destroyer is operating farther from home than it's ever been 
* US Navy destroyer USS Zumwalt is on a tour of the Pacific, making visits to Guam and Japan. 
* The trip is the farthest the futuristic stealth warship has been from home since it entered service. 
* It comes after years of mechanical problems and debates about the ship's role in the fleet. 
The US Navy's most advanced destroyer may finally be turning over a new operational leaf after years of maintenance delays, budget headaches, and debates about its role in the fleet. 
USS Zumwalt, the lead ship of the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers, made a port call in Guam on September 19 and arrived in Japan on September 26. It departed Japan on October 8. 
The trip is the farthest the warship has been from its home port in San Diego since it was commissioned in 2016. It's also a chance to figure out what the Zumwalt class will actually do for the Navy.

Business Insider: The US Navy's new high-tech aircraft launcher is being prepped for deployment on France's new nuclear-powered carrier

* Chancellor given his marching orders after being hauled back to Downing Street early from a US summit 
* PM due to front a 2.30pm press conference in which she is expected to announce corporation tax increase 
* Mr Kwarteng's departure makes him the second shortest-serving chancellor in modern British politics

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republicans have ramped up calls to impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after an email circulated indicating he was notified that claims of border patrol agents whipping migrants was false.

Last September images from Del Rio circulated showing border patrol agents on horseback rounding up migrants who had illegally crossed the border.

Republicans have now called for him to be impeached for failing to defend agents.

Daily Mail: Russia's army will be 'annihilated' by the West's non-nuclear military response if Putin uses nukes against Ukraine, warns EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell 
* Fears that Moscow could use a nuke have grown after Putin issued veiled threats 
* NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has warned Russia of 'severe consequences' 
* Alliance has stopped short of threatening to use its nuclear arsenal to respond 
* This is because Ukraine is not covered by NATO's mutual self-defence clause 
Russian forces would be 'annihilated' by the West's military response if Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow on Thursday. 
At the opening of a Diplomatic Academy in Belgium, Borrell said: 'Putin is saying he is not bluffing. 
Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the Member States, and the United States and NATO are not bluffing neither. 
'Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated.'

Iraq's Parliament on Thursday elected Abdelatif Rashid, candidate of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, as the country's new president after beating his rival, Barham Sali, in a secret ballot held more than a year after the parliamentary elections that took place in October 2021. 
The victory of Rashid, who has garnered more than 162 votes against 99 for Sali, candidate of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and current president of the country, comes after he beat his opponent in a first ballot but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to secure the post, as reported by the state news agency NINA. 
 Iraq's Prime Minister Mostafa al-Kazemi congratulated Rashid, who previously served as Minister of Water Resources between 2003 and 2010, on his official Twitter profile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: North Korea fires ballistic missile into the sea and sends warplanes near to the border with South Korea as Kim Jong Un responds to 'provocative action' from Seoul after its military scrambled fighter jets 
* The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said warplanes flew to the border tonight 
* North Korean jets were seen within 12km of the boundary between the nations 
* South Korean fighter jets were scrambled in response to the unusual incident 
* It comes amid raised tensions on the peninsula after missile tests in the North 
South Korea has scrambled fighter jets after Kim Jong Un's warplanes flew towards the border and launched a ballistic missile into the ocean. 
Around 10 North Korean military aircraft were seen flying near the de-facto border overnight, in what it says is a response to 'provocative action' by its southern neighbour. 
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff says planes were seen flying as close as 12km north of the boundary between the two countries late on Thursday and early on Friday.

FM Sergey Lavrov says Joe Biden’s unwillingness to talk with Vladimir Putin won’t complicate an already dire situation  
US President Joe Biden’s latest remark indicating his unwillingness to negotiate with his Russian counterpart is unlikely to further worsen an already dire global security situation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. The diplomat noted that Moscow is, however, still open to dialogue, but that no “sensible” offers have so far been forthcoming from Washington. 
In an interview with Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel aired on Thursday, Lavrov was asked whether he thought Biden’s reluctance to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin would further complicate tensions in the international arena.

Update: Russia not shying away from contacts with US, but no sane proposals so far, Lavrov says (TASS) 
WNU Editor: I disagree with the Russian Foreign Minister. U.S. - Russian relations can get worse, and will get worse. 
My prediction. 
After the US midterm elections are over the Biden administration is going to significantly escalate the deployment of US personal and equipment to eastern Europe, coupled with a massive increase in economic and military support to Ukraine. The next six months we are probably going to witness the most intense moments between the U.S. and Russia since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.
On a side note. The 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis is only 3 days away .... Cuban Missile Crisis (Wikipedia).]]></summary>

BRUSSELS — NATO will closely monitor Russia’s upcoming nuclear exercise but not be cowed into dropping support for Ukraine by Moscow’s veiled nuclear threats, the alliance’s chief said on Thursday. 
“We will not be intimidated,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after a two-day meeting of the alliance’s defense ministers. 
“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous, reckless, and they know that if they use (a) nuclear weapon against Ukraine, it will have severe consequences.” 
The meeting was the first large NATO gathering since Moscow announced it would annex several Ukrainian territories, began a partial mobilization and issued veiled nuclear threats, moves NATO has classified as a clear escalation of the war that started when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

TASS: Ukraine’s joining NATO can lead to World War III — Russia’s Security Council  
Apparently, that's what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Alexander Venediktov said 
MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. Accession of Ukraine to NATO can lead to World War III and NATO itself understands it, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Alexander Venediktov said in an interview with TASS. 
According to him, Ukraine's application for a fast-track NATO membership is "rather a propaganda move."  "Kiev is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to World War Three," Venediktov said. 
"Apparently, that's what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again," Venediktov noted.

In 2017, Drug Enforcement Administration agents following the money from cocaine deals in Memphis, Tennessee, identified a mysterious figure in Mexico entrusted by drug lords with their millions: a Chinese American gangster named Xizhi Li.
As the agents tracked Li’s activity across the Americas and Asia, they realized he wasn’t just another money launderer. He was a pioneer. Operating with the acumen of a financier and the tradecraft of a spy, he had helped devise an innovative system that revolutionized the drug underworld and fortified the cartels.

Now, the Biden administration says it will be "re-evaluating" its relationship with the Saudis. 
According to The Intercept's Ken Klippenstein, the reaction was a public sign of disappointment from U.S. officials rarely directed towards the Saudi Kingdom. 
Experts speaking to The Intercept say the Saudis' move wasn't just geopolitical -- it was an effort to influence U.S. politics. 
“The Saudis are working to get Trump re-elected and for the MAGA Republicans to win the midterms,” Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, told The Intercept. “Higher oil prices will undermine the Democrats.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An explosive new report claims that Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin before he floated a "peace plan" for Ukraine that was widely panned by critics as a gift to Russia.
Vice News reports that newsletter from Ian Bremmer, a foreign policy expert and the founder of the Eurasia Group global risk consultancy firm, is claiming that Musk said that Putin is now "prepared to negotiate" a peace settlement but only if Ukraine accepted Russia's annexations of its territories in the eastern part of the country.
Putin emphasized to Musk that Russia's annexation of this Ukrainian territory, as well as an agreement in which Ukraine would maintain neutrality and not join NATO, would be accomplished "no matter what," and he even emphasized that his nation was prepared to launch a nuclear strike should Ukrainian forces attempt to retake Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.
Bremmer also claims that Musk personally told him that "everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome," and that was why he publicly floated his plan.
IN OTHER NEWS: Now Trump is openly challenging the feds to indict him
But Musk's plan has not been well received in Kyiv, with many officials saying it would amount to capitulation to Russia.
"The only outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing tesla crap. So good luck to you," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk wrote to Musk on Twitter. "F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you."
Musk has denied Bremmer's claims, however, and he wrote on Twitter that "I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space."

"I think the president's been very clear that this is a relationship that we need to continue to re-evaluate, that we need to be willing to revisit," National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.
"Certainly in light of the OPEC decision, I think that's where he is."
The 13-nation, Saudi-led OPEC cartel and its 10 allies headed by Russia agreed last week to reduce output by two million barrels a day from November -- raising fears that oil prices could soar.
The decision was widely seen as a diplomatic slap in the face, since Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in July and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salma…]]></summary>

Such weapons are less destructive than “strategic” weapons designed to wipe out entire cities. But analysts worry that this talk of tactical weapons risks normalising weapons of mass destruction.
Nuclear-armed authoritarian states are increasingly invoking the specter of using “tactical” nuclear weapons. North Korea said on Monday that it had simulated a “tactical” nuclear attack on South Korea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted at using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine as Moscow suffers heavy losses on the battlefield.

Most military analysts expected an easy victory.

It was reasonable to believe that Russia would conquer Ukraine rapidly and then replace the existing government before declaring "victory". 
Of course, that did not happen.

While observers do not believe the unrest is close to toppling the government, the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, with reports of strikes spreading to the vital energy sector.

The kingdom has been stunned by the tragedy in northeastern Na Klang province, one of the worst mass killings in its history, with flags at half-mast and King Maha Vajiralongkorn visiting the families of the victims.
At Wat Rat Samakee temple in Na Klang, chanting monks began the ceremony as the exhausted and grieving close-knit rural community prepared to say a final goodbye to 19 of those killed.
"An incident like this shouldn't have happened," said Thanakorn Nueangmatcha, 39, ahead of the funeral at the temple.
"They were only children."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rights groups voiced alarm Tuesday over the extent of an Iranian crackdown on a Kurdish-populated city that has become a hub for protests, as oil refinery workers pressed strikes in a new tactic.
Iran's clerical authorities have been shaken by over three weeks of protests that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year old Iranian of Kurdish origin, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police.
Despite the use of brutal force by the authorities that activists say has left dozens dead, and led to hundreds of arrests, there is so far no sign of the protest movement coming to an end.
Protests have been especially intense in the city of Sanandaj in the western province of Kurdistan, Amini's home region, where rights groups fear heavy casualties and accuse authorities of resort…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskiy on Monday that the United States will provide Ukraine with advanced air systems after a devastating missile barrage from Russia.
Biden spoke by phone with Zelenskiy to give assurances about continued U.S. support and to condemn the "senseless attacks" from Russia that hit civilian targets.
"President Biden pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems," a White House statement on the phone call said.
Biden also told Zelenskiy the United States and its allies and partners would continue imposing costs on Russia, "holding Russia accountable for its war crimes and atrocities, and providing Ukraine with security, economic, and humanitarian assistance," the White House said.
The United States has provided more than $16.8 billion worth of U.S. security assistance since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and imposed a wide-ranging array of economic sanctions on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - The United States and other G7 powers will hold crisis talks Tuesday on Russia's recent bombing blitz across Ukraine, with Britain's Liz Truss expected to insist they "must not waver one iota" in their support for Kyiv.
The meeting comes a day after Russian missiles rocked the Ukrainian capital for the first time in months, with President Volodymyr Zelensky warning Moscow that his country "cannot be intimidated".
Russian forces rained more than 80 missiles on cities across Ukraine on Monday, according to Kyiv, in apparent retaliation for an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The websites for a number of major US airports were briefly taken offline Monday after a cyberattack promoted by a pro-Russian hacking group.
The distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks hit the airport websites of several major US cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and St Louis.
A DDOS attack involves knocking a website offline by flooding it with traffic.
The airport websites were targeted after the pro-Russian hacking group known as "KillNet" published a list of sites and encouraged its followers to attack them.
The DDOS attacks only affected the public-facing websites of the airports, which supply flight and services information and do not have any impact on operations.
Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport said its website is "up and running after an incident early this morning that made it inaccessible to the public."
"An investigation into the cause of the incident is underway," it said. "At no time were operations at the airport impacted."Most of the airport websites targeted appeared to be functioning normally after being temporarily knocked offline.
KillNet claimed responsibility last week for attacks on a number of US state government websites, and it has taken aim at other countries opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
There was no immediate comment from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently floated a new "compromise" intended to keep peace between Taiwan and China -- and it is being given the same kind of hostile reception that politicians in Ukraine recently gave to his proposed "peace plan" with Russia.
As CNBC reports, Musk told the Financial Times over the weekend that the United States should endorse some kind of plan that gives Beijing some administrative control over Taiwan.
Specifically, Musk said America should "be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy.”
“And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong," Musk added.
However, Taiwanese diplomat Hsiao Bi-khim immediately shot down Musk's proposal, which had received a friendly reception from Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the United States.

"Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale," she said. "Any lasting proposal for our future must be determined peacefully, free from coercion, and respectful of the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan.
Bates Gill of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis similarly told CNBC that there is little desire among people in Taiwan to have any such arrangement, especially after watching how China slowly destroyed freedoms that had existed previously in the city of Hong Kong.
"The world’s wealthiest man obviously feels he has a lot to say on these geopolitical questions," explained Gill. "I would only suggest that he take a lot harder look at the realities, the historical precedents and geopolitical contestation that surround all of these questions before giving us all a lesson in diplomacy."]]></summary>

Near the frontline in southern Ukraine, Andriy Dolgopolov, 35, and his battery of BM-21 Grads await a Russian target.
His wife Tetiana Dolgopolova, 26, prepares coffee on a portable hob placed on the grass.
The couple met almost three years ago on duty in the eastern Donbas region, where there was fighting well before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.
Andriy and Tetiana have been side-by-side ever since.
"My heart is full -- with love for my wife, and love for" the Grads, the commander nicknamed "Demon" tells AFP. "The key thing is that they're not jealous o…]]></summary>

Another 13 people were killed in heavy rains elsewhere in the South American country, while four died in Central America after tropical storm Julia dumped torrential rain on El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Residents of Las Tejerias some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Caracas, used picks, shovels and any tools they could find to dig through a thick bank of mud deposited on the town Saturday.
"It came too fast, we had no time," resident Carlos Camejo, 60, said of the mudslide.
"The town is lost, Las Tejerias is lost," added Carmen Melendez, 55, desperately waiting for news on the whereabouts of a missing relative.

But the real culprit behind the subjugation of non-European peoples across the globe wasn't an individual, or even a monarch. It was the Roman Catholic Church. It's time the church owned that grievous mistake.
 As early as the 15th century, as European nations were making voyages of discovery, Catholic popes gave them permission to subjugate and steal. The most significant of these papal permission slips was the Doctrine of Discovery. A decree Issued in 1493 by Pope Alexander VI, it essentially told Catholic countries that any lands they "discovered" were …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several cities across Ukraine were rocked with explosions in what some are calling the most extensive attack on the country since Russia launched its invasion in February. 
"This morning, a massive high-precision strike was conducted on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, military command, and communications," said Russian President Vladimir Putin. "In case Ukrainian terrorist attacks continue on Russian territory, our response will be tough and proportional."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the strikes disproportionately targeted civilian infrastructure in 11 of Ukraine's 25 regions. 
"It's a tough morning when you're dealing with terrorists," said Zelenskyy in the video. "They're choosing targets to harm as many people as possible."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia on Monday launched a series of missiles into cities across Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson doesn't believe that any new initiative will help the country succeed in its goals of taking and holding Ukrainian territory.
While speaking on CNN, Anderson broke down news that Russian General Sergey Surovikin would be taking over as head of the Kremlin's "special military operation" in Ukraine, which in recent weeks has been hit with multiple humiliating setbacks.
While Surovikin has a well earned reputation as a hardliner, Anderson was skeptical he could turn things around given the current state of Russia's military.
"I don't think there's going to be a new approach because he's incapable of doing a new approach as long as the Russian army is what it is, which is a terrible army," he said.
IN OTHER NEWS: Trump sounded 'guilty and scared' during his latest rally rant: Former federal prosecutor
Later in the segment, Anderson elaborated on why new leadership won't be nearly enough to fix what's broken in the Russian military.
"It's not like the soldiers are going to jump into a phone booth and come out as Superman," he said. "They have a terrible army. They're ten years away from having a good army that can take on the Ukrainians and achieve the military objectives they wanted. They have a low morale... They're incapable of executing the military operations that Vladimir Putin wants. George Patton couldn't make this a success for Putin."

In Iran no-one who expresses dissent from the ruling theocratic system, including the famous, is safe from being caught in the dragnet of a crackdown that has seen hundreds arrested in more than three weeks of protests.
Activists say that when the unrest erupted last month over the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police, the authorities initially resorted to lethal force, killing dozens in the space of days.
But, as well as keeping up the threat of force, authorities are increasingly resorting to arrests, with a particular focus on those who promote videos of protests or anti-regime messages on social media.

In a video released Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the deadly blast on the 12-mile strategic bridge "an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure."
"This was devised, carried out, and ordered by the Ukrainian special services," Putin declared.
Ukrainian officials were dismissive of the accusation. According to the Financial Times, "Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the bridge attack, although officials posted several comments mocking Russia on social media and the Ukrainian p…]]></summary>

Kim made acquiring tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021, and this year vowed to develop North Korea's nuclear forces at the fastest possible speed.
The country revised its nuclear laws last month to allow pre-emptive strikes, with Kim declaring North Korea an "irreversible" nuclear power -- effectively ending the possibility of negotiations over its arsenal.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan throws open its doors to visitors this week after more than two years of pandemic isolation, hopes for a tourism boom face tough headwinds amid shuttered shops and a shortage of hospitality workers.
From Tuesday, Japan will reinstate visa-free travel to dozens of countries, ending some of world's strictest border controls to slow the spread of COVID-19. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen's slide to a 24-year low.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has pointed the finger at Ukraine's secret service SBU for what he called an "act of terrorism" on a bridge linking Russia to Crimea.
"There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation," Putin said on Sunday evening in his first public remarks since an explosion tore through the bridge's rail and roadway.

A projection by pollster SORA for national broadcaster ORF based on a partial vote count put Van der Bellen, a 78-year-old former leader of the Greens, on 54.6% with a margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. His nearest rival was far-right Freedom Party candidate Walter Rosenkranz on 18.9%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Julia slammed into Nicaragua on Sunday carrying top winds of up to 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and a storm surge, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, warning of dangerous weather in the coming days across the region.
The storm made landfall early on Sunday near Laguna de Perlas, the NHC said. By 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) it was around 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of Bluefields.
The hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it crosses Nicaragua, emerging over the eastern Pacific by Sunday night. It was forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night, the NHC said.
"Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides possible from heavy rains over Central America and Southern Mexico through early next week," the center said.
