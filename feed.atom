        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Australian’s Washington correspondent Adam Creighton says US President Joe Biden’s impeachment inquiry will be “a lot more focused” on one single question from the Biden family dealings. 

Mr Creighton joined Sky News Australia host Paul Murray to talk about the “perfectly justified” impeachment inquiry into the President on corruption claims. 

“We have known about the suspicion of corruption in relation to Ukraine for some time,” he said.

“Then of course we had Hunter Biden’s laptop and all the emails about ’10 per cent for the big guy’, so there has been a lot of smoke there. 

“Biden lied – that’s the big one … he has been saying over and over he knew nothing about his son’s business dealings.

“For the Democrats, it is bad – he is going to have the pall of impeachment hanging over him as he campaigns for re-election.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an unspecified location in Russia’s Far East region later in the week.

Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia on board a heavily armoured train yesterday ahead of his meeting with the Russian president.

Vladimir Putin is currently attending the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok which is Russia’s closest city to the North Korean border.

North Korea Political Expert Dr Leonid Petrov believes the meeting between the meeting is significant for both parties and gives Russia the chance to demonstrate its new diplomatic ambition following its invasion of Ukraine.

“Russia has been increasingly isolated and … it’s important to demonstrate that he (Vladimir Putin) is not just someone who is now being sought by the International Criminal Court but also supported by the neighbouring states like North Korea.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: US releases $6bn in frozen Iran funds for prisoner swap 
The US has issued a sanctions waiver for banks to transfer $6bn (£4.8bn) of frozen Iranian funds from South Korea to Qatar, paving the way for the release of five Americans held by Iran.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress that the money would provide "limited benefit" to Iran as it could only be used for humanitarian trade. 
He also confirmed that five Iranians detained in the US would be freed as part of the prisoner exchange deal.

Republicans condemned the transfer.

One senator accused President Joe Biden of paying a "ransom to the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism".

Kyiv Independent: Poll: Most Ukrainians consider president directly responsible for corruption in government 
According to a recent poll published by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, 78% of surveyed Ukrainians believe that the president bears direct responsibility for corruption in the government and regional administrations. Only 18% of respondents disagreed with this statement. 
Older Ukrainians seem more demanding of the head of state than the young people, reads the report. The share of respondents who think the president is responsible for corruption ranges from 70% to 81% among people aged 18-29 and those over 60, respectively.

Update: Almost 80% of Ukrainians consider Zelenskyy responsible for corruption in government and military administrations (Ukrainska Pravda)

 
WNU Editor: I have been told by my Ukrainian contacts that recent poll numbers for President Zelensky are horrible. He is bleeding support that is being ignored by the West.
Corruption is one of the reasons, but the horrors of the war and the failure of the counteroffensive to achieve its promised goals has shifted the mood among my Ukrainian friends, family members, and contacts. They are blaming President Zelensky for this, and unless the tempo of the war changes significantly in favor of Kyiv, this erosion of support for President Zelensky will continue, as well as support for the war.]]></summary>

Politico:  Ukraine needs to do more to fight corruption, Germany’s Baerbock says 
Kyiv ‘still [has] a way to go in the implementation of the anti-oligarch law and the fight against corruption,’ German foreign minister says.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Monday called on Ukraine to step up its efforts to fight corruption during a surprise visit to Kyiv.

Ukraine “still [has] a way to go in the implementation of the anti-oligarch law and the fight against corruption,” Baerbock said on arrival in the Ukrainian capital, the German foreign ministry said in a statement. 
The German minister praised Kyiv’s “impressive” progress on judicial reforms and media legislation — completed even as Ukraine has spent the last 18 months fending off Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, which has cost thousands of lives. Baerbock also reassured Kyiv that it would get Berlin’s “decisive support” for its European Union bid.

The Telegraph: Ukraine’s counter-offensive is stalling. The West must prepare for humiliation 
Time is running out for Ukraine. After 18 months of war, it is no longer a question of if the Western alliance will falter, but when. Since the start, despite making many of the right noises and supplying some military hardware, France and Germany, in particular, have been reluctant partners. Their leaders have often seemed more concerned with finding an “off-ramp” for Vladimir Putin than ejecting his forces from Ukraine. As well as dependency on Russian energy, a pacifist instinct among Western European political classes has led to neglect of their armed forces and a corresponding fear of escalation. 
As the provider of the lion’s share of backing for Ukraine, it is the US calling the shots in this war. Yet, since the earliest days, President Biden, too, has been dragging his heels, giving just about enough military assistance to keep Ukraine fighting, but intentionally not enough to enable a victory.

WNU Editor: The above author (Colonel Richard Kemp) is a fervent supported of Ukraine, and that is why his commentary is an eye-opener. 
Bottom line. 
The West has to escalate their involvement in the war even more by significantly ramping up military aid to Ukraine and increasing economic pressure on Russia. If not, Western public support for the war will continue to decrease, and the likelihood of a Ukraine victory is all but unlikely.]]></summary>

Demystifying the synthetic drug menace: India’s struggles and strategies
Girisanker S.B.                
By the end of the Cold War, the evolution of the referent object of security from a state-centric approach to a broader focus on human security has led to recognising various non-traditional security threats that extend beyond traditional state boundaries. The rise of synthetic drugs has added a new dimension to the illicit drug landscape, altering the dynamics of traditional plant-based opioids and associated trafficking networks necessitating governments to rethink their conventional counter-narcotic strategies.

Ukraine says it has successfully retaken control of four gas drilling platforms in the northern Black Sea, close to the Crimean Peninsula. 
Video of the operation, which Ukraine says took place last month, shows special forces removing Russian military equipment. 
Russia seized control of the so-called Boyko Towers in 2015, shortly after it illegally annexed Crimea. 
There has been a battle for control of these strategic waters since last year. 
A video and statement released by Ukraine's military intelligence, entitled Battle for the Sea, offer a rare glimpse into this sphere of the conflict. 
In the video, which the BBC cannot verify, rigid inflatable boats are seen speeding across the Black Sea, carrying teams of Ukrainian special forces.

        <link href="http://warnewsupdates.blogspot.com/2023/09/new-video-emerges-22-years-after-911.html"/>
        <updated>2023-09-11T13:30:00.121Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: For more info on the above video .... Mysterious 9/11 video that emerged on YouTube 20 years after atrocity (Mirror). 
WNU Editor: I was in my office 22 years ago when I noticed that the browser on my computer was very slow. I was trying to load CNN, and it would just not load. My guess was that CNN's servers had crashed, but I could not load any other news services like the BBC, CBC, France24, AP, etc.. That was when I knew something was wrong. 
I was finally able to load some news from the CBC, and it was then that I knew what was happening. While wondering how could a passenger plane pilot make such a catastrophic mistake, news of a second plane hitting the next tower was being reported. I knew right away that the U.S. was under a coordinated attack, and I made the decision to go home. 
While driving home I called my brother who was living in California to tell him that the U.S. mainland was under attack. After a minute my connection to him died. I learned later from my brother that when I called him I actually woke him up (it was 6:45am his time), and by telling him that New York and Washington were under attack his first thought was that a nuclear attack was underway. 
Getting home I had 3 VCRs, and I started to record the news from the CBC, ABC News, and NBC. I knew history was happening, and I wanted my own archive. I recorded the news from those channels for the next 36 hours, and when finished I took the tapes and put them aside to look at them later. 
Twenty-two years later, I took the tapes out last night, and watched some of it for the first time. 
Sighhhh .... 
It does not get old. It feels like yesterday.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent Chinese Coast Guard operations in the South China Sea targeted a Philippine vessel attempting to resupply a remote outpost that has the potential to become the next flashpoint in the region. The Chinese government followed its provocative act with a disinformation campaign designed to coerce the Philippines to recognize Chinese claims of extended territorial sovereignty in the South China Sea. China claims that the Philippines had previously agreed to remove the Sierra Madre — a false claim the current government has vociferously denied. The Chinese Communist Party’s real intent is to strengthen China’s territorial claims within the Nine Dash

The August 2023 BRICS summit seeks to change that. After much jostling over candidates, criteria, and balance, the members agreed to the potential inclusion of Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In the short term, this move has been perceived as a challenge to the United States and the West more broadly. Yet the long-term impact remains uncertain. The

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has praised a joint declaration by G20 leaders in Delhi that avoids condemning Moscow for its war against Ukraine. 
Russia had not expected consensus and agreement on the wording was "a step in the right direction", said Mr Lavrov. 
The closing G20 statement denounced using force for territorial gain but made no mention of Russian aggression, prompting criticism from Ukraine. 
The two-day summit also inducted a new permanent member, the African Union. 
The 55-member bloc joins at the invitation of hosts India, one of whose key objectives while president has been to make the G20 more inclusive with greater participation of so-called Global South countries. 
The world's biggest economies reached other key deals in Delhi, including one on climate and biofuels - although there was criticism of the summit's failure to commit to phasing out fossil fuels. 
 For the second year in a row, there was no official G20 "family photo". No reason was given but reports say many leaders refused to be photographed, pointing to Russia's presence at the summit.

The head of Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence agency (GUR) has said that Russian troops will prove unable to continue their full-scale invasion for longer than one more year, adding that Moscow's forces have "miserably failed" at the strategic level. 
Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov told the Yalta European Strategy (YES) summit in Kyiv on Saturday that Russia's invasion "didn't work for the better" for the Kremlin, leaving the country's armed forces and economy much diminished.
Despite Russian tactical adaptations and impressive defenses in southern Ukraine, Budanov—who has become well-known for his psychological operations against Russia—suggested the war may end in Ukrainian victory before the end of 2024.

CBS News: Gen. Mark Milley on seeing through the fog of war in Ukraine 
No other American has been more deeply involved in the war in Ukraine than General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At 6:45 in the morning, he was about to have a call with Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, commander of Ukraine's armed forces. "I talk to him every week, sometimes twice a week, three times a week," Milley said. 
Three hours later, he took "Sunday Morning" underground, deep in the bowels of the Pentagon, into a top-secret command center where all the intelligence collected from the battlefields of Ukraine is monitored by his staff, who inform him on a day-to-day basis what's happening in the current operations. Milley said, "The fog and friction of war is always present, but our information systems are pretty good."

WNU Editor: There were some errors in the above CBS report (see tweet below).

The new @CBSNews report w/ Mark Milley is really good, but the map in the report needs some TLC.
It shows the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant and the Kinburn Spit as not Russian-occupied, which is factually incorrect.
It also places Zaporizhia City in an entirely wrong location. pic.twitter.com/vNcYjZ2Klc

Ukraine has just 45 days left to make significant gains in its counteroffensive against Russian forces before the onset of autumn and winter weather, Western observers said yesterday. 
General Mark Milley, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it would become 'very difficult to manoeuvre' in the region's autumn rains.

Early in the summer, Kyiv began to strike at Russia's defensive lines, intending to reach the Sea of Azov to split Ukrainian territory held by Russia into two.

After achieving a degree of success with the EV6 two years ago, the Koreans have upped the ante with an imposing and well-equipped EV9, albeit it at a high price. The first lavishly equipped Launch Edition with all-wheel drive will bend your bank balance to the tune of €83,190 in Europe. Prices for the base version with no gizmos hover around €70,000. The snub-nosed EV9 is big but not brutish. It stands at 5 metres from bumper to bumper in length and is designed to lure SUV buyers as well...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London-based sex worker Marin Scarlett and right-wing populist Nigel Farage might initially appear unlikely campaigning allies, but when it comes to the pitfalls of banking in Britain they share a common cause.
"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second-ranking US diplomat met Niger's military leaders on Monday to press to reverse a coup but reported no headway a day after an ultimatum from the West African bloc ECOWAS was ignored.
Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.
A source close to ECOWAS said an immediate military intervention to restore Bazoum was n…]]></summary>

The musician's funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing "greater flexibility and maritime capability" to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
