		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden signed a new weapons package worth up to $400 million for Ukraine on Friday, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and more ammunition. 
The new U.S. aid is meant to bolster Ukraine as it confronts heavy pounding by Russian artillery.
Since the Feb. 24 invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a big chunk of territory across Ukraine's southern flank above Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Russia is slowly pushing Ukrainian forces out of two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine which it has recognized as independent states. 
A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the additional HIMARS would bring the total number of these systems to 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, poses for a picture at the Bundestag in Berlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

Last month, while undergoing scheduled maintenance at a Siemens Energy facility in Montreal, the turbine was caught up in sanctions the Trudeau government brought against its owner, Russian oil and gas giant Gazprom.

In 2016, Donald Trump loved to stunt on his political opponents by landing his massive, branded jet behind them just as they were giving speeches during campaign stops at airports. 
Now, a new video documents “Trump Force One” getting a fresh coat of paint, leaving the gleaming Boeing 757 resplendent with a waving American flag on the tail. 
Trump linked the video in a post on his Truth Social media platform, writing, “During my four years in the White House, I didn’t use everybody’s favorite airplane, the Boeing 757 we campaigned on for our big 2016 WIN. Now it has been completely modernized and renovated, and looks GREAT, all done in the Great State of Louisiana, and coming back to the skies in the Fall of 2022, or maybe sooner. Get ready!”

Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

Daily Mail: Fury as left-wing activists ShutDownDC offer $200 bounties for intel on locations of SCOTUS judges who overturned Roe v Wade after targeting Brett Kavanaugh during steakhouse dinner 
* A left-wing activist group is encouraging social media users to tweet the location of any of the conservative Supreme Court Justices are spotted out and about 
* ShutDownDC is promising a bounty of $50 for anyone who shares a 'confirmed sighting' and a further $200 if they are still in that location half an hour later 
* The tweet specifically targets Justices Kavanaugh, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Coney Barrett or Roberts 
* Twitter forbids users encouraging others to harass individuals or groups 
* Earlier this week Brett Kavanaugh was eating dinner when activists showed up at the steakhouse where he was forcing him to leave via the back door 
* Incident comes less than a month after a man was charged with turning up at his home and threatening to kill him 
A left-wing activist group is encouraging users on social media to tweet the location of any of the conservative Supreme Court Justices in exchange for money. 
The justices were the majority who voted to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision last month. 
Since then, pro-abortion activists have repeatedly protested outside the justices' homes and, in some cases, confronted them in public.

Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa's resignation, has called an urgent …]]></summary>

From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.

It’s the $400 Steam Deck, as utilitarian a console as that sounds.  The handheld device, a chunky black plastic slab with an integrated game controller, has the guts of a supercomputer and a touchscreen.  It’s like a gaming computer and a Nintendo Switch had a child.
Valve, the Bellevue, Wash. company known for its Steam online game store, started taking orders for the Steam Deck last year, and the consoles arrived recently.  The company hasn’t released sales figures, but estimates suggest hundreds of thousands have been shipped.  People trying to order one today won’t receive the device until the fall.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

					Over the last 10 years, the number of people around the world who have been forced to flee their homes and become displaced in their own countries, has more than doubled. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the increase in internally displaced persons (IDPs) has been particularly stark, as Resident Coordinator Bruno Lemarquis, the senior UN official there, explains.

Severe recruiting shortages in all branches of the service are too serious to ignore. 
Enlisted bonuses as high as $50,000 have not helped much. And the Army has met only 40 percent of its 2022 goal, so it reduced end strength by 22,000 soldiers.

Americans' confidence in newspapers and television news has plummeted to an all-time low, according to the latest annual Gallup survey of trust in U.S. institutions. 
Why it matters: The erosion of trust in media is one of the most significant signs of deepening polarization in America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former NHL general manager and scout Craig Button compared Bedard to Steve Yzerman, the Hall of Famer who captained the Detroit Red Wings to the Stanley Cup three times.  “Connor has all the skills, but what impresses me is his intensity like Stevie Y, a killer instinct,” said Button, who follows the entry draft and junior hockey for the TSN network. in Canada.
Such talk could easily turn a 16-year-old’s head, but Bedard seems to be used to it.  He’s been hearing it at least since he was 12, the first year he started skating with NHL players in their off-season practices.  “I skated with them once that summer and I was that annoying little boy there,” he said.  “When I was 14 I skated with them regularly, almost every day they had ice.”
Soon, Vancouver-based pros like Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins of Edmonton, the 2011 first overall pick, would be texting Bedard when rounding up players for practices and scrimmages.  Those sessions gave Bedard a sense of the skill and speed of NHL play, but the business side of the league, especially pre-draft interviews, stresses out a lot of talented teenagers.
Thus, Newport Sports Management, the agency representing Bedard, organized for its client interviews with three general managers of the NHL: Don Sweeney of the Boston Bruins, Kyle Davidson of the Chicago Blackhawks and Yzerman, now at the front office of the Red Wings. .
For Bedard, the most intense was a one-on-one interview with Yzerman.  “We talked for 45 minutes and he asked a lot of questions,” Bedard said.  “In the end it probably became more of a conversation than an interview. I asked him a few questions and he gave me advice on the game and the league.

TORONTO/OTTAWA — A major network outage at one of Canada’s biggest telecom operators shut banking, transport and government access for millions on Friday, drawing outrage from customers and adding to criticism over Rogers Telecommunications’ industry dominance. 
Nearly every facet of life was disrupted. Canadians who typically work from home crowded into cafes and public libraries that still offered internet access and hovered outside hotels to catch a signal. 
Canada’s border services agency said its mobile app for incoming travelers was affected. Retailers’ cashless pay systems went down, while banks reported issues with ATM services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s lawsuit blaming China for COVID-19 was dismissed Friday when a federal judge ruled his court has no jurisdiction over foreign governments.

DW: Russia targets EU, cutting off Kazakhstan's oil exports 
This week, Moscow halted crude oil exports from Kazakhstan via a Black Sea port. Kazakhstan is the EU's fifth-largest supplier and this effectively reduces oil imports. 
The search is now on for alternative routes.  In a telephone conversation on July 4, Kazakhstan's president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev assured EU Council President Charles Michel of his country's support in helping the 27-nation bloc overcome its current energy crisis. 
Only a day later, a district court in Novorossiysk — Russia's biggest Black Sea port — ordered a pipeline coming from Kazakhstan and exporting oil to Europe shut for a month.

WNU Editor: A million barrels of oil production per day has just been taken off the world markets. 
This is also happening a few days after Kazakhstan's president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev assured EU Council President Charles Michel of his country's support in helping the 27-nation bloc overcome its current energy crisis. Yeah .... I do not believe in coincidences.

Reuters: Taiwan slams 'provocative' China for sending fighters across Taiwan Strait 
TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese fighter jets crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday in what the island's government slammed as a provocation, as a senior U.S. senator visited Taipei for a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen that China condemned. 
China claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up military and political pressure to try and force the island to accept Chinese rule. 
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the Chinese aircraft "intentionally crossed the median line of the strait in a provocative move, which has seriously damaged regional peace and stability".

RT: Kremlin clarifies Putin’s remark on Ukraine  
Russia is using ‘only a fraction’ of its military capability in the neighboring country, spokesman said  
President Vladimir Putin’s observation that Russian troops in Ukraine “haven’t even really started anything yet” simply states that Moscow is far superior in its military strength, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified on Friday. 
On Thursday, Putin dared Western leaders who seek Russia’s defeat on the battlefield in Ukraine to deliver on the threat. “Let them try. We haven’t even really started anything yet,” he claimed. 
The president “simply reminded [his audience] that the military potentials [of Ukraine and Russia] were incommensurable,” Peskov said. 
“Russian strength is so vast that only a small fraction of it is engaged in the special military operation,” the official said.  Western expectations that Ukraine can defeat Russia militarily are “absurd and only add to the suffering of the Ukrainian people,” he added.

The assassination of Abe, who was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, shocks a peaceful country.
 The assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday was shocking for many reasons: the rarity of political killings in an advanced democracy these days; the paucity of murders of any kind in Japan, long one of the world’s safest countries; the use of a gun in a nation that reportedly had just one shooting homicide in 2021. 
But perhaps the most stunning thing of all was the assassin’s target: Abe, who had seemed to master the art of political resurrection as few leaders had in Japan or any oth…]]></summary>

The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
"I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave," Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…]]></summary>

Under the new rules — which were released Tuesday and go into effect in September — CAF will allow military personnel to, among other things, colour their hair and grow it to any length, and to sport face tattoos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday's shocking assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stunned the world and drew immediate condemnation, with world leaders praising Abe's "global leadership" and slamming a "cowardly attack".
Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …]]></summary>

Nearly a dozen employees in the club’s marketing department said they expected to be reprimanded by their boss in front of their colleagues.  Others said they dealt with his anger in more humiliating ways, ordered to stand up and leave staff meetings on one man’s word.
The pressure had its effect.  Last year, several Chelsea employees were missing for weeks, if not months, of sick leave.  At least 10 members of staff – from a department which employs around 50 people – had left the club altogether, an employee said.

The mainstream press spends a lot of time talking about the dangers of misinformation and their fight against misinformation and the need to control and correct these things.  Not so much when it’s theirs, though, like falsely attributing a viewpoint to a Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas.
Politico a posted a correction to an article they published last week with the title “Clarence Thomas suggests that Covid vaccines are being developed using cells from aborted children”.
The story moved very quickly, amid a flurry of negative press directed at Judge Thomas, and not only had a huge social media presence, but was quickly picked up by other news outlets.  The correction?  Not that much.

I guess that was a funny way of saying it, but I was dead serious.  I have always understood that misogyny and homophobia work in tandem.  One informs the other, so if the right has spent decades plotting and plotting to overturn Roe v.  Wade and outlawing abortion, one has to assume that other rights — especially any related to the LGBTQ community — will be next.

As frustrating as it was to read the Supreme Court’s decision last Friday, at least Justice Clarence Thomas didn’t bother to argue otherwise.

In a separate concurring opinion, Thomas challenged a number of previous court rulings    including Obergefell v.  Hodges, which established marriage equality after giving same-sex co…]]></summary>

Comey, the former FBI director, and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe – both seen as enemies of former President Donald J.

The IRS disclosure came a day after The New York Times reported that Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe had undergone audits that only target several thousand Americans a year and are very invasive.

Boris Johnson will step down as Prime Minister
Standing alone at a desk outside 10 Downing Street, Boris Johnson announced that he resigns after three years as British Prime Ministerthe result of a massive cabinet rebellion, a wave of government resignations and a devastating loss of party support caused by recent scandals. 
Johnson has tried to keep his job in recent days.  But a dizzying 48 hours, during which two of his most senior ministers resigned, left him with little chance of retaining his support in parliament.  “Most prime ministers would have gotten the message sooner,” said Andrew Gimson, one of Johnson’s biographers.

These cells are the largest bacteria ever observed, thousands of times larger than more familiar bacteria like Escherichia coli.  “It would be like meeting another human the size of Mount Everest,” said Jean-Marie Volland, a microbiologist at the Joint Genome Institute in Berkeley, California.
Dr. Volland and his colleagues published their study of the bacteria, called Thiomargarita magnifica, Thursday in the journal Science.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
"We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[National Interest: Did Russia Take Out Ukrainian HIMARS Missile Launchers? 
Ukrainian military officials rejected Russia’s claims as “fake.”  The Russian military claimed on Wednesday that it destroyed two High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) missile launchers in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region.
“In the area of the village of Malotaranovka, high-precision air-launched missiles destroyed two US-made HIMARS multiple missile launchers and two ammunition depots for them,” announced Russia’s Defense Ministry, according to Russian news outlet RIA Novosti. 
The Defense Ministry reportedly added that a radar station for a Ukrainian S-300 missile system was destroyed in southern Ukraine. Malotaranovka is located to the south of Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region that sits on the path of Russia’s ongoing offensive in the Donbass region.

WNU Editor: I do not know if these HIMARS systems have been destroyed. The Russian Ministry of Defense has posted what appears to be a Ukrainian HIMARS system and support vehicles being wiped out, but the video was taken from a distance and it is hard to determine what exactly is being destroyed (link here). 
But I would not be surprised if these systems will be knocked out very quickly. I have been told by a regular reader of this blog that these HIMARS launch a very unique missile, and when they are fired they can be quickly spotted by the Russian military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

Daily Mail: Royal Navy reveals it seized Iranian missiles after high-speed pursuit of smugglers' speedboats in Wildcat helicopters 
* Weapons confiscated in the operation include missiles which breach UN Security Council resolution 2216 
* One of these missiles has a range of over 600m/s and is of the same variety used in the deadly attack on Abu Dhabi  in January 2022 which killed three civilians 
* This is the first time a British Naval ship has intercepted vessels carrying such sophisticated and advanced weaponry from Iran 
* The weapons were thought to be on their way to Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen 
The Royal Navy has revealed one of its warships, the HMS Montrose, seized a stash of deadly weapons off the Iranian coast earlier this year. 
The first-of-its-kind raid took place after helicopter crews noticed smuggler vessels acting suspiciously while on patrol in international waters. 
A number of the weapons seized from the hoard violate a UN Security Council resolution namely surface-to-air-missiles and engines for land attack cruise missiles. 
It is thought the weapons were being transported to Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen.

Kyiv protests over ‘unacceptable situation’ as Russian-flagged ship sails from Karasu, where it had been impounded 
Ukraine has summoned the Turkish ambassador after it said Turkey had allowed a Russian-flagged ship carrying what it has claimed was thousands of tonnes of stolen Ukrainian grain to leave the port of Karasu. 
“We regret that Russia’s ship Zhibek Zholy, which was full of stolen Ukrainian grain, was allowed to leave Karasu port despite criminal evidence presented to the Turkish authorities,” said the foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko. “Turkey’s ambassador in Kyiv will be invited to Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs to clarify this unacceptable situation.”

WNU Editor: The Ukrainian government is pissed. But considering how important and dependent Turkey is on having good relations with Russia, the release of this grain ship is not a surprise.

Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

\u201cMorning @snb19692  Glad you have your speakers back.  Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?\u201d

\u201cBenny Hill music blaring outside Parliament. \n\nPerfect.\n\n\u201d

* WNBA star Brittney Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges and now faces up to 10 years in a Russian prison 
* She told the judge: 'I'd like to plead guilty, your honor. But there was no intent. I didn't want to break the law'

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
"Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being 'lynched,' as they put it, by the January 6 Committee," reported Julia Davis.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - G20 foreign ministers head to a joint summit on Friday that will put some of the staunchest critics of Russia invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, in the first such meeting since the war started in February. 
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Europe, the United States and Australia stressing there will be no "business as usual" at the forum, without saying what that might entail. 
Russia's invasion has cast a cloud over Indonesia's presidency of the Group of 20 largest economies this year, with speculation of boycotts from some members and a walkout in April at a finance ministers' meeting in Washington.
