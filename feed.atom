Update: Putin 'planning for a long war' in Ukraine: NATO chief (France 24)   
WNU Editor: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is saying what this blog has been saying since September. The Kremlin made the decision (probably in August when the decision to call-up reserves was made) that this war is going to last a few years.
The question that should be asked is on NATO's commitment to send weapons and monies in the billions of dollars to Ukraine every month that may last for 2, 3 or more years.
Is the public willing to accept this commitment and sacrifice (i.e. high energy prices/inflation/shortages/etc.), and will the political still be there in 2024 or beyond? You tell me.]]></summary>

Former President Pedro Castillo is in jail. That’s nothing new in Peruvian politics.
 Peru’s former president Pedro Castillo is in prison, at least 20 people are dead, hundreds of tourists are stranded, and the nation is in crisis after Castillo was ousted from his position on December 7. Dina Boluarte, the South American nation’s sixth president in seven years, is now struggling to maintain control in a political environment where chaos and corruption are the norm.
Castillo’s leadership came to an end after he attempted to dissolve Congress earlier this month prior to a planned impeachment vote following corruption charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC/Reuters: New Covid model predicts over 1 million deaths in China through 2023 
* China’s national health authority has not reported any official Covid deaths since the lifting of Covid restrictions. The last official deaths were reported on Dec. 3. Total pandemic fatalities stand at 5,235. 
* Other experts expect some 60% of China’s population will eventually be infected, with a peak expected in January, hitting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, the hardest. 
* Key concerns include China’s large pool of susceptible individuals, the use of less effective vaccines and low vaccine coverage among those 80 and older, who are at greatest risk of severe disease. 
China’s abrupt lifting of stringent Covid-19 restrictions could result in an explosion of cases and over a million deaths through 2023, according to new projections from the U.S.-based Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
According to the group’s projections, cases in China would peak around April 1, when deaths would reach 322,000. About a third of China’s population will have been infected by then, IHME Director Christopher Murray said.

Daily Mail: Biden buys 3 million barrels of oil to stock up the emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve after withdrawing 180 million to try and bring down gas prices 
* The department said it will purchase the oil for less than the $96 per barrel it sold its supply for 
* Three million barrels, only 15 percent of daily U.S. demand, is a drop in the bucket of the 180 million DOE has depleted the reserve of since March 
* At the same time the department will tap 1.8 million barrels from the reserve in an emergency exchange after a shutdown of the Keystone pipeline 
The Department of Energy (DOE) announced Friday it will purchase 3 million barrels of oil to replenish the supply it depleted from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to lower gas prices.  
The department said it will purchase the oil for less than the $96 per barrel it sold its supply for. 
Three million barrels, only 15 percent of daily U.S. demand, is a drop in the bucket of the 180 million DOE has depleted the reserve of since March.  
The deal is part of a fixed-price plan that allows refiners to sell oil to the SPR at a stable rate and avoid selling at the volatile oil market's rate on any given day.

   Antiwar.com: Serbia Seeks Troop Deployment in Kosovo  
Belgrade formally asked NATO if its troops could return to northern Kosovo, a request unlikely to be granted  
Serbia has formally asked NATO if it can deploy up to 1,000 troops into northern Kosovo, where Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic says ethnic Serbs are being “terrorized” by the Kosovo government based in Pristina. 
Vucic made the request to the commander of NATO forces in Kosovo, known as KFOR. Serbian officials say that a UN resolution that formally ended the Kosovo war allows for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian troops into Kosovo, but Vucic still doesn’t expect the request to be granted. 
“The request says that a certain number of (Serbian troops), from one hundred to up to 1,000, return to Kosovo,” he said.

WNU Editor: The UN resolution that formally ended the Kosovo war allows for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian troops into Kosovo. But it looks like NATO is going to break this agreement and not permit this deployment.If agreements are not going to be honored, the usual outcome is conflict and in the case of the Balkans, war.
 Update: This is not going to happen .... Kosovo submits formal request to join the EU, Serbia angry (AP).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington Post: 'Massive' wave of missiles strike Ukraine; civilian and infrastructure targets hit 
A wave of explosions and missile strikes was reported across Ukraine Friday — from the capital, Kyiv, to Kharkiv and Sumy in the northeast and Poltava in central Ukraine. 
Critical infrastructure across seven cities took another wave of hits.    Reporters with The Washington Post heard blasts in Kyiv and the central city of Dnipro. Kyiv officials said the city had experienced “one of the biggest missile attacks” since the beginning of the war. 
A Ukraine air force spokesman said that Russia had launched more than 60 missiles at the country in the latest barrage.  At least three people were killed and 13 injured when a residential building was hit in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, local officials said. 
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy operator, said emergency shutdowns were taking place in all regions of Ukraine as a result of the strikes.

Reuters: Thousands protest in Turkey over Istanbul mayor's conviction 
ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Thousands of people rallied in Turkey on Thursday to oppose the conviction and political ban of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, chanting slogans criticising President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party before elections next year.
A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced Imamoglu, a popular rival to Erdogan, to two years and seven months in prison, which like the ban must be confirmed by an appeals court.
The verdict drew wide criticism at home and abroad as an abuse of democracy. 
Late on Thursday, media reports said the prosecutor in the case had launched a legal challenge to the verdict, seeking a longer jail sentence for Imamoglu. No further details were immediately available.

Daily Mail: Planning to turn America to ash? Laughing Kim Jong Un puffs on a cigarette as he is dwarfed by a smoke cloud while supervising test of new missile that is harder to detect and can reach mainland US 
* The North Korean leader has tested a new arsenal capable of striking the US 
* Kim Jong Un was pictured laughing and puffing on a cigarette during the test  
* The missiles include solid fuel which helps shorten launch preparation times 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un puffed on a cigarette and laughed as he supervised the test of a 'high-thrust solid-fuel motor' for a new strategic weapon on Thursday. 
State media said the development could hand the despot a more mobile, harder-to-detect arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the mainland US.
Thursday's 'static firing test' of a missile engine at the country's northwest rocket launch facility was the first of its kind in North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.

A Ukrainian Embassy reception, sponsored by America’s biggest weapons makers.
 The invitation said the quiet part out loud.
The Ukrainian Embassy hosted a reception last week in honor of the 31st anniversary of the country’s armed services. Events like this are part of the social calendar of Washington’s smart set, with hobnobbing diplomats, think tankers, journalists, and US officials. Guests took photos with the Ukrainian ambassador. Even Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley showed up.
But there was something so overt it led some observers to laugh out loud at the gathering’s invitatio…]]></summary>

The European Parliament passed a resolution that declared Holodomor — the starvation of millions of people in Ukraine in the 1930s under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin — a "genocide". 
The European Parliament on Thursday voted for a resolution declaring the deliberately induced famine in Ukraine 90 years ago a genocide. 
The text of the resolution said the EU legislature "recognizes the Holodomor, the artificial famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine caused by a deliberate policy of the Soviet regime, as a genocide against the Ukrainian people." 
EU lawmakers "strongly condemn these acts, which resulted in the deaths of millions of Ukrainians, and call on all countries and organizations that have not yet done so to follow suit and recognize it as genocide," the statement read. 
"While condemning the current Russian regime for manipulating historical memory for the purpose of its own survival, Parliament calls on the Russian Federation, as the primary successor of the Soviet Union, to apologies for those crimes," the press release read.

WNU Editor: The brutality of Stalin was not only felt in Ukraine, but also throughout the Soviet Union. No ethnic group was spared from the Socialists/Communists in power then, even Russians. 
But IMHO the ones who probably suffered the most during this time were the Kazakhs, where it is estimated that between 38% - 42% of the population died during this period of time (Kazakh famine of 1930–1933).]]></summary>

    DW: International Rescue Commission lists emergency hotspots 
Every year, the IRC publishes its Emergency Watchlist. Globally, there are record numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance — but there is cause for hope. 
The International Rescue Committee was founded in 1933, at the suggestion of Jewish refugee Albert Einstein, to rescue people from the Nazi regime. 
Today, the IRC helps victims of war around the world.  For the last 10 years, the organization has published its Emergency Watchlist: the 20 countries at greatest risk of deteriorating into a humanitarian crisis. 
 Factors such as economic resilience, the intensity of conflicts, natural disasters and the displacement of people are all taken into account. 
The countries in the top 10 (in this order) are: Somalia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Haiti and Ukraine. 
Numbers 11 to 20 are: the Central African Republic, Chad, Lebanon, Mali, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan and Venezuela.

NYPost: Biden jokes about plan to visit Africa, tells leaders he may ‘eat your food’ 
WASHINGTON — President Biden turned heads Thursday by jokingly telling African leaders that he plans to visit their continent, but that he might ravenously “eat your food.” 
The 80-year-old president made the crack while dusting off one of his frequent laugh lines about being a “poor relative” who overstays his welcome but drew groans from those in attendance due to food insecurity in Africa. 
“I’m grateful that all of you have made the journey to Washington for this summit, and I’m eager to visit your continent,” Biden told the representatives of 50 African nations at DC’s convention center after hosting them for a White House dinner Wednesday night. 
“As I told some of you — you invited me to your countries. I said, ‘Be careful what you wish for because I may show up.’ The poor relatives always show up. The wealthy ones never show up. The poor come and they eat your food and stay longer than they should.”

Al Jazeera: India test-fires Agni-V missile amid border tensions with China  
The nuclear-capable ballistic missile, with a range of 5,400km (3,300 miles) is launched from eastern India, a government minister says.

Reuters: Russia preparing for long war, Ukrainian military says 
KYIV (Reuters) -Russia is digging in for a long war in Ukraine and still wants to conquer the entire country, a senior Ukrainian military official said on Thursday. 
Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov told a military briefing that although he did not expect Moscow to launch an attack from Belarus, Russian was training new troops on its neighbour's soil and had moved military aircraft there. 
Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar, at the same briefing, warned against allowing complacency to set in after recent Russian military setbacks. 
"The Kremlin ... is seeking to turn the conflict into a prolonged armed confrontation," Gromov said.  Malyar added: "We and the world should not relax, because the ultimate goal of the Russian Federation is to conquer all of Ukraine, and then it can move on." 
Gromov did not say what Russia's aim might be in prolonging the already nearly 10-month-old war.

 Washington Post: Russia is destroying Ukraine's economy, raising costs for U.S. and allies 
KYIV, Ukraine - Two months of relentless missile and drone attacks by Russia have decimated Ukraine's critical infrastructure and blown a hole in projections for the country's war-ravaged economy. 
Before those strikes, Kyiv expected to need at least $55 billion in foreign assistance next year to meet basic expenses - more than the country's entire annual prewar spending. 
Now, with its energy systems severely battered, and more Russian attacks likely, some officials believe Ukraine could end up needing another $2 billion a month, and political leaders have begun trying to brace Western supporters for such worst-case scenarios. 
"What do you do when you can't heat your house, you can't run your shops, factories or plants, and your economy is not working?" said Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky. "We are going to be requiring more financial assistance, and Putin is doing this to destroy unity among allies."

Moon Of Alabama: Ukraine - What Its Military Leadership Says 
The Economist has interviewed the three Ukrainian leaders who manage the war in Ukraine. It summarizes them in an interpretive writeup. I will use that to extract the important points.   
Volodymyr Zelensky and his generals talk to The Economist (Paywalled) 
The writeup is of course full of propaganda but one can still glean some information from it. 
The first interview (transcript) was with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, who is saying nothing new that would be of interest:       
“People do not want to compromise on territory,” he says, warning that allowing the conflict to be “frozen” with any Ukrainian land in Russian hands would simply embolden Mr Putin. “And that is why it is very important…to go to our borders from 1991.” 
Zelensky wants Crimea back. Good luck achieving that impossibility one might say. 
The second interview is with General Valery Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The third interview is with Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrsky, the head of Ukraine’s ground forces.       
All three men emphasised that the outcome of the war hinges on the next few months. They are convinced that Russia is readying another big offensive, to begin as soon as January.

WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a bill late Wednesday banning federal employees from using TikTok on government devices, marking the latest attempt by Republicans to clamp down on the popular, Chinese-owned video-sharing app, and suggesting the existence of bipartisan congressional support to regulate it further. 
Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who introduced the bill, said in a Thursday statement that the ban would prohibit individuals from downloading or using the app on devices issued by the federal government, with an exception for those working in law enforcement or national security.

Washington Post: Shelters, backpacks and FM radios: Kyiv prepares for nuclear war 
KYIV, Ukraine — If Kyiv is struck by a nuclear bomb, Serhiy Dmytruk’s biggest fear is that he will survive the blast but die anyway from hunger, thirst or cold. So he has assembled what he calls his “nuclear backpack,” crammed with enough provisions and survival paraphernalia to sustain him for a week. 
Pavlo Huk, who has compiled a similar pack, is kitting out the basements of his home and his workplace, and has rented a house in the countryside, planning to equip it with a generator, food and fuel. His worry is that friends and relatives who have shrugged off the threat will die because they have not taken similar precautions. 
Natalia Sulima fears only that she will be separated from her 5-year-old son Misha, and she has been drilling him on the importance of following adults to a shelter whenever sirens sound. She won’t let him out without his own version of a nuclear backpack, a school bag containing a Transformers toy, snacks, and his favorite book: “The Boy Who Lives With Dragons.” 
“I can’t believe we have to do this. In the 21st century,” Sulima said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany is bleeding cash to keep the lights on. Almost half a trillion dollars, and counting, since the Ukraine war jolted it into an energy crisis nine months ago. 
That's the cumulative scale of the bailouts and schemes the Berlin government has launched to prop up the country's energy system since prices rocketed and it lost access to gas from main supplier Russia, according to Reuters calculations. 
And it may not be enough. 
"How severe this crisis will be and how long it will last greatly depends on how the energy crisis will develop," said Michael Groemling at the German Economic Institute (IW).

   Polskie Radio: Polish MPs have passed a resolution designating Russia as “a state sponsor of terrorism” over Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The resolution was adopted by the Sejm, the lower house of Poland's parliament, in a 231-2 vote, with one abstention, on Wednesday night, Polish state news agency PAP reported. 
A total of 226 lawmakers, mainly those from the opposition, did not take part in the vote, according to public broadcaster Polish Radio’s IAR news agency.   
Earlier, the Sejm amended the draft to mention the 2010 Smolensk air disaster, in which a Polish plane carrying President Lech Kaczyński, his wife and 94 others, including top political and military figures, crashed near Smolensk, western Russia, killing all those on board.

   CNN: Ukraine launches ‘most massive strike’ on occupied Donetsk region since 2014, Russia-installed mayor says  
Ukrainian forces have unleashed the biggest attack on the occupied Donetsk region since 2014, according to a Russia-installed official, in the wake of heavy fighting in the east of the country. 
Donetsk has been held by Russian-backed separatists for eight years and it is one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow attempted to annex in October, in violation of international law. 
“At exactly 7 a.m. the (Ukrainians) subjected the center of Donetsk (city) to the most massive strike since 2014,” the Moscow-appointed mayor, Aleksey Kulemzin, posted on Telegram.
“Forty rockets from BM-21 ‘Grad’ MLRS were fired at civilians in our city,” he said Thursday, adding that a key intersection in Donetsk city center had come under fire.

USNI News: SECNAV Names Next Big Deck Amphib USS Fallujah 
Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro named a future landing helicopter assault ship after the first and second Battle of Fallujah, the Navy announced Tuesday.
LHA-9, an America-class amphibious assault ship, will be called USS Fallujah, the Navy said in a news release. Del Toro announced the name at a promotion ceremony for Private 1st Class Chesty, the Marine Corps bulldog mascot. 
“The name selection follows the tradition of naming amphibious ships after the U.S. Marine Corps battles, early U.S. sailing ships or legacy names of earlier carriers from World War II,” Del Toro said during the announcement. “It is an honor for me for our nation to memorialize the Marines, the soldiers and coalition forces that fought valiantly and those who sacrificed their lives during both battles of Fallujah.”

   CBS DFW: F-35 fighter jet pilot ejected after attempted landing at Fort Worth naval air base 
FORT WORTH, Texas (CBSDFW.COM) — A pilot was ejected during an attempted vertical landing at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth this morning. 
The aircraft, identified to CBS 11 as an F35 B Model used by the Marine Corps, was in the process of a vertical landing when the nose began to lean forward as the back wheels lifted up.  
The front of the plane fell into the pavement, and smoke began pouring out of the nose before the pilot was ejected. His parachute deployed and he landed apparently without injury.

Russia's defense ministry shared a video of a intercontinental ballistic missile being loaded into a launch silo, days after reports surfaced that the US is preparing to send an advanced Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. 
The Russian ministry shared the video on Telegram on Thursday, saying that it showed the loading of an "intercontinental ballistic missile into silo launcher" in Kozelsk, a town in western Russia. 
It claimed the missile was a "Yars," which has a nuclear warhead. Russia previously fired a Yars missile in October, as part of a test conducted by the country's nuclear forces.

Some of the indigenous protesters, who had come from the Peruvian Amazon jungle, were carrying bows and arrows, which police said they confiscated.
They are among the thousands of protesters demanding not only Castillo's release but also the resignation of his successor Dina Boluarte, the dissolution of Congress and new elections.
"I came to take part in a protest march. My country is very ill ... we want to bring forward elections and close Congress, which does not represent us," Sanchez, 57, told AFP.

Al Arabiya: Netanyahu: US needs to reaffirm support for allies, including Saudi Arabia 
The Israeli PM-designate said that part of the Democratic Party had moved “sharply” to the left, “in some cases, to a radical position and often against the wishes of a broad constituency in the public.” 
Incoming Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that he wants US President Joe Biden to reaffirm Washington’s commitment to its “traditional allies” in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. 
“And I view that alliance with the United States as particularly important,” Netanyahu told Al Arabiya English in an interview. 
Consecutive US administrations have voiced their “ironclad” commitment to the security of Israel, but cracks have appeared in recent years as divisions over Iran have led to increased US criticism of Israeli policies towards Palestinians.

Antonio Graceffo, Modern Diplomacy: Analysis of U.S. Ability to Counter the Russian Threat in the Arctic 
From the end of World War II until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States and Russia stood on opposing sides of a potential conflict. Through the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war, mutual destruction was avoided, and the spread of communism was held back. Eventually, economic pressure, partially caused by the arms race and partially deriving from the fallacy of communist economics, destroyed the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, it was replaced with the new Russia, which has similar expansionist goals. 
In Europe, the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war are once again being played out, in Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies, the EU and NATO, are supporting the defense of a sovereign nation which has been invaded by Russia. Meanwhile, Russia has other ambitions which could pose a threat to U.S. ambitions.

WNU Editor: According to the above analysis. Even though Russia borders much of the Arctic, and that they have put the time, resources,  and investment in developing their part of the Arctic for as long as anyone can remember, this should be considered by the US and its allies a threat. 
The conclusions of the above analysis also do not make sense. Its prediction that the Russian economy will collapse if their banks are kicked out of SWIFT have not happened. In fact the opposite has happened, and the Russian ruble is now more stronger than it was before the war.]]></summary>

Russian Armed Forces have deployed its rare arctic version of the Tor surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine.  
The Russian Ministry of Defense’s Zvezda TV channel shared footage showing the Tor-M2DT air defense system.  The missile launcher has the letter “V” written on its side, which is the letter written on Russian military vehicles that invaded Ukraine.

WNU Editor: The Tor-M2DT air defense system has been active in the Ukraine conflict since the summer .... Russian TOR-M2 air defense missile system shows high efficiency against Ukrainian drones (Army Recognition).

"Spinning together a counternarrative for tens of millions of viewers, Russian propagandists plucked clips from American cable news, right-wing social media and Chinese officials. They latched onto claims that Western embargoes of Russian oil would be self-defeating, that the United States was hiding secret bioweapon research labs in Ukraine and that China was a loyal ally against a fragmenting West," reported Paul Mozur, Adam Satariano, and Aaron Krolik.

CNN: Jill Biden makes a tidal shift from her thoughts on another run at the White House 
First lady Jill Biden, despite being so worn out from a recent circuit of White House events that she lost her voice, is now seriously looking ahead to her husband running for reelection in 2024. That’s a tidal shift from her position just three months ago. 
Seven people familiar with Biden’s thinking told CNN that her private conversations about another run now match her publicly enthusiastic persona, as well as the sentiments of President Joe Biden. 
The first lady was still mostly skeptical as of early fall – “not a proponent,” as one person familiar with her thinking told CNN. But in the month since the November midterm elections, in which Democrats defied the fate of most parties of first-term presidents, friends noted a change. 
Jill Biden is now “all in” on the idea, according to a person who works with the East Wing.

Now Eleusis -- known to Greeks as Elefsina -- aims to resurrect its flagging fortunes by becoming European capital of culture next year.
Roman emperors including Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus -- of "Gladiator" fame -- were among the glitterati of antiquity who came to be initiated into its secret death-defying cult based around Persephone, the queen of the netherworld.
But Eleusis long ago lost its glamour.
Its grim factories, steelmills, refineries and ship and breaker yards drew thousands fleeing the poverty of rural Greece over the last century.
Choked by smog and pollution, its bay a vast ships' graveyard, for decades it resembled a modern version of the underworld from which…]]></summary>

Up to 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are holding a one-day stoppage from 0800 to 2000 GMT after rejecting a government pay offer.
Ameera, a senior nurse in London, told AFP that "we have not chosen industrial action lightly". The strike is the first in the Royal College of Nursing union's 106-year history.
"We're tired. We're fed up," added the nurse, who asked that her last name not be reported. "We need a pay rise now to make a living."
The UK is currently grappling with a cost-of-living crisis as spiraling inflation outstrips wage growth.

Harry, 38, and his wife Meghan, 41, have lifted the lid on their experiences in the institution in the new series, risking a further rift with his family.
As young boys, the brothers provided the enduring image from their mother Princess Diana's funeral, walking behind her coffin.
But they are reportedly now no longer on speaking terms since Harry and Meghan -- also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- left for North America, settling in California.
In the final three episodes of "Harry & Meghan", Harry recalled a family summit in January 2020 over their plans to move abroad.

Several satirical outlets mimic legitimate media websites, often sowing confusion among readers with what appear to be typical news articles but are in fact fabricated stories.

(Reuters) -Tesla boss Elon Musk disclosed another $3.6 billion in stock sales on Wednesday, taking his total near $40 billion this year and frustrating investors as the company's shares wallow at two-year lows.
A U.S securities filing showed he unloaded 22 million shares in the world's most valuable carmaker over three days from Monday to Wednesday.
The sale is the second big chunk of stock he has cashed out since his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October. It isn't clear if the sales are related to the Twitter acquisition, but they are annoying investors who are upset by a perception he is diverting his focus and resources to Twitter ahead of Tesla.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the FBI arrested Alexey Brayman, a resident of Merrimack, New Hampshire who was using his Etsy craft store as a front to run a weapons-smuggling ring to the Kremlin.
Speaking to CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) emphasized that this operation is a sign of how dire a toll the global sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine is taking on their ability to procure weapons for their military.
"So, congressman, I do want to ask you about ... this Russian smuggling, Russian weapons smuggling ring here in the United States," said Burnett. "What does this tell you about Putin? I mean, why he would even be doing this, that he's going to such lengths to do something like this?"
"First, I would say that this is not unusual," said Himes. "For decades — for generations — we've been facing Chinese, Russian, other efforts to get our equipment. Your correspondent is exactly right that this is a sign of desperation, this is stuff that could ordinarily be bought on the open market by the Russian government. But it cannot be bought by the Russian government now that, of course, sanctions and prohibitions are in place."

Additionally, said Himes, "the FBI is exactly right. Obviously a guy with a trunk full of rounds, that's a guy who can assist in the creation of an awful lot of mayhem."
"But at the end of the day, there is no way in the world that you can restock, rearm, and refurbish the Russian military by guys driving cars across the border of Estonia," added Himes. "So, we need to continue to take this stuff really, really seriously. But it is a sign of desperation."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -A former Twitter Inc manager convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia by sharing user data several years ago and potentially exposing users to persecution was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison on Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors said.
Ahmad Abouammo had been found guilty by a jury in August following a trial in federal court in San Francisco.
Prosecutors had sought a prison term of just over seven years, saying they wanted a "sentence strong enough to deter others in the technology and social media industry from selling out the data of vulnerable users." Abouammo faced a maximum penalty of decades in prison.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Many of the hundreds of migrants who crossed the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez into El Paso this week were part of a group kidnapped in Mexico as they made their way to the United States, according to nine migrants interviewed by Reuters.
Testimony from the nine migrants suggests there were multiple kidnappings across several days in the northern state of Durango, with people taken to at least two main locations and held against their will while ransoms were demanded.
The kidnappings are a stark reminder of the dangers faced by migrants as they travel across Mexico, crisscrossing areas rife with drug violence and weak rule of law.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru's defense minister announced a nationwide state of emergency on Wednesday, which will take effect in the next few hours and allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public safety after a week of fiery protests and road blockades.
The protests were sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo on Dec. 7 in an impeachment vote. Castillo, a leftist elected in 2021, was arrested after illegally trying to dissolve the Andean nation's Congress, the latest in a series of political crises the world's second-largest copper producer has faced in recent years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday Russian athletes should face "complete isolation" and not be welcomed back at the 2024 Olympic Games.
Zelensky told International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach that he strongly opposed moves by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Paris Games provided they do not participate under their countries' colors or flags.
US officials said Monday there was "unanimous interest" among delegates to an IOC summit to come up with a pathway that would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to competition.
Russia and Belarus have been isolated from international sport ever since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.
However, Zelensky blasted the American moves, claiming that "since February, 184 Ukrainian athletes have died as a result of Russia's actions".
Zelensky told Bach he was disappointed with the presence of the president of the Russian Olympic Committee at the IOC summit on November 9
"One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored," he said in a statement.
Zelensky added that the only response is "the complete isolation of the terrorist state on the international stage. In particular, this applies to international sports events."
At this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country's Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.
However many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.

Following a campaign led by the United States, 29 members of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) voted to expel the Islamic republic from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW) for the remainder of its 2022-2026 term.
Eight countries voted against and 16 abstained. A simple majority was needed to adopt the move, which had been proposed by the United States.
The resolution says it strips Iran of its membership of the commission with immediate effect.
The text says the Iranian leadership "continuously undermine and increasingly suppress the human rights of women and girls, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine has announced that another American has been freed as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that a retired U.S. Air Force veteran Suedi Murekezi was captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine earlier this year, his family said. He has now been freed. 
"Another exchange of prisoners," tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. "We continue to return ours. 64 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, are going home. It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people - Murekez Suedi. The bodies of the 4 dead were also returned."
His brother said that Murekezi said in a call that he was being held in the Donetsk People’s Republic with two other American nationals. 
The Post report explained that a prisoner swap in September included two U.S. veterans. The latest swap adds up to 1,456 prisoners that have been released by Russia since the start of their invasion. 
"One prisoner of war told The Post he was beaten so badly that his ribs were broken and his kidneys were badly injured," the piece said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgraced crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried is being held in a jail in the Bahamas that's known for its poor conditions -- so poor that a warden described it as “not fit for humanity," the New York Post reports. 
Bankman-Fried is being held in Fox Hill Prison after failing to get bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. The prison is the only correctional facility in the region. As the Post points out, the prison was the focus of a report last year by the US Department of State which looked into possible human rights violations, including violence and abuse by staff.
“Inmates removed human waste by bucket,” the government report noted. 
“Some inmates developed bedsores from lying on bare ground,” the report said, adding that conditions included “overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care.”
“Sanitation was a general problem, and cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” the report noted. 
Bankman-Fried faces criminal charges in the United States, including securities fraud, campaign finance violations and money laundering, over the collapse of his FTX crypto exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A judge in Peru on Wednesday postponed by 24 hours a hearing to decide whether ex-president Pedro Castillo will be released from detention on charges of rebellion and conspiracy.
Castillo's arrest last week after he tried to dissolve parliament and rule by decree has sparked days of nationwide protests in which seven people have been killed.
Last week, a judge ordered Castillo to be held for seven days, and he was meant to be released on Wednesday.
However, prosecutors filed a request late Tuesday to hold him in pre-trial detention for 18 months.
Judge Juan Checkley on Wednesday postponed a hearing on the new request until Thursday after defense attorneys argued they had not received all documents from the public prosecutor.
He also ordered Castillo to remain in detention for another 48 hours.
Castillo, a leftist former school teacher, was in power for only 17 months in the South American nation that is prone to political instability and is now on its sixth president in six years.
His short period in office was marked by a power struggle with the opposition-dominated Congress, and six investigations into him and his family, mainly for corruption.
He was facing his third impeachment bid when, last Wednesday, he announced he was dissolving Congress and would rule by decree.
But lawmakers went ahead and voted to sack him and he was quickly arrested while trying to flee to the Mexican embassy and seek asylum.
Castillo's vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in as his successor, but has failed to calm tensions that have led to violent clashes between police and protestors in several parts of the country.

Former soccer player-turned-commentator Gary Lineker has been covering the World Cup in Qatar and spoke to the  “News Agents” podcast and discussed why Qatar was allowed to host the World Cup. 
“We pointed facts out at the beginning of the tournament; those facts remain. So, lots of people were killed doing the stadiums. Yes, the stadiums are extraordinary, but at a great price. Homophobia is an issue here, women’s rights are a little bit of an issue here," he said. 
“For me, it was always really more about the corruption side of it because, as I said previously, I think pretty much every country, including our own, has got issues,” he continued. “And we’re off to America in four years’ time, with Canada and Mexico, but obviously America’s an extraordinarily racist country.”

But campaigners warn that more executions will inevitably follow without tougher international action, with a dozen more people already sentenced to death over the protests and a similar number charged with crimes that could see them hanged.
