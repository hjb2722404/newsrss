        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finland’s President Sauli Niinisto has officially announced the country will apply to join NATO.

A formal membership application from Finland is expected to be submitted to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week.

The move is prompted by security fears over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The nation shares a border with Russia that stretches over 1,300 kilometres.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently warned Mr Niinisto that abandoning Finland's traditional policy of military neutrality to join NATO would be an “error”, according to a statement from the Kremlin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden has hired a "very expensive" lawyer whose "only job" is to keep him out of jail, says Curtin University political analyst Joe Siracusa.

It comes as President Biden's legal team is preparing to defend against the possibility of impeachment if Republicans gain a majority in Congress after midterm elections.

"All the analysts in America, pundits, are picking a landslide at the midterm elections in November," Professor Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

"President Biden knows they're coming for him.

"They're going after him, the kid (Hunter), they're going to go after his performance ... they're going to go after incompetence.

"Particularly, they're going to start with the departure from Kabul in Afghanistan and they're going to go to the southern border.

"Biden knows it’s coming – he hired a very expensive fellow; he's going to be called special counsel and his only job is to keep President Biden out of jail.

"He may be a little tired and sleepy sometimes, but he was smart enough to hire a first class lawyer to represent him."]]></summary>

Yesterday the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu. 
Why? 
The U.S. readout of the call says:      
 On May 13, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu for the first time since February 18. Secretary Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication. 
Austin initiated the call and the U.S. is seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine!!! 
Are we not told that the Ukraine is winning the war? That it will soon push the Russian forces back over the border? The operation to 'weaken Russia', which Austin had publicly announced two weeks ago, does not seem to go that well.

        <id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-732247599994189300.post-1650636902222306133</id>
        <link href="https://www.newsrust.com/2022/05/book-review-familia-grande-by-camille.html"/>
        <updated>2022-05-15T15:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kouchner adds, “My grandmother killed herself soon after that.”
It’s the second funeral in the book — “a militant, heartbroken crowd who’d come to pay tribute to my grandmother’s freedom to kill herself.”  The suicide leaves Camille’s mother an alcoholic shell.  She drinks herself blind every night: “This is absolutely not up for discussion.  It’s my freedom.”
The book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: “He started stroking me, and then, you know …”
From this point, the narrator’s voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a “hydra” of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.
The book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  “Let’s be clear about this,” she writes:

Article 222—31—1 of the criminal code
Rape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:
1) ascending year;
2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;
3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.

Claire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.  She lives in Paris.

THE FAMILY GRANDE, by Camille Kouchner |  Translated by Adriana Hunter |  214 p.  Other Press.  |  $24.

After 80 days of fighting that forced millions from their homes, wreaked havoc on towns and villages in eastern Ukraine, and killed tens of thousands, the group has won an emotional victory for Ukraine with a performance of “Stephanie», a catchy and anthemic song.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mr. Chayefsky “was very charming and he was very funny about some of the people he saw,” Mr. Wald told Dave Itzkoff for his book. “Crazy as hell: The creation of ‘Network’ and the fateful sight of the most angry man in cinema” (2014).  “Which led me to believe he wasn’t going to treat them kindly.”
Mr. Wald resigned from NBC News in 1977 after disputes with senior network management over issues such as signing exclusive and expensive contracts with former President Gerald R. Ford;  his wife, Betty;  and Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, to appear on NBC News specials.
Although he approved the signings at the time, he later felt that the fees paid resulted in cuts to his budget for special features and documentaries, The New York Times reported at the time.
After leaving NBC, Mr. Wald consulted with PBS on the future of public television newsgathering and served for three months as a special assistant to Otis Chandlereditor of the Los Angeles Times.
When Mr. Arledge recruited him to join ABC News in 1978, Mr. Wald had to adjust to the culture there, especially at the Washington bureau, which did not welcome him happily.
“If you think we need a guy from NBC to help us, you’re wrong,” Frank Reynoldsone of three anchors on ABC’s “World News Tonight,” said, according to Mr. Arledge’s memoir.
Mr. Wald adapted and stayed for 21 years.
In addition to his sons Matthew, a former New York Times reporter, and Jonathan, a former “Today” and “NBC Nightly News” executive producer, Mr. Wald, who lived in Larchmont, NY, is survived by one daughter, Elizabeth. Wald;  seven grandchildren;  and a great-grandson.  His wife, Edith (Leslie) Wald, died in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency prices also fell precipitously.  The price of bitcoin fell to $26,000 on Thursday, down 60% from its peak in November, before rising somewhat.  Since the start of the year, Bitcoin’s price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark heavily weighted towards tech stocks, suggesting that investors are treating it like any other risky asset.
Ether’s price has also fallen, losing over 30% of its value over the past week.  Other cryptocurrencies, like Solana and Cardano, are also down.
Any panic could be overdone, some analysts said.  A study by Mizuho showed that the average owner of Bitcoin on Coinbase would not lose money until the price of the digital currency fell below $21,000.  This, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a real death spiral could occur.
“Bitcoin worked as long as nobody lost money,” he said.  “Once it gets back to those levels, it’s kind of an ‘Oh, my God’ moment.”
Professional investors who weathered the volatility in crypto also remained calm.  Hunter Horsley, managing director of Bitwise Asset Management, which provides crypto investment services to 1,000 financial advisers, met with more than 70 of them this week to discuss the market.  Many weren’t selling, he said, because all other assets were down as well.  Some were even trying to capitalize on the decline.
“Their point of view is, ‘It’s not fun, but there’s nowhere to hide,'” he said.
Still, the price crash has rattled crypto traders.  Just a few months ago, blockchain proponents predicted that Bitcoin’s price could hit $100,000 this year.

Daily Mail: US Navy scraps NINE anti-submarine warships that cost $3.2 billion to make - some under three years old - because their technology is already obsolete

The US Navy will scrap nine warships worth $3.2 billion - despite some being just three years old - because their technology is already obsolete. 
Anti-submarine systems on the Freedom-class combat warships, four of which were commissioned in 2019 and 2020, 'did not work out technically', the Navy's operations chief said. 
Admiral Michael Gilday asked Congress to sign off on the scrapping, which will save the Navy $391 million.

But that’s not the only factor at play: a study published Wednesday confirms that, for the frequency of hurricanes, the effects of particulate air pollution are even more important.

During the same period, increased pollution from the growing economies of India and China had the opposite effect, reducing hurricane activity in the western North Pacific, according to the study.

19FortyFive: Forget Retirement: The A-10 Warthog Can Kill Tanks with ‘Reactive’ Armor 
The A-10C Thunderbolt II Just Became Even More Deadly – The Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt II was tailor-made for close-air support, and with its unique GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm (1.18-inch) cannon, it has proved to be among the most effective anti-tank aircraft ever devised. Earlier this year, the United States Air Force demonstrated how the aircraft, which has also earned the nickname “Warthog” among its pilots, is able to knock out modern tanks equipped with armor improvements. 
The first-ever tests were conducted at the Nevada Test and Training Range, February 14-25, 2022 – and the 422nd and 59th Test and Evaluation Squadrons successfully proved that modern-day armored vehicles equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor were still vulnerable to the A-10C Thunderbolt II’s GAU-8 Avenger.

Whenever our son is on rotation in the US military, we keep his golden retriever.  Our original lease gave us permission to do this, but it expired years ago and we have had a monthly agreement ever since.  We are again in the process of keeping dogs.  The other day the landlord told me that the building only allowed dogs under 20 pounds, even though our original lease didn’t include weight restrictions.  (Other tenants in the building have dogs, although theirs are smaller than ours.) The landlord then told me that we could move out at any time.  Can he really deport us?

Navy Times: Navy hush-hush after secret boat’s unexplained sinking  
A Navy vessel sank under unclear circumstances, at an undisclosed location, while testing out some secretive technology last December — and that’s about all the sea service will say on the subject. 
The vessel’s name and the nature of the technology tests were not disclosed, though officials did say it took on water and sank while moored. 
That’s the extent of information made public by the Navy regarding the Dec. 7 Class A mishap, the highest mishap category, denoting damages of at least $2.5 million.

Business Insider: US special-operations leaders are figuring out what skills to bring with them into 'the 5th modern era' of special ops 
* US special operators are shifting focus to great-power competition after 20 years of counterterrorism. 
* Special-ops leaders told lawmakers in April that in a new era they will focus on an old skill: supporting conventional forces. 
During a Senate hearing at the end of April, US special-operations leaders provided insight into how the US special-operations community is gearing up for future challenges. 
Near-peer adversaries — mainly China, but also Russia — are the primary threats to US national security, and the US military, including US Special Operations Command, is adjusting accordingly. 
When asked how the shift from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations to great-power competition is affecting their planning and investment decisions, the commanders emphasized a shift to supporting operations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“With privacy, it’s like once it’s out, it’s out,” Professor Meiklejohn said.
Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, a physician and director of Women on Waves, a nonprofit that provides resources for abortion seekers, found this to be the case when she tried to create her own crypto wallet.  “It had the exact same due diligence demands as a normal bank account, where you have to provide ID and other information,” she said.
She could see how anonymous transactions could attract abortion providers, whose work could soon turn them into legal targets.  But, she says, “I haven’t found any cryptocurrency where you can do that.”
Lawyers are not convinced that cryptocurrencies would protect patients in most cases.  Abortion bans “will cover everything whether you pay in cash or crypto,” said Rachel Rebouché, acting dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law and author of a forthcoming paper titled “The New Abortion Battleground.”
“If abortion is illegal in your state — it doesn’t matter if you have a surgical abortion, a medical abortion, whether you self-manage your abortion — if it’s illegal, it’s illegal,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School which focused on reproductive rights.  (In the first three months of this year, 22 states introduced more than 100 restrictions on abortion pills approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.)
Still, organizations like Planned Parenthood are keeping an open mind about how they might raise and distribute funds.
Alexis McGill Johnson, the organization’s president and CEO, said Planned Parenthood was “looking into a number of things” in the cryptocurrency space, but would not divulge specifics.
“At the end of the day, all options are on the table,” she said.

Why exactly mother octopuses engage in a form of self-harm that leads to death right after breeding remains a mystery.  But a study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology uses the California two-spotted octopus as a model to help explain the physiology of this strange behavior.
Z. Yan Wang, assistant professor of psychology and biology at the University of Washington and author of the study, explained that the female of the species goes through three stages of reproduction.
After mating, the mother produces her eggs and handles them with care.  She takes each egg, one at a time, carefully threading them into long strands.  Then she cements them to…]]></summary>

After that, Wednesdays became their regular fixture at the Mean Eyed Cat.  They also started taking the kids on regular outings — to the park’s wading pool, picnics or the pool at Ms. Thompson’s apartment complex just outside Austin.
In mid-July 2019, “we made the relationship official,” Ms Thompson said.
In December, they broke up for about a month, the first of three breakups.  “Jeni needed some space, but we were still in touch,” Ms. Thompson said.
Ms Pandolfi said: ‘I’m a typical non-committal person.
“But I didn’t want to lose her,” she added.
The following year, after a week-long breakup in June 2020, the two received another set of tattoos in October featuring their and their children’s birth month flowers: Ms. Pandolfi included roses, for her and Beau, and Mrs. Thompson included thrush.  , for Juniper, and concern for herself.
She proposed to Ms. Pandolfi weeks later, on November 11, 2020, at a local Airbnb – a converted garage where Ms. Thompson set up battery-powered candles, red wine and charcuterie.
In 2021, after a breakup from February to June, Ms Pandolfi proposed on November 11, a year to the day after Ms Thompson had proposed to her.  At the Sekrit Theater, an Austin event space, Ms. Pandolfi had arranged a marquee inside a greenhouse to read, “Marry me.”

He was 92 years old.
His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his son Dennis, the president of Cakebread Cellars.
Mr. Cakebread, an auto mechanic with a sideline in photography, was returning from filming in northern Napa County when in 1972 he visited a couple of family friends at their farm in Rutherford.  He was 42 and only vaguely curious about what a life beyond car repair might be like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time when the Boston Celtics’ season seemed in danger of crumbling into a pile of fine dust.  They had a losing record at the end of January.  They were battling a series of injuries.  There were questions about whether Jayson Tatum could co-exist with Jaylen Brown – was it time for the team to consider trading Brown?  — as well as the inevitable criticisms of Ime Udoka in his first season as a coach.
It’s a familiar story at this late stage of the season, but one worth repeating, especially now.  Why?  Because Friday night, following a late-game meltdown earlier in the week, the Celtics faced elimination in Milwaukee.  Outside their cocoon, as they prepared for Game 6, the questions swirled: Did they miss their chance?  Could they somehow find the resolve to extend their Easte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I think the playoffs can sometimes reveal who you are, what kind of character you have,” Kreider said.  “For him to stay with his game and keep working, he’s been a huge, huge leader for us all year.  He was an absolute horse.
The Rangers trailed 2-0 after one period and the Penguins, playing without Sidney Crosby, their star center and captain, were 40 minutes away from qualifying for the second round.  But Zibanejad scored two one-time slapshots in 76 seconds to tie the game.
“There is no giving up,” Zibanejad said of the comeback.  “That’s what I love about this team.”
A few minutes later, there was another crazy breakaway.  The game started when Rangers keeper Igor Shesterkin took advantage of a poor Penguins line change and delivered a perfect 100-foot pass on Zibanejad’s stick.  Zibanejad was alone again.
“His passing is better than all of us sometimes,” Zibanejad said of Shesterkin’s stickwork.
penguin keeper Louis Domingue made the initial save on Zibanejad, but Kreider was there with his teammate, and he slammed the rebound to put Rangers ahead, 3-2.  If that sounds like the Game 5 scoring pattern at Madison Square Garden, it was, and would continue, until the last goal in an empty New York net at the end.
Evgeni Malkin scored for the Penguins to even things up, 3-3, on a breakaway late in the second period.  The game remained tied until just 1:28 remained.  Kreider then fired a high slap shot which Domingue saved in front of his chest, but the puck spun over his head and landed behind him and into the net.
“Nobody said it was going to be easy,” Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said.  “They are a very good team. They have a lot of talented players who can score goals.

Given Manny Machado’s torrid start for the San Diego Padres this season, it would be predictable to joke that the five-time All-Star plays chess while his peers play checkers.  But in Machado’s case, it’s also true: when he’s not beating opposing pitchers and stealing hits with acrobatic defensive plays, Machado can be found keeping his mind sharp with contemplation. calm on a chessboard.
“Chess is interesting,” said Machado, who learned the game from former Orioles player and manager Brady Anderson in Baltimore in 2017. “It’s something you can’t just play. anticipate what …]]></summary>

In the broader discipline of trail running – which includes everything from 100-mile ultramarathons to ultra-steep kilometer races – he is also part of the pantheon of all-time greats, as a four-time world champion and four-time winner at Pikes Peak Ascent, one of the toughest races in the country.
Gray’s specialty, mountain running – a type of running at higher altitudes, with difficult, technical surfaces, and considerable elevation gain and loss – is still a niche sport.  But trail running as a whole is booming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delaware State University is a historically black university, and about 70% of the team members are black, according to its coach, Pamella Jenkins.
The team bus was returning to Delaware from a game in Florida on the morning of April 20 when Georgia police arrested the bus driver, Ms Jenkins said in an interview.  The driver stopped on a freeway off-ramp, she said, and an officer boarded, saying the bus was mistakenly driving in the left lane.
Within five minutes, she said, one of the student-athletes drew attention to officers pulling backpacks, team duffel bags and other belongings from under the bus. – for inspection by a drug-sniffing dog.  Then two officers boarded the bus announcing a drug search in an interaction that Ms Jenkins, who is black, described as “racially motivated”.
“When he raised narcotic dogs, the first thing he went to was marijuana, which is stereotypically associated with African Americans,” Ms Jenkins said.  She added that the officer had an “accusatory tone: he was not asking”.
When a student asked how the routine traffic stop turned into a drug search, she said, an officer replied that charter buses on this section of the highway were known to drug and human trafficking.  Although nervous and scared, Ms Jenkins said she tried to stay calm, as students gathered by the window to look outside and others sat in shock.  She said she feared a single bad word could inflame the situation.
The university’s student newspaper, the hornet, published an article on traffic control by Sydney Anderson, a member of the team.  Ms Anderson and the other team members did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Ms Anderson wrote in the article that the police tried to get the players to admit they had drugs, and she accused them of carrying out an unlawful search without probable cause.  She said “the majority of the team members had never encountered the police, which made this a traumatic incident for them”.

One day you’re fine, and the next morning you’re completely swallowed up and have no choice but to pull through. 

For those of you who are vaccinated, just know that Samuels was a self-proclaimed relationship guru who started his own YouTube channel in 2014. He hosted a phone show in which he offered advice, but the advice was often harsh criticism of the caller’s appearance, or worse. 

It came viral in 2020    when a woman who called her told her she was no longer interested in dating below her pay grade.  She said she owned a business and noted that men who didn’t earn at or above her level tended to want to get into her business (both figuratively and literally).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judge Thomas said the left had tactics adopted that the Conservatives would not use.
“You would never visit Supreme Court justices’ homes when things weren’t going our way,” he said.  “We didn’t throw tantrums.  It is our responsibility to always act appropriately and not give up.
He added that conservatives had “never trashed a Supreme Court nominee”.  He acknowledged that Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, “didn’t get a hearing, but he didn’t get trashed.”
“You won’t see the total destruction of just one candidate,” Judge Thomas said.  “You also won’t see people going to other people’s houses, attacking them while dining out, throwing things at them.”
He said Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh had been the victim of particular abuse, but he only made a cursory reference to his own brutal confirmation hearings, during which he angrily denied the accusations of sexual harassment.
Taking sides on a disputed point, Judge Thomas said the Senate Republicans who blocked Mr. Garland’s nomination were following a rule that then-Senator President Biden proposed, “which is to say you get no audience in the last year of an administration.”
Judge Thomas, the most senior member of the current court, was a fierce opponent of Roe.
On Friday, he said opposition to his nomination in 1991 was “by these people who were trying to get me out of court because of an abortion.”
During his confirmation hearings, however, he said, to the astonishment of many, that he never discussed Roe, even though it was published while a student at law school in Yale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in New Delhi arrested two people suspected of flouting fire safety regulations on Saturday after at least 27 people died in a blaze at a building housing a manufacturing unit for surveillance cameras.
Rescue teams worked overnight to clear the burnt out four-storey building near a railway station in the western suburbs.
More than 75 people were in the building when the fire broke out on Friday evening. Some jumped from windows to save themselves, according to eyewitnesses, and firefighters broke the glass and rescued people with ropes.
Authorities said fire started in an office on the first floor and spread rapidly. Two owners of the company were arrested as part of probe to identify suspected safety violations.
Offering condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 200,000 rupees ($2,580) in compensation for the victims' next-of-kin.

Ukrainian hopes of being able to repurpose frozen Russian assets to pay for war damage were dashed on Saturday as Germany's foreign minister highlighted the hurdles to such an approach.
Ukrainian officials have pushed for weeks for frozen Russian assets to be transferred to Kiev, to cover the costs of repairing destruction caused by Russia's invasion or even to pay for Ukraine's defence efforts.
But German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at the end of a G7 foreign ministers' conference she hosted, said there were multiple problems with such an approach.
"Gaining access to frozen money is legally ... anything but easy," she said. She noted that there could be sound reasons to attempt such an act, but noted that they had to be aligned with the law.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had again proposed the idea at the session held on the Baltic coast.
"We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe," he said, arguing that Russia should be forced to pay for the war, not only in political or economic terms, but also financially.
Beyond legal issues, many European leaders fear attempts to liquidate and transfer Russian funds will lead to countries like Russia and China seeking to set up an alternative international financial system, which would make sanctions a weaker tool in the future.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Saturday the spread of COVID-19 had thrust his country into "great turmoil" and called for an all-out battle to overcome the outbreak, as 21 daily deaths were reported among people with fever.
North Korea this week acknowledged for the first time a COVID outbreak, imposing a nationwide lockdown. But there was no sign of a rigorous testing or treatment campaign in the isolated country's rudimentary healthcare system.
"The spread of the malignant epidemic is a great turmoil to fall on our country since the founding," Kim told an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, according to state news agency KCNA.

And yet, beyond death and destruction, another outcome is very likely and potentially tragic; namely, a renewed call for more and “better” nuclear weapons.
The claim is already being made that if Ukraine hadn’t given up its nuclear weapons in the mid-1990s, Putin would not have attacked that country. Nukes, we are told, would have deterred him, and so, we should cast our lot — even more than at present — with nuclear weapons so as to deter would-be aggressors.
History argues otherwise, namely, that nuclear weapons do not prevent wars…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates' de facto leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan was elected president of the Gulf Arab state by a federal supreme council on Saturday, solidifying his rule over the OPEC oil producer and key regional player.
The council, which groups the rulers of the seven emirates of the UAE federation, elected Sheikh Mohammed, known as MbZ, a day after the death of his half-brother, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, who was also ruler of Abu Dhabi.
"We congratulate him and pledge allegiance to him as do our people...and the entire country will follow his leadership to glory," Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also UAE vice-president and premier, said in a Twitter post.
MbZ, 61, had already been wielding power for years in a period when Sheikh Khalifa suffered bouts of illness, including a stroke in 2014.
He becomes president at a time when the UAE's long-standing ties with the United States have been visibly strained over perceived U.S. disengagement from its Gulf allies' security concerns.
MbZ led a realignment of the Middle East that created a new anti-Iran axis with Israel. He also bolstered the military might of the UAE which, coupled with its oil wealth and business hub status, extended Emirati influence in the region and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Russia CUTS electricity to Finland: Moscow-run state energy company says it will stop supplying Helsinki tomorrow over 'payment issues' amid tensions over NATO 
* RAO Nordic has said it will suspend its electricity import to Finland from May 14 
* The supplier firm is a subsidiary of Russian state energy holding Inter RAO 
* This is due to RAO Nordic not being able to pay for imported electricity, it said 
* Blamed suspension on not having received payments for electricity sold in May 
Finland was preparing for Russia to cut off electricity supplies early today due to its failure to pay the provider. 
Russian state-owned power firm Inter RAO will stop exports because it has not been paid for energy sold via the pan-European exchange Nord Pool since May 6. 
No reason was given for the non-payment. 
It comes as Finland prepares for Moscow to cut gas supplies in retaliation for the country making moves to join Nato.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During her last week as press officer, Jen Psaki sold the legend that Joe Biden coined the term “ultra-MAGA” because he wanted to put “a little more pop” on his burns.  But new reports suggest it’s branding concocted by a committee over a period of months.  Or just borrowed.
Like “Big Lie” or “Don’t Say Gay” over the past two years, the phrase “ultra-MAGA” – along with descriptors like “extreme MAGA” and more – has gone straight from the lips of Democrats to media ears and pens.  It became ubiquitous seemingly overnight after President Biden first said it aloud on May 4.
“Let me tell you about this ultra-MAGA agenda.  It’s extreme — as are most MAGA things,” Biden said in a fiery speech on the Supreme Court’s leaked draft opinion.  “This MAGA mob is truly the most extreme political organiz…]]></summary>

Instead of pushing when my cervix was fully dilated, I froze.  For the next three hours, my daughter was crowned.  As the top of her baby-sized head protruded two inches from my torn vagina, I vaguely remember the obstetrician, who seemed to be standing at the end of a dark, dis…]]></summary>

And he urged local leaders to keep the money flowing.
“My message is clear: Spend this money,” Biden told the Rose Garden.  “Do it quickly before the summer, when crime rates typically spike.”
As Republicans take advantage of rising violent crime to portray the White House as weak on law and order, Mr Biden is scrambling to show he is a strong advocate for policing ahead of the midterm elections in Congress in November.
But the timing of his remarks, just two weeks before the second anniversary of the killing of George Floyd by a police officer, has also frustrated progress…]]></summary>

Niko Omilana, who received 49,628 votes and finished in fifth place in London's 2021 mayoral race, traveled to Harrison, Arkansas — which he described as "America's most racist town."
In a local Walmart, Omilana was told that Thomas Robb was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Police then asked him to leave the store.
Omilana set up an interview with the man by saying it was for "BBC" and asked him to give a shout-out to supporters of the KKK in the United Kingdom who voiced excitement for the interview on social media.

					Amid new claims by Moscow of a covert biological weapons programme in Ukraine, the Director of Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) affirmed on Friday that the UN is not aware of any such programme and has neither the mandate nor the technical operational capacity to investigate it - a message first delivered to the Security Council on 11 and 18 March, by High Representative Izumi Nakamitsu.

        <updated>2022-05-13T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The daughter of a GM die-maker, Ms Barra, 60, grew up in Royal Oak, Michigan, and started working at a GM plant as an intern at 18 while studying electrical engineering at technical college of business, now called Kettering University.  Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a master’s degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.
In January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.
In a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.
Removing loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years “helped change the mindset,” she said.  “The whole company kind of said, ‘Well, it’s a new day.  “”
GM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.
Along the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Maritime traffic to and from Russia has remained relatively heavy in recent months as companies rush to fulfill contracts to purchase energy and other assets before the full force of global sanctions does not come into force.
With the European Union about to introduce a ban on Russian oil in the coming months, this situation could change significantly.  But the data so far shows that while trade with Russia has been reduced in many cases, it has not yet been crippled.
Crude and petroleum product volumes shipped from Russian ports, for example, soared to 25 million metric tons in April, according to data from shipping tracker Refinitiv, from around 24 million metric tons in December, January, February and March, and mostly above the levels of the past two years.

The number of container ships, tankers and bulk carriers – the three main types of ships that transport energy and consumer products – arriving and leaving Russian ports fell by around 23% in March and April compared to the previous year.
“The reality is that the sanctions haven’t been that hard to get around,” said Georgios Hatzimanolis, who analyzes global shipping for MarineTraffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This includes using observational data and two sets of computer simulations, one that models the world as it is, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than it is. was before widespread emissions began in the late 19th century, and a hypothetical world in which global warming never occurred.
The conclusion that the likelihood of such an extreme rain event has increased with global warming is consistent with many other studies of individual events and larger trends.  One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.
The study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.
Among these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.
The researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durban’s population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.
“Once again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,” said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.

(CNN)US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his Russian counterpart for the first time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon announced on Friday. 
The call lasted approximately an hour and was at the request of Austin, who used the first call between the two in 84 days to urge Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to implement an "immediate ceasefire," according to a brief readout of the call. 
The two last spoke on February 18, a week before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.  It ends an extended period in which Russia's top military leaders repeatedly refused to speak with their American counterparts.

Bitcoin is the premier cryptocurrency and its value accounts for the lion's share of the whole sector.
This week, its price at one stage plummeted to $25,500 -- less than half of its record price in November last year and the lowest valuation since it exploded at the end of 2020.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the two countries to reconsider NATO membership.
 Finland and Sweden are on the verge of seeking membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a historic shift for two traditionally non-aligned countries and a major expansion of the Western alliance as war wages in Europe.
On Thursday, Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin strongly backed Finland’s NATO membership. “NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security,” they said in a joint statement. “As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense al…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Already one of the most unusual corporate takeover attempts in modern business, Elon Musk’s $44 billion bid to buy Twitter got a little weirder on Friday.
First, in a pre-dawn tweet, Mr Musk said the deal was on hold.  He said he wanted more details about the volume of spam and fake accounts on the platform. 
Then, about two hours later, Mr. Musk tweeted again.  He was “still committed” to the acquisition, he said, without giving further details. 
The seemingly conflicting messages left many wondering if Mr. Musk had cold feet, was trying to drive down the acquisition price, or was looking for some attention.  Maybe it was a combination of all three.  Twitter shares yo-yoed in response to his posts.


As with many things involving Mr. Musk, it was difficult to know his thinking.  He did no…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dr Özel said the new image’s similarity to that of 2019 demonstrated that the previous image was no coincidence.  In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  “The similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,” said Dr Galison.
At Thursday’s press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, “This is an extraordinary verification of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. “
Einstein’s Bad Dream
Black holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.
Einstein’s insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.
Einstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.
But there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still don’t understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.
Paradoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials – gas, dust, jagged stars – falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.

"Secretary Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication," the Pentagon said in a statement.
The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the call, saying the two sides discussed current international security issues, "including the situation in Ukraine."

ABC News Australia: Defence Minister Peter Dutton says a Chinese spy ship has been seen near secretive naval facility off Western Australia  
A high-tech Chinese surveillance ship has been tracked off the West Australian coast, close to a secretive naval communications base that supports American and other allied submarines. 
Defence Minister Peter Dutton has revealed the auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) vessel was closely monitored by the ADF as it sailed past the Harold E Holt naval station at Exmouth. 
Mr Dutton said Australia had been tracking the spy ship in the past "week or so" but didn't put an exact date on the surveillance. 
"Its intent, of course, is to collect intelligence right along the coastline," he said.

Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist and WNBA champion, was detained at Moscow airport in February on charges of carrying in her luggage vape cartridges with cannabis oil, which could carry a 10-year prison sentence.
A court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow extended Griner's arrest until June 18, state news agency TASS reported, citing a court representative.
Griner's detention came days before Russia defied US warnings and sent troops into Ukraine, prompting Western powers to impose sweeping sanctions and send military aid to Kyiv.

Unclear whether modifications reflect change in US stance on 'one China' policy, Taiwan sovereignty 
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. State Department last week changed the wording on its U.S.-Taiwan relations page to delete reference to Taiwan as being part of China and removed a statement disavowing Taiwan independence.

Joint Communique severing ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, acknowledged the "Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China." 
The fact sheet was dated Aug. 31, 2018 during the Trump administration.

Washington (CNN)The US intelligence community is carrying out a sweeping internal review of how it assesses the fighting power of foreign militaries amid mounting pressure from key lawmakers on Capitol Hill who say officials have failed twice in one year on the two major foreign policy crises faced by the Biden administration in Ukraine and Afghanistan.

"We must find an agreement," Zelenskyy said in an interview with an Italian media outlet as deadly ground fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continues to intensify.
"Every day the war continues, the risk of its spreading grows."
Ukrainian and Western officials claimed Friday that Russian troops have begun pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as Moscow focuses its assault on the eastern part of the country.

Masked police officers faced scores of flag-waving and chanting Palestinians in the compound of St. Joseph's Hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, television footage showed.
Officers then charged the crowd and at one point the group carrying her coffin backed against a wall and almost dropped the casket, recovering it just before one end hit the ground.
The violent scenes underlined the growing anger over Abu Akleh's killing which has threatened to add further fuel to an already raging conflict.

* NATO ascension for a new member state requires consensus approval from all existing members. 
* Turkey joined NATO in 1952, and has the second-largest military in the 30-member alliance after the United States. 
* Finland's leaders on Thursday called for NATO membership "without delay" and neighboring Sweden is expected to follow suit. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has thrown Sweden and Finland's potential NATO membership into doubt, just as both countries are on the cusp of applying to join the alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
"We are following the developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don't hold positive views," Erdogan told press in Istanbul on Friday.

In an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s minister of foreign affairs and European integration, "called on the United States and the EU to pay more attention to Moldova’s struggle, in order to maintain the economy and security of the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli forces stormed the grounds of a Jerusalem hospital Friday as the coffin containing the body of a slain journalist emerged ahead of burial, with police saying they acted against people "disrupting the public order".
TV images showed Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh's coffin nearly falling to the ground as police grabbed Palestinian flags from the crowd around the procession outside Saint Joseph's hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Israel forbids public displays of Palestinian flags and often storms individuals who hoist them at rallies or protests in the city.

A senior Palestinian figure, Hanan Ashrawi, tweeted that "savage #Israeli 'special forces' viciously attack the funeral procession bearing the coffin" of Abu Akleh as it left St. Joseph's. "The inhumanity (of) Israel is on full display", said the former top Palestine Liberation Organization official.

In a statement, police said they had held dialogue with Abu Akleh's family ahead of time in order to "enable a respectable funeral. "Unfortunately under the auspices of the funeral and taking cynical advantage of it, hundreds of people began disrupting the public order before it even began," police said.
"As the coffin was about to exit the hospital, stones began to be thrown at officers from the hospital's plaza, and the officers were forced to use riot dispersal means," the statement added. Police also released a video in which an officer, outside the hospital grounds, is addressing the crowd over a loudspeaker.
"If you don't stop these chants and (Palestinians) nationalistic songs we will have to disperse you using force and we won't let the funeral take place," the officer says in the video. Abu Akleh's coffin left the hospital grounds by vehicle and had arrived at a Jerusalem church for her funeral.
She was killed Wednesday while covering clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

As tourism in Thailand is starting up again after a long period of complicated Covid entry rules, a new water park is set to open on the popular holiday island of Phuket, in a bid to draw in much-needed visitors.
The 9-hectare Andamanda Phuket park, which has 36 slides and a 10,000-square-metre wave pool, is scheduled to open on May 22, one year later than originally planned due to the pandemic.
The name comes from the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean, where Phuket is located.
On the park's website, its operators promise visitors "a sea adventure that wanders into the tales of Thai mythology."
"I am confident that Andamanda Phuket will motivate tourists around the world to come to Thailand," said Thapanee Kiatphaibool from the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
Besides the large number of slides and other water-related attractions, there will also be daily shows, parades and performances which celebrate Thai culture as well as a 5,300-square-metre playground and a floating market.
According to estimates, the mega park cost about $127 million and operators are hoping to attract some 1 million guests over the next year.
Last year, Phuket became the first region in the country to offer quarantine-free holidays again. Since then, the number of visitors has steadily increased.
According to Phuket's tourism authority, some 3,000 to 5,000 tourists currently arrive on Thailand's largest island every day, with the industry hoping for 9,000 daily arrivals in the last quarter of 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs, took to Twitter to single out Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as the cause of delay for a $40 billion aid package to assist his country against the Russian invasion.
"We could have already started using the U.S. assistance package to more effectively save lives of Ukrainians who defend the democratic world," wrote Kuleba, noting that President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, and senators from both parties are all in favor of the assistance.
Paul alone, he wrote, has "delayed so much needed support."

We could have already started using the new U.S. assistance package to more effectively save lives of Ukrainians who defend the democratic world. @POTUS, @SecBlinken, @SenateGOP, @SenateDems and American people were in strong support, and @RandPaul delayed so much needed support.
 — Dmytro Kuleba (@Dmytro Kuleba)

The Ukrainian package, which provides both military and humanitarian aid along with $5 billion to address global food shortages caused by the disruption of Ukrainian agriculture, passed the House with broad bipartisan support, with only a handful of Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) opposing the deal.

In the Senate, however, a single senator can prevent unanimous consent to pass a bill, forcing it to go through a longer process to achieve passage.
Paul has been accused by experts of echoing Kremlin propaganda in his description of the invasion going on in Ukraine, including his suggestion that Russia is justified in acting to prevent the expansion of the NATO alliance and the territory Russia is invading is historically "part of Russia."]]></summary>

Russia’s war against Ukraine is now the hottest in the battle of Donbas. Ukraine is counterattacking in northern Kharkiv Oblast, Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces near Sievierodonetsk. And something unclear is happening near Izium. 
After a short lull in early May, the Ukrainian Army is expelling the Russians from northern Kharkiv Oblast, thus threatening the rear of the Izium Russian group of occupiers, which is attacking Sloviansk and Barvinkove ​​from the north. This can be seen on the general map of hostilities.

WNU Editor: I am not sure about the first two encirclement plans for the Donbas (see above map). I always felt the priority of the Russian and DPR military in April was to secure a land-bridge from the Donbas to Crimea. 
As for encirclement #3. That military operation is definitely in play right now.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-12T23:15:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, TechCrunch reported that Congress is asking major social media platforms to archive content showing evidence of Russian war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.
Four representatives sent letters making the request to Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.
"As TikTok booms in popularity and surpasses 1 billion users, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too," reported Amanda Silberling. "These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable."

"In particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes," said the report.
The Russian army has been accused of repeated war crimes as part of the Ukraine invasion, from the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol to the butchering of unarmed civilians in Bucha.
Russia has denied all accusations, claiming that they are only going after military targets and sticking to their discredited story they are trying to "denazify" the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a segment on CNN this Thursday, the panel discussed the day's news regarding the Jan. 6 committee's subpoenas of five House Republicans. According to CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger, one of the lawmakers subpoenaed, Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, "might actually be willing to testify." 
According to Borger, Brooks spoke at the infamous "Stop the Steal" rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot, only to later be passed over by former President Donald Trump for an endorsement in his reelection race. 
Borger also pointed out that Brooks has already publicly revealed that Trump asked him to help "rescind" the 2020 election. 
"If he's already said it publicly, why not say it to the committee?" Borger said.
