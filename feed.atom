The Biden administration currently has no plans to place conditions on the military aid it is providing to Israel, officials told CNN, despite growing calls by Democratic lawmakers and human rights organizations for the US to stop providing weapons unless Israel does more to protect civilians in Gaza. 
Speaking to Democratic donors in Washington this week, President Joe Biden acknowledged that he has had tough conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Israel’s military campaign, how Israel is losing international support, and the need for a two-state solution led by the Palestinian Authority. 
But he said even throughout those discussions, “we’re not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process. Not a single thing.”

Ukraine's efforts to garner further support in the U.S.'s private defense sector have sparked criticism, as Kyiv races to shore up Congressional backing for its fight against Moscow into the new year. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that he had met with the heads of several U.S.-based defense companies, expressing his "gratitude to every American worker who manufactures weapons that help us safeguard our people and defend our land."

WNU Editor: For the past month Ukraine President Zelensky has been pushing this idea to arms manufacturers .... Zelenskyy in US shares idea to create European defence hub in Ukraine (Ukrainska Pravda). A prediction .... there will be no European defence hub in Ukraine.

 
Update #1: This is Ukraine's wish list when it comes to weapons and arms .... Ukraine's ambitious US weapons wish list includes F-18 Hornet fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and giant transport planes (Business Insider).

 
Update #2: Sad but probably true (see below).

The grift is right in our faces. No one bothers to conceal who the real stakeholders are in the Ukraine war.

It reveals the extent of child poverty in these countries and how these cases vary from middle-to-high income countries. Titled <em>Child Poverty in the Midst of Wealth</em>, this report is the latest in the Innocenti Report Card series, which observe children’s well-being in high-income countries. Within these countries, over 69 million children were living in households earning less than 60 percent of the average national income level. Across these countries, there was a reported 8 percent decrease in poverty levels between 2014 to 2021. During this period of relative prosperity, countries took this as an opportunity to address child poverty with varying levels of success.
Of the countries assessed for this report, Slovenia, Poland, Finland and Denmark reported child poverty reduction rates that exceeded 30 percent. By contrast, higher-income countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and France, reported a high percentage of child poverty, and even saw these rates increase in recent years.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/12/12/35558">Read the full story, “The Solutions to Child Poverty Must Reach the Most Vulnerable Communities”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told reporters that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky faced off against conspiracy theories while meeting members of Congress Tuesday — including one that he used aid from the United States to buy a $75 million yacht. 
The Associated Press reported in September that a conspiracy theory broke out on social media when someone posted a YouTube video claiming "Ukrainian President Zelensky uses proxies to hide ownership of two yachts worth $75,000,000." 
The account hasn't posted any other videos. According to the BBC, the source was "very suspect" and has no other presence anywhere online. 
The company selling the yachts also confirmed to the AP that it wasn't true. 
“We can confirm that the yacht has not been sold and therefore remains for sale," the company's spokesperson, Nicci Perides, told the AP.

But the conspiracy that spread online is now apparently influencing whether or not Republicans will back Zelensky's request for funds necessary to continue fighting off Russia. 
Fox reporter Chad Pergram paraphrased Tillis saying in passing that, "It was helpful that President Zelensky focused on some of the myths around yachts being bought with the money coming from the United States."
Tillis went on to say that he and others are aware of what is happening on the ground in Ukraine and he is confident that the money is being sent properly. He cautioned that if lawmakers failed to support Ukraine, the U.S. would be spending a lot more money if they walked away from them.]]></summary>

His lawyers claim a culture of reckless law enforcement caused him grave psychological damage. Malik's co-defendants Vincent Ellerbe and James Irons also seek compensation. The convictions of all three were overturned last year due to false confessions and unreliable evidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Javier Milei's new government will on Tuesday unveil a set of emergency measures to avoid "hyperinflation" that are expected to deliver a shock to the country's ailing economy.

The Ukrainian president is facing calls for regime change 
 Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Western public has been sold the story of a Ukrainian front united in its unwavering commitment to a total military victory over Russia. Over the past few weeks, however, this narrative has started to crumble. 
Despite the failure of Ukraine’s Nato-backed counteroffensive, which is now universally accepted, Zelenskyy continues to stick to the maximalist victory-at-all-costs narrative — that Ukraine must go on fighting until it retakes every inch of lost territory, including Crimea, and that Putin should not be negotiated with.

WNU Editor: I personally think his position is secure for the next few months. He has the support of the West, and more importantly, the personal support of President Biden. Replacing him right now will be a military and political disaster for the West, and an admission that their support for Ukraine has failed.

But back in Ukraine all of my friends/contacts/and family members who have always supported Zelensky are now having doubts not only on where the war is going, but on the leadership of Zelensky. 
This is something new, and indicates to me that if the war continues to go as bad as it currently is, support for Zelensky is definitely going to be tested by the spring of 2024. Both inside Ukraine and outside.]]></summary>

The 13-day COP28 summit in the glitzy metropolis built on petrodollars has debated a historic first-ever global exit from oil, gas and coal, the main culprits in a planetary crisis of warming.
But a draft put forward on Monday by COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber, himself head of the UAE oil company, fell well short, instead presenting reductions in fossil fuels as one of several options.
Negotiators described a mood of anger and tension in talks that again ran through the night, with activists confronting delegates and island leaders saying their very existence w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A dissident doctor who became China's most outspoken AIDS campaigner was praised in her home country on Tuesday, days after she died in self-exile in the United States at age 95.
Gao Yaojie moved to New York in 2009 after years of harassment by Chinese officials believed to be nursing grudges after she exposed a cover-up of the true extent of the AIDS epidemic in central Henan province.
Asked Tuesday about the death of Gao, who dedicated her retirement to helping AIDS patients and orphans, Beijing's foreign ministry praised those who "made positive contributions to the relief and prevention" of the illness.
Chinese social media was flooded with comments paying tribute to Gao, who appeared on a list of top searches on the Baidu search engine.

        <updated>2023-12-11T17:46:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French lawmakers sent the government’s immigration bill back to the drawing board on Monday, in a surprise move that cut short debates at the lower house and dealt a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to pass laws without a majority.
Lawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far right party as well as many conservatives joined forces to reject the bill on its first day in the National Assembly, adopting a motion proposed by the Greens, which passed by just two votes.
The rejection does not mean the government needs to resign and does not signal the end of the immigration bill.
The government can now decide to send it back to the upper house, send it to a joint committee of senators and deputies to find a compromise, or pull it, which is unlikely.
It can also use special executive powers to force its adoption without a vote.
The immigration bill has been a key plank of Macron’s attempts to show he can be tougher on law and order issues while keeping France’s doors open to foreign workers who can help the French economy.
But short of a majority in parliament, he has struggled to pass a bill that has strict provisions disliked by left-wing lawmakers and more liberal aspects criticised by some conservatives and the far right.
The government has presented the bill as essential to expel foreign criminals more easily. One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.
Other provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government’s aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diamonds in the dust – a ring worth 750,000 euros ($807,000), which went missing at the luxury Ritz hotel in Paris, has been found in a vacuum cleaner.
The ring went missing on Friday and its owner suspected hotel staff of theft.
On Sunday, it was found in a vacuum cleaner bag after police launched an investigation, the Ritz said.
The hotel told AFP the ring had been found “thanks to the meticulous search work carried out by our security guards.”
“Our client is delighted with this news,” the hotel was quoted as saying.
The owner, described as a Malaysian businesswoman, went to the police on Friday after discovering that her ring, left on the table in her room, had disappeared.
On Saturday, she left Paris for London but was expected to return to the French capital to retrieve her ring, Le Parisien newspaper said.
It said the Ritz had offered her three nights’ accommodation as compensation but the businesswoman had no intention of taking advantage of the offer.

Mohammadi, who has campaigned against the compulsory wearing of the hijab and the death penalty in Iran, stopped eating on Sunday in parallel with Sunday's Nobel prize ceremony in Oslo, where she was represented by her 17-year-old twins, Ali and Kiana.
It is not known whether her hunger strike is continuing or if it was just for the day.
"As her children, we are of course extremely worried," Ali said on Monday at a press conference that followed a meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
"Maybe she is in hospital right now," his sister Kiana added.

The 46-year-old is fleeing to Spain after realising her legal rights as one of two mothers of three-year-old Arturo are no longer safe under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
"It's a nightmare," she told AFP, saying she and Christine, 42, are braced to leave friends, family and her job in Rome "because it's the only escape route".
Civil unions became legal in Italy in 2016, but the law on parental rights for same-sex couples is unclear.
Encouraged by several court rulings, local mayors have in recent years been registering both biological and non-biological parents on birth certificates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders appeared Monday to have persuaded his preferred coalition partners to keep negotiating but reportedly major "stumbling blocks" remain over his hardline anti-Islam, anti-European views.
Wilders delivered a political earthquake in the Netherlands and across Europe last month by handily winning elections and putting his PVV Freedom Party in pole position to form a government.
Unlike Britain and the United States for example, the Netherlands has a hugely fragmented political system that means no one party ever enjoys a parliamentary majority.
Wilders has struggled to convince other party leaders to join his government, as they are put off by elements of his party's manifesto seen as unconstitutional, such as banning mosques and the Koran.

The main areas of concern are the environmental issues around the surfing venue in Tahiti, the safety of the unprecedented opening ceremony on the Seine, the efficiency of public transport in the Paris region and, of course, the shadow of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- Public transport mess -
The anger and irritation that has shrouded journeys for Paris commuters over the last 18 months has spilled into the political arena.
In mid-November the city's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo declared that the transport system in the city would "not be ready" for the summer of 2024.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
