 Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Says Intercepted U.S. Drone Over Black Sea 
Russia said Saturday it scrambled an Su-30 fighter jet to "prevent a violation of the Russian state border" by a U.S. Reaper MQ-9 military drone over the Black Sea. 
"As the Russian fighter approached, the foreign reconnaissance drone performed a U-turn away from the border," the Russian Defense Ministry said. 
The ministry said the drone belonged to the U.S. Air Force.

"The Russian aircraft returned safely to its airbase, there was no violation of the border," it added. 
Incidents involving Russian and Western aircraft have multiplied over the Black Sea and Baltic Sea in recent months, as Moscow pursues its offensive in Ukraine.

Moscow may cancel its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to be on par with the US, Kommersant has reported  
Elements within the Russian government are reportedly advocating a withdrawal of Moscow’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), an international agreement to suspend all nuclear-weapons tests. The 1996 document has never come into force because some nations, including the US, have not ratified it. 
The proposed move to withdraw its ratification would be symbolic rather than practical, rendering Russia’s stance regarding CTBT as the same as the US’ stance, according to the business daily Kommersant, which reported the deliberations on Thursday. The discussion is at an early stage, news outlet also said.

Update: Press review: Moscow may pull test-ban treaty ratification and intervention risk for Niger (TASS)

 
WNU Editor: I believe there is a very real chance that the Kremlin may withdraw from the treaty. 
Russia has called upon the US to finally ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), a treaty that Washington has never ratified. There has been no response from the White House.

According to the Russian business daily Kommersant, Russian government officials have already suggested withdrawing Moscow’s ratification of the treaty to ensure that Russia is on par with Washington and to send a message to the West on their involvement in the Ukraine war. 
The eight countries that have not ratified the treaty are .... China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified the Treaty; India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it. (Wikipedia).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC News: Imran Khan: Pakistan ex-PM given three-year jail sentence 
Ex-Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for nationwide protests after he was handed a three-year jail sentence over corruption allegations. 
Mr Khan was found guilty of not declaring money earned from selling gifts he received in office. 
He denies the charges and says he will appeal. 
After the verdict, Mr Khan was taken into custody from his home in Lahore.

In a pre-recorded statement posted after the verdict, he urged supporters to fight against the ruling. 
 "I have only one appeal, don't sit at home silently," he said in a video address posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. 
"I am struggling for you and the country and your children's future," he added. 
The former cricketer-turned-politician, 70, was elected in 2018, but was ousted in a no-confidence vote last year after falling out with Pakistan's powerful military.

(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine attacked an oil tanker it said was supplying Russian forces and warned that ports, including commodity hubs, may be at risk in the latest escalation in the area around the Black Sea. 
The hull of the tanker was pierced after an attack by a sea drone in the Kerch Strait, Russia’s Federal River and Marine Transportation Agency said on Telegram. 
There were no casualties and the vessel is still afloat, the agency said. Ukraine’s state security service was responsible for the drone strike, according to a Ukrainian official familiar with the matter.

RT: Russia becomes Europe’s biggest economy – report 
The country’s GDP in PPP terms is outperforming that of Germany, according to World Economics 
Russia was among the world’s five largest economies and the largest in Europe in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) as of the end of 2022, despite Western sanctions, the latest World Economics report has revealed. 
According to estimates based on official country data published by the World Bank and the IMF, Russia's gross domestic product was $5.51 trillion in PPP terms at the end of last year. The figure is 38% larger than the official estimate of $3.993 trillion, the report noted. 
It also showed that the Russian economy was ahead of Germany’s when measured in purchasing-power parity, with the latter’s GDP at $5 trillion.

The world does not only need Russia natural resources, but it is dependent on it. Sanctions have put a break on the Russian economy, but on the plus side hundreds of billions of dollars no longer leave Russia each year. There is also the expectation that when the war is eventually over the lifting of sanctions will follow, and when that happens the economic expansion that will then follow will be massive.]]></summary>

Reuters: Exclusive: Russia doubles 2023 defense spending plan as war costs soar 
LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has doubled its 2023 defence spending target to more than $100 billion - a third of all public expenditure - a government document reviewed by Reuters showed, as the costs of the war in Ukraine spiral and place growing strain on Moscow's finances. 
The figures shed light on Russia's spending on the conflict at a time when sector-specific budget expenditure data is no longer published. 
They show that in the first half of 2023 alone, Russia spent 12%, or 600 billion roubles, more on defence than the 4.98 trillion roubles ($54 billion) it had originally targeted for 2023. 
Defence spending in the first six months of 2023 amounted to 5.59 trillion roubles, 37.3% of a total 14.97 trillion roubles spent in the period, the document showed. Russia's budget plan envisages 17.1% of total funds spent on "National Defence".

WNU Editor: I think this number is a low-ball number. I think the decision was made in August/September of last year that since a negotiated end to the war was not going to happen, the Russian economy was to be put at a war time footing. The entire country is now completely focused on the war. and I see no signs of it ending anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: CNN Poll: Majority of Americans oppose more US aid for Ukraine in war with Russia 
Most Americans oppose Congress authorizing additional funding to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, as the public splits over whether the US has already done enough to assist Ukraine. 
Overall, 55% say the US Congress should not authorize additional funding to support Ukraine vs. 45% who say Congress should authorize such funding. And 51% say that the US has already done enough to help Ukraine while 48% say it should do more. A poll conducted in the early days of the Russian invasion in late February 2022 found 62% who felt the US should have been doing more. 
Partisan divisions have widened since that poll, too, with most Democrats and Republicans now on opposing sides of questions on the US role in Ukraine.

WNU Editor. There are other surprises in this poll (link here). Here are two eye-opening poll results .... (1) 56% oppose President Biden's Russia policy. (2) 57% oppose President Biden's China policy.]]></summary>

Niger putschists said Thursday they will end military cooperation deals with France, dealing a major blow to French efforts to combat terrorism in the Sahel region.
Junta representative Amadou Abdramane late on Thursday read on national television a decision to revoke five military deals with France dating between 1977 and 2020, Reuters reported.

Newsweek: Top Russian General Leaks Number of Elite Casualties in Ukraine War 
The commander of Russia's elite airborne troops, General Colonel Mikhail Teplinsky, leaked the number of casualties sustained by his unit since President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, prompting the Kremlin to scramble to delete his announcement. 
In a video now deleted by Russia's Defense Ministry, Teplinsky, commander of the Russian Airborne Forces (the VDV), revealed on Wednesday that 8,500 Russian paratroopers have been wounded since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. 
The figure marks the highest number of casualties among a single type of military force mentioned by a Russian military official since the war began, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

1 sailor assigned to vessel in San Diego, the other based near Los Angeles 
The U.S. Department of Justice arrested two U.S. Navy sailors on national security charges relating to China on Thursday. 
It is unclear whether the two cases are connected in any way. The first sailor, a 22-year-old assigned to a vessel in San Diego, was arrested on an espionage charge relating to a conspiracy to share intelligence with a Chinese official. 
The second sailor, based near Los Angeles, is charged with conspiracy and receipt of a bribe from a Chinese official.

DOJ officials have not identified either U.S. sailor by name. 
A DOJ spokesman detailed the charges against each of the members, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Trump says he's being 'persecuted' for leading polls after pleading not guilty to January 6 charges: 'If you can't beat him, prosecute him' 
* The former president entered a not guilty plea in a federal D.C. courtroom on Thursday afternoon 
* He vented about Biden family 'bribes' as he flew in from Newark, New Jersey 
* Faces four federal charges on alleged plot to overturn the 2020 election 
Donald Trump said he's being 'persecuted' because he's leading in the polls and ripped into the 'filth' in Washington, D.C., after pleading not guilty in a federal court to four criminal charges for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 
 'When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent,' Trump said to reporters without taking questions after arriving at Reagan National Airport following his third arraignment in six months. 
'This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute them or you prosecute him. We can’t let this happen in America.'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canada's The Mining Company will seek a license next year to start mining the depths of the Pacific Ocean, with production expected to follow in 2025, according to a statement.
It posted on its website late Tuesday that its subsidiary Nauru Ocean Resources intends to submit an application to the International Seabed Authority (ISA).
"Assuming a one-year review process, NORI expects to be in production in the fourth quarter of 2025," it added.
The International Seabed Authority (ISA)'s member nations agreed in July on a two-year roadmap for the adoption of deep sea mining regulations, despite conservationists' calls for a moratorium on mineral extraction they say would avert marine threats.
The little-known global body is tasked with regulating the vast ocean floor.
Some countries want to hurry up and begin retrieving rock-like "nodules" scattered across the seafloor, which contain minerals important to battery production such as nickel, cobalt and copper.
But NGOs and scientists say that trawling the deep seas could destroy habitats and species that may still be unknown or potentially vital to ecosystems.

The Mining Company and others are eyeing an abyssal plain stretching between Hawaii and Mexico, known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), for the nodules.
Its chief executive Gerard Barron said the timeline it has laid out "gives us more time to strengthen our environmental dataset" while providing more time also for ISA work on mining code regulations and procedures.
It estimated it must also raise $60 million to $70 million to proceed with its application for a license, in addition to $20 million in cash it has on hand.
The company said it lifted 3,000 tonnes of nodules from the seafloor in trials last year, and aims to mine an estimated three million wet tonnes per year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activists from Greenpeace were arrested Thursday after scaling UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency home in northern England and covering it with black fabric to protest his fossil fuel policy.
Sunak this week approved hundreds of new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea off Britain's east coast, angering environmentalists.
"We desperately need our prime minister to be a climate leader, not a climate arsonist," said Greenpeace UK climate campaigner Philip Evans.
"Just as wildfires and floods wreck homes and lives around the world, Sunak is committing to a massive expansion of oil and gas drilling."
Greenpeace UK posted videos of four activists climbing onto the roof of Sunak's mansion in Richmond, north Yorkshire, and covering it with black sheets.
It later said that the activists, who spent around five hours on Sunak's roof, had been arrested.
Two more activists unfurled a banner reading "Rishi Sunak -- Oil Profits or Our Future?" on the front lawn.
The prime minister and his family are currently on holiday in California.
"He seems quite happy to hold a blowtorch to the planet if he can score a few political points by sowing division around climate in this country," said Evans.
"This is cynical beyond belief."
Separately, dozens of mothers joined forces outside parliament to demonstrate against the government's policy.
"We all know that climate science screams that we cannot have more fossil fuels... I am really furious on behalf of my kids," said protest organizer Lorna Powell, 37.
"Instead of being a climate leader and acting in the right way, he's decided that he is going to use it as a political game to try and stoke a culture war," she added.
Downing Street insists the policy is essential to ensure Britain's domestic energy security, and that it can still meet its 2050 net zero goals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mexican government said Wednesday that a dead body had been found caught in the controversial floating barriers installed by Texas authorities to stop migrants crossing into the United States.
US authorities informed Mexico that "they found the body of a lifeless person stuck in the southern part of the buoys" on the Rio Grande river, the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement.
The cause of death and nationality of the victim were unknown, it added.
The ministry expressed "concern about the impact on the human rights and personal safety of migrants that these state policies will have."
The buoys were installed in the river at a popular migrant crossing point in July on the instructions of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, along with large razor-wire barriers on shore. 
In response, the US Justice Department has filed a lawsuit in a federal court, saying the buoys illegally obstruct river navigation and lack federal authorization.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that the barriers violate his country's sovereignty.
Hundreds of migrants die each year along the US-Mexico border, mostly while trying to cross the Rio Grande.

The devastating wildfires have burned some 30 million acres (12 million hectares) this year so far, incinerating an area larger than the size of Cuba or South Korea.
Enormous plumes of smoke have choked the air in Canada and neighboring United States, affecting more than 100 million people and at times disrupting flights and forcing the cancellation of outdoor events.
Europe's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) said it had tracked the fires since the season began at the start of May, as the blazes scorched across large areas of…]]></summary>

The renewed political instability has revived long-held fears in a country that has seen more than a dozen military coups in the past century.
So what is happening, why, and what might come next?
- How did we get here? -
Thailand held elections in May, returning a shock win for the progressive Move Forward Party (MFP), buoyed by many Thais' desire for change and an end to almost a decade of army-backed rule.
But their plans, which included amending strict royal defamation laws, spooked the powerful conservative establishment.
An eight-party coalition headed by MFP failed to sec…]]></summary>

"It's been more than 70 years since a temperature like this was recorded" in Vicuna, Chilean meteorologist Cristobal Torres told AFP.
Unusually high temperatures were also recorded 450 kilometers (280 miles) south in the capital Santiago: 24C (75F) on Wednesday, with similar levels forecast for Thursday and Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis on Wednesday met with victims of clerical sexual abuse, as he began a five-day visit to Portugal for a major Catholic youth festival.
The 86-year-old pontiff had earlier said that the "anguished cry" of sexual abuse victims must be heard, six months after a report into the abuse that shook Portugal.
Francis was welcomed with military honors in Lisbon, where one million pilgrims from around the world are expected to take part in World Youth Day festivities.
The event – a week of religious, cultural and festive events held about every three years in a different city – comes as the Church reflects on its future and grapples with priest pedophilia scandals.
A report released in February in Portugal by an independent commission concluded that at least 4,815 children had been abused by clergy members, mostly priests, in the country since 1950.
The inquiry – similar to audits elsewhere in Europe and the Americas – concluded that the Church hierarchy "systematically" tried to conceal the abuse.
In an address to the clergy at Lisbon's vast Jeronimos Monastery, the pontiff said the sex abuse scandals had "marred" the Church and sparked "disappointment and anger".
These scandals "call us to a humble and ongoing purification, starting with the anguished cry of the victims, who must always be accepted and listened to," he added.
'Intense listening'
"The meeting was held in an atmosphere of intense listening and lasted more than an hour," it added.

It said the location of the haul, in the Bay of Biscay, was "totally exceptional". Most cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe are seized along Spain's western Atlantic coast.

Millions of people have been hit by extreme weather events and prolonged heatwaves around the globe in recent weeks, events that scientists say are being exacerbated by climate change.
And the Beijing Meteorological Service said the capital has just experienced the "heaviest rainfall in 140 years", when city authorities started keeping records.
"The maximum (amount) of rainfall recorded during this storm, which was 744.8 millimeters, occurred at the Wangjiayuan Reservoir in Changping," the service said, adding the largest volume previously recorded was 609 millimeters in 1891.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One person was reportedly killed and hundreds of thousands were without electricity in southern Japan on Wednesday as a typhoon approached packing powerful winds and lashing rain.
Hundreds of flights to Okinawa and other islands in the area were cancelled, stranding thousands of tourists holidaying in the region's tropical beach resorts.
Typhoon Khanun, described as "very strong" by the Japanese weather agency, brought maximum sustained wind speeds of 180 kilometers (112 miles) an hour.
Okinawa's power company said 220,580 households -- nearly 35 percent of the total in the region -- had no electricity early on Wednesday.
An evacuation warning issued across Okinawa and the southern part of Kagoshima region was in place, urging more than 690,000 residents to move to safety, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
The agency said a total of 11 people in Okinawa were mildly injured.
A 90-year-old man died after being trapped under a collapsed garage on Tuesday evening, public broadcaster NHK reported, adding that strong winds were probably the cause.
The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of flooding and landslides in some parts of the main island of Okinawa.
The typhoon was about 70 kilometers south of Okinawa's remote Kumejima island at 2300 GMT and was moving west-northwest, according to the JMA.
It was expected to cross to eastern China later in the week.
More than 400 flights were cancelled on Wednesday, according to NHK, affecting more than 65,000 passengers.
On Tuesday, tourists made long queues at the main Naha airport, hoping to get back home.
"We haven't been able to secure a hotel and we don't know when the return flight can be booked," Minako Kawakami told local daily Okinawa Times.]]></summary>

"I research the fetish," says the 28-year-old, a figure wearing a dramatic red wig ahead of her fight and holding a cane that she says is imbued with mystical powers.
Maitresse Libondans is a practitioner of "catch-fetiche," also called voodoo wrestling -- a wildly over-the-top Congolese sport where fighters grapple with each other and use magic to try to gain supremacy.
She will only step into the ring if her ancestors, reached through spiritual rites, assure her of conquest.
And once in combat, she uses her signature fighting technique: baring her chest to hypnotize her opponent.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
