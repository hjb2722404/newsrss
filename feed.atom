Pope Francis asserted on June 14 that World War III had already begun, referring to battles taking place around the world. 
Pope Francis on June 14 asserted that World War III had already commenced, referring to the conflicts that have been taking place across the world in recent months. 
The pontiff went on to say that "we see" what is occurring in Ukraine in a different light because it is closer to us and pricks our senses more, however, "no one cares" about the fights taking place in parts of Africa, northern Nigeria, northern Congo, and Myanmar. 
  According to Vatican News, the pontiff said, "We see what is happening now in Ukraine in a certain way because it is closer to us and pricks our sensibilities more. But there are other countries far away—think of some parts of Africa, northern Nigeria, northern Congo—where war is ongoing and nobody cares. Think of Myanmar and the Rohingya. The world is at war. Today, for me, World War III has been declared."

WNU Editor: I was surprised at the appearance of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at today's NATO meeting (see above). As a former politician, diplomat, and now leader of NATO, he knows that it is a rule for people in these positions to always look clean shaven, neat, and sharp looking. 
He definitely did not look like that today. In fact, he looked like shit. His tie was crooked, hair was messed-up, and this is the first time that I have seen him unshaven. 
Optics and perception is important to political leaders like Jens Stoltenberg. They always take the time to look good. My gut tells me that he is becoming stressed by the Russia - Ukraine war, or more to the point, the intelligence that he has access to is painting a very grim picture on what is really happening in eastern Ukraine. 
Long meetings. Continuous bad news. NATO members with their own agendas. Keeping a unified message among the alliance. It looks like being clean-cut for the cameras was not the priority for Jens Stoltenberg's at today's meeting.]]></summary>

Russian forces have destroyed the last bridge linking the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk to a Ukrainian held city on the other side of the river, cutting off all routes of evacuation for those remaining in the city, a Ukrainian official said on Monday evening. 
Sergei Gaidai, the governor of Lugansk, said on social media that some 70% of Sievierodonetsk was now under Russian control, describing the situation for Ukrainian soldiers holding out in the city as "difficult, but under control". 
At the same time, the destruction of the last bridge across the river to the twin city of Lysychansk meant that it was impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies, he said, nor remove any civilians still in Sievierodonetsk.

Wall Street Journal: Ukraine Has Begun Moving Sensitive Data Outside Its Borders  
Some government databases are already on cloud servers in Poland, and officials are negotiating similar arrangements with France, Estonia and several other nations 
Ukrainian government officials have begun storing sensitive data outside the country to protect it from Russian cyber and physical assault, and are negotiating with several European nations to move more databases abroad. 
Since the start of the war, around 150 registries from different government ministries and offices, or backup copies of them, have been moved abroad or are in discussions to be transferred, said George Dubinskiy, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. 
Previously, much of the government’s information trove was held in data centers in Ukraine, and needed first to be moved to the cloud before backup copies could be transferred, he said. 
The government prioritized important databases to move from old legacy data-storage systems, and created copies of those registries for storage in clouds outside Ukraine, he said. 
“To be on the safe side, we want to have our backups abroad,” Mr. Dubinskiy said.  Moving databases to the cloud adds a layer of security because government officials can still access it even if a data center in Ukraine were demolished by Russian weapons, he said. 
The government specified legal and security provisions to help protect the databases from cyber and other threats, he added.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) -Armed men killed at least 100 civilians in a rural district of northern Burkina Faso close to the border with Niger over the weekend, a security source said. 
The attackers targeted men but appeared to spare women and children in Seytenga district on Saturday night, the security source and two other sources said, all speaking on condition of anonymity. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the assault happened in borderlands where militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are waging an insurgency.

VOA: Ethiopia PM Says Committee Created to Negotiate With Tigray Forces 
Addis Ababa — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has announced the formation of a committee to begin peace talks with Tigray forces after 18 months of war. 
Abiy spoke to parliament on Tuesday about the conflict in comments broadcast on state television.  “We need to repeat the victory that we made on the battlefield in peace talks,” he said adding that the war is hindering the country’s development. “Every bullet that is shot is like a dollar lost.”
Abiy said that the committee would be led by Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen and would be given 10 to 15 days to decide what will be up for negotiation.

El Pais: Nicaragua’s Ortega strains US relations by expanding military ties with Russia 
President Daniel Ortega welcomes more Russian military personnel and equipment to be stationed throughout Nicaragua 
With relations between Nicaragua and the United States at its lowest point in years, former Sandinista guerrilla and current president Daniel Ortega’s new accord with Russia has just added fuel to the fire. Vladimir Putin’s propaganda machine kicked into high gear to publicize the Nicaraguan government’s recent announcement that it will begin receiving more Russian military personnel, ships, and aircraft starting July 1. Ortega’s regime has dubbed it “a military exchange, instruction, and training initiative to support humanitarian aid operations.” The announcement of this new Russian collaboration with Nicaragua follows Ortega’s defiance of the United States and the European Union when he supported Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Ortega’s apparent diplomatic strategy is to use such initiatives to alleviate his country’s economic pain caused by international isolation and sanctions.

Zero Hedge: Mexico President Slams "Immoral" NATO Proxy War in Ukraine 
The president of Mexico has condemned NATO's approach to the war in Ukraine - labelling it "immoral." 
“How easy it is to say, 'Here, I’ll send you this much money for weapons.' Couldn’t the war in Ukraine have been avoided? Of course it could,” said President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. 
López Obrador didn't elaborate on how, but fair to say a peaceful resolution would have centered on the negotiation of: 
* Some form of independence for the eastern Ukraine provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk 
* A Ukraine government pledge that it will not join NATO 
* Ukraine's recognition that Crimea is now part of Russia 
The increasingly dismal prospects for Ukraine's military now seem to point to a negotiated end to the war that embraces those same three elements, but perhaps with Donetsk and Luhansk—which together comprise the Donbas region—joining Russia outright.

19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia 
The Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. 
Militarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.    
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky's top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). 
Ukraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. 
I am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. 

Being straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:
 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;
 300 MLRS;
 500 tanks;
 2000 armored vehicles;
 1000 drones.
Contact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15. We are waiting for a decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Image credit: SpaceX)  SpaceX: SpaceX beating Russian jamming attack was ‘eyewatering’: DoD official  
“The way that Starlink was able to upgrade when a threat showed up, we need to be able to have that ability," said Dave Tremper, the Pentagon's director of electronic warfare. "We have to be able to change our electromagnetic posture, to be able to change very dynamically what we're trying to do without losing capability along the way.”  
WASHINGTON: The US military’s electronic warfare enterprise needs to take a page from SpaceX when it comes to responding to new threats, the Pentagon’s director for electromagnetic warfare said today.  After SpaceX sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine in February in an apparent effort to help Ukraine maintain its internet connection amid war with Russia, SpaceX founder Elon Musk claimed that Russia had jammed Starlink terminals in the country for hours at a time. 
After a software update, Starlink was operating normally, said Musk, who added on March 25 that the constellation had “resisted all hacking & jamming attempts” in Ukraine.

Ukraine can receive Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers from Germany around June 22.

WNU editor: I do not think this June 22 delivery date was deliberately planned to coincide with the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Germany does not really have its act-together when it comes to supplying Ukraine with weapons .... Germany Never Gave Fixed Date on Weapons Delivery, Says Govt Spokesperson (Reuters). 
But June 22 is a day that is remembered by most Russians, and it is bringing back memories that are not pleasant. 
When I was a kid my father told me on a June 22 day why that date was important to him. The start of the war changed his life and the life of everyone he knew in 1941. I still remember the look that he had. It is the same look that my friends in New York City have when they remember 9/11.]]></summary>

RFE: Interview: Edward Luttwak, A Military Adviser To Presidents, Explains How The Ukraine War Began And How It Might End 
Edward Luttwak is among modern times' most sought-after military strategists, advising the Pentagon, presidents, and prime ministers around the world. He's also among their most controversial. Luttwak's analyses and conclusions are often described as being blunt, unequivocal, counterintuitive, and sometimes jarringly cynical. 
A polyglot American born to Jewish parents in World War II Romania and raised in Italy and England, he is the author of seminal books like Strategy: The Logic Of War And Peace and The Grand Strategy Of The Soviet Union as well as more than a dozen others. But he is best known for his 1968 book Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook, which is required reading at some war colleges.

WNU Editor: I have been following Edward Luttwack since the 1980s. His analysis is usually spot on. And while I do not think his confidence in Ukraine salvaging a "victory" in this war is realistic, the above interview is my must read post for today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The opening hearing of the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol made it clear why Fox News split from every other major news network by refusing broadcast the audience during prime time.
This was so the network could continue to mislead its viewers about what happened on January 6, 2021.
ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, CNN and MSNBC broadcast the entire two-hour hearing live.  Fox News didn’t, pushing its anchors Bret Bayer and Martha MacCallum at Fox Business, while its opinion leaders aired counter-programming laden with misrepresentations and conspiracy theories about the riot.
The hearing began at 8 p.m., at the start of At Tucker Carlson Fox News broadcast.  Carlson continued to downplay the bloody riot on his show, as he has for more than a year, callin…]]></summary>

She pulled out an old box of Christmas lights to wrap around the railing.  She looked at me with beaming eyes as she plugged them in and told me that my ex-partner had raved about me a few weeks earlier.

“She said she had never felt more loved and cared for than when she was with a black woman.”

I looked up from where I was sitting and wondered if I was going to end the night in a flurry of tipsy text messages reminding all my former lovers and friends that I’m not binary.  Instead, I poured myself more wine and drank like it wasn’t a weekday.

The mass movement coincided with a recent meeting in Los Angeles of leaders from the Western Hemisphere, where migration was a key focus.
Although migrant caravans have become a common occurrence and are usually dispersed by authorities long before they reach the southern border of the United States, the latest march of some 6,000 people walking along Mexican highways has drawn significant international attention.

The Guardian: Ukraine’s high casualty rate could bring war to tipping point 
Analysis: Kyiv’s fighting strength is stretched, yet Russia could now benefit from a pause in fighting 
Any way you count it, the figures are stark: Ukrainian casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 6oo and 1,000 a day. One presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told the Guardian this week it was 150 killed and 800 wounded daily; another, Mykhaylo Podolyak, told the BBC that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops a day were being killed. 
It represents an extraordinary loss of human life and capacity for the defenders, embroiled in a defence of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk that this week turned into a losing battle. Yet the city was also arguably a place that Ukraine could have retreated from to the more defensible Lysychansk, across the Siverski Donets River, the sort of defensive situation that Ukraine has fared far better in.

“The West has the right to give Ukraine nuclear warheads so that it could protect its independence,” Sikorski told Ukraine’s Espreso TV on Saturday.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's prime minister pledged to lead a minority government on Wednesday as the populist ITN party quit the government over disagreements on budget spending and whether Bulgaria should back North Macedonia's European Union accession. 
Kiril Petkov said he was "optimistic" his centrist PP party and its two remaining coalition partners could still deliver on pledges to uproot widespread corruption in the EU's poorest member state after losing their parliamentary majority. 
But analysts say the rift is likely to bring fresh instability just as the Ukraine war causes inflation to surge. Petkov's government only took office in December after a prolonged political crisis.

Mr Marles met with General Wei Fenghe for more than hour on the sideline of the Shangri-La Defence Dialogue, marking the first time in three years the defence ministers of the two countries have met.

Lowy Institute Senior Fellow Richard McGregor says the meeting was “very interesting” as both Australia and China were willing to have a conversation.

He said before Mr Marles went to Singapore he said there was no meeting arranged so the occurrence of one shows both countries “decided it was about time to end the stand-off”.

“It’s important to remember though there’s no change in all the fundamental problems in the relationship, all that’s happening now is we’re talking about them,” he told Sky News Australia.

“In the case of the military that’s a good thing because it means we might be able to avoid the kind of incidents we had in the South China Sea a few months ago.”]]></summary>

This sound prompted families carrying bags of food, pots of coffee, soda coolers, grills, hookahs and many children into action, climbing iron ladders to get into the wagons. wooden train.

Warzone/The Drive: Israel Has Extended The Range Of Its F-35s: Report 
Reports in the Israeli media suggest that IAF F-35s have been enhanced to hit Iranian targets unrefueled and carry at least one new weapon. 
Recent reports in the Israeli media claim that the country has developed a means of extending the range of its F-35I Adir stealth jets, allegedly providing them with enough reach to hit targets in Iran without needing aerial refueling. The development has been announced together with the integration of a new, locally developed smart bomb for internal carriage in the F-35. These apparent upgrades to the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities come as the Israeli leadership announces a harder line against Tehran’s nuclear program, while the air force conducts exercises widely thought to be dress rehearsals for potential raids against Iran.

WNU Editor: Israel modified the external fuel tanks for the F-35. It will degrade its stealth capabilities, but it will make it possible for these jets to now strike Iran without being refueled.
