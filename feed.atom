        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” interior designer Thom Filicia has sold his home in Skaneateles, New York, in an off-market deal for $4.6 million. 

The TV host has not only found a buyer for the five-bedroom lakeside home, but one who is a longtime friend. 
“They purchased about 60% of the furniture separately and they want to reupholster and update some pieces,” Filicia, from nearby Syracuse, told The Post.  The buyer, who requested anonymity, also wants to work with Filicia to renovate the boathouse, make the space more child-friendly (they have a young daughter) and customize an outdoor kitchen area.
Filicia bought the property, where he spent weekends away from his Chelsea flat, for $965,000 in 2008, Syracuse.com reported.  He came across it on his way home from a friend’s wedding an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 and one of the goals of Artemis is to put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface.


		The name Artemis was chosen to echo that of the Apollo program.


		Here is an overview of the Artemis program:

Artemis 1: test flight


		Blastoff is scheduled for 8:33 am (1233 GMT) on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.


		Orion will orbit the Moon before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis 2: first crew


		The four members of the crew will be named before the end of the year. A Canadian is expected to be among them.

Artemis 3: Moon landing


		NASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.


		Artemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.


SpaceX Moon lander


		SpaceX's Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.

Gateway space station


		The launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.


		Astronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.

Destination Mars

		The ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the "next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars."


		The goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.


		While a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States plans to name an ambassador at large for the Arctic, reflecting the region's growing strategic and commercial importance as its shrinking opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the region, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, a day after visiting the Arctic, saying Russian capabilities there pose a strategic challenge to the 30-nation alliance.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a "special military operation," has heightened Western concerns about Russian ambitions around the world.
China, which describes itself as a "near-Arctic" state, also has ambitions in the region and has said it intended to build a "Polar Silk Road." China has its eye on mineral resources and new shipping routes as ice caps recede with rising temperatures.
In a statement on Friday, the U.S. State Department said President Joe Biden planned elevate the area's importance within the U.S. government by nominating an ambassador-at-large for the Arctic region, subject to the Senate's advise and consent.
It did not say who would be nominated.
"An Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative is of critical strategic importance to the United States," the Department said.
"As one of eight Arctic nations, the United States has long been committed to protecting our national security and economic interests in the region, combating climate change, fostering sustainable development and investment, and promoting cooperation with Arctic States, Allies, and partners," it said.
The eight Arctic nations are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.

gCaptain/Reuters: US Coast Guard Can’t Bunker In Solomon Islands  
(Reuters) A United States Coast Guard vessel was unable to enter Solomon Islands for a routine port call because the Solomon Islands government did not respond to a request for it to refuel and provision, a U.S. official said. 
 The islands’ government did not immediately answer a Reuters request for comment.
The Solomon Islands has had a tense relationship with the United States and its allies since striking a security pact with China in May. 
The USCGC Oliver Henry was on patrol for illegal fishing in the South Pacific for a regional fisheries agency when it failed to obtain entry to refuel at Honiara, the Solomons’ capital, a U.S. Coast Guard press officer told Reuters in an emailed statement.  The U.S. vessel was diverted to Papua New Guinea instead, the official said.

WNU Editor: This refusal to allow a US ship to make a port of call follows the Solomon Islands signing a security pact with China.    
Update: another disturbing trend from the Solomon Islands .... Solomon Islands to ban foreign journalists who are not ‘respectful’ – report (The Guardian).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis will on Saturday create 20 new cardinals picked from the four corners of the world, most of whom could one day end up choosing the pontiff's successor.
Francis has raised the possibility of retiring due to his declining health, a path taken by his predecessor Benedict XVI. If he were to do so, a conclave involving all cardinals aged under 80 would be called to pick a successor.
Sixteen of the 20 cardinals created Saturday would be eligible for that conclave based on their ages.
The ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica is the 85-year-old pope's eighth since being elected in 2013 and includes clergy known for their pastoral work and, in some cases, progressive views.
All parts of the globe are represented, including new cardinals from Brazil and Nigeria, Singapore and East Timor, am…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the costs of importing energy soars worldwide and climate crises wreak havoc, interest in nuclear power is on the rise with nations scrambling to find alternative sources.
Investment in nuclear power declined after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, as fears over its safety increased and governments ran scared.
But following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, the subsequent squeeze on energy supplies and Europe's push to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, the tide is now turning back in favour of nuclear.
Governments face difficult decisions with rising gas and electricity bills and scarce resources threatening to cause widespread suffering this winter.

But the 36-year-old's reputation as a firm crisis leader -- deftly navigating her small nation through the Covid pandemic and a historic NATO membership application -- has been challenged in the last few days.
Marin has become entangled in controversies over her partying, earning her the nickname "Party Sanna" in Finland's tabloid press.
A poll published by leading newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Friday showed that 42 percent of Finns had a worse opinion of their prime minister due to the scandals.

There was no happy ending for by Alan Dershowitz appearance on Hill TVs Rising    Friday morning, while grilled by the host Ryan Grim around a massage received at the home of Jeffrey Epstein.
Dershowitz became frustrated with the interrogations, insisting over and over “LET ME FINISH” until he finally explained that a massage booked at the home of the convicted child trafficker who “committed suicide” in a Manhattan jail was perfectly normal since it had been booked.  by his wife.
The law professor explained how the massage was performed by a middle-aged woman named Olga, further claiming that getting massages at friends’ homes was completely normal.
Congratulations to the host Ryan Grim for toying his topic with probing questions until Dershowitz posted fluent answers.  Some critics may deride the Harvard law professor as a total wanker, but others see his behavior as completely normal – everyone does it.
Watch above via The Hill TV.

The August 15 article on the “euthanasia” (translation: murder) of Freya the walrus in Oslo made me sick and disgusted.  (“Freya, the crowd-drawing walrus, euthanized,” August 15)
Its presence was considered a potential risk to humans.  I know many humans who pose a potential risk to other humans.  Should they all be “euthanized” equally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has updated its information related to Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to include any forks that may occur.
In a Thursday update to an Aug. 16 blog post, Coinbase said it would assess all potential forks in the Ethereum blockchain on a case-by-case basis.” The crypto exchange previously said that he planned to ‘briefly pause’ Ether(ETH) and deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 tokens during the merger, which are expected to take place between September 10 and September 20.
“Should an ETH PoW fork occur after The Merge, this asset will be reviewed with the same rigor as any other asset listed on our exchange,” Coinbase said.

Rest assured that all potential Ethereum forked tokens, including PoW forks, will go through the same strict listing review process that is performed for any other asset listed on our exchange.
— Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) August 25, 2022

Exchanges and crypto companies dealing with ETH have made announcements informing customers of all the preparations needed before the merger, from proof of work, or PoW, to proof of stake, or PoS.  Many expect blockchain power consumption to drop precipitously, scalability to improve, and the network to be less vulnerable to attack.
It is unclear how crypto users might respond to a forked PoW token listed on Coinbase or any crypto exchange during Ethereum transitions.  Wednesday, the platform launched an ERC-20 token which will allow customers to use staked ETH while earning rewards, cbETH.

Binance too said On Thursday, it might offer support for new tokens created by a potential hard fork but would “guarantee no listings” without a review process.  BitMEX made a similar announcement on August 8, adding that the offer was “highly speculative” and “may never exist”.

Like my former colleague at the conservative watchdog Media Research Center, editor of NewsBusters Curtis Houcknoted on Twitter, CBS MatineesABC hello america and NBCs Today did not mention the suicide bombing that killed the US military.

   Al-Monitor: US strikes Iran-backed militias in Syria for third day 
The White House sought to halt attacks on American troops in Syria by authorizing airstrikes on a depot used by the IRGC. Local militias have responded by firing more rockets.  American military aircraft struck Iran-backed militia targets in eastern Syria for the third day in a row on Thursday as commanders sought to suppress a new flurry of attacks on US bases in the country. 
The US deployed Apache helicopters, AC-130 gunships and M777 artillery in response to rocket fire that lightly injured three US soldiers at the Conoco base in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province around 7:20 p.m. on Wednesday. At least two additional rockets later landed outside the United States' Green Village base at al-Omar oilfield.

Euractiv/Reuters: Analysis: Forget showering, it’s eat or heat for shocked Europeans hit by energy crisis 
No more ironing, limited oven use and showering at work – Europeans are trying to keep their energy use down but the bills keep climbing. 
As wholesale gas and electricity prices surge, millions of people in Europe are now spending a record amount of their income on energy, data show. 
In the east England town of Grimsby, Philip Keetley didn’t turn on his cooling fan at home as Britain sweltered under a record heat-wave this summer.

The background is that right now abortion rights and access in this country are under attack from (mostly) Christian, conservative and far-right extremists who want to control women’s bodies and reproductive rights.  These extremists want to force a pregnant person to carry the fetus to term.  This culminated on June 24 when the United States Supreme Court struck down Roe v.

The Taliban broke its silence Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, days after a U.S. drone strike killing al Qaida’s top leader in Afghanistan’s capital, acknowledging his slaying, and pledging to launch an investigation. Shaheen, the head of the group’s political office in Doha, Qatar told the Associated Press in a what’s App message that "The government and the leadership weren’t aware of what is being claimed, nor any trace there.

Suhail Shaheen insisted the Taliban did not know Ayman al-Zawahri was in Kabul 
Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen blamed the West for a humanitarian crisis that has gripped Afghanistan following the group’s takeover last year. 
"Our hands are tied," Shaheen told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. "We are facing sanctions, embargoes - those countries, including the United States, who are funding projects here in the country and some of which of those projects work was completed, about 95% are more than that, they stopped funding those projects, so this is also one of the causes of poverty increase in the country."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Marcelo Rochabrun
LIMA (Reuters) - LGBT activists in Peru held a protest on Friday questioning how their government handled the death of a Peruvian transgender man in Indonesia earlier this month who was detained at the airport upon arriving to celebrate his honeymoon.
Rodrigo Ventosilla, a Peruvian graduate student at Harvard University and transgender rights activist, died on the tourist island of Bali of "bodily failure" days after being detained for alleged cannabis possession.
Peru's foreign ministry issued a statement this week calling Ventosilla's alleged drug possession a serious crime in Indonesia and that transphobia had not been a factor in his arrest, but did not acknowledge he had later died while in custody.
"We reject and condemn the foreign ministry's statement," said LGBT activist Luz Manriquez at a small protest in Lima.
Manriquez said the government's statement was biased because it adopted Indonesia's position and did not demand an investigation.
"It lacks empathy because it does not recognize that a Peruvian has died in the hands of police from another country," Manriquez added.
Brenda Alvarez, a lawyer for Ventosilla's family, told reporters on Friday the foreign ministry had agreed to apologize over the statement and launch an investigation.
Peru's foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
Alvarez added there is no date for when Ventosilla's body will arrive in Lima.
The Indonesian police told Reuters this week the case is closed and that no violence was involved in Ventosilla's death.
"Even if you are detained in another country, it is unreal and painful that (the Peruvian government) can leave you like this," said Arturo Davila, a member of Diversidades Trans Masculinas, a trans rights organization that Ventosilla founded seven years ago in Peru.

Times Of Israel: US hints to Gantz it’s preparing military option against Iran, Israeli official says  
Senior official says Washington meeting with Jake Sullivan ‘positive’ despite defense minister raising Israeli objections to emerging nuclear deal 
Defense Minister Benny Gantz told US President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Friday that Israel “needs” the US to have a credible military option against Iran, a senior Israeli official said to reporters Friday, amid reports of an emerging renewed nuclear deal between the Islamic Republic and world powers. 
According to the defense official, Israel received “good hints” with regard to the US having a working offensive plan against Iran. He did not elaborate, but said it that would potentially ensure Tehran is more flexible during negotiations for the renewed accord. If not, the US would be ready to act against Iran alongside Israel, which has also been preparing a military option.

 Insider: Bulgaria's return to Russian gas supply talks is 'inevitable' amid steep shortages, energy chief says 
* A return to Russian gas supply talks is "inevitable," Bulgaria's energy chief said on Monday. 
* "Given the demands of business and the trade unions, in reality, talks with Gazprom to renew supplies are inevitable," he said. 
Bulgaria's energy minister Rossen Hristov said the country would likely go back to talks with Russia on resuming gas deliveries from state-run energy supplier Gazprom. 
Gazprom provided 90% of Bulgaria's natural gas until April, when it cut supplies after Bulgaria refused to pay in rubles.  "Given the demands of business and the trade unions, in reality, talks with Gazprom to renew supplies are inevitable," Energy Minister Rossen Hristov said at a press event, according to Reuters.

        <updated>2022-08-26T17:19:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argentine authorities seized 1.6 tons of cocaine hidden in animal feed destined for Dubai and detained 12 people, police said on Friday.
The seizure, which took place overnight from Thursday to Friday in the central city of Rosario, highlights the role played by Argentine ports in trafficking South American drugs internationally.
The cocaine "is worth approximately $60 million," said Mariano Giuffra, head of the dangerous drugs department in the federal police.
The arrests took place at various sites around the country.
"They are all Argentines and some of them are known drug traffickers," added Giuffra.
Several firearms, sports cars and a large amount of cash were also seized.
Rosario, located 310 kilometers (190 miles) from Buenos Aires, is Argentina's third-largest city and the main port for agricultural exports to the Atlantic.
It is also the most violent city in Argentina, with a murder rate three times the national average.
The cocaine had been hidden in bags of corn fodder that was about to be loaded onto a container destined for Dubai.
Police said the cocaine probably originated in Colombia, the world's largest producer of the drug.
While most cocaine is produced by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia -- where growing coca leaf, which is the main ingredient in the white powder, is legal -- experts say Argentina has increasingly taken on an important role in trafficking the drug.
Argentina has several major ports, has a large supply of quality chemicals needed to turn coca leaf into cocaine, and provides ample opportunities for money laundering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Umit Bektas
MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Actors in a heavily bombarded city in southern Ukraine have returned to the stage, putting on their first performance since Russia's invasion in an underground shelter converted into a tiny theatre.
A few dozen theatre-goers descended steep concrete steps into the subterranean venue on Thursday for the opening night of a show put on by the Mykolaiv Art Drama Theatre. Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.
"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller," said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.
Theatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as "art-therapy", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.
Ievhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.
"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun'," he said. "There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good."

As a Resistance fighter in Lyon, rescuing Jews was at the core of René Nodot’s mission. But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.
“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”

BBC: Nato investigates hacker sale of missile firm data 
Nato is assessing the impact of a data breach of classified military documents being sold by a hacker group online. 
The data includes blueprints of weapons being used by Nato allies in the Ukraine conflict. 
Criminal hackers are selling the dossiers after stealing data linked to a major European weapons maker.  MBDA Missile Systems admitted its data was among the stash but claimed none of the classified files belong to the firm. 
The pan-European company, which is headquartered in France, said its information was hacked from a compromised external hard drive, adding that it was cooperating with authorities in Italy, where the data breach took place. 
 It is understood investigations are centred around one of MBDA's suppliers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Family members of 10 miners who have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for three weeks said on Thursday they rejected a government plan to find the miners that they said officials described as lasting from six to 11 months.
Three miners had been rescued and hospitalized, the Security and Citizen Protection Ministry said in an update on the rescue efforts at the mine in the Sabinas municipality of the northern state of Coahuila.
Television footage showed family members outside the mine clamoring for information on the missing men.
"I hope we find them safe," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier on Twitter. Lopez Obrador had said nine miners were likely to be trapped, but authorities revised the number later.
Some 92 soldiers were working at the scene, as well as specialists and rescue dogs, the president said.
The Labor Ministry said it had not received any complaints about safety at the mine, which began operations in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia on Friday tapped a former high court judge to investigate ex-prime minister Scott Morrison's decision to secretly appoint himself to several key ministerial portfolios.
Incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the creation of the inquiry, saying the country's system of "parliamentary democracy" had been tested.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, conservative leader Morrison appointed himself to the ministries of health, treasury, finance, resources and home affairs without telling colleagues or the public.
Albanese said the inquiry was essential "to ensure that this can never happen again".
The probe will be led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and will report by November 25.
"We need to have a quick and appropriate inquiry," said Albanese, adding this is "not about the politics, but how this happened, why this happened and who knew about it."

He did not rule out Morrison or other former government ministers from being compelled to give evidence if necessary.
Morrison has insisted he was right to take "emergency powers" during the tumult of the pandemic.
"I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest," he said in a defiant first public appearance after the scandal broke, dismissing critics who were "standing on the shore after the fact".
Three of Morrison's fellow conservative prime ministers have also criticized the former premier's behavior.

Euractiv: Scholz’s SPD lawmakers demand an end to Ukraine war, negotiations with Russia 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is steering his pacifist SPD party through precedent-breaking arms shipments for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, has been called on to engage in a diplomatic offensive by lawmakers. 
As a consequence of the “Zeitenwende” Scholz observed, the German government boosted its military budget by an extraordinary €100 billion and shipped arms into a hot conflict for the first time ever. Parts of the SPD struggled with these measures and have now sent a letter signed by multiple MPs and MEPs to Scholz, titled “The weapons must be silent!” 
“The escalation spiral must be stopped,” the letter reads, which calls for a “modus vivendi.”

"We need this place to fight on the cultural front too," says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.
The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides "a form of 'art therapy'" for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.
Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.

But this year's crop is devastated, another casualty of a blistering heatwave that has engulfed southern China in the country's hottest summer on record and subsumed half its land in drought.
"This is absolutely the first time in my life encountering such a disaster," he tells AFP.
"This year is a very miserable one.
"We should be harvesting fruits right now, but it's all gone, dead from the scorching sun."
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, forcing power cuts that have hit agricultural workers hard.

Moon Of Alabama: Ukraine Previously Cited High Casualty Rates - It Is Now Lowballing Those Numbers 
In June several Ukrainian officials admitted that their army had some 700 or even more casualties per day. The numbers were played up to gain access to more 'western' weapons. 
Since then Ukrainian officials have stated much lower totals of killed and wounded than make sense.

This report must be seen in that light. 
Russia Hits Train Station in Deadly Attack on Ukraine’s Independence Day - New York Times   
A Russian missile hit a train station in eastern Ukraine, killing at least 22 people, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday, in an attack that came as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day and brought home the harsh reality of the six-month-old war. 
The attack, which took place in an area about 74 miles east of the city of Dnipro in Ukraine-controlled territory, was one of the deadliest strikes on the country’s railways since April, when more than 50 people were killed when a rocket slammed into a crowded railway platform in eastern Ukraine.

Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn is the latest in a series of US lawmakers to visit Taiwan amid tensions with China 
Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., landed in Taiwan for an unannounced visit on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the trip. 
Blackburn is only the latest in a series of U.S. lawmakers to fly to Taiwan, a trend that has outraged the Chinese government. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governed island in early August, and she was the highest-level U.S. official to do so since Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997. 
The Pentagon declined to comment on Blackburn's trip, stating that it does not comment on security details.

The world's second-largest economy has been hit by record temperatures, flash floods and droughts this summer -- phenomena that scientists have warned are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. 
Southern China has recorded its longest sustained period of high temperatures and sparse rain since records began more than 60 years ago, the agriculture ministry said.

Breitbart: Winter of Discontent: Germany to Implement Energy Rationing Amid Fears of Gas Riots 
As officials in the country express their fears about future gas riots this winter, the German government has announced a host of new energy rationing rules that will come into effect from next Thursday. 
In what appears to be the latest attempt to avoid energy shortages this winter, the German government is to implement restrictions limiting the use of energy in the country. 
Ministers appear to be hoping that the rationing efforts will help reduce the risk of energy shortages this coming winter, with a number of bigwigs now openly fearful of a future of public unrest and gas riots should people be left unable to adequately heat their homes.

Legal Insurrection: Germany, Europe Brace For Energy Crunch As Second Russian Pipeline Goes Down  
Reuters: “Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday.” 
As I arrived in Berlin today after a gap of almost a year, I noticed how big businesses and ordinary Germans are gearing up for a massive power crisis triggered by the dwindling Russian energy supplies. 
Government ministers, who haven’t done an honest day’s work in their lives, have taken it upon themselves to ‘educate’ hardworking Germans on how to save on electricity, room heating, and hot water. 
I have always considered German media and public debates, whether over Climate Change, Brexit, or pandemic, to be driven by wild hysteria and doom-and-gloom predictions. But this time, the German Angst is based on some challenging and bitter facts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zee News: China strongly opposes Indo-US military drills, calls it violation of bilateral agreement 
India and the US will kick-start an over two-week-long mega military exercise in Uttarakhand's Auli in October amid the fast-evolving regional security scenario. The 18th edition of exercise "Yudh Abhyas" is scheduled to take place from October 14 to 31. 
Beijing: China's defence ministry on Thursday said it firmly opposes any third party meddling in the border issue and hopes India will abide by the bilateral agreements to not hold military drills near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the very pacts it has been accused of violating in eastern Ladakh leading to a prolonged standoff. 
Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defence (MND), made the comments while replying to a question about reports of special forces of the US and India recently holding a joint combat exercise in the southern foothills of the Himalayas and their plans to conduct a joint military exercise code-named "War Exercise" (Yudh Abhyas) in October, close to the border.

The musical case against the musicians — who face RICO charges for alleged gang activity — is built on decades of racist precedent.
 Back in May, rapper and record label exec Young Thug was arrested on suspicion of gang activity and conspiracy to violate Georgia’s criminal racketeering law. Days later, Gunna — Young Thug’s Billboard-topping protégé who is signed to his label — and 26 others were charged in a 56-count RICO indictment for gang activity, including robbery and murder. 
“Prosecutors are alleging that they are part of a gang that has committed a number of crimes throughout Atlanta,” said Jewel Wicker, editor-at-large for Capital B Atlanta in an interview with…]]></summary>

Three months ago, Sonya, a 25-year-old who works at a major mobile gaming company and moonlights as a tutor, made one of the toughest decisions of her life: She left Russia. 
She had an old but cozy communal apartment with her boyfriend and two other roommates in Moscow’s city center, a tight-knit group of friends, and spent several days a week taking classes at a local dance academy—her lifelong passion. 
 “It’s my home. My family, friends are there. My whole life. How can you possibly abandon all these things?" she told Fortune.

(CNN)Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is held by Russian forces, was completely disconnected from the power grid for the first time in its history on Thursday, according to the country's nuclear operator. 
The complex was disconnected Thursday due to fires at a nearby ash pits, causing the last remaining power line connecting to Ukraine's energy grid to disconnect twice, Energoatom said in a statement. 
"The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) from the power grid -- the first in the history of the plant," it wrote.

WNU Editor: Power is still being provided to the reactors .... Energoatom said the nuclear plant was still being supplied with power from Ukraine's energy system through a final power line between the plant and the coal power station.  
Update: Expect no more video leaks from this nuclear plant .... Russia detains two Zaporizhzhia nuclear workers for handing Ukraine information (Reuters).

        <updated>2022-08-25T16:34:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes slammed Republicans for a history of giving favorable treatment to CEOs and other wealthy people.
During an appearance on Real America's Voice, Cortes said that Democrats were "smart" to forgive student loans for many borrowers.
"Privileged people, many of whom chose to go and pursue worthless degrees are getting a handout from Joe Biden," he told podcast host Steve Bannon. "In terms of political payoffs, and that's what this is, a crass political payoff, at least the Democrats are smart enough to payoff American voters."
"Establishment Republicans, they pay off CEOs and defense contractors," Cortes continued. "This about that contrast. If you're going to do power politics and you're going to do crass payoffs, at least the Democrats know where their bread is buttered and they're going to pay off voters."
The ex-Trump adviser added: "What Mitch McConnell does and establishment Republicans do is they reward the CEOs of places like Northrop Grumman and therein lies one of the key reasons why in America, as you often talk about, the Republicans have won election after election for decades while we are losing our country."
As president, former President Donald Trump signed a tax cut law that reportedly helps billionaires pay less in taxes than the working class.

LUANDA (Reuters) -Angola's ruling party, which has been in power for nearly five decades, looked set to win a national election with a solid lead over the main opposition on Thursday, after most votes had been counted amid accusations of fraud. 
A win for the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) would extend its continuous rule since independence from Portugal in 1975. 
Earlier on Thursday the opposition party UNITA's vice-presidential candidate Abel Chivukuvuku told Portuguese radio station TSF that the party was considering contesting the results because they did not "correspond to reality", fuelling fears of post-election violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.
Roizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.
The court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.
Roizman denies all the charges.
On Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words "war" and "invasion" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
State news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.
Roizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The harvesting of grapes in France's Champagne region and in vineyards across the country has already begun, far earlier in the season than is normal – a result of the extreme heat seen across Europe this summer. While August harvests used to be extremely rare, they are now becoming common due to climate change, say winemakers. And the warming weather may soon start forcing changes to how the famous sparkling wine is produced.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.
Russia's defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.
"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine," Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.
"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families."
Brown said the human toll of the attack was "just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine."
She cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.
"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain," she said.
