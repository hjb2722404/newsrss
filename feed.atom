   Reuters: Uniper seeks billions of euros in compensation from Gazprom 
DUESSELDORF — German utility Uniper has launched an arbitration process in the hope of securing billions of euros in compensation from Russia’s Gazprom over undelivered gas volumes, Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach said on Wednesday. 
Gazprom’s export arm denied it was in breach of contract regarding gas supplies to Uniper and said it did not accept the legality of the company’s claims.

The Guardian: Fighting in east Ukraine descends into trench warfare as Russia seeks breakthrough 
The town of Bakhmut has been mostly abandoned as relentless shelling reduced buildings to rubble 
Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting.

WNU Editor: Ukraine is denying reports that the town of Bakhmut is surrounded by Russian forces. My Russian sources say that in the past week a number of towns around Bakkhmut have been seized by their forces. I do not know who is right, but I do know that the worst fighting of this war is now happening in this part of the Donbas.

CNN: Pope Francis calls Chechens and Buryats ‘the cruelest’ Russian troops fighting in Ukraine 
Pope Francis has described two of Russia’s ethnic minority groups, the Chechens and Buryats, as some of the “cruelest” troops fighting in Ukraine. 
The pontiff was speaking in an interview with a Jesuit magazine, America, which was published on Monday but took place on November 22, according to the outlet. 
“The cruelest are perhaps those who are of Russia but are not of the Russian tradition, such as the Chechens, the Buryats and so on,” he said. 
“I speak of a people who are martyred. If you have a martyred people, you have someone who martyrs them.”

An explosion occurred Wednesday at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid, injuring one Ukrainian employee who was handling a letter addressed to the country’s ambassador to Spain, officials said. 
The individual was slightly injured and is being treated at hospital, while police are investigating, Spain’s foreign ministry said.
It later added that Kyiv’s ambassador to Spain, Serhil Pohoreltsev, was the intended recipient of the envelope.  Ukraine has ramped up security at all of its embassies in response. 
 Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, said the life of the injured employee “is not at risk,” and descsribed the staffer’s position as “commandant.”

South Korea scrambles F-15k jets after Chinese and Russian warplanes cross its air defense identification zone 
South Korea’s military scrambled its jets after two Chinese and six Russian warplanes entered its air defense identification zone (KADIZ) without warning early Wednesday morning.  
Two Chinese H-6 bombers first crossed the air defense zone shortly before 5:50 am and proceeded to repeatedly fly over the KADIZ boundaries off of South Korea’s southern and northeast coasts the Joint Chief of Staff said, according to Seoul based news outlet Yonhap. 
After leaving South Korea’s KADIZ around 7 a.m., the two Chinese bombers returned some five hours later with Russian warplanes, including 4 TU-95 bombers and 2 SU-35 fighters, and flew over Seoul’s air defense identification zone through the Sea of Japan around 12:20 p.m.

The Defense Post: S. Korea, US to Expand Anti-Submarine Drills Amid North Korea Tension 
South Korean and American naval forces have discussed expanding their biennial anti-submarine warfare naval exercise amid North Korea’s growing missile threats, a US Navy official told The Korea Times. 
The planned expansion of the Silent Shark joint maritime exercise is a response to Pyongyang’s evolving submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) technology. 
In October, North Korea disclosed it “successfully” test-fired a KN-23 SLBM from a reservoir’s underwater launch site.  
According to the unnamed navy officer, the 2023 drill is expected to be well-attended, training participants in simulated settings involving Korean diesel-powered submarines and American nuclear-powered vessels.

Insider: Mysterious aircraft dropped bombs near a base for Russia's Wagner Group mercenaries fighting in Central African Republic 
* An unknown aircraft dropped bombs near a Wagner Group base in the Central African Republic. 
* It was unclear who targeted the Russia-linked mercenary group, which has fighters there. 
* Wagner personnel have been deployed to numerous battlefields, including in Ukraine.  
A mysterious aircraft that flew from an unknown destination dropped bombs this week near a base housing Russia-linked Wagner Group mercenaries in the Central African Republic, who responded with bursts of weapons fire that scared local residents.  
The attack occurred Monday morning local time at a base in Bossangoa, which is a town located in the middle of the country, nearly 200 miles north of the capital city Bangui, according to multiple reports. It was not immediately known where the aircraft came from, or from which entity it may belong to, nor was it clear how many casualties the group suffered.

BREMERTON — With the Thanksgiving leftovers barely consumed, 2,500 sailors headed out of Sinclair Inlet on the USS Nimitz on Monday morning for a months-long global deployment that begins just as the holiday season ramps up. 
Home just in time from its last training run to see kids don Halloween costumes, sailors who said farewell to loved ones this weekend will return in several months. The Navy declined to specify what global areas of operation the ship and its strike group will visit or how long it will be gone.

Washington Examiner: Netherlands to buy out and close 3,000 farms to meet climate goals 
The Dutch government is planning to buy out and close as many as 3,000 farms in the country, exacerbating an already-bitter dispute with growers as leaders attempt to halve the country’s nitrogen emissions by 2030. 
Leaders said last week they plan to allocate some $25 billion to the buyout plan, which they will use to purchase between 2,000 and 3,000 Dutch farms and other large nitrogen emitters "well over" their property values. 
If farmers do not agree to the plan, the buyouts could become compulsory. “There is no better offer coming,” Dutch Nitrogen Minister Christianne van der Wal told members of parliament last week.

WASHINGTON—U.S. government and congressional officials fear the conflict in Ukraine is exacerbating a nearly $19 billion backlog of weapons bound for Taiwan, further delaying efforts to arm the island as tensions with China escalate. 
The U.S. has pumped billions of dollars of weapons into Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February, taxing the capacity of the government and defense industry to keep up with a sudden demand to arm Kyiv in a conflict that isn’t expected to end soon. 
The flow of weapons to Ukraine is now running up against the longer-term demands of a U.S. strategy to arm Taiwan to help it defend itself against a possible invasion by China, according to congressional and government officials familiar with the matter.

WNU Editor: The arms that Taiwan is waiting for are Javelins, Stinger missiles, HIMARS, and howitzers. My advice to Taiwan is that they should look elsewhere for their arms. The US is tapped out because of their commitment to Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Five cars rented by Biden's Secret Service burst into FLAMES in Nantucket: Investigation into blaze with vehicles used by the first family 
* The vehicles that went up in flames were rented by the U.S. Secret Service during President Joe Biden's Thanksgiving vacation to Nantucket 
* Fire happened Monday in the parking lot of the Nantucket Memorial Airport – just one day after the president left the island to return to Washington, D.C. 
* The flames were just 40 feet from the airport's 25,000-gallon jet fuel tanks  
* One of the vehicles, a Ford Expedition, is under a manufacturer battery recall 
* The incident is now under investigation 
A fire near Nantucket Memorial Airport set ablaze at least five vehicles that were used by the Secret Service during President Joe Biden's Thanksgiving vacation on the wealthy Massachusetts island.
The vehicles are owned by Hertz and were just recently returned to the rental car company by USSS, according to sources who spoke with the Nantucket Current. 
The fire involving the rental cars occurred Monday – one day after Biden left Nantucket to return to the White House.

BAKHMUT, Ukraine — For almost an hour, the stream of Ukrainian casualties in the eastern city of Bakhmut seemed unending: Ambulances, an armored personnel carrier and private vehicles all screamed to a halt, one after another, and disgorged the wounded in front of the city’s only military hospital. 
A soldier propped up by his comrades, his face a mass of mangled flesh, walked in the main gate. The dark green stretcher that awaited him was one of several still covered in blood.  By around noon on Friday, doctors had counted 50 wounded, many of them soldiers. 
The day before was even worse: 240 people had come through the hospital’s doors with everything from gunshot wounds to shrapnel injuries and concussions.  “They came in batches — 10, 10, five, 10,” said Parus, one of the Ukrainian medics at the hospital, as artillery screeched overhead and the chatter of machine-gun fire echoed off the surrounding buildings. “In the last couple of days the Russians have tried to advance more intensely.”

Update #2: Fighting in east Ukraine descends into trench warfare as Russia seeks breakthrough (The Guardian)

What has changed recently is that Russian military forces are now getting involved in this battle, not the Russian mercenary Wagnar group that has waged much of the battle. Bottom line. It looks like this city will fall in the coming weeks.]]></summary>

VOA/Reuters: Russia Postpones Cairo Talks With US Under New START Nuclear Treaty 
Russia postponed nuclear weapons talks with the United States set to take place this week in Cairo, the U.S. State Department said on Monday, with neither side giving a reason for the postponement. 
Officials from the two countries were scheduled to meet in the Egyptian capital from Nov. 29 to Dec. 6 to discuss resuming inspections under the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty, which had been suspended in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
"The Russian side informed the United States that Russia has unilaterally postponed the meeting and stated that it would propose new dates," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

Belarus' foreign minister, Vladimir Makei — a longtime associate of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko — has died suddenly, aged 64. 
Belarusian authorities did not name the cause of death and Mr Makei was not known to suffer from any chronic illness.
 Prior to becoming foreign minister in 2012, Mr Makei served as Mr Lukashenko's chief of staff and, earlier, had worked as presidential adviser. 
Mr Lukashenko offered his condolences to Mr Makei's family, according to the presidential office.

The pullout proposed by General Sergei Surovikin, appointed last month to take overall charge of Russia's war effort, means Moscow is giving up a strategic city just north of annexed Crimea, the only Ukrainian provincial capital it had captured since its Feb. 24 invasion.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.

"Russian state media is following the midterm elections in the United States with great interest, but the mood in Moscow’s studios had noticeably soured in comparison to the fun-filled episodes of the years preceding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine," Davis reported. "While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.
