        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An informant who made derogatory claims about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter has been arrested by the FBI after a grand jury charged him with false statements and obstruction, reported Politico's Kyle Cheney on Thursday.
Alexander Smirnov, who was identified as a confidential human source in the investigation, was arrested at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas earlier this week, according to a statement released by the DOJ Thursday.
According to the indictment, Smirnov falsely claimed to FBI agents that executives at the Ukrainian industrial company Burisma told him they hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems," at a time when Biden was vice president and bribed both of them for their efforts.

At the time, Biden had been instrumental in pressuring Ukraine to remove prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, which Republicans have claimed was to prevent an investigation of Burisma. But this has been repeatedly debunked; Biden was acting in line with U.S. policy, Shokin was not planning to investigate Burisma, and international observers had accused him of corruption.
Per the DOJ statement, FBI officials became suspicious in part because Smirnov changed his story and provided different details when questioned at a later date.
This comes after a number of other failed Republican allegations against the Bidens, including a series of payments the younger Biden made to his father that turned out just to be repaying loans for a truck.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For half a century, during the Cold War, every U-S president painted Russia as the dominant threat. America's ideological opposite, a hostile and nuclear-armed power. Ronald Reagan went so far as to call the Soviet Union an Evil Empire.
So the events of recent days have been noteworthy. On top of a holdup of U-S aid for Ukraine, former President Trump said he might NOT come to the defense of a NATO ally who hadn't spent enough on defense.
And Tucker Carlson, the erstwhile Fox news host, flew to Moscow to sit down with Vladimir Putin for more than two hours of mostly softball questions. 
Afterward, he pronounced Putin "impressive" on stage at the World Government Summit.
So what gives? Why the romance between the American right and Russia?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Valentine's Day, you're under arrest!
Two Peruvian women accused of drug trafficking got more than they bargained for on Wednesday when a romantic gesture turned out to be a police raid leading to their arrests.
Police footage of the raid showed a giant teddy bear holding up gifts outside the women's home, while another officer held a heart-covered sign reading "You are my reason to smile".
One of the women rushed down the stairs to receive her offering.
But love can be deceiving, and the cuddly bear quickly sprang into action, tackling her to the ground. The second woman was arrested inside.
"It was a surprise operation for them as part of the day of love," the disguised officer later told AFP.
Police said the women, a mother and daughter, were part of a gang called "the drug cheats", and sold cocaine paste and marijuana from their home in northern Lima.
Hundreds of packages of drugs were seized at the location.
Peruvian police have become adept at disguises and operations launched on special dates to try to deceive and trap criminals.
The officers "disguised themselves using the teddy bear because drugs were sold there," Colonel Walter Palomino, head of the Green Squadron of the National Police, told AFP.
Peru is one of the world's biggest cocaine producers, yielding some 400 tonnes per year, according to official figures.
In 2023, authorities seized 21.5 tonnes of cocaine and dismantled 119 criminal networks linked to drug trafficking, according to the interior ministry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French yachtswoman has denied accusations of cheating in the last Vendee Globe solo non-stop round the world sailing race.
"We never cheated," Clarisse Cremer insisted on Thursday in a joint statement with her husband Tanguy Le Turquais.
They were responding to an anonymous e-mail sent to the French Sailing Federation (FFVoile) last Sunday.
In it Cremer was accused of using information relayed to her by the land-based Le Turquais to help plot her route during the 45,000-kilometre 2020/2021 Vendee Globe.
Outside assistance of this nature is strictly forbidden in the rules of the mythic race that sets out and finishes at the French port of Les Sables-d'Olonne every four years.
An international jury has been established to investigate the affair based on screenshots of WhatsApp conversations between the couple sent to the federation in Sunday's tip-off.
"During our chats which essentially concerned the intimacy between a couple, Tanguy never gave me the slightest bit of information that I didn't have already," insisted Cremer.
The 34-year-old, who skippered her yacht Banque Populaire into 12th, added: "No chat with him contributed to me changing course or making a strategic decision that would have had an impact on my race.
"All my performance decisions I made alone and without any assistance according to the rules."
The couple questioned the motive and timing of their anonymous accuser with the pair among the 44 candidates for the next Vendee Globe starting in November, with only 40 allowed to take part.
They are considering legal action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spanish farmers kept up their protests over the sector's troubles on Thursday, with tractors parked outside of the agriculture ministry in central Madrid before a meeting with Agriculture Minister Luis Planas.
Farmers slowly drove around 15 tractors, some decorated with Spanish flags, to the building which sits across the street from Madrid's busy Atocha train station, snarling traffic.
Once there they parked and unfurled banners that read "Farmers on a war path" and "Planas, the ruin of the countryside".
Around 250 farmers and agricultural union representatives gathered in the rain ahead of the meeting. Most had arrived by bus from other regions of Spain.
Planas was due to meet with Spain's main agricultural unions, Asaja, COAG and UPA, later on Thursday, a day after he met with the major players in the food supply chain
Farmers on Wednesday blocked roads across the country, especially in the south where they disrupted the first stage of a cycling race and in the northeastern region of Catalonia where they blocked parts of the AP-7 highway linking Spain and France.
Angry farmers have been protesting across Europe over rising costs, high fuel prices, bureaucracy and the environmental requirements in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its forthcoming "Green Deal".
Spanish farmers are also protesting low prices for their produce and the lack of financial aid to the sector.
The unions are planning a huge rally in front of the agriculture ministry on February 21, and will rally again in Madrid on February 26 to coincide with the meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels.
Often referred to as Europe's vegetable garden, Spain is one of the bloc's leading producers of salad, fruit and vegetables but its farms have suffered from a long-running drought in the Iberian Peninsula for the past three years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a test of new surface-to-sea missiles and warned that the country would take a more aggressive military posture in disputed sea boundaries with war-divided rival South Korea, the North’s state media said Thursday.
The report by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea's military said it detected the North firing multiple cruise missiles in waters off its eastern port of Wonsan. The test, the North’s sixth missile launch event of 2024, added to a provocative run in weapons demonstrations since 2022 that escalated tensions to the highest point in years.
Some experts say Kim may seek to further dial up pressure in an election year in South Korea and the United States. There are growing concerns in South Korea about a direct military provocation and a possible area of conflict could be the Koreas’ poorly drawn western sea boundary, which has been the site of several bloody skirmishes in past years.
Kim supervised the test launches of the missiles he described as key weapons for his navy. He also accused South Korea of frequently violating what he decried as North Korean territorial waters with its maritime patrols and interdiction of third-party ships. He ordered his navy to strengthen its defense posture in waters near the South Korean border islands of Baekryeong and Yeonpyeong, where a North Korean artillery bombardment killed four people in 2010.

Soon he is moving through the deserted corridors to open the doors of some of the most visited galleries in the world.
"There are exactly 2,797 keys... Each one has between one and five copies, so we have more than 10,000," said the 51-year-old Roman, who knows every lock by heart.
From Bramante's spiral staircase to the Gallery of Maps, Crea's silhouette weaves its way through the museums, between marble sculptures, Roman antiquities and Renaissance paintings.
In a few hours, thousands of tourists will be crowding into the museums' 1,400 rooms.

Kevin Kang'ethe had been detained in January pending extradition to the United States over the death of Margaret Mbitu, but he slipped out of a police station last week.
"We have re-arrested the suspect and he is now in custody," Nairobi police chief Adamson Bungei told AFP.
He said Kang'ethe had been hiding at a relative's home on the outskirts of Nairobi, where police found him late Tuesday after a days-long manhunt.
"He will now be taken to court to face charges of escaping from lawful custody as he awaits extradition."

For decades NATO has a nuclear deterrent that works for the Western military alliance, Stoltenberg said. "We should continue to ensure that it remains safe and reliable," he said.

        <updated>2024-02-14T13:24:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty on Wednesday by a Paris appeals court of illegal campaign financing over his failed 2012 re-election bid, confirming a previous ruling by a lower court.
He was sentenced to one-year year prison sentence, half of which is suspended, that can be served through alternative means like wearing an electronic bracelet without going to jail.

Sarkozy had been handed a one-year prison sentence in 2021 when first found guilty, though that was suspended while he launched his appeal.
Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, remained an influential figure among conservatives and is on friendly terms with President Emmanuel Macron - despite a string of trials and investigations linked to various legal issues surrounding his campaign finances.
He has always denied accusations that his party Les Republicains, then known as the UMP, worked with a public relations firm named Bygmalion to hide the true cost of his campaign - marked by lavish show events previously unseen in French politics. 
During a hearing, Sarkozy put the blame on some members of his campaign team: "I didn't choose any supplier, I didn't sign any quotation, any invoice," he told the court.
France sets strict limits on campaign spending. Prosecutors allege that the firm invoiced UMP rather than the campaign. They say Sarkozy spent 42.8 million euros on his 2012 campaign, almost double the permitted amount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debating eagerly in their classroom, Romanian teacher Gabriela Obodariu's pupils faced up to a hard question: if horrors like the Holocaust were to happen in their time, what part would they play?
Under the fascist regime that ruled their country, allied with the Nazis, would they have been bystanders, resistance fighters -- or torturers?
Romania killed hundreds of thousands of Jews during World War II, yet polls show that awareness of those atrocities today is extremely low. The lesson is part of a national drive to fix that.
"Such horrors didn't stop and won't stop," Obodariu, 56, told her students in the eastern city of Focsani.
Hers was part of a program of weekly classes on Jewish history and the Holocaust introduced into the curriculum in high schools all over Romania in September.

Office worker Nguyen Thi Ly respectfully placed a tray with sweets, water, money -- fake bills of both dong and US dollars -- and the familiar Valentine's roses on the altar at the Ha Pagoda.
"Please help me Buddha, I want to have a boyfriend this year to stop being single," she mumbled before the altar, already packed with dozens of other similar trays.
Vietnam is a communist state but Buddhist and Confucian traditions are still strong, with many people going to pray on the first, middle and last days of the lunar month for peace, luck and prosperity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tourists and Parisians have long been accustomed to the sight of wild rabbits frolicking around the lawns of the historic Invalides memorial complex, one of the French capital's great landmarks.
But efforts are underway to relocate the fluffy animals, accused of damaging the gardens and drains around the giant edifice that houses Napoleon's tomb, authorities said.
Police said that several dozen bunnies had been captured since late January and relocated to the private estate of Breau in the Seine-et-Marne region outside Paris, a move that has prompted an outcry from animal rights activists.
"Two operations have taken place since 25 January," the police prefecture told AFP on Tuesday.
"Twenty-four healthy rabbits were captured on each occasion and released after vaccination" in Seine-et-Marne, the prefecture said.
Six more operations are scheduled to take place in the coming weeks.
Around 300 wild rabbits live around Les Invalides, according to police estimates.
"The overpopulation on the site is leading to deteriorating living conditions and health risks," the prefecture said.
Authorities estimate the cost of restoring the site, which has been damaged by the proliferation of underground galleries and the deterioration of gardens, pipes and flora, at 366,000 euros ($391,000).
Animal rights groups denounced the operation.
The Paris Animaux Zoopolis group said the rabbits were being subjected to "intense stress" or could be killed "under the guise of relocation".
"A number of rabbits will die during capture and potentially during transport," said the group, accusing authorities of being "opaque" about their methods.
The animal rights group also noted that Breau was home to the headquarters of the Seine-et-Marne hunting federation.
The police prefecture insisted that the animals would not be hunted.
In 2021, authorities classified the rabbits living in Paris as a nuisance but the order was reversed following an outcry from animal groups who have been pushing for a peaceful cohabitation with the animals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Texas showdown on Twitter/X had Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) trading fire with scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton. 
The first shot came from Michael Quinn Sullivan who called out the senator for failing to protect the Southern Border. 
His tweet reads: "While Texans slept, @JohnCornyn sent $95 billion to help other countries with their border problems. Question: when was the last time Cornyn stayed up all night fighting for our border?"

Paxton piled on. 
"This is a question all Texans should be asking," according to his reply. "Unbelievable that @JohnCornyn would stay up all night to defend other countries borders, but not America."
So that had Cornyn landing a counterpunch. "Ken, your criminal defense lawyers are calling to suggest you spend less time pushing Russian propaganda and more time defending longstanding felony charges against you in Houston, as well as ongoing federal grand jury proceedings in San Antonio that will probably result in further criminal charges," according to the tweet. 
Paxton faced an impeachment effort stemming from a whistleblower lawsuit filed by four former senior employees claiming they were wrongfully terminated. 
They accused Paxton of axing them from their posts after reporting his suspected corruption to the FBI.
Those allegations eventually led to a Paxton impeachment vote on alleged bribery and abuse of office charges. 
He managed to get acquitted after a trial in the Senate.
However, the whistleblower lawsuit reportedly remains pending.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When House Republicans managed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by a single vote on Tuesday, two Democrats were missing from the House floor.
One of them, Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), soon revealed why she had been unable to attend on her X account.
"Unfortunately, I recently tested positive for COVID-19 and am isolating in accordance with CDC guidelines," Chu wrote. "Today, I was unable to be on the Floor to vote once again against impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. As I stated last week when this was first put to the House: impeaching a Cabinet member over policy disagreements isn't a solution to our broken immigration system."

"This is an abuse of power by House Republicans, and they degrade the oath they took to the Constitution to score cheap political points with their extremist MAGA base," she continued.
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the House under Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) adopted a proxy voting rule to handle precisely this situation, where members could cast votes on behalf of a lawmaker who was unable to attend. However, after the GOP won control of the House in 2022, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rescinded this policy.
The impeachment of Mayorkas, in which Republicans have remained vague about what high crimes or misdemeanors they are actually accusing him of, is expected to fail at trial in the Democratic-controlled Senate.]]></summary>

The problem, as others were quick to point out, is that the image was from when Trump was still in office and therefore has nothing to do with the current U.S. president.
"This is a photo from 2018 when Donald Trump was president," said Josh Schwerin, the communications director for Priorities USA.
Edwards responded to Schwerin, not acknowledging that he was in the wrong. Instead, he posted another purported border photo and wrote, "Satisfied?"
"I'm just here waiting on Community Notes to correct another Republican's lies," one X user wrote.
"From 2018. Guess who was president then? Nice try," another internet user wrote.
National security lawyer Bradley P. Moss also joined in the conversation, saying, "Impressive given that photo is from 2018."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has been impeached by the House — the first time this has happened to a cabinet member in over a century.
Republicans spearheaded the charge, arguing that Mayorkas was derelict in responsibilities to control migration at the southern border. However, their allegations have consistently been vague as to what law or laws he is supposedly violating or not enforcing.
DHS has been in charge of border patrol ever since the agency was founded in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

The matter now falls to the Senate, where it is exceedingly unlikely Mayorkas would face conviction if it comes for a vote due to the supermajority requirement.
This comes after the GOP's previous attempt to impeach Mayorkas earlier this month failed due to a series of absences and vacancies that they had not accounted for.
It also comes just after former President Donald Trump successfully pushed Republicans in the House and Senate to oppose a bipartisan border security agreement that would have given Mayorkas and the Joe Biden administration greater tools and stronger mandates to remove certain migrants and improve border security.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian activists on Tuesday stuck photographs of climate change devastation to a glass panel protecting Botticelli's famed Birth of Venus painting at the Uffizi museum in Florence.
Two activists from Last Generation posted images of a flooded Tuscan town over the goddess' giant shell on the 15th-century work, before being escorted to a police station, the campaign group said in a statement.
"The government continues to pretend that fields did not burn in January, that water will not be a problem this summer, that houses destroyed by floods are accidental events and not caused by human choices," one of the protesters, Giordano, was quoted as saying.
"And instead of dealing with these real problems, it makes absurd laws" punishing climate activism, he said.
Italy's parliament in January approved a law increasing penalties for people who damage monuments and cultural sites, following a series of climate protests.
In November, a judge in Florence ruled two activists who in 2022 glued their hands to the glass surrounding another Botticelli painting, also in the Uffizi, had not committed a crime.
The Last Generation organisation began carrying out peaceful but disruptive protests in Italy in 2022 ahead of the general election, urging politicians from all parties to make climate change their priority.
According to the European Commission, Italy is on track for significantly higher emissions than those set in its 2030 target.
The protests in Italy are part of a series of actions across Europe to focus attention on climate change.
Activists have thrown soup, cake, mashed potatoes and washable paint at heritage and culture sites and artworks in museums.

While Stewart talked about the recent special counsel report claiming Joe Biden had memory issues because he answered questions with "I don't recall," the host showed clips of Donald Trump and his adult children similarly answering questions.  
Co-hosts were annoyed that people look at the advanced age and don't factor in "intelligence" and the danger they said Donald Trump presents to the world. 
Joy Behar said that the other problem is that Biden has a stutter that he has had his whole life, and it makes him pause to make sure he doesn't stutter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been taking some Moscow-friendly votes lately, that apparently hasn't been enough to get him off of Russia's "most wanted" list.
Vice reports that leaked Russian Internal Affairs Ministry records show that Graham is one of several foreigners who have been singled out for arrest by Russian prosecutors, who have also issued warrants against Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Piotr Hofmański, the president of the International Criminal Court.
Interestingly, it appears that Graham's indictment relates to his strong support for the government of Ukraine in its war against Russia, despite the fact that Graham voted against an aid package for the country on Tuesday morning.

"Russian investigative reporters Mediazona found the database of 96,752 suspects could be accessed from the internet, then built a search tool to allow searches by name and discovered a large number of indicted foreigners," writes Vice. 
"These included foreign fighters supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, officials with the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Ukrainian officials and lawmakers in Baltic states that voted to remove Soviet memorials from World War Two."
In fact, the warrant for Estonian PM Kallas relates to her decision to support taking down a monument of a Russian tank that had been in the capital city Tallinn two years ago.
In addition to the arrest warrants for foreigners, the database also contains warrants for more than 31,000 Russian citizens.]]></summary>

Experts are worried. Due to the ongoing fight against HIV, syphilis has long been relegated to a much less talked about second place in French public health policy.

        <updated>2024-02-13T14:40:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who months ago pledged to stand by Ukraine and its efforts to repel invading Russian military forces, voted against passing military aid to Ukraine in the United States Senate on Tuesday morning.
In justifying his vote, Graham claimed that he opposed the package because it didn't do enough to address the migrant crisis on the southern border, despite the fact that Republicans had also killed a bipartisan deal aimed at tackling that exact crisis.
Many of Graham's critics were quick to pounce on his vote, which they noted went completely against his past declarations that supporting Ukraine was essential for American security.
"An incredible transformation that would have left his late friend John McCain aghast," commented journalist Michael Weiss. "Graham said backstage at an event I moderated in 2016 that he could not understand why the GOP didn’t just kick Trump out of the party."

Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-IL) was similarly stunned by Graham's embrace of hardcore Trumpian nationalism.
"No politician these past 8 years has emasculated themselves more than this one has," he declared.
Arnaud Castaignet, the vice president of Government Affairs and Public Relations at Skeleton Technologies, argued that Graham had shown himself to be utterly two-faced on aiding Ukraine.
"This man literally went to Kyiv 9 months ago and told Zelensky and Ukrainians, with a straight face, 'I will continue to stand with and for Ukraine’s freedom until every Russian soldier is expelled from Ukrainian territory,'" remarked Castaignet, who works out of Estonia. "Until Trump tells him not to."
This prompted Ret. Gen. Mark Hertling to discuss just how much Graham was helping to damage America's international alliances.
"For those who think our allies aren’t watching and are disgusted by the hypocrisy of US elected officials," he remarked.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
