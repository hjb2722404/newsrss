New York Times: 3 Nuclear Superpowers, Rather Than 2, Usher In a New Strategic Era 
WASHINGTON — On the Chinese coast, just 135 miles from Taiwan, Beijing is preparing to start a new reactor the Pentagon sees as delivering fuel for a vast expansion of China’s nuclear arsenal, potentially making it an atomic peer of the United States and Russia. The reactor, known as a fast breeder, excels at making plutonium, a top fuel of atom bombs. 
The nuclear material for the reactor is being supplied by Russia, whose Rosatom nuclear giant has in the past few months completed the delivery of 25 tons of highly enriched uranium to get production started. That deal means that Russia and China are now cooperating on a project that will aid their own nuclear modernizations and, by the Pentagon’s estimates, produce arsenals whose combined size could dwarf that of the United States.

 Newsweek: Multiple Russian Submarines Moving in 'Strange Routes,' U.K. Says 
Russian submarines have been traveling on "strange routes" that deviate from those deemed typical by Western defense officials, according to British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. 
Wallace said the U.K. had been tracking Russian submarines "in the North Atlantic and in the Irish Sea and in the North Sea doing some strange routes that they normally wouldn't do," Wallace said Tuesday while speaking to the media during a visit to Washington, D.C. The British Defence Ministry confirmed the remarks to Newsweek on Wednesday. 
Alarm bells have been ringing among NATO allies about Russia's underwater fleet, which one expert previously told Newsweek is "the critical challenge that the United States faces." There have been increasing indications of Russian submarines operating off U.S. and Mediterranean coasts, in what appear to be "Soviet-style submarine deployments" reminiscent of the Cold War.

Al Arabiya News: Raisi says Iran would ‘destroy’ Tel Aviv and Haifa if Israel attacks 
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi warned on Tuesday that any military action by Israel against Iran would result in the “destruction” of the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa. 
Raisi made the statement during a ceremony broadcast live on state television to mark Iran’s annual Army Day.

“The enemies, especially the Zionist regime, have understood that the smallest action against (Iran) will prompt a harsh response from the armed forces that will lead to the destruction of Haifa and Tel Aviv,” he said.

WNU Editor: According to EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell the current four top EU foreign policy priorities are .... values and rights (whatever that means), economic security (economic sanctions against China), Taiwan (that so happens to be on the otherside of the world), and Ukraine (who is not a member of the EU).

Washington Post: China readies supersonic spy drone unit, leaked document says 
The Chinese military could soon deploy a high-altitude spy drone that travels at least three times the speed of sound, according to a leaked U.S. military assessment, a development that would dramatically strengthen China’s ability to conduct surveillance operations. 
A secret document from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which has not previously been reported, shows the Chinese military is making technological advances that could help it target American warships around Taiwan and military bases in the region. 
The document features satellite imagery dated Aug. 9 that shows two WZ-8 rocket-propelled reconnaissance drones at an air base in eastern China, about 350 miles inland from Shanghai. The drones are a cutting-edge surveillance system that could help China gather real-time mapping data to inform strategy or carry out missile strikes in a future conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hill: The battle lines are being drawn for a war across East Asia involving Taiwan 
The United States has strengthened its defenses in East Asia by gaining year-around, permanent access to nine bases in the Philippines. These aren’t American bases, but U.S. troops can move freely in and out for exercises or, for that matter, in a real war.

The Philippines’ President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has reversed the policies of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who undermined the U.S.-Philippine alliance by courting China.

* Rice production for 2023 is set to log its largest shortfall in two decades, according to Fitch Solutions. 
* “At the global level, the most evident impact of the global rice deficit has been, and still is, decade-high rice prices,” Fitch Solutions’ commodities analyst Charles Hart told CNBC.

But for those who cannot, and the fact that these shortages are going to last into 2024, for many in Asia hard times are coming.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) -The death toll rose to 29 on Wednesday from a fire at a Beijing hospital that was one of the Chinese capital's deadliest in at least two decades, killing 26 patients and wounding dozens.
Social media showed dramatic videos of people using tied bed sheets to climb down the walls to escape smoke and flames after the fire broke out at Changfeng Hospital on Tuesday.
Broken and burned out windows could be seen at the site, where there were many police officers, some in plain clothes, Reuters witnesses said.
All but three of the 29 dead were patients, officials told a media briefing on Wednesday, with the fire having been put out in half an hour.
"There was a lot of smoke, I could see it," said an elderly local resident who gave only his surname, Li. He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.
Authorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.
Initial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.
By Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.
"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening," one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.
"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification."
Early on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.

The visit is Prince Faisal bin Farhan's first since the start of the civil war and follows the Syrian foreign minister's trip to Saudi Arabia last week. 
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan landed in Syria on Tuesday, the first such visit since the start of the civil war in 2011. The trip represents a continuing and significant shift in the kingdom’s policy toward Syria. 
Farhan was received by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The two discussed efforts towards finding a "political solution" to the Syria conflict that would "preserve Syria's unity, security, stability, Arab identity, and territorial integrity." They also talked about the "return of Syria to its Arab fold and the resumption of its natural role in the Arab world," according to a statement from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The superseding indictment alleges that Russian national Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov, founder of the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia (AGMR), used his organization under the direction of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and three Moscow-based intelligence officers to recruit, fund and direct pro-Kremlin propaganda within the U.S. with the help of four Florida-based activists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few dozen Holocaust survivors on Tuesday led a march in southern Poland to commemorate victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau, on the eve of the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
Every year, thousands of people from around the world -- both Jewish and not -- take part in the event held at the site of the former death camp built by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland.
One million European Jews died at the camp in the city of Oswiecim between 1940 and 1945 along with around 80,000 non-Jewish Poles, 25,000 Roma and 20,000 Soviet soldiers.
The camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.
The 35th edition of the March of the Living began with the doleful sound of the shofar -- a traditional Jewish ram's horn symbolizing freedom -- at the notorious "Arbeit Macht Frei" (Work Will Set You Free) gate at Auschwitz.
The three-kilometre march was notably attended this year by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch.
On Wednesday, Warsaw will commemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which broke out 80 years ago on April 19, 1943.
The presidents of Israel and Germany will be in attendance and are expected to visit the site of the former Jewish district.
The Germans confined up to 450,000 Jews to an area of just over three square kilometers -- most of whom died of starvation or disease inside or were taken to a death camp to the east of Warsaw.

Magar, 43, stepped on an improvised explosive device in 2010 while serving in Afghanistan with the Brigade of Gurkhas -- a unit of Nepalis recruited into the British Army.
After years of rehabilitation and training, next month he plans to summit the world's highest mountain, an endeavor promoted on his website under the slogan "no legs, no limits".
If successful, the expedition will make him the first double above-the-knee amputee to see the world from the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak.

But I'll tell you straight up: you won't silence me.” On the night of October 16, Moreno was shot dead by two men on a motorcycle in Montelibano, a small rural town in northern Colombia’s Cordoba department, one of the most marginalised and violent parts of the country. Moreno worked there as director of online news outlet Voces de Cordoba, in which he regularly exposed corruption, embezzlement and the activities of illegal armed groups.


	Moreno was investigating the installation of a mine on property belonging to a senator; according to him, resources were being extracted from it for public construction projects.

Forbidden Stories, an international consortium of investigative journalists offering to protect the work of colleagues under threat. Moreno told the group he wanted his investigations to be pursued and published worldwide if anything happened to him.


	For six months, a group of some 30 reporters co-ordinated by Forbidden Stories have taken over Moreno’s investigations, including journalists from FRANCE 24 and its sister service Radio France International, examining hundreds of documents and emails that Rafael had not yet made public to uncover a system of wide-scale clientelism and endemic corruption.

The DUP, which supports Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK, has been boycotting the divided territory's government at Stormont over post-Brexit trading arrangements agreed with the European Union.

Lula's meeting with Sergei Lavrov in Brasilia follows state visits to China and the Middle East, during which he said the United States should "stop encouraging war and start talking about peace" in Ukraine.
He also claimed that Kyiv shares the blame for the conflict, which began when Russian forces poured into Ukraine in February 2022.
Lula's remarks echoed a line frequently used by Moscow and its strategic ally Beijing, which blame the West for the war.
China seeks to position itself as neutral on the Ukraine war, but has maintained its partnership with Moscow and refrained from imposing sanctions.

Kiev is reportedly expected to launch a push against Russian forces at the end of this month  
The start of Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian troops has been planned for April 30, Newsweek reported on Sunday, citing a leaked Pentagon document. 
Dated February 28, the file details equipment deliveries and a training schedule for nine brigades that “can be generated for the spring counteroffensive” with the help of the US and its allies. Three additional brigades are expected to be gathered “internally” in Ukraine, according to the file. 
Out of the nine brigades trained and equipped by Western countries, six will be ready by March 31, while the “final” three will be ready by April 30, the document claimed.

DW: Sweden starts largest military exercise in over 25 years 
More than 26,000 soldiers from 14 countries, including the US and European members of NATO, are taking part in Sweden's largest military drill in decades. 
Swedish authorities launched military exercise Aurora 23 on Monday, starting weeks of drills "in the air, on ground and at sea," according to a statement from the Swedish Armed Forces. 
Aurora 23 is the biggest exercise in Sweden in more than 25 years, and will run until May 11. 
 Soldiers from the US, the UK, France, Germany and neighboring Nordic nations are all taking part in the drills. The exercise aims to train the troops for the event of a major armed attack on Sweden.

Bloomberg: Taiwan to Buy 400 US Anti-Ship Missiles Intended to Repel a China Invasion 
(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan will buy as many as 400 land-launched Harpoon missiles intended to repel a potential Chinese invasion, completing a deal that Congress approved in 2020, according to a trade group’s leader and people familiar with the issue. 
Taiwan has previously purchased ship-launched versions of the Harpoon, which is made by Boeing Co. Now, a contract with Boeing issued on Taiwan’s behalf by the US Naval Air Systems Command marks a first for the mobile, land-launched version, according to Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council. Three other people familiar with the deal, including an industry official, confirmed the contract is for Taiwan. 
The Pentagon announced the $1.7 billion contract with Boeing on April 7 but made no mention of Taiwan as the purchaser. The deal comes as US-China tensions are high, particularly over Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as part of its territory. China held military drills around Taiwan after its president met in California this month with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

Politico: Russia jamming U.S. smart bombs in Ukraine, leaked docs say

 
A separate technical problem, since fixed, had been causing the munitions to fail. 
American-made smart bombs are falling victim to Russian electronic jamming in Ukraine, causing them to miss their targets, according to leaked documents and confirmed by a Defense Department official. 
 In some cases, the weapons were also failing to detonate due to a technical issue, which Ukrainian troops have since addressed. 
The news adds to an increasingly bleak picture of the state of Ukraine’s military that has emerged from a trove of top secret intelligence documents that leaked on social media and came to light over the past week.

The word ‘stealth’ in military parlance conjures up a vision of Hollywood star Kevin Bacon going invisible during a scientific test in the film Hollow Man released in 2020, or Hollywood actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen acquires the ability to go invisible in the 2022 film Invisible Man.

Major powers have already spent billions of US dollars, viz China, Russia, and the US, towards R&D in this field and producing operational aircraft. USA took the lead by manufacturing F-117, F-22, F-35, and B-2 and to-be inducted strategic bomber B-21. China and Russia have miles to go.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea, the United States and Japan staged joint naval missile defence exercises on Monday to improve responses to North Korean threats, as Pyongyang accused Washington of ramping up "nuclear blackmail" with military drills.

Merkel, who led Europe's biggest economy from 2005 to 2021, was presented with the special class Grand Cross by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday evening.

Reuters: ANALYSIS-China's intensifying nuclear-armed submarine patrols add complexity for U.S., allies 
HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters) - China is for the first time keeping at least one nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine constantly at sea, according to a Pentagon report - adding pressure on the United States and its allies as they try to counter Beijing's growing military.

SCMP: China claims another success in midcourse ballistic missile interception test 
* Test carried out within country's territory is sixth success of its kind and 'accomplished its objectives', defence ministry says 
* China needs to carry out repeated tests to improve technology and be able to hit multi-warhead targets, expert observes 
China successfully tested a ground-based midcourse ballistic missile interception, the defence ministry announced on Friday. 
The result brought the number of such missile interceptions to at least six. 
Friday's test took place within Chinese territory and space and "accomplished its objectives", according to a statement from the ministry. 
"This test is defensive in nature and it does not target any particular country," the statement added, without elaborating.

DF-17 Dongfeng medium-range ballistic missiles equipped with a DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, involved in an October 2019 military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Republic. The DF-27 is a new and improved version of the DF-17

 
Daily Mail: Leaked Pentagon files show China successfully tested new hypersonic ICBM which can evade US defenses 
* Among the classified documents leaked by Jack Teixeira was a February 28 top-secret report by the Joint Chiefs of Staff intelligence directorate 
* The document said that on February 25, China had successfully tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile called the DF-27 
* The DF-27 'possesses a high probability of penetrating US' missile defenses, the secret report said 
Pentagon files allegedly leaked by Jack Teixeira include a deeply troubling report about China's hypersonic missile program, and the revelation that a new missile believed to be capable of evading U.S. defenses has been successfully tested. 
Teixeira, 21, was arrested on Thursday at his home in Massachusetts. 
He is believed to have shared hundreds of classified documents with friends on a Discord chat room between the fall and mid March.

Among them was a February 28 top-secret report from the Joint Chiefs of Staff intelligence directorate, The Washington Post reported.

Reuters: China 'greatest threat' to Dutch economic security, Dutch intelligence says

While the Netherlands regards China as a major trading partner, its military ambitions are driving attempts to obtain Dutch and Western technologies, the agency known by its acronym AIVD, said in its 2022 annual report.
"Chinese companies and knowledge institutions sometimes are valued partners for Dutch institutions. At the same time, the country forms the greatest threat to Dutch economic security," the agency said.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
