(Bloomberg) -- The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank warned of a rising risk of a global recession as advanced economies slow and faster inflation forces the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, adding to the debt pressures on developing nations. 
In the US, the world’s largest economy, the labor market is still very strong but is losing momentum because the impact of higher borrowing costs is “starting to bite,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Monday. 
The euro zone is slowing as natural gas prices soar, as is China due to Covid-19 disruptions and volatility in the housing sector.  The IMF calculates that about one-third of the world economy will have at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this year and next, and that the lost output through 2026 will be $4 trillion.

Putin let rip with 83 missiles at what he claimed were military, energy and communications networks in Ukraine. 
Kyiv said the missiles actually hit power plants and busy civilian areas in major cities, killing at least 11 and wounding scores more. It was Russia's largest single barrage since the opening day of the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The websites for a number of major US airports were briefly taken offline Monday after a cyberattack promoted by a pro-Russian hacking group.
The distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks hit the airport websites of several major US cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and St Louis.
A DDOS attack involves knocking a website offline by flooding it with traffic.
The airport websites were targeted after the pro-Russian hacking group known as "KillNet" published a list of sites and encouraged its followers to attack them.
The DDOS attacks only affected the public-facing websites of the airports, which supply flight and services information and do not have any impact on operations.
Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport said its website is "up and running after an incident early this morning that made it inaccessible to the public."
"An investigation into the cause of the incident is underway," it said. "At no time were operations at the airport impacted."Most of the airport websites targeted appeared to be functioning normally after being temporarily knocked offline.
KillNet claimed responsibility last week for attacks on a number of US state government websites, and it has taken aim at other countries opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
There was no immediate comment from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently floated a new "compromise" intended to keep peace between Taiwan and China -- and it is being given the same kind of hostile reception that politicians in Ukraine recently gave to his proposed "peace plan" with Russia.
As CNBC reports, Musk told the Financial Times over the weekend that the United States should endorse some kind of plan that gives Beijing some administrative control over Taiwan.
Specifically, Musk said America should "be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy.”
“And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong," Musk added.
However, Taiwanese diplomat Hsiao Bi-khim immediately shot down Musk's proposal, which had received a friendly reception from Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the United States.

"Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale," she said. "Any lasting proposal for our future must be determined peacefully, free from coercion, and respectful of the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan.
Bates Gill of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis similarly told CNBC that there is little desire among people in Taiwan to have any such arrangement, especially after watching how China slowly destroyed freedoms that had existed previously in the city of Hong Kong.
"The world’s wealthiest man obviously feels he has a lot to say on these geopolitical questions," explained Gill. "I would only suggest that he take a lot harder look at the realities, the historical precedents and geopolitical contestation that surround all of these questions before giving us all a lesson in diplomacy."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several cities across Ukraine were rocked with explosions in what some are calling the most extensive attack on the country since Russia launched its invasion in February. 
"This morning, a massive high-precision strike was conducted on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, military command, and communications," said Russian President Vladimir Putin. "In case Ukrainian terrorist attacks continue on Russian territory, our response will be tough and proportional."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the strikes disproportionately targeted civilian infrastructure in 11 of Ukraine's 25 regions. 
"It's a tough morning when you're dealing with terrorists," said Zelenskyy in the video. "They're choosing targets to harm as many people as possible."

BBC reporter Hugo Bachega was broadcasting live from Kyiv when when the first rounds of the strikes came in, causing him to duck for cover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia on Monday launched a series of missiles into cities across Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson doesn't believe that any new initiative will help the country succeed in its goals of taking and holding Ukrainian territory.
While speaking on CNN, Anderson broke down news that Russian General Sergey Surovikin would be taking over as head of the Kremlin's "special military operation" in Ukraine, which in recent weeks has been hit with multiple humiliating setbacks.
While Surovikin has a well earned reputation as a hardliner, Anderson was skeptical he could turn things around given the current state of Russia's military.
"I don't think there's going to be a new approach because he's incapable of doing a new approach as long as the Russian army is what it is, which is a terrible army," he said.
IN OTHER NEWS: Trump sounded 'guilty and scared' during his latest rally rant: Former federal prosecutor
Later in the segment, Anderson elaborated on why new leadership won't be nearly enough to fix what's broken in the Russian military.
"It's not like the soldiers are going to jump into a phone booth and come out as Superman," he said. "They have a terrible army. They're ten years away from having a good army that can take on the Ukrainians and achieve the military objectives they wanted. They have a low morale... They're incapable of executing the military operations that Vladimir Putin wants. George Patton couldn't make this a success for Putin."

In Iran no-one who expresses dissent from the ruling theocratic system, including the famous, is safe from being caught in the dragnet of a crackdown that has seen hundreds arrested in more than three weeks of protests.
Activists say that when the unrest erupted last month over the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested by the notorious morality police, the authorities initially resorted to lethal force, killing dozens in the space of days.
But, as well as keeping up the threat of force, authorities are increasingly resorting to arrests, with a particular focus on those who promote videos of protests or anti-regime messages on social media.

Among Secretary-General António Guterres’ proposals in a letter to the Security Council: the quick deployment of a rapid-action armed force to Haiti, made up of military personnel from one or more foreign nations, to help the Haiti National Police get fuel and water flowing in the country again.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen's slide to a 24-year low.

The Netherlands will not continue to exploit the Groningen gas field because of the resulting earthquakes that impact those living in the area, Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists in Prague on Thursday. 
Groningen is one of the world’s largest gas fields and has been described as “the only potential game-changer in Europe” to replace the increasingly disrupted gas supply from Russia. 
The giant Dutch gas field once produced more than 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas yearly – equivalent to 10% of the EU’s consumption – but its production has now been capped due to earthquakes, EURACTIV reported.

Update: Dutch limit Groningen gas production despite energy crisis (Reuters)   
WNU editor: The Groningen gas field is massive. At its peak it was producing 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas yearly. This compares with Nord Stream 1 that use to send 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas yearly. 
 So why did the Dutch government shut down the field?  It is all about earthquakes (link here).]]></summary>

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea's recent missile tests were "tactical nuclear" drills personally overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, state media said Monday, adding the launches were a response to US-led joint military exercises in the region.
Kim has long wanted to develop tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021.
The country revised its nuclear laws last month, envisaging a wide array of scenarios in which it could use its nukes, with Kim declaring North Korea an "irreversible" nuclear power -- effectively ending the possibility of denuclearisation talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen secured a second six-year term in office by obtaining more than 50% of the vote in an election on Sunday to avoid a runoff, initial projections issued soon after voting closed showed.
A projection by pollster SORA for national broadcaster ORF based on a partial vote count put Van der Bellen, a 78-year-old former leader of the Greens, on 54.6% with a margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. His nearest rival was far-right Freedom Party candidate Walter Rosenkranz on 18.9%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Julia slammed into Nicaragua on Sunday carrying top winds of up to 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and a storm surge, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, warning of dangerous weather in the coming days across the region.
The storm made landfall early on Sunday near Laguna de Perlas, the NHC said. By 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) it was around 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of Bluefields.
The hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it crosses Nicaragua, emerging over the eastern Pacific by Sunday night. It was forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night, the NHC said.
"Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides possible from heavy rains over Central America and Southern Mexico through early next week," the center said.

Russian aircraft launched at least 12 missiles into Zaporizhzhia in the latest strike, partially destroying a nine-storey apartment block, leveling five other residential buildings and damaging many more, said Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region.

The North on Thursday fired two short-range ballistic missiles, one of which is assumed to be the KN-25.   
CNN: North Korea fires two ballistic missiles, South Korea and Japan say 
North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles from the Munchon area of Kangwon Province to the waters off the peninsula’s eastern coast, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters on Sunday. 
The missiles were launched between 1:47 a.m. and 1:53 a.m. local time Sunday, according to Japan’s State Minister of Defense Toshiro Ino.  Both missiles fell outside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone, Ino added. 
The first missile is estimated to have flown about 350 kilometers, or 217 miles, at a maximum altitude of approximately 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, according to Ino. The second traveled about the same distance.

Monday, Kim Kardashian    suddenly created his first podcast, The system.  This is a Spotify-exclusive show that aims to serve as an audio compendium of Kardashian’s work helping those wrongfully convicted.
In a conversation last month with magazine interviewKardashian revealed in passing that she was recording this new podcast for Spotify, but had not announced a release date.
His initial contract with Spotify was signed in 2020 and as we have seen with other celebrities, it often takes years before they close the deal.
Take Meghan Markle for example.  Although she signed an exclusive deal with Spotify in December 2020, her first contracted podcast, Archetypeswas not created until August…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANU astrophysicist and cosmologist Dr Brad Tucker says the SpaceX Crew 5 mission launched early Thursday shows launches are “becoming quite regular” for the company.

“They’re doing this five-to-six-month rotations on behalf of NASA, so they send the astronauts up, they do experiments, conduct operations on the International Space Station,” he told Sky News Australia.

Dr Tucker said this mission marks the first time a Native American woman has gone into space and a Russian cosmonaut was on board.

“In the past, these missions, these, kind of, stays, have been taking Americans, Russians and a few other countries together,” he said. 

“Obviously, with the war in Ukraine tensions have been high – even in space – and we’ve seen Americans still going with the Russians on the Russian capsule but this is the first time a Russian has gone on a SpaceX capsule.

“It’s as much a good sign for science as it is international peace and diplomacy”.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first two women in line for Donald Trump's rally in Minden, Nevada voiced her support for both Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán during an interview ahead of the former president's speech.
The woman is one of the "Front Row Joes" that travel from rally to rally, much like deadheads used to "tour" with the Grateful Dead.
Three "Front Row Joes" were interviewed by Right Side Broadcasting Network. One of the women wore a "MAGA King" hat. One of the first two women in line, from Michigan, said she had been to 71 rallies.
The other, from Arkansas, said she had been to 25 rallies.
She said Orbán is "very good" and was asked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"I love Putin," she said.
"He's a good, good president," she said. "Number two after president one, number two. I love him."
She was wearing a "fake media is the virus" T-shirt. The women said they were going to drive over 750 miles overnight to attend Trump's Sunday rally in Mesa, Arizona.
