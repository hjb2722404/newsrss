        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo says his move back to Manchester United hasn’t been what he’d hoped for as there is “instability” within the club.

The football star addressed specific issues that hadn’t changed since 2009 when he first decided to part ways with the club.

“Everything was so fast, but what surprised me a lot (was) instability in the club; everything was kind of the same,” he told Sky News Australia host Piers Morgan during an exclusive interview.

Ronaldo is under contract with Manchester United until 2023; however, he’s expressed his interest in leaving the club at the end of the year as the next transfer window is set to open in the next couple of months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says the conviction of three men involved in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 is a “very important verdict”. 

A Dutch court has found two Russians and one Ukrainian guilty and handed down life sentences, while one suspect was acquitted.

“There are steps to ensure justice is thoroughly done, and that would require the individuals who've been convicted to actually serve the sentences that have been handed down,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia. 

“This, of course, is not everything that families could wish for, and their pain will never, ever go away, but it is a very important day.”]]></summary>

A Dutch court has found three men guilty of murder over the shooting down of MH17 in Ukraine in 2014. 

“The men were serving members of the Russian military,” Ms Bishop told Sky News Australia. 

“And I, and many others, vowed that we would get justice for the family.

“There are guilty verdicts, but Russia still must admit its responsibility for this heinous crime.”]]></summary>

Newsweek: U.S. NASAMS Having 100% Success Rate in Stopping Russian Missiles: Pentagon 
Air defense systems provided by the U.S. have had a perfect strike rate in intercepting Russian missiles fired into Ukraine, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said. 
As Moscow continues to fire rockets at Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure, Austin praised the efficacy of the NASAMS (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) that the U.S. has supplied as part of its military support for Kyiv. 
Austin told a briefing on Wednesday that the systems sent to Ukraine "are now operational, and their performance so far has been very impressive.
"  "The NASAMS systems had a 100 percent success rate in intercepting Russian missiles as the Kremlin continues its ruthless bombardment of Ukraine," he said.

Biden wants to reevaluate Saudi Arabia policy. Here are four questions to guide the review.
 President Joe Biden wants a re-evaluation of the United States’s policy toward Saudi Arabia. 
In early October, the kingdom announced that, together with the OPEC+, it would cut oil production, effectively raising gas prices and siding with Russia’s best interests. After almost two years of navigating the difficult relationship with the oil-rich autocracy, it was the event that pushed Biden to say, “There’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done, with Russia.”

Reuters: Black Sea grain export deal extended, but Russia wants more on fertiliser exports 
Nov 17 (Reuters) - A deal aimed at easing global food shortages by facilitating Ukraine's agricultural exports from its southern Black Sea ports was extended for 120 days on Thursday, though Moscow said its own demands were yet to be fully addressed. 
The agreement, initially reached in July, created a protected sea transit corridor and was designed to alleviate global food shortages by allowing exports to resume from three ports in Ukraine, a major producer of grains and oilseeds. 
"I welcome the agreement by all parties to continue the Black Sea grain initiative to facilitate the safe navigation of export of grain, foodstuffs and fertilizers from Ukraine," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised by this grain export deal extension. Turkey wants this deal to continue, and Russia wants good ties with Turkey. 
But Western sanctions that block developing countries from purchasing fertilizer from Belarus and Russia is what is causing the most harm on global food supplies. Especially in Africa, where they can only buy this fertilizer using Western banks, but Western banks are prohibited from dealing with Russia and Belarus. Talk about being caught in a Catch-22 position.

 London — Britain faces major security threats from the trio of Russia, China and Iran, which all use coercion, intimidation and violence to pursue their interests, the U.K.'s domestic intelligence spy chief said Wednesday. 
Ken McCallum, director-general of MI5, added to mounting warnings from British authorities about Russia's aggression and China's growing assertiveness. 
He also singled out Iran as a mounting concern, saying U.K authorities have uncovered at least 10 "potential threats" this year to "kidnap or even kill British or U.K.-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime." 
 He said Iran's intelligence services "are prepared to take reckless action" against opponents, both on Western soil and by luring people to Iran.

World Beyond War has launched a new online tool that allows the user to view a globe pock-marked with 867 U.S. military bases in countries other than the United States, and to zoom in for a satellite view of and detailed information on each base. The tool also allows filtering the map or list of bases by country, government type, opening date, number of personnel, or acres of land occupied. 
This visual database was researched and developed by World Beyond War to help journalists, activists, researchers, and individual readers understand the immense problem of excessive preparation for war, which inevitably leads to international bullying, meddling, threats, escalation, and mass atrocity.

Washington Post: CIA director met Zelensky in Kyiv as Russian missiles targeted capital 
CIA Director William J. Burns met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday, reaffirming U.S. support for the country on the same day Russian missiles pummeled the capital and sent residents fleeing for cover. 
The visit came at a moment of Ukrainian triumph, days after its forces liberated the city of Kherson and Zelensky declared a turning point in the war. But it was a moment of extraordinary tension and uncertainty, too, as a Russian-made missile appeared to land in Poland, raising the question of how the NATO alliance might respond to a possible attack on a member state.

The Hill: Milley tried to speak with Russian counterpart on Tuesday but was ‘unsuccessful’ 
 Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley attempted to speak with his Russian counterpart on Tuesday following a missile-caused explosion in Poland but was unable to get through, the top military official revealed Wednesday. 
Milley said his staff tried to connect him with Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov but they were “unsuccessful in getting me linked up.” 
 He instead spoke several times with his Ukrainian counterpart, with his Polish counterpart and with other chiefs of defense in Europe, Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. 

U.S. officials are still waiting on more information as to the exact origin of a Soviet-era missile that struck within Poland’s borders on Tuesday, killing two.

“It’s visible on the streets,” Mr Lea said. 

The apparent willingness of China’s President Xi Jinping to talk with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Joe Biden at the G20 conference in Bali is raising hope it could lead to a thawing of relations between China and the West. 

However, the tension between China and Taiwan has only escalated significantly in the past months with the visit of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island and subsequent military drills conducted by both countries.]]></summary>

Newsweek: Zelensky Accused of Trying to Start World War III Over Missile Strike 
Several social media users accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of attempting to lead the world into a new war over a missile strike that hit Poland and left two individuals dead.
"UKRAINE tried to start WW3 yesterday when a UKRAINIAN missile struck a NATO country and killed innocent civilians. Ukrainian leaders LIED and BLAMED RUSSIA. The AP wrote it up unquestioningly," conservative commentator Benny Johnson wrote on Twitter. "Ukrainian Leaders LIED to try and initiate full-blown WW3. These are the facts." 
The tweet comes shortly after there were reports that a "Russian-made" missile struck Polish territory near the area of Przewodow. Following the reports, Zelensky said that it was a "really significant escalation" amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.

Update: Poland Missile Attack Triggers Surprise Clash as Blame Game Spirals (Daily Beast)   
WNU Editor: Ukraine President Zelensky is not trying to start World War III over this missile strike. But he does want more aid and direct involvement from the West. 
But if he wants more aid he should stop claiming that yesterday's missile strike was not caused by a Ukrainian missile .... Zelenskyy doubles down and pushes back on Western assessments that a Ukrainian missile killed 2 in Poland (Insider). More here .... Zelensky insists missile that hit Poland was not Ukrainian (The Hill). Pushing this narrative after NATO said it was not a Russian missile is making him look desperate, and in turn it is making some people in the West nervous.]]></summary>

While Europe has been keeping a generally optimistic facade ahead of the coming cold winter, signaling that it has more than enough gas in storage to make up for loss of Russian supply even in a "coldest-case" scenario, behind the scenes Europe's largest economy is quietly preparing for a worst case scenario which include angry mobs and bankruns should blackouts prevent the population from accessing cash. 
As Reuters reports citing four sources, German authorities have stepped up preparations for emergency cash deliveries in case of a blackout (or rather blackouts) to keep the economy running, as the nation braces for possible power cuts arising from the war in Ukraine. The plans include the Bundesbank hoarding extra billions to cope with a surge in demand, as well as "possible limits on withdrawals", one of the people said.

WNU Editor: I think Germany will do OK this winter. Energy prices and the general cost of living will be high for everyone, but unrest and protests will be limited. I am more worried about next winter, when there is no Russian gas to top off your storage tanks, and everyone around the world is in a scramble to grab what they can.]]></summary>

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Falls into Recession 
Russia's economy has entered a recession as gross domestic output fell by four percent in the third quarter, according to first estimates published Wednesday by the national statistics agency, Rosstat. 
The drop in GDP follows a similar four percent contraction in the second quarter, as Western sanctions pummel Russia's economy following Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. 
The four percent drop in economic output between July and September was less than the 4.5 percent contraction analysts had expected.  The contraction was driven by a 22.6 percent plunge in wholesale trade and a 9.1 percent drop in retail trade. 
On the bright side, construction grew by 6.7 percent and agriculture by 6.2 percent.

Update #2: Russia enters recession, GDP shrinks 4% in third quarter (WION)                                                                                                                                                   
WNU Editor: I have said it many times in the past. Russia's economy is weird. 
The economy is in recession but everyone is working. The ruble is one of the strongest currencies in the world, even though the West has imposed comprehensive sanctions. The country is so filthy rich when it comes to resources that I think only the surface has so far been scratched, and there are buyers for everything that is produced. There is no government debt (it actually has a surplus). And everyone has a side hustle that I know is off the books even though I would estimate it represents a fifth of the economy.]]></summary>

Reuters: Germany Rejects No-Fly Zone, Could Lead to NATO-Russia Confrontation 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Establishing a no-fly zone would pose a threat of direct confrontation between Russia and NATO, a German government spokesperson said, after a missile blast in Poland near the Ukrainian border killed two people on Tuesday. 
The spokesperson rejected this and said, "Together with all our allies we are agreed that we want to avoid a further escalation of this war in Ukraine." 
 Berlin will offer support to the Polish air defence, a spokesperson for the defence ministry said at a regular news conference on Wednesday. 
The NATO meeting following Tuesday's blast was not based on the article 4 of the alliance's founding treaty, under which members can bring any issue of concern for discussion, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.

Update: No-fly zone over Ukraine not on the table – Germany (RT)   
WNU Editor: After yesterday's missile strike in Poland talk about imposing a no-fly zone were making the rounds in the media and, I can presume, among EU diplomats and politicians. Fortunately the German government has killed this idea. Imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine will only lead to one thing .... a war between NATO and Russia that will probably lead to a nuclear exchange.]]></summary>

Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Wednesday that the explosion that killed two people near the country's border with Ukraine appears to be an "unfortunate accident," not an "intentional attack."   
The big picture: Duda said it was "very likely" the explosion was caused by Ukrainian air defenses. The missile "unfortunately fell on Polish territory" as Ukraine defended itself against Russian strikes, he said. 
* Duda added that the projectile that caused the blast was "most likely" Russian-made, but officials have "no proof at the moment that it was a missile fired by the Russian side." 
* Ukraine has previously denied it was to blame for the blast and accused Moscow of a "serious escalation." Russia also denied responsibility.

Russia launched a fresh wave of missile attacks targeting cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian authorities, as the war-torn country prepares for winter and the challenges it will bring. 
At least a dozen regions throughout Ukraine reported strikes on Tuesday, some of which experienced emergency blackouts because of the damage, the Associated Press said. 
The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv was among the areas reportedly hit. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko wrote on Telegram Tuesday that two residential buildings in the city's Pechersk District were hit but said several incoming missiles were shot down by air defense over Kyiv. 
In a later Telegram post, Klitschko wrote that another multistory building in the same district was struck.

Satellite monitors discovered two vessels with their trackers turned off in the area of the pipeline prior to the suspected sabotage in September. 
The first gas leaks on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea were detected in the early hours of September 26, pouring up to 400,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere. Officials immediately suspected sabotage of the international pipeline. 
New analysis seen by WIRED shows that two large ships, with their trackers off, appeared around the leak sites in the days immediately before they were detected.

   The Hill: Biden: ‘Unlikely’ missile that hit Poland was fired from Russia, pending investigation 
President Biden on Tuesday said it initially appears unlikely that a missile that hit a rural town in Poland near the Ukraine border was fired from Russia, but he said a final determination is pending a full investigation into the incident. 
“There is preliminary information that contests that,” Biden told reporters when asked whether the missile was fired from Russia. “I don’t want to say until we completely investigate. It’s unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia.”

Politico: U.S. scrambles to reassure Ukraine after Milley comments on negotiations 
The top general's remarks about a “window” for talks angered Ukrainian officials, people familiar with the matter said. The Biden administration is in damage control mode after a top U.S. general said a window for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow could open this winter, with senior officials scrambling to assure Ukraine it wasn’t undercutting its goal of expelling the Russians. 
Specifically, senior U.S. officials are telling their counterparts in Ukraine that the expected winter fighting pause doesn’t mean talks should happen imminently. Instead, they’re relaying that Washington will continue to support Kyiv’s militarily as it launches the next phase of advances on the battlefield, according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials familiar with the outreach.

CNBC: Polish president says apparent missile strike in Poland was ‘isolated incident,’ but notes the ‘North Atlantic Alliance is on standby’ 
* President Andrzej Duda of Poland said his government doesn’t yet conclusively know who fired a missile that struck Polish territory late Tuesday, killing two civilians. 
* Duda added that Poland has “strengthened the readiness of the Polish armed forces, including the air defense. Our planes will be supported by allied planes. We act calmly and prudently.” 
The president of Poland said his government doesn’t yet conclusively know who fired a missile that struck Polish territory late Tuesday, killing two civilians. 
The explosion, which took place about 15 miles (24 km) from the Ukrainian border, came as Russia was launching a massive wave of missiles at Ukrainian cities and energy facilities just before dusk local time. 
President Andrzej Duda said the projectile was “Russian-made” and variously referred to it as either a missile or a rocket. 
“What happened was an isolated incident,” said Duda, who added that an investigation is underway. “There is no indication that more will take place”

Local media is reporting the pair died when a projectile struck a village near the border with Ukraine.

Ms Wong said Australia stands with Ukraine in “condemning Russia's deadly missile attacks. Reports these missiles have also struck Polish territory are deeply concerning”. 

“We again call on Russia to withdraw its forces and end its illegal, immoral war,” she said.

Poland is a member of NATO, making the strike the first time a Russian missile has crossed into NATO territory during its conflict with Ukraine.

A spokesperson for the Polish government has confirmed the Russian ambassador had been summoned to provide an explanation. 

Poland may now be considering calling a meeting of NATO members, which would be convened under Article 4 of the treaty. 

The article allows for NATO allies to meet when the “territorial integrity, political independence or security” of any member has been threatened.

Russia's defence ministry denies any involvement in the strikes, labelling the reports as a "deliberate provocation".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Euronews: Oil flows on Druzhba pipeline suspended in parts of Eastern Europe  
BUDAPEST/PRAGUE – Oil supply to parts of Eastern and Central Europe via a section of the Druzhba pipeline has been temporarily suspended, according to oil pipeline operators in Hungary and Slovakia. 
The extent of the disruption was not immediately clear, and came concurrent with an explosion in a village in eastern Poland near the Ukrainian border that raised alarm among NATO countries. 
Hungary’s MOL said its Ukrainian partner told the company that a Russian rocket hit a power station close to the Belarus border that provides electricity for a pump station, and this led to the stoppage. Slovakia’s Transpetrol confirmed the suspension as well, citing “technical reasons on the Ukrainian side” but did not specify a rocket strike.

— U.S. Embassy Türkiye (@USEmbassyTurkey) November 13, 2022
   The Hill: Turkey alleges US complicity in deadly Istanbul bombing, rejects condolence statement 
Turkey’s interior minister accused the U.S. of being complicit in a recent bombing in the city of Istanbul on Sunday that left at least six people dead and dozens of others injured. 
 Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu rejected a statement of condolence from the U.S. during a press conference with reporters near the scene of the attack after authorities arrested a Syrian woman with suspected ties to Kurdish militants.

WNU Editor: The reason why the Turkish government rejected the US Embassy's condolence message stems from US support of the Kurdish PKK. The PKK is regarded by Turkey as a terrorist organization.

KYIV/FRONTLINE NORTH OF KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops have reclaimed dozens of landmine-littered settlements abandoned by Russian forces in southern Ukraine, officials said, the day after Moscow announced its withdrawal from the strategic capital city of Kherson province.
There were indications on Thursday night that Ukrainian forces were getting closer to the city of Kherson, a port at the mouth of the Dnipro River, said a Ukrainian military analyst and a media commentator.
It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

Schools for teenage girls have also been shut for over a year across most of the country.

"You're looking at well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded. Same thing probably on the Ukrainian side.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

"Begin to pull out troops," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia's commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its "special military operation" and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow's forces since the offensive began on February 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.

Julia Davis, creator of the Russian Media Monitor, explained the dynamics in The Daily Beast.
"Russian state media is following the midterm elections in the United States with great interest, but the mood in Moscow’s studios had noticeably soured in comparison to the fun-filled episodes of the years preceding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine," Davis reported. "While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.
