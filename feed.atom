Reuters: China Says It Resolutely Opposes US Military Sales to Taiwan 
BEIJING (Reuters) - China resolutely opposes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and has lodged stern representations to Washington, China's defence ministry said on Wednesday. 
 "The United States has ignored China's core concerns, violently interfered in China's internal affairs and deliberately pushed up tensions in the Taiwan Strait," spokesperson Tan Kefei said in a statement. 
The U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of ammunition and logistics support to Taiwan in two separate deals valued at up to $440 million, the Pentagon said last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When US superstar Taylor Swift announced yet more dates for her much-hyped world tour -- but once again skipped Canada -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could not shake it off.
In a tweet referencing the lyrics of Swift's songs, Trudeau urged her to fill the blank space and perform in America's neighbor to the north.
"It's me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you," Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. "So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon."
The artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.
She plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.
The bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer's lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.
Swift last came to Canada in 2018.]]></summary>

The Libertarian Institute: Germany Concerned About Western Escalations in Ukraine 
Top German officials have voiced anxiety regarding Western escalations in Ukraine, signaling that Berlin will push back against the most provocative proposals. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany was reluctant to send longer-range weapons to Ukraine over concerns the arms will be used to attack Russian territory. London has provided Kiev with Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles which have a range of more than 155 miles. According to recent reporting, the White House is also closing in on a decision to provide Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), munitions capable of striking targets roughly 200 miles away.

"The figures we have 12 hours after the rescue work began are 29 people dead and 19 injured," Bernardo Rodriguez Alamilla said by telephone.
Images from the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle lying on its side at the bottom of a steep cliff as rescuers worked nearby.
Fifteen women died, two of them while receiving hospital care, as well as 13 men and a child, the prosecutor said.
The first official report set the number of fatalities at 27 and the number of wounded at 17.

Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on June 24, seized the command centre there where Russia coordinates its war in Ukraine, and sent a column of fighters towards Moscow before standing down after striking a deal with the Kremlin.
His mutiny posed the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin since the Russian leader came to power more than two decades ago and has forced the Kremlin to move into a damage-limitation exercise in which it has stressed the loyalty of the armed forces and the unit…]]></summary>

Current leadership will continue for another year. 
NATO allies have agreed to extend Jens Stoltenberg’s term as secretary-general by a year. 
“Honoured by NATO Allies’ decision to extend my term as Secretary General until 1 October 2024,” Stoltenberg tweeted. “The transatlantic bond between Europe & North America has ensured our freedom & security for nearly 75 years, and in a more dangerous world, our Alliance is more important than ever,” he added. 
The decision, ahead of a summit of NATO leaders in Vilnius next week, is seen as a reflection of how politically sensitive the current moment is for the alliance, as well as how difficult it is for allies to find a high-profile candidate who is both available and acceptable to all alliance members.

President Emmanuel Macron's government faced a backlash Wednesday after the centrist leader called for powers to "cut off" social media in case of widespread violence like riots over the past week. 
"We have to think about the social networks, about the bans we'll have to put in place. When things get out of control, we might need to be able to regulate or cut them off," Macron told a meeting of mayors on Tuesday according to media reports.
Macron and his ministers have singled out platforms like Snapchat, TikTok and encrypted messenger Telegram for their role in spreading images of the nights of violence following the June 27 police shooting of a 17-year-old teenager, Nahel M. 
"When (social media) becomes a tool for organising or for attempting to kill, it's a real problem," Macron said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authorities in the French capital region struck the name of US black rights activist Angela Davis from a high school on Wednesday, judging her views on race relations to be too radical.
The conservative head of the Paris region, Valerie Pecresse, has accused the university professor and former Black Panther of having views that "feed communitarian feeling and can encourage violence."
Speaking to a committee in March, the rightwinger also criticized Davis's belief in the idea of systemic racism, which she denied existed in France, and said "a certain number of recent declarations about France pose a problem."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey said the Hollywood actor grabbed him "like a cobra", a London court heard on Wednesday.
The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is the third of four men accusing Spacey of a string of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
The accuser said he met the US actor, who won Oscars for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", at an event in a West End theatre in 2005.
In a recording of a police interview played at Southwark Crown Court in south London, the man said Spacey "smelled of booze" and "looked disheveled" when he arrived.
"My first impression is that he seemed very arrogant," he added.
"I remember he looked me up and down and looked at my crotch region," the accuser said, adding that the actor made crude remarks towards him.
"It was very aggressive. I have never had anyone talk to me in that way. It was all getting hardcore," he said about the alleged comments.
The complainant said Spacey allegedly grabbed him "with such force it was really painful", describing it as "like a cobra coming out and getting hold".
"I remember freezing and pushing his arm away and feeling shellshocked and frustrated that anybody would be that sleazy," he added.
The accuser said he had initially put the incident "in a box" but it had "a detrimental effect" on his life.
The alleged victim criticized Spacey for coming out as gay several years ago when other allegations against him became public.
"He took no responsibility for it, he just said 'I'm gay'.
"He's still not hearing what he did was wrong –- that's sort of spurred me on a bit," the witness said.
The court has heard from two other complainants, one of whom said Spacey was an aggressive "predator" uncomfortable with his sexuality.
Another accuser alleged Spacey kissed his neck and grabbed his crotch.
The prosecution has described Spacey as a "sexual bully", whose preferred method of assault was grabbing other men in the crotch.
Spacey denies all the charges.]]></summary>

The US Navy intervened to stop Iranian Navy ships attempting to seize two oil tankers in separate incidents in the Gulf of Oman early on Wednesday morning, according to a US defense official. 
An Iranian ship opened fire at the tanker in the second seizure attempt, according to the official. 
In the first incident, an Iranian Navy vessel approached the TRF Moss, a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker, in international waters in the Gulf of Oman at approximately 1 am local time, the official said. The tanker was through the Strait of Hormuz and heading toward the Arabian Sea when the Iranian vessel approached.

A study conducted as part of the Clem Burke Drumming Project found children with the condition who learned to play the drums showed better control of their emotions and fewer signs of hyperactivity, inattention and repetitive behavior.
"This landmark study is the first of its kind to show how the brain responds positively to drumming and how it can help children with autism and other social and emotional difficulties," said Burke.

At 90, Nokkho Konyak can barely see beyond a few feet, his facial tattoos marking him as a warrior are fading and his frail body needs support.
But his eyes light up and his hands become animated when he talks about "those simpler times".
"We witnessed our brave elders cutting off enemies' heads and participated in many battles," he told AFP.
Nokkho is a Konyak, a small but fierce and respected warrior community in northeastern India's Nagaland state.
The Konyaks were the last to give up the age-old practice of severing enemies' heads in this remote, hilly and densely forested region close t…]]></summary>

The village of Gramatneusiedl near Vienna now has a zero jobless rate after guaranteeing work to all its 129 long-term unemployed.
The project shows it is possible to eradicate this stubbornly difficult problem at a community level, said economist Oliver Picek of Vienna's Momentum Institute.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
