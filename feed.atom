        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Residents in Kyiv have been warned to prepare for the worst as Ukraine faces continuing energy shortfalls. 

The city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko recently told media that their enemies are "doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die”.

“And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations,” Mr Klitschko said. 

Kyiv launched hourly rotating blackouts across the city and its surrounds on Sunday.

Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine's power infrastructure which has put a strain on the nation's energy supply.]]></summary>

A giant Ukrainian flag was unfurled at Sydney’s beach suburb of Bondi on November 5, as part of the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, in a show of solidarity for the war-affected country.
Ukrainian community members and locals were filmed carrying the 8 metre by 12 metre flag through Marks Park before holding it above their heads and singing the Ukrainian national anthem.
Organisers said the flag was part of the global “Artists Support Ukraine” movement, and was aimed at raising funds for the Ukraine Crisis Appeal.

Read the entire article on The Hill HERE.
 

(Editor's Note: Remember that Irregular Warfare is an intellectual orphan in DOD (though perhaps not in the Army in the new FM 3-0 as the Army has introduced not only a new definition but also a description of IW as well as conventional warfare).
 

























Defense Department needs to capitalize on historic opportunity
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3721929-defense-department-needs-to-capitalize-on-historic-opportunity/
BY CHARLES T. CLEVELAND, DANIEL EGEL, RUSSELL HOWARD, DAVID MAXWELL, HY ROTHSTEIN, OPINION CONTRIBUTORS - 11/06/22 9:30 AM ET
The Department of Defense (DOD) may be facing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a critical gap in its national security arsenal. Congress has authorized the creation of an institution dedicated to the study and research of irregular warfare (IW), and the education of officers and civilian professionals charged with defending against non-standard threats and executing competent IW campaigns and strategies. 
Unfortunately, initial indications are that this opportunity created by Congress — which comes at precisely the right moment to prepare the nation for competition in the 21st century, in which IW may play an oversized role — might not be realized.

   Euronews/AP: World population to hit 8 billion in the coming days  

The United Nations estimated on Monday that the world’s population will reach 8 billion on Nov. 15 and that India will replace China as the world’s most populous nation next year. 
In a report released on World Population Day, the U.N. also said global population growth fell below 1 per cent in 2020 for the first time since 1950. 
According to the latest U.N. projections, the world’s population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030. 
That number will jump to 9.7 billion in 2050 and a peak of around 10.4 billion during the 2080s. It is forecast to remain at that level until 2100.

So much for message discipline.  President Biden repeatedly disparaged Afghanistan as a “God-forsaken place” Friday and jokingly threatened to use “my shotgun” to protect the US economy against a recession during a rambling speech in San Diego. 
The president, who turns 80 later this month, also mused about his late father returning as a ghost to “strangle me” and confused Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett with General Motors CEO Mary Barra.  “A lot of you have been to Afghanistan. 
I’ve been to every part of it. It’s a God-forsaken place — it’s a God-forsaken place,” Biden said, after using the term one other time while recounting being part of a 2008 congressional trip that got stranded in the snow.

France 24: Turkey warns Finland, Sweden must 'take steps' before joining NATO 
Turkey will not formally approve Finland and Sweden's membership of NATO until the two countries take the necessary "steps", Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg Friday. 
Ankara has accused the two Nordic nations of providing a safe haven for outlawed Kurdish militants it deems "terrorists" and held back on ratifying their NATO membership despite an agreement in June. 
"President Erdogan noted that the steps to be taken by Sweden and Finland would determine how fast the approval process... would go and when it would be concluded," the Turkish presidency said.

President Biden called Brazil's President-elect Lula Da Silva within a day of his win 
President Biden has yet to call Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulate him on his win in this week’s Israeli elections, even though interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid conceded defeat. 
A National Security Council spokesperson told Fox News Digital that President Biden will speak with Netanyahu "soon," but avoided outright naming Netanyahu the prime minister-elect – instead saying that "Mr. Netanyahu, after winning a plurality in the Knesset, is likely to be tasked with forming a government over the coming days." 
 "The president has known and worked with Bibi Netanyahu for many years," the spokesperson added. "They worked closely together when Netanyahu was prime minister last year, and they met again during the president’s visit to Israel in July."

President Joe Biden on Friday offered a wildly upbeat assessment of his party's chances in next week's midterm elections, claiming Democrats will keep the Senate and could even hold on to the House of Representatives - despite a slew of polls forecasting that Republicans will make sweeping gains.
'We're gonna win this time this time around, I think. I feel really good about our chances,' he said.  'I think we're gonna keep the Senate, pick up a seat. I think we have a chance of winning the House.'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Biden Feud With Big Oil Ratchets Up Just as World Needs More US Oil 
As October drew to a close, the White House saw another potential energy flash point on the horizon. 
Diesel and heating oil inventories in the US Northeast were getting worryingly low. Officials swung into action, organizing a series of calls between Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and several of the country’s biggest oil refiners to discuss strategies to boost stockpiles. The tone was cordial, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. 
But the very next working day, the oil industry was blindsided. At a hastily arranged press conference on Oct. 31, President Joe Biden castigated Big Oil for handing “outrageous” profits to shareholders and executives rather than bringing down prices at the pump. Unless that changed, he warned, oil companies faced more taxes. “Their profits are a windfall of war -- the windfall from the brutal conflict that’s ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe,” he said.

Zero Hedge: French Nuclear Reactor Power Outlook Worsens Ahead Of Winter, Electricity Prices Erupt 
France's nuclear troubles are mounting due primarily to routine maintenance of the country's 56 aging reactors. 
A new update from French electric utility company Electricite de France SA, commonly known as EDF, said an outlook for nuclear power generation was slashed ahead of winter, causing chaos in energy markets. 
EDF is the world's largest owner of nuclear plants. It reported Friday that its fleet of nuclear reactors is expected to produce between 275 and 285 terawatt-hours of energy this year, down from the range of 280 and 300 terawatt-hours.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of “energy terrorism” after Moscow’s repeated attacks on key infrastructure knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people. 
About 450,000 households across Kyiv were without electricity on Friday as power outages across the country continue, according to the city’s mayor Vitalii Klitschko. 
“It is one and a half times more than the recent days,” Klitschko said on Telegram. 
Across the country, about 4.5 million consumers were temporarily disconnected from the power supply on Thursday under emergency and stabilization schedules, according to Zelensky.

Q&A with Kurt Braddock about how rhetorical strategies can lead to violence.
 The political environment less than a week before the midterm elections has a broad swathe of the American public on edge, particularly after high-profile incidents of political violence — both foiled and perpetrated.
According to a new poll by the Washington Post and ABC News, about 88 percent of US adults from across the political spectrum are concerned about political violence around the midterm elections. Of the 1,005 people surveyed, 63 percent said they were very concerned about politically-motivated violence — not a surprising statistic given the rise in public antisemitic speech, a foiled plot to attack synagogues in New Jersey, and a physical a…]]></summary>

I am surprised that Reuters got these pictures. These soldiers look exhausted. And the Zaporizhzhia front is one the quieter parts of the war.

In the past few weeks there has been a large number of social media postings from Ukrainian soldiers who have come from the front-lines. It has been depressing to watch. 
I am sure the same is happening on the Russian side. But Moscow still has a lot of control on how the war is being covered. For one. Unlike their Ukrainian counterparts Russian soldiers are not allowed to have cell phones.]]></summary>

CNN: Iran acknowledges providing drones to Russia before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine  
The Iranian government acknowledged for the first time Saturday that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine. 
The statement by Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian comes after previous denials by Tehran that it had supplied Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it “has not and will not” do so. 
Amirabdollahian did not say if the drones that were supplied to Moscow were the type that carry explosives.
“Some western countries have accused Iran of helping the war in Ukraine by providing drones and missiles to Russia. The part regarding missiles is completely wrong. The part about drones is correct, we did provide a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of the war in Ukraine,” Amirabdollahian told reporters in Tehran.

Nuclear diplomacy is urgently needed amid rising tensions but politically untenable. 
 US and South Korean officials believe North Korea may be gearing up for its seventh nuclear test, after the country, led by dictator Kim Jong Un, launched a barrage of missiles this week, including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in violation of repeated United Nations Security Council efforts to stop such actions.

RFE: Russia Launches More Drones Into Central Ukraine As Fierce Fighting Under Way In The East  
Russia launched fresh drone attacks on targets in central Ukraine as Kyiv's forces fought pitched battles in the east and Moscow-appointed authorities continued to evacuate people from Kherson in the south in apparent preparation to stave off a potential Ukrainian offensive. 
The General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on November 5 that its forces managed to stop Russian attacks the previous day in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east. 
The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, said it launched 11 strikes against Russian positions, while Ukrainian air defenses shot down an Orlan-10 drone, 11 Shahed-136 drones, and two Kalibr cruise missiles.

WNU Editor: While there has been fighting along much of the front-lines, there has been no major push to gain territory in the past few days. It feels like a lull before the storm. 
And while the Western media narrative is claiming that Ukraine is going to be launching counter-offensives soon, my gut tells me that it is the reverse. That with over 300,000 more troops being prepared to enter Ukraine, it is actually Russia that will be launching an offensive in the coming months with the focus on taking the all of the territories of the four regions that Moscow has claimed as its own.
And winter favors the Russian military. Or so my military sources tell me. 
There will be no forest coverage during winter (all the leaves are on the ground), and with air and artillery superiority they tell me that it will be easy for Russian forces to easily identify and pick-off Ukraine military positions. 
All that I can say is .... we shall see.]]></summary>

“We are in our most dangerous decade right now with the geopolitical threats we face,” said Vice Adm. Bill Houston, commander of submarine forces.  
WASHINGTON — The US Navy’s top submariners gathered this week just minutes away from the Pentagon and with increasing levels of urgency, conveyed a similar and at times ominous message: The need for the silent service to “get real, get better” is both immediate and imperative. 
“We are in our most dangerous decade right now with the geopolitical threats we face,” said Vice Adm. Bill Houston, commander of submarine forces. The Navy has significantly increased the physical size of the submarines it is building in the past decade, but “we’re doing this with an industrial base that has actually shrunk.”

New York CNN Business  — The Federal Reserve’s war on inflation isn’t just painful for home buyers and people with credit card debt. Uncle Sam is getting squeezed by higher borrowing costs, too. 
The cost to finance America’s growing mountain of debt is rising rapidly as the Fed scrambles to put out the inflation fire by raising interest rates and shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. 
During fiscal 2022 alone, the federal government made $475 billion in net interest payments, up from $352 billion the prior year, according to the US Treasury Department. For context, that’s more than the government spent on veterans’ benefits and transportation – combined. And it’s nearly as much as the $677 billion spent on education.

Update #2: Federal interest payments soar, soon will exceed cost of entire defense budget (Convention of States)   
WNU Editor: If current trends continue, one can easily see interest payments becoming the biggest expense in the US Federal budget by 2030.]]></summary>

Maria Zakharova stressed that such developments was "a deliberate pursuit of a destructive course toward escalation of tensions in the Euro-Arctic region and the final destruction of Russian-Norwegian relations" and this was not Moscow's choice 
MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. Russia perceives Norway's military preparations near its borders as a course on escalation of tensions in the region, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday. 
"Foreign military bases actually appeared in Norway on a permanent basis. The corresponding infrastructure has been modernized, modern equipment is being purchased, and Oslo is now among the most active supporters of NATO's involvement in the Arctic," she said, 
"We consider such developments near Russian borders as Oslo's deliberate pursuit of a destructive course toward escalation of tensions in the Euro-Arctic region and the final destruction of Russian-Norwegian relations."

"The Raising of the Cross" oil sketch from the 1640s was long thought to have been the work of a follower of the 17th century master, known for his famous works like "The Night Watch" and "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp".

KYIV (Reuters) -Russian attacks were reported across large areas of Ukraine on Thursday, with heavy shelling in numerous regions damaging infrastructure, including electricity supplies to Europe's largest nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said.
The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days' worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said.
Russian strikes were also reported in Kriviy Rih, in central Ukraine, and in Sumy and Kharkiv, in the northeast. Heavy fighting was ongoing in the eastern reg…]]></summary>

SEOUL (Reuters) - "Dad, I'm going out" were the last words Jung Hae-moon heard his daughter utter, at the end of a chat they had on the telephone on Saturday as she turned down an invitation to dinner.
Hours later, 30-year-old Jung Joo-hee was among 156 people, most of them in their teens and twenties, killed in the South Korean capital as they celebrated Halloween free of COVID restrictions for the first time in three years.
On Thursday, the young woman's family buried her ashes in a peaceful family plot outside Seoul, with a planted sapling and bouquets by her grave stone, in a sombre ceremony of prayers and tears.
"Rest well. Mum and dad will come see you," Jung Hae-moon said as the family stood by, together with his daughter's pet poodle.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea unsuccessfully fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during a new salvo of launches Thursday, the South Korean military said, with Washington urging all nations to enforce sanctions on Pyongyang.
The launches prompted South Korea and the United States to extend their ongoing joint air drills, the largest-ever such exercises, citing North Korea's "provocations".
People in parts of northern Japan were ordered to seek shelter during the North's latest launches, which included two short-range missiles and followed a blitz of projectiles fired Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Days before the polls close in the 2022 midterm elections, actions by Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are already being seen through the prism of the expected 2024 GOP presidential nomination contest.
DeSantis is starring in a new ad for GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who is facing an uncharacteristically tough re-election in deep-red Utah as he's being challenged by independent Evan McMullin, who won Lee's vote for president in 2016.
The ad, paid for by the far-right Club for Growth, is the first out-of-state ad featuring DeSantis backing a fellow Republican, according to Breitbart News.
Trump then re-endorsed Lee in a statement posted to his Truth Social website.

After days of silence, Bolsonaro on Tuesday gave a short speech in which he neither accepted defeat nor congratulated Lula on his win, though his chief of staff took the podium afterward to say the president had "authorized" the transition to a new government.
Since then, his supporters have rallied in front of military installations in Brazil's major cities to call for action.
"Federal intervention now!" chanted some of the thousands who gathered in front of the Southeastern Military Command in the Latin American country's biggest city, Sao Paulo, on Wednesday.

"We have grown increasingly concerned about the potential as these months have gone on," said White House national security spokesman John Kirby.
Kirby did not confirm a New York Times report that said high-level Russian military officials recently discussed when and how they might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.
The report, which cited unnamed US officials, said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not take part in the discussions, and there was no indication that the Russian military had decided to deploy the weapons.

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a hurricane warning for Honduras' Bay Islands, the coast of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan area stretching from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya.
Lisa was moving westward in the Caribbean Sea at a speed of 24 kilometers (15 miles) per hour with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and even higher gusts, said the NHC.
"Additional strengthening is forecast as Lisa approaches Belize. Weakening is expected after the center makes landfall," it added.

Russia has started a draft of men in the country. Many of them have fled and those who couldn't were sent to fight with sparse and “barely usable” equipment and little food. It has resulted in soldiers looking for creative ways to get out. 
In a report by the independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe, covered by the Daily Beast, reporters spoke to the wives of three men sent to Ukraine last month into a "living nightmare."  
First, training has been little more than "dig a trench in the forest." They were then sent to the Luhansk region of Ukraine. According to one spouse, her husband is being "commanded by two other mob…]]></summary>

One person was found with gunshot wounds and was taken to the hospital and later died. Another teen boy was taken to the hospital but his condition is not known. 
Toronto Police Service (TPS) duty inspector Lori Kranenburg said that both victims are believed to be teenagers but she could not confirm if either victim was a student at the school. 
“It appears that there were several shots fired, but I don’t have an exact number. At this time we’re reviewing video and canvassing the area,” Kranenburg said.
Video circulating online apparently shows the events that led up to the shooting. The video shows one person backing away as three people walk towards him while words are exchanged. Shots then ring out.

Sunak had argued that "pressing domestic commitments" would keep him away from COP27 in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh -- after inheriting an economic crisis from predecessor Liz Truss.
But that fuelled doubts about Sunak's interest in the planetary emergency, and critics said the inexperienced leader was passing up an opportunity to rub shoulders with the likes of US President Joe Biden and European peers.
"There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy without investing in renewables," Sunak wrote on Twitter.

With around 84 percent of the vote counted at 0755 GMT, according to the Central Elections Committee, Netanyahu could be set for a dramatic comeback.
"We are close to a big victory," he told supporters of his right-wing Likud party at a rally early Wednesday.
But his main rival, caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, told his own supporters in Tel Aviv that "nothing is decided", and that his centrist Yesh Atid party "will wait patiently... for the final results".
The two rivals are vying for a majority coalition in Israel’s 120-seat parliament, with initial results putting Netanyahu’s bloc ahead aft…]]></summary>

The Russians have been firing salvos from the south end of the road ever since being routed and retreating from the village in the first month of war in March.
The Ukrainians have been trying to press a more recent counteroffensive past the Russian positions into areas around the Crimea peninsula the Kremlin seized in 2014.

Victory it was not. Death came in the form of an end to his presidency, which he grudgingly accepted Tuesday -- two days after the election was declared for his opponent.
And prison?
"You can be sure that option... does not exist," the far-right leader told members of his crucial evangelical support base in August 2021.
Analysts, however, believe a future behind bars may be a very real prospect for the bellicose Bolsonaro, even if it may take years.
Almost from the start of his controversial mandate in 2019, Bolsonaro racked up accusations and investigations for everything from spreading disinformation to crimes against humanity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea's military said.
The launch comes after Pyongyang on Tuesday demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, calling them a provocation that may draw "more powerful follow-up measures."
Broadcaster YTN reported that an air raid warning was issued on the South Korean island of Ulleung around the time of the missile launch. A spokesman for South Korea's military said they were checking to see whether the air raid warning was related to the missile launch.
The United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day.
North Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills.

Radcliffe was discussing the open letter he released in 2020, in which he criticized Rowling’s views on gender identity.
“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that," Radcliffe told IndieWire.
"And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important,” he explained.

In his June 2020 open letter posted at The Trevor Project, Radcliffe wrote, "Transgender women are women."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U2's Bono on Tuesday released his memoir "Surrender," detailing the journey from his youth in Dublin to fronting one of the world's most prominent rock bands.
The introspective book is organized across 40 different U2 songs, including 40 original drawings.
The 62-year-old artist born Paul David Hewson is a long-time humanitarian well-known for lending his voice to a variety of causes, including the fight against poverty and AIDS.
In his more than 500-page book, Bono delves in to those ambitions but also his growth as a teenager struck by tragedy -- his mother died suddenly when he was 14 -- and an account of his heart operation in 2016.
He also waxes on the perplexities and finer points of songwriting, and "the pseudo-religious part of being a rock star, how we put the messy in messianic."
"U2's music was never really rock 'n' roll," he writes in the book. "Under its contemporary skin it's opera -- a big music, big emotions unlocked in the pop music of the day."
The rocker is promoting the memoir with a 14-date book tour entitled "Stories of Surrender," which kicks off in New York this week and includes stops in Chicago, London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and, of course, Dublin.
"When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I'd previously only sketched in songs," Bono said in a statement when the book's publication was announced earlier this year.
"Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept," he continued. "I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist."
"Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way."

At the new cabinet's first meeting on Monday the draft legislation was approved, raising concern it could be used arbitrarily to shut down any type of public demonstration.
"It's a major error. Raves have no place in such a document. This calls into question public freedoms," Democratic Party secretary and former prime minister Enrico Letta posted on Twitter.
Writer Erri di Luca saw a "serious danger for open and free musical shows".
On Monday, police confiscated audio equipment worth 150,000 euros (dollars) when they intervened at a rave in the northern city of Modena.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The White House said Tuesday Iran was willingly taking part in killing Ukrainians by providing drones to Russia for the war, and voiced concern it would also ship missiles to Moscow.
By arming the Russians, the Iranian regime "is involved in killing innocent Ukrainians," White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.
"At its core, this is a regime in Tehran that is openly and willingly making themselves an accomplice to the murder of innocent Ukrainian people on Ukrainian soil."
Kirby noted Iran's provision of attack drones to Russia, which have been deployed in recent weeks to damage Ukraine infrastructure.
But he would not confirm reports that Tehran could also send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
"We remain concerned about the potential of Iran to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles," Kirby told reporters.
"We haven't seen that bear out, but it's a concern that we have," he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day, research estimated Tuesday, suggesting that the omnipresent pollution poses a bigger danger to the world's largest animal than previously thought.
The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood.
Now a modeling study published in the journal Nature Communications has estimated how much is being ingested by whales.
A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements.
"It's basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale," said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study's first author.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October 2022 is set to be the hottest month of October in France since records started in 1945, national weather agency Meteo-France said in a statement. 
With an average temperature close to or even just above 17 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit) - three to four degrees above normal levels - last month was far warmer than the previous record in October 2001, when temperatures averaged 16.3C.
The second half of the month saw an exceptionally long and intense period of unseasonably high temperatures, with the southwestern city of Bordeaux registering on Oct. 16 the latest 30C since records started.
Meteo-France said that due to climate change, periods of unusual heat late or early in the year were set to become more frequent.
Beach resorts across Europe have extended their season as the unseasonable warmth kept tourists coming to the seaside.
