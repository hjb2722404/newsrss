Officially, the gunman is believed to have acted alone, but Khan said he suspected the assailant was merely a decoy serving the interests of a state-level conspiracy.

Reuters: Germany Rejects No-Fly Zone, Could Lead to NATO-Russia Confrontation 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Establishing a no-fly zone would pose a threat of direct confrontation between Russia and NATO, a German government spokesperson said, after a missile blast in Poland near the Ukrainian border killed two people on Tuesday. 
The spokesperson rejected this and said, "Together with all our allies we are agreed that we want to avoid a further escalation of this war in Ukraine." 
 Berlin will offer support to the Polish air defence, a spokesperson for the defence ministry said at a regular news conference on Wednesday.

Imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine will only lead to one thing .... a war between NATO and Russia that will probably lead to a nuclear exchange.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: Poland, NATO say deadly explosion likely caused by Ukraine air defense 
Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Wednesday that the explosion that killed two people near the country's border with Ukraine appears to be an "unfortunate accident," not an "intentional attack."   
The big picture: Duda said it was "very likely" the explosion was caused by Ukrainian air defenses. The missile "unfortunately fell on Polish territory" as Ukraine defended itself against Russian strikes, he said. 
* Duda added that the projectile that caused the blast was "most likely" Russian-made, but officials have "no proof at the moment that it was a missile fired by the Russian side." 
* Ukraine has previously denied it was to blame for the blast and accused Moscow of a "serious escalation." Russia also denied responsibility.

Russia launched a fresh wave of missile attacks targeting cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian authorities, as the war-torn country prepares for winter and the challenges it will bring. 
At least a dozen regions throughout Ukraine reported strikes on Tuesday, some of which experienced emergency blackouts because of the damage, the Associated Press said. 
The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv was among the areas reportedly hit. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko wrote on Telegram Tuesday that two residential buildings in the city's Pechersk District were hit but said several incoming missiles were shot down by air defense over Kyiv. 
In a later Telegram post, Klitschko wrote that another multistory building in the same district was struck.

Wired: ‘Dark Ships’ Emerge From the Shadows of the Nord Stream Mystery  
Satellite monitors discovered two vessels with their trackers turned off in the area of the pipeline prior to the suspected sabotage in September. 
The first gas leaks on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea were detected in the early hours of September 26, pouring up to 400,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere. Officials immediately suspected sabotage of the international pipeline. 
New analysis seen by WIRED shows that two large ships, with their trackers off, appeared around the leak sites in the days immediately before they were detected.

   The Hill: Biden: ‘Unlikely’ missile that hit Poland was fired from Russia, pending investigation 
President Biden on Tuesday said it initially appears unlikely that a missile that hit a rural town in Poland near the Ukraine border was fired from Russia, but he said a final determination is pending a full investigation into the incident. 
“There is preliminary information that contests that,” Biden told reporters when asked whether the missile was fired from Russia. “I don’t want to say until we completely investigate. It’s unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia.”

Politico: U.S. scrambles to reassure Ukraine after Milley comments on negotiations 
The top general's remarks about a “window” for talks angered Ukrainian officials, people familiar with the matter said. The Biden administration is in damage control mode after a top U.S. general said a window for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow could open this winter, with senior officials scrambling to assure Ukraine it wasn’t undercutting its goal of expelling the Russians. 
Specifically, senior U.S. officials are telling their counterparts in Ukraine that the expected winter fighting pause doesn’t mean talks should happen imminently. Instead, they’re relaying that Washington will continue to support Kyiv’s militarily as it launches the next phase of advances on the battlefield, according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials familiar with the outreach.

CNBC: Polish president says apparent missile strike in Poland was ‘isolated incident,’ but notes the ‘North Atlantic Alliance is on standby’ 
* President Andrzej Duda of Poland said his government doesn’t yet conclusively know who fired a missile that struck Polish territory late Tuesday, killing two civilians. 
* Duda added that Poland has “strengthened the readiness of the Polish armed forces, including the air defense. Our planes will be supported by allied planes. We act calmly and prudently.” 
The president of Poland said his government doesn’t yet conclusively know who fired a missile that struck Polish territory late Tuesday, killing two civilians. 
The explosion, which took place about 15 miles (24 km) from the Ukrainian border, came as Russia was launching a massive wave of missiles at Ukrainian cities and energy facilities just before dusk local time. 
President Andrzej Duda said the projectile was “Russian-made” and variously referred to it as either a missile or a rocket. 
“What happened was an isolated incident,” said Duda, who added that an investigation is underway. “There is no indication that more will take place”

Local media is reporting the pair died when a projectile struck a village near the border with Ukraine.

Ms Wong said Australia stands with Ukraine in “condemning Russia's deadly missile attacks. Reports these missiles have also struck Polish territory are deeply concerning”. 

“We again call on Russia to withdraw its forces and end its illegal, immoral war,” she said.

Poland is a member of NATO, making the strike the first time a Russian missile has crossed into NATO territory during its conflict with Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poland is holding an urgent security meeting to discuss the two “Russian-made” missiles which struck a village near the border with Ukraine and killed two people.

A spokesperson for the Polish government has confirmed the Russian ambassador had been summoned to provide an explanation. 

Poland may now be considering calling a meeting of NATO members, which would be convened under Article 4 of the treaty. 

The article allows for NATO allies to meet when the “territorial integrity, political independence or security” of any member has been threatened.

Russia's defence ministry denies any involvement in the strikes, labelling the reports as a "deliberate provocation".]]></summary>

BUDAPEST/PRAGUE – Oil supply to parts of Eastern and Central Europe via a section of the Druzhba pipeline has been temporarily suspended, according to oil pipeline operators in Hungary and Slovakia. 
The extent of the disruption was not immediately clear, and came concurrent with an explosion in a village in eastern Poland near the Ukrainian border that raised alarm among NATO countries. 
Hungary’s MOL said its Ukrainian partner told the company that a Russian rocket hit a power station close to the Belarus border that provides electricity for a pump station, and this led to the stoppage. Slovakia’s Transpetrol confirmed the suspension as well, citing “technical reasons on the Ukrainian side” but did not specify a rocket strike.

Reuters: Kremlin says Zelenskiy's 'no Minsk 3' comment confirms Kyiv's unwillingness to negotiate 
LONDON (Reuters) - Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Volodymyr Zelenskiy's statement that there will be no "Minsk 3" deal to end the fighting in Ukraine confirms that Kyiv is not interested in holding peace talks with Moscow, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.

Update #1: Kiev’s terms for talks ‘unrealistic’ – Moscow (RT)  
Update #2: Lavrov emphasizes Ukraine refusing to negotiate, not Russia (TASS)   
WNU Editor: The Ukraine government wants all the territory under Russian control to be completely returned, and with US backing they feel confident that they will achieve it. The Russian government is saying no, and are confident that their forces will succeed in not only holding onto the current territories, but to also be able to seize the rest of Donbas by next year. 
Bottom line. 
There see no common ground for any talks to start right now.]]></summary>

Reuters: IMF says global economic outlook getting 'gloomier', risks abound  
WASHINGTON – The global economic outlook is even gloomier than projected in October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Sunday, citing a steady worsening in purchasing manager surveys in recent months. 
It blamed the darker outlook on tightening monetary policy triggered by persistently high and broad-based inflation, weak growth momentum in China, and ongoing supply disruptions and food insecurity caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The global lender in October cut its global growth forecast for 2023 to 2.7 per cent from a previous forecast of 2.9 per cent.

CNN: CNN Exclusive: US intelligence suggests Russia put off announcing Kherson retreat until after midterm elections 
The US has intelligence that Russia may have delayed announcing its withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson in part to avoid giving the Biden administration a political win ahead of the midterm elections, according to four people familiar with the intelligence. 
Senior Russian officials discussed the US midterms as a factor during deliberations about the withdrawal announcement, one person familiar with the intelligence said. Waiting until after the US election was always a “pre-planned condition” of Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson, a second person familiar with the intelligence told CNN.

WNU Editor: Russia made its intentions very clear weeks ago when General Surovikin was appointed to coordinate Russian military operations in Ukraine. He said hard decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks, and he even mentioned the Kherson district.   After that Russian authorities removed the remains of Russian Prince Grigory Potemkin, the founder of Kherson, two weeks ago ....

   Newsweek: Russian Rally Urges Putin to Strike US With Nuke-Capable Satan II Missile 
A rally recently held in Moscow saw attendees and leaders calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to launch a nuclear strike against Washington, D.C. 
A clip from the rally was shared to Twitter on Saturday morning by Julia Davis, creator of the Russian Media Monitor and columnist for The Daily Beast. In the video, a man can be seen leading a crowd of people through the streets of Moscow and through chants calling for attacks on Washington. 
"Strike the decision-making centers," the man leading the crowd shouts. "On Washington! A flight task for the Sarmat missile. On Washington! Sarmat, strike the enemy's cities. On Washington!...U.S.A. is the enemy! We will go to heaven as martyrs. They will simply croak."

Update #2: Moscow residents march to demand missile strike on Washington and 'enemy cities' (Express)  

WNU Editor: This was a small rally. 50 people? I am not going to lose any sleep on protestors calling for Armageddon. What I am worried about is what will Russia do against the U.S. in conflicts that the U.S. will find itself in the future. 
You can take this to the bank. In the next war the U.S. is involved in, the other side is going to be armed by Russia.]]></summary>

"We have been very open about the fact that we have channels to communicate with Russia on managing risk, especially nuclear risk and risks to strategic stability," a spokesperson for the National Security Council told Newsweek. 
The spokesperson went on to say that, "as part of this effort," CIA Director William Burns "is in Ankara today to meet with his Russian intelligence counterpart."

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that Russia has not yet used the full arsenal of weapons at its disposal in its war with Ukraine. 
The comments on Telegram did not specify what weapons he meant. But it appeared to be a reference to Russia's vast nuclear arsenal, which officials have gestured towards but not deployed in the conflict. 
Medvedev has made previous nuclear threats against Ukraine, remarking in September that to Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits and that this is "certainly not a bluff".

Reuters: U.N. General Assembly calls for Russia to make reparations 
The resolution was supported by 94 of the assembly's 193 members, according to the Vice President of the U.N. General Assembly, Brian Wallace. It said Russia, which invaded its neighbor in February, "must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts." 
The resolution recommends that member states, in cooperation with Ukraine, create an international register to record evidence and claims against Russia. 
General Assembly resolutions are not binding, but they carry political weight.

   The Media Line: Ukraine’s UN Vote To Take Israel to International Court Further Strains Ties 
Ukraine voted for an International Court of Justice investigation into Israel’s “occupation” against the backdrop of Israel's refusal to provide it with weapons to fight Russia 
A vote at the United Nations General Assembly has further strained relations between Israel and Ukraine. 
Israel’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned the Ukrainian ambassador over his country’s vote against Israel at the UN General Assembly Fourth Committee on Friday on a resolution request titled “Israeli practices and settlement activities affecting the rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories.”

The city has recently been liberated after eight months of Russian occupation and is facing critical shortages of power and water.

Up to 70 per cent of the Kherson region is still controlled by Russia, and the danger posed by mines left behind by retreating forces remains significant. 

Reports suggest Russian troops are fortifying their lines along the eastern bank of the Dnieper River.]]></summary>

Rumble("play", {"video":"v1rnv1m","div":"rumble_v1rnv1m"}); WNU Editor: From Small Dead Animals (see below): 
Tarl Warwick (aka ‘styxhexenhammer666’) has a comprehensive take on how incredibly bad the FTX scandal is.  In case you’ve been sleeping under a rock, the basic scam is this: 
* The Democrats have ginned up the Ukrainian War and convinced Congress to donate billions in taxpayer money to Ukraine. 
* FTX convinced its investors that a good portion of its profits would be donated to the National Bank of Ukraine. 
* There are strong suspicions that some portion of this money sent to Ukraine was not used to fight Russia but was instead reinvested in FTX. 
* The Chief of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, was the #2 donor to the Democrats, just behind George Soros. To think that this didn’t buy him some “protection” would make you very naive. 
The fact that the legacy media is not openly reporting this massive scam is telling.   
Update: One half of The Duran provides his analysis, about 5 minutes into this video.  
Update 2: Robert Barnes and Viva Frei share their thoughts.]]></summary>

Radio Free Europe: Ukraine Revokes Some Journalist Accreditations Over Early Reports From Liberated Kherson  
KYIV -- Ukrainian authorities have revoked the accreditations of several international journalists over their reporting from the city of Kherson in the early hours after it was liberated by Ukrainian armed forces from Russian troops over the weekend. 
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Facebook on November 13 that the move was made because some foreign news organizations violated regulations on reporting from combat zones. 
"In recent days, multiple media reporters, ignoring existing bans and precautions that were in place, and without the approval of the relevant commanders and military units' public relations services, carried out reports from the city of Kherson before the completion of stabilization measures there.

Update #1: Journalists stripped of accreditation for reporting from Kherson demand it back (Ukrainska Pravda)  
Update #2: CNN and Sky News journalists stripped of their accreditation for reporting from Kherson (Ukrainska Pravda) 
WNU editor: A friend of mine who reports on the war from the Ukraine side told me that these journalists went into Kherson without the military's approval. But what really irked the authorities was that the videos they took only showed 100 - 200 civilians going out to greet the Ukrainian forces when they entered the city. The mass majority of the residents stayed inside their homes. This ruined the media narrative of thousands showing up that they wanted. 
Even Zelensky's visit to Kherson today did not result in large crowds of people going on the streets to greet him. This was a tightly controlled PR event, and the videos that were released showed mostly close-ups or the camera was positioned at ground level. Very few if any camera shots from above looking down and giving a wide angle view.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: The human race at 8 billion 
Eight billion humans are living on planet Earth — a huge milestone officially projected for and being recognized Tuesday by the U.N. 
Why it matters: People are living longer, with generally better access to health care, food, clean water and sanitation than in past generations. A smaller share of humans live in extreme poverty. 
* There are still challenges — ongoing ramifications from the pandemic, a record number of forcibly displaced people and worsening climate change. 
“It is a momentous milestone for humanity," Natalia Kanem, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), told reporters last month. 
* "Some express concerns that our world is overpopulated with far too many people and insufficient resources to sustain their lives. I am here to say clearly, that the sheer number of human lives is not a cause for fear."

Daily Mail: Rishi Sunak labels Russia a 'rogue state': Prime Minister slams Vladimir Putin for not attending G20 summit in Bali to explain his invasion of Ukraine as he declares President 'responsible for so much bloodshed'

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak labelled Russia a 'rogue state' as he attacked President Vladimir Putin for not attending the G20 summit in Bali. 
Mr Sunak believes that the president's no-show at today's summit means the Kremlin leader is making no effort to explain his actions, despite being 'responsible for so much bloodshed in Ukraine'. 
Moscow's foreign minister and Putin's attack dog Sergey Lavrov will instead go to the G20 summit. He is expected to take a battering from leaders at today's session.

Sergei Lavrov, 72, arrived in Bali via jet yesterday evening and was taken ill early this morning with a 'heart condition', according to local officials. 
But Lavrov, who is standing in for President Vladimir Putin at the summit, appeared in photos and videos shortly afterwards showing him sitting by his hotel pool and leafing through papers ahead of the economic conference, which begins tomorrow.

WNU Editor: It is a staged short video clip, but he looks OK. 
As for the video clip. Who wears dress shoes in shorts? 
He also has a cell phone. I would love to know the brand.

KYIV/FRONTLINE NORTH OF KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops have reclaimed dozens of landmine-littered settlements abandoned by Russian forces in southern Ukraine, officials said, the day after Moscow announced its withdrawal from the strategic capital city of Kherson province.
There were indications on Thursday night that Ukrainian forces were getting closer to the city of Kherson, a port at the mouth of the Dnipro River, said a Ukrainian military analyst and a media commentator.
It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

"A new international treaty that addresses autonomous weapons systems needs a more appropriate forum for negotiations."
The 40-page report, which was co-published with Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic, posits that "rather than accepting continuing stagnation" while trying to reach a deal within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), proponents of a legally binding instrument for banning killer robots should try something new.

The decision was taken at a hearing in the city of Ryazan where Krivanek complained she had endured conditions "like hell" in a penal institution similar to the kind of prison colony to which U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner is currently being transferred.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

"Begin to pull out troops," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia's commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its "special military operation" and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow's forces since the offensive began on February 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.
"We do not have any information on her exact current location or her final destination," they added.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.

"While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.
