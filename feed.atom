        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU editor: I do not post music on this blog. But WOW! The passion, lyrics, and message .... it is all there in this American protest song.

And not just minors on an island somewhere”  
Wow that’s a powerful lyric!

 
Update: You know an artist is genuine when he/she believes it is all about the music, and not the image/money/and fame .... 'Rich Men North of Richmond' Artist Turns Down $8 Million From Stunned Music Execs, Says "Nothing Special About Me" (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

ABC News: Ukraine taking heavy casualties 10 weeks into its counteroffensive 
The Ukrainian counteroffensive on the eastern front began in June.  
There is mounting evidence that Ukraine has been taking heavy casualties in its counteroffensive, which began roughly ten weeks ago.
ABC News spoke with two former U.S. soldiers who are contracted in a special forces division of the Ukrainian military and who were both injured during an operation in eastern Ukraine two weeks ago. 
Both soldiers are currently in a hospital in Kyiv but said they hope to be transferred to Germany for surgery this week in order to remove shrapnel from their bodies.

Washington has approved sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine from Denmark and the Netherlands, it has been reported. 
The White House has given the two European nations official assurances that it will expedite approval of transfer requests for the F-16s as soon as Ukrainian pilots have completed training programmes for the aircraft, an unnamed US official told Reuters. 
“The United States is in active discussions with our European partners about how we can support the efforts to provide Ukraine with F-16 pilot training as quickly as possible,” Politico quoted a State Department spokesperson as saying.

WNU Editor: This is quite a reversal from what Washington said a few days ago ....  No F-16s For Ukraine This Year (August 17, 2023). More here .... U.S. Now Promising To Fast-Track F-16 Fighters For Ukraine: Report (Warzone/The Drive).
  
   
Update: I guess we should get ready for World War 3 (see tweet below)

TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Japan said on Friday it scrambled fighter jets after two Russian IL-38 information-gathering aircraft were spotted flying between the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea where Russia is holding a joint naval patrol and exercise with China. 
Russian and Chinese navy ships have been jointly patrolling the Pacific Ocean and holding naval exercises in the East China Sea, the Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Friday. 
 "In the East China Sea, an exercise was conducted to replenish ships with water and fuel supplies from support vessels," the ministry said. 
"A detachment of ships of the Russian Navy and the PLA Navy is currently operating in the waters of the East China Sea and has covered more than 6,400 nautical miles since the beginning of the patrol."

The United States has agreed to new security ties with Japan and South Korea in a historic trilateral pact aimed at countering threats from China and North Korea, according to a senior Biden administration official. 
President Joe Biden will announce the new security framework with South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a trilateral summit Friday at Camp David, the presidential retreat that has served for decades as the site for high-profile summits between the U.S. and key partners around the world.

Reuters: West African militaries meet to finalise possible Niger intervention 
ACCRA/NIAMEY (Reuters) - West African army chiefs were due to hold a second and final day of talks on Friday in Ghana's capital Accra, where they have been hashing out the details of a possible military intervention in Niger if diplomacy fails to reverse a military coup. 
Military officers deposed Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26 and have defied calls from the United Nations, the West African bloc ECOWAS and others to reinstate him, prompting regional powers to order a standby force to be assembled. 
During their two-day meeting, which ends with a closing ceremony from around 1600 GMT, defence chiefs have been discussing logistics and other aspects of a possible deployment, according to the official schedule.

Warzone/The Drive: Ukrainian Stryker Seen In Frontline Video For The First Time

 
The Stryker is seen being attacked by a Lancet loitering munition as it uses its high-speed abilities to traverse a road in the open. 
What appears to be the first combat-related video of a U.S.-donated Stryker Armored Vehicle in Ukraine has emerged on social media. The Strykers have been puzzlingly absent from media coming from the front since the counteroffensive began, with some positing they were being held in reserve for a larger thrust. 
The 28-second video, originally posted by the Russian ZA_FROHT Telegram channel Tuesday, is apparently a Russian drone’s view of the vehicle hauling down a roadway. ZA_FROHT says the video shows "the combat work of the Osman army special forces unit to destroy the Stryker...with the Lancet loitering ammunition in the Zaporizhzhia direction."

* The Pentagon and FBI have advised families of some of the thousands killed that agreements without the death penalty are under consideration 
* It comes eleven and a half years after military prosecutors and defense lawyers began exploring a negotiated resolution to the case 
* The suspects behind the 2001 attacks were captured at various times and places in 2002 and 2003 and sent to Guantanamo for trial in 2006 
The suspected architects behind the 9/11 terror attacks may never face the death penalty under new plea agreements being considered. 
The Pentagon and FBI have advised families of some of the thousands killed that the agreements are under consideration to try and bring an end to their more than decade-long prosecution. 
The move has angered some family members of the nearly 3,000 people killed outright in the terror attacks.

Business Insider: Top tanks worth millions and other expensive heavy armor are being hunted in Ukraine by cheap exploding drones worth only a few hundred bucks 
* Ukrainian and Russian heavy armor, including their better tanks, are facing a growing threat: FPV drones. 
* These cheap hobby drones run for a few hundred dollars but are hunting tanks worth millions. 
* The growing presence of these drones on the battlefield speaks to an evolution in modern warfare. 
Cheap hobby drones rigged with a variety of explosives are wreaking havoc on expensive tanks and armored vehicles, as well as other weapons and even supply systems, on the battlefields in Ukraine, and it's a development that will likely have far-reaching implications. 
This week, a video emerged of first-person-view (FPV) drones slamming into what appeared to be a Russian T-90M, an advanced Russian tank worth as much as $4.5 million by some estimates — significantly more than the price of the drones, likely only a few hundred dollars apiece.

RT: US military could create ‘global biological crisis’ – Russian MOD 
The Pentagon is especially interested in studying infections that could be used as weapons, Moscow has claimed 
The US military is studying pathogens that could be used as biological weapons as the nation prepares for a potential new pandemic, the commander of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, claimed on Wednesday. 
The list of diseases that have attracted the attention of US specialists includes anthrax, tularemia, and various coronaviruses, Kirillov told a media briefing. Some of these pathogens are listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as “high-priority” threats that can be used as “bioterrorism agents.”

However, the fear of failing to display loyalty to "our group" makes it controversial to condemn fascism. Are we then nazi apologists?

The Grey Zone: Zelensky Holds Court With Ukraine's Most Notorious Neo-Nazi 
Western media has dismissed evidence of neo-Nazi influence in Ukraine by citing President Zelensky’s Jewish heritage. 
But new footage published by Zelensky shows the leader openly collaborating with a fascist ideologue who once pledged to “lead the white races of the world in a final crusade…against Semite-led Untermenschen.” 
Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky has uploaded a video to his Telegram channel showing him holding court with one of the most notorious neo-Nazis in modern Ukrainian history: Azov Battalion founder Andriy Biletsky.

 
Read more ....

 
WNU Editor: Patrick Lancaster has documented some of the war crimes committed by Azov in Mariupol last year (link here).

But here is the shocker. There are some who are even worse than Azov founder Andriy Biletsky. 

I am not surprised about the existence of these extremist groups. I have known about them for a long time, and I have documented some of them in the blog before this war started. 
But what catches my attention about this story is the Western media's coverage of these groups. In the case of the New York Times, they call this "complicated" .... Nazi Symbols on Ukraine’s Front Lines Highlight Thorny Issues of History (New York Times). 
Sighhh .... it is not complicated at all.  

Update: Check out Azov's emblem to the emblems that were used by German units in the Second World War (see picture below).]]></summary>

iNews: Russia puts captured Western tanks, howitzers, missiles, and drones on display at Moscow propaganda show

 
Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine had ‘debunked many myths about the superiority of Western military standards’ 
Russia has placed captured Western and Ukrainian weapons on display at a military expo in the Moscow region, including armoured vehicles, artillery guns, missiles, and drones. 
The annual event showcased more than 800 weapon types captured from the battlefield in Ukraine, Russian state media claimed.

Defence Minsister Sergei Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine had “debunked many myths about the superiority of Western military standards” in a speech at the expo. 
“We have data on… the destruction of German tanks, American armoured vehicles, British missiles and other weapons systems,” he said. “We are ready to share our assessments… with our partners.”

Newsweek: Ukraine Faces Major F-16 Jet Blow 
Ukraine will not receive F-16 fighter jets before next year, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson has said, as Kyiv's backers still hesitate to take the plunge on providing Ukraine with advanced Western jets. 
"It is already obvious that we will not be able to protect Ukraine with F-16 jets this autumn and winter," Ukrainian air force Colonel Yuriy Ihnat said in remarks reported by Ukrainian outlet Ukrinform on Thursday. 
Ukraine has long called on its Western supporters to provide fighter jets to supplement its Soviet-era air force. Although Kyiv has received additional Soviet MiG-29 jets from NATO members, Western jets such as the F-16 would be a marked upgrade for the air force, now 18 months into all-out war with Russia's more modern fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Biden turns to Camp David diplomacy for first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea  
President Joe Biden is using the presidential retreat at Camp David to help with a diplomatic mission – hosting the first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea, two countries that are putting aside a fraught history in the face of shared security challenges.
Biden’s summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is meant to serve as a show of force as the countries grapple with persistent provocative behavior from North Korea. It also comes as the president has sought to deepen ties with allies in the Indo-Pacific amid concerns about a rising China.

WNU Editor: China's position on this summit is clear .... US-Japan-South Korea summit to form 'destructive' mini NATO structure (Global Times). 
As to what is my take. 
This is all about optics. American media and the US foreign policy establishment are playing up this summit as a big event for President Biden. But I predict the only substantive thing that will be coming out of this summit will be a hotline .... U.S., Japan, South Korea to work toward security hotline at summit (Nikkei Asia). More here .... Biden to broker crisis hotline with Japan, South Korea (Axios).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US Army's 1st Infantry Division soldier trains on electronic-warfare equipment on September 6, 2019. US Army/Staff Sgt. Simon Mictizic
Insider: The US Army is rushing to rearm its electronic warriors after watching Russia and Ukraine jam each other's drones 
* Electronic warfare has played a prominent role during the war in Ukraine. 
* Ukraine and Russia are both using EW to interfere with each other's operations and aid their own.
* That has added urgency to the US Army's efforts to update its own EW weaponry. 
After years of neglecting electronic warfare, the US Army is rushing to revitalize its jamming capabilities. 
The catalyst is the Ukraine war, where cheap but plentiful drones are playing a vital — almost decisive — role, doing everything from spotting for artillery to destroying armored vehicles. 
At the same time, jamming has emerged as perhaps the most effective counter-drone weapon: Ukraine may be losing 10,000 drones a month — many to Russian electronic-warfare systems — while it strives to boost its jamming capabilities. Rather than using scarce and expensive antiaircraft missiles and guns to shoot down a drone that may cost only a few hundred dollars, it's easier to disrupt the link between the drone and its operator, causing it to crash.

"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second-ranking US diplomat met Niger's military leaders on Monday to press to reverse a coup but reported no headway a day after an ultimatum from the West African bloc ECOWAS was ignored.
Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Local, national, and global leaders warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons as they commemorated the 78th anniversary of the dropping of an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima Sunday.
This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.
Organisers had insisted the event would continue but on Monday the World Organization of the Scout Movement said Seoul had told …]]></summary>

The US sailors and Marines entered the Red Sea on Sunday after transiting through the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the US Navy's Fifth Fleet said in a statement.
They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing "greater flexibility and maritime capability" to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.
The US military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
