Reuters: Sweden Says Turkey Asking Too Much Over NATO Application 
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden is confident that Turkey will approve its application to join the NATO military alliance, but cannot fulfil all the conditions Ankara has set for its support, Sweden's prime minister said on Sunday. 
"Turkey both confirms that we have done what we said we would do, but they also say that they want things that we cannot or do not want to give them," Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a defence think-tank conference in Sweden. 
Finland and Sweden signed a three-way agreement with Turkey in 2022 aimed at overcoming Ankara's objections to their membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Politico: Serbian request to deploy troops in Kosovo denied by NATO 
Belgrade sought NATO’s authorization for deployment after a string of violent confrontations. 
NATO has declined Belgrade’s request to deploy 1,000 Serbian security and military personnel to Kosovo amid growing tensions between the two countries, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said. 
In an interview with Serbian television on Sunday, Vučić said that in a letter turning down the request, NATO’s mission in Kosovo — KFOR — declared “they believe that there is no need for the return of the Serbian Army to the territory of the Republic of Kosovo.” 
In December, Belgrade requested NATO’s authorization to deploy troops in neighboring Kosovo following a string of violent confrontations between Kosovo authorities and Serbs residing in the country’s northern region.

Condoleezza Rice and Robert M. Gates, Washington Post: Time is not on Ukraine's side 
When it comes to the war in Ukraine, about the only thing that’s certain right now is that the fighting and destruction will continue. 
Vladimir Putin remains fully committed to bringing all of Ukraine back under Russian control or — failing that — destroying it as a viable country. He believes it is his historical destiny — his messianic mission — to reestablish the Russian Empire and, as Zbigniew Brzezinski observed years ago, there can be no Russian Empire without Ukraine. 
Both of us have dealt with Putin on a number of occasions, and we are convinced he believes time is on his side: that he can wear down the Ukrainians and that U.S. and European unity and support for Ukraine will eventually erode and fracture. To be sure, the Russian economy and people will suffer as the war continues, but Russians have endured far worse.

WNU Editor: Some bitter truths from former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. 
Russia will not "return the annexed parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions to Ukraine voluntarily". And "Ukraine's economy has been completely destroyed, and the country's military forces have become directly dependent on Western supplies of equipment and weapons."]]></summary>

* President Joe Biden is due to visit the Texas border city of El Paso on Sunday 
* He has been under intense pressure to see the crisis for himself 
* But border patrol agents say he won't see the problems they have to deal with 
* The city cleared migrant camps last week and illegal crossings have dropped  
* Border agents' union says Biden will learn little from his three-hour visit 
When President Joe Biden makes his first visit to the border with Mexico on Sunday, he will hear from aid workers helping manage the immigration crisis and from local officials desperate for more support. 
What he won't see are the miserable makeshift camps dotted around El Paso that triggered headlines last month about migrants taking over the streets. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday law enforcement teams moved through the downtown area, picking up migrants who had entered the country illegally.

NYPost: Joe Biden reportedly ‘all in’ and readying launch of 2024 campaign 
President Biden is reportedly “all in” on a second run for the White House in 2024 — with an official announcement to come within weeks. 
“I think it’s all about timing at this point,” one Biden ally told The Hill Saturday. “It seems like he’s all in. It’s not really ‘if’ he runs anymore.” 
The 80-year-old Biden, the oldest president in the nation’s history, would be 82 if he is inaugurated a second time – and 86 by the end of his potential second term. 
He and his senior aides are preparing an announcement for release in February around the time of the State of the Union address to Congress, multiple sources told the outlet.

Reuters: U.S. trade deficit shrinks sharply as imports tumble 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit contracted by the most in nearly 14 years in November as slowing domestic demand amid higher borrowing costs depressed imports. 
The trade deficit decreased 21.0% to $61.5 billion, the lowest level since September 2020, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. 
The percentage decline in the trade gap was the largest since February 2009.  Imports tumbled 6.4% to $313.4 billion, with goods dropping 7.5% to $254.9 billion. Consumer goods imports were the lowest since December 2020.

* Members of Congress profited from selling defense company stocks, many after voting in favor of sending billions in weapons to Ukraine. 
* While unforeseen demand has left top weapons makers scrambling to meet production targets, defense stocks are performing well overall, according to Investopedia. 
* Several Republican lawmakers bought defense stocks but voted against Ukraine aid. 
Members of Congress raked in profits from defense contractor stocks after voting to send billions in military aid to Ukraine, according to financial disclosures and voting records reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation. 
The U.S. has delivered more than $20 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, a month before Russia invaded, and Nov. 20, according to data compiled by the Council on Foreign Relations, and Congress has approved billions more in spending on Ukraine. 
To make up for that aid, top defense companies have boosted production, and lawmakers trading on company stocks saw a financial windfall as a result, according to publicly available stock trading data.

The Guardian: US senators urge Joe Biden not to sell ‘scarce’ nuclear submarines to Australia 
Democrat and Republican lawmakers reportedly warned president that Aukus security pact could stress US submarine industrial base ‘to breaking point’ 
Two top US senators have urged president Joe Biden not to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, warning it would diminish US national security given the vessels are “scarce”. 
The intervention confirms the US is under pressure not to sell its submarines before Australia is able to build its own as part of the Aukus alliance – meaning it could be decades before Australia gains nuclear submarines. 
A spokesperson for the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, played down the leak, saying “the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines is taking shape, and an announcement remains on track to be made in the first part of this year.”

Global News: Protest held in Montreal against purchase of F-35 fighter jets

(Bloomberg) -- The World Bank is concerned that “further adverse shocks” could push the global economy into recession in 2023, with small states especially vulnerable. 
The warning is contained in an abstract for the bi-annual “Global Economic Prospects” report due for release on Tuesday and visible on the group’s Open Knowledge Repository website. 
Even without another crisis, global growth this year “is expected to decelerate sharply, reflecting synchronous policy tightening aimed at containing very high inflation, worsening financial conditions, and continued disruptions from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” the World Bank said.
“Urgent global and national efforts” are needed to mitigate the risk of such a downturn as well as debt distress in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), where investment growth is expected to remain below the average of the past two decades, the Washington-based lender said.

Authorities abroad gird up for Covid policy relaxations’ complications that many in China also hadn’t foreseen 
More places, including Taiwan and the United States, have reintroduced Covid test requirements for people coming from mainland China after the health department in Italy said about half of the newly-arrived Chinese travelers tested positive. 
 Other countries such as the United Kingdom, the Philippines and South Korea said they were considering launching similar rules as they were worried that new Covid strains could have emerged amid China’s large-scale virus infections. 
Chinese medical experts said about 5% of those who sought treatment at hospitals and clinics had pneumonia; most of them could fully recover, but a few would die within days. Authorities warned that both elderly and young Covid patients could have serious pneumonia if they should fail to seek medical treatments in an early stage.

SHANGHAI — China on Saturday marked the first day of "chun yun," the 40-day period of Lunar New Year travel known pre-pandemic as the world's largest annual migration of people, bracing for a huge increase in travelers and the spread of COVID-19 infections. 
This Lunar New Year public holiday, which officially begins January 21, will be the first since 2020 without domestic travel restrictions.  Over the last month China has seen the dramatic dismantling of its "zero-COVID" regime following historic protests against a policy that included frequent testing, restricted movement, mass lockdowns and heavy damage to the world's No.2 economy.

Kim Jong Un’s military plans are raising tensions with the South to new heights.
 Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at the highest in years after an unprecedented year of missile launches on the part of North Korea — and a more bellicose posturing from the South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol.
In 2022, North Korea launched at least 95 missiles — more than in any previous year — and shot off another short-range missile New Year’s Day of this year, according to the New York Times.

New York Times: Military Investigation Reveals How the U.S. Botched a Drone Strike in Kabul 
WASHINGTON — In the chaotic final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, U.S. military analysts observed a white Toyota Corolla stop at what they believed was an Islamic State compound. 
The Americans were already on edge. Three days earlier, a suicide bomber had killed scores of Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at a main gate of the Kabul airport. Now, officials had intelligence that there would be another attack there, and that it would involve a white Corolla. 
They tracked the car around Kabul for the next several hours. After it pulled into a gated courtyard near the airport, they authorized a drone strike. Hours later, U.S. officials announced they had successfully thwarted an attack.

Update #1: Errant Kabul drone strike was 'deadly blunder,' US military misled public about children killed: report (FOX News)  
Update #2: Pentagon misled public on drone strike that killed children – NYT (RT)   
WNU Editor: Bottom line. A lot of wrong assumptions and biases were the reasons for this disastrous drone strike. 
If I was to hazard a guess. The suicide bomber attack that killed 13 US soldiers at Kabul Airport a few days prior to this drone strike put everyone on edge, resulting in the mistakes and blunders that were then made.]]></summary>

According to Ukrinform, Reznikov said this in a post on Facebook.

Today, they are rewriting the textbooks on military art," Reznikov said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., gestures towards the newly installed nameplate at his office after he was sworn in as speaker of the 118th Congress in Washington   
Daily Mail: 'That was easy, huh?' Kevin McCarthy's opening speech sparks uproar as he issues warning to Hakeem Jeffries after FINALLY becoming Speaker following four days of chaos, 15 ballots and a near-punch up in Congress 
* The final vote tally was 216 for McCarthy, 211 for Democrat Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and six 'present' votes  
* After the 14th ballot left McCarthy one vote short of the speakership, he immediately walked over to 'present' voters Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz 
* Rep. Mike Rogers then lunged at Gaetz and had to be held back by Rep. Richard Hudson before an all-out fist fight could break out on the House floor 
On the 15th ballot over a series of four days, Rep. Kevin McCarthy finally won the coveted title: Speaker of the House.
'That was easy, huh?' McCarthy began in his victory speech - shortly after South Carolina Representative Mike Rogers had to be held back from attacking Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. 
The two Republicans almost came to blows over Gaetz's refusal to back McCarthy during the 14th vote, costing him that contest, with the violent clash coming as tempers frayed over the mammoth voting-process.

Update #1: McCarthy elected House speaker in rowdy post-midnight vote (AP)  
Update #2: Kevin McCarthy secures Speakership after historic floor battle (The Hill)   
WNU Editor: I have to give credit where credit is due. 
The "Squad" for the Democrats had the opportunity to gain real power in the last Democrat controlled Congress but folded when threatened, choosing instead to be social and main stream media distractions. 
The Republicans in the Freedom caucus wanted to be positioned to have real power and influence, did not fold, and it looks like they got it. Only time will tell if it was worth it.]]></summary>

The DeBrief: DARPA Selects Boeing’s Aurora for Potentially Game-Changing X-Plane 
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has selected Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences to design and possibly build a potentially game-changing X-plane. Part of the agency’s Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effecters (CRANE) program, the revolutionary X-plane would employ Active Flow Control (AFC) instead of conventional control surfaces to maneuver the craft at ultra-fast speeds. 
If successful, the new X-plane could completely change the way high-speed aircraft fly by combining the simplicity and stability of AFC to improve overall reliability and performance while offering a lower radar cross-section.

Defense News: Pentagon racing to restore US superiority in hypersonics 
WASHINGTON — In 1959, the U.S. Air Force and Navy partnered with NASA to fly a piloted hypersonic test aircraft, the X-15, for the first time. 
During that flight, the high-speed vehicle designed to travel at speeds of at least Mach 5 was dropped from under the wing of a B-52 bomber flying over the Mojave Desert in Southern California. Pilot Scott Crossfield carried the aircraft to an altitude of 52,341 feet and reached a peak speed of Mach 2.11. 
The flight kicked off a robust testing effort, and over the next nine years, three X-15 aircraft flew 199 times. The program eventually surpassed performance targets and achieved what is still the nation’s the fastest piloted hypersonic flight at Mach 6.72, or 4,520 miles per hour. Though it ended in 1968, discoveries from the program continue to inform the government’s hypersonic vehicle research.

WNU Editor: Currently, Russia is the indisputable leader in the hypersonic weapons race and is gaining valuable operational experience with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM), which is said to have a maximum speed of Mach 10 (link here).]]></summary>

SCMP: Chinese navy shows new heavy-lift ship carrier, revealing future role in wartime transport and vessel rescue

The Yinmahu, bearing the hull number 834, ran ship transport trials after travelling almost 1,000 nautical miles to several undisclosed locations recently, CCTV reported on Thursday.

A train carrying Russian troops and equipment has arrived in Belarus amid concerns that Moscow could use its ally’s territory to attack Ukraine from the north.

Reuters: Russia sends more Arctic oil to China, India after sanctions 
SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Russia is sending more crude oil produced in the Arctic region to China and India, and at steeper discounts, after Europe slammed its doors shut on Russian supplies last month, trade sources and data show. 
Arctic grades Arco, Arco/Novy Port and Varandey do not normally head East but are now finding new homes further afield after the European Union, G7 nations and Australia introduced a price cap on Russian oil in December, on top of an EU embargo on Russian crude by sea. Sellers are selling the Russian crudes at bigger discounts as they absorb higher shipping costs. 
"All these Arctic crudes usually go to the EU but now they have to go elsewhere," a Singapore-based trader said. 
Arctic crude exports to India have steadily increased since May, with a record 6.67 million barrels loaded in November and 4.1 million barrels in December, Refinitiv data showed. Most of the supplies were Arco and Arco/Novy Port produced at fields operated by Gazprom Neft.

The Taliban claimed while their fighters are the ultimate victors of the conflict, Harry had 'fled to his grandmother's palace' and is now struggling to maintain a place in the Royal Family.

One report claimed that hospitals told patients to bring their own bed due to shortage 
A Beijing hospital has run out of beds, forcing patients to rest on stretchers or lay on the hallway floors as COVID-19 infections run rampant in the country and stretch thin the public health sectors’ resources. 
"We have no beds, we have no oxygen, and we have a room full of sick people waiting," a health care worker in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital’s emergency room told the Financial Times ahead of Christmas. 
China has watched as cases of COVID-19 spiked following the rollback of the country’s "zero-COVID" policy as the abrupt shift occurred without any increase in vaccinations. Instead, officials tried to simply bolster hospitals in anticipation of a new COVID-19 wave by establishing hundreds of "fever clinics" to increase testing.

DW: Spike in German troop numbers asking not to be sent to war 
It's fewer than 1,000 troops, but nevertheless, the number of German Bundeswehr soldiers who asked to be exempted from serving in war zones rose markedly in 2022. This option dates back to the era of national service. 
Almost 1,000 German military personnel applied for an exemption from serving in combat zones in 2022, a sharp rise on 2021's figures, according to a report published on Friday. 
A spokesperson for the German ministry responsible for processing the applications told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland group of newspapers that 951 Bundeswehr soldiers had applied for the exemption. 
 "In 2021, 201 applications for exemption from combat service were received, in 2022 it was a total of 951 applications," the spokesperson for the Ministry for Family and Civil Affairs told the newspapers.  
The Bundeswehr has roughly 183,000 serving personnel, meaning far fewer than 1% of troops applied for the status in all.

Reuters: World food prices hit record high in 2022 
PARIS (Reuters) -A surge in the cost of most food commodities last year, as the disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of shortages, sent the U.N. food agency's average price index to the highest level on record. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 143.7 points in 2022, up 14.3% from 2021, and the highest since records started in 1990, the agency said on Friday. 
The index had already gained 28% in 2021 from the previous year as the world economy recovered from the impact of the pandemic. 
Food prices surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year on fears of disruptions to Black Sea trade. T
hey have pared some of their gains since, in part because of a U.N.-backed grain export channel from Ukraine and the prospect of improved supplies in producing countries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newsweek: Ukraine Reveals End Date for War With Russia 
In a recent interview, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence hinted at a possible end date for his country's war with Russia. 
Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, told ABC News in an interview shared by the outlet on Wednesday that he expects the "hottest" fighting between Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces to occur in March. 
Budanov added that he expects Ukraine's military to make a large push against the invading Russians in the spring. According to him, those efforts could lead to what Ukraine feels would be an end to the war. 
"This is [when we will see more] liberation of territories and dealing the final defeats to the Russian Federation," Budanov said. "This will happen throughout Ukraine, from Crimea to the Donbas."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[reported that a passenger on an Air India flight was detained after drunkenly urinating on an empty seat and another passenger's blanket.


	"Officers from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), an Indian federal police force, detained the man when the flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Fortune reported," the story continued. "The man and the other passenger discussed the incident came to an 'understanding,' an airline representative said. He gave the passenger a written apology, and she did not want the airline to file a police report. The man was then allowed to leave the airport."

similar incident happened last month, when a business class passenger urinated on an elderly woman. According to The Hindu, "The airline not only failed to hand him over to security personnel but also forced the woman to sit in the urine-soaked seat for a part of her journey."

This comes after a number of U.S. airlines went through years of elevated incidents on flights, spurred in part by passengers enraged over mask rules during the COVID-19 pandemic — something which the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately cracked down on with stiff fines, penalties, and criminal referrals in the most severe cases.
In one highly-publicized incident, an intoxicated American Airlines passenger on a flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City screamed racist threats at an Asian woman who had gotten up to stretch her back, then snarled and gnawed on his mask like an animal.]]></summary>

* Russia's 36-hour ceasefire to allow for Orthodox Christmas celebrations was set to begin at midday, after it was ordered by Vladimir Putin on Thursday evening 
* But outgoing and incoming shelling could still be heard in eastern Ukraine 
* Ukrainian officials said the city of Kramatorsk was hit, as was Kherson 
Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its positions as Vladimir Putin's unilateral 36-hour 'truce' gets under today, with Ukraine blaming Moscow for the strikes. 
The ceasefire - proposed by the Russian despot on Thursday to run from from 12pm, January 6 to midnight on January 8 - was rejected Thursday  by Ukraine as a Moscow sham, with analysts suggesting it was an attempt to allow Putin's forces to regroup. 
Just hours after the 36-hour truce was set to begin, rockets slammed into a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk close to Bakhmut and on the eastern frontline, damaging 14 homes but with no casualties, the mayor said.

Breaking Defense: F-35 program pauses engine acceptance as crash investigation continues  
The news comes just a few days after prime contractor Lockheed Martin reached an agreement with the government on a $30 billion contract for hundreds more F-35s. 
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has temporarily stopped accepting engines for the F-35 joint strike fighter while it investigates the cause of a mid-December crash of an F-35B jet. 
“Currently, acceptance of new engines has been suspended,” JPO spokesman Chief Petty Officer Matthew Olay said in a statement. “That pause began Tuesday, Dec. 27. The length of the pause is currently to be determined, and it is hard to say how long it will last given the current investigation of what specifically would allow deliveries to resume. The root cause analysis and accident investigation need to be completed first.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kenyan police are investigating the killing of an LGBTQ rights activist whose body was discovered stuffed in a metal trunk in a killing that has sparked national outrage.
Edwin Chiloba, a 25-year-old fashion designer and model, was found dead by the roadside Wednesday some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the Rift Valley town of Eldoret, media reports said.
Police spokesperson Resila Onyango told Kenya's The Star newspaper that the motive of the killing was still unknown.
"Experts are handling the matter," Onyango said.
Rights activists have called for speedy investigations into attacks on LGBTQ people who face a precarious existence in the predominantly conservative Christian nation.
Homosexuality is taboo in Kenya and across much of Africa, and gays often face discrimination or persecution.
Attempts to overturn British colonial-era laws banning homosexuality in Kenya have proven unsuccessful, and gay sex remains a punishable crime with penalties that include imprisonment of up to 14 years.
"It is truly worrisome that we continue to witness escalation in violence targeting LGBTQ+ Kenyans," the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Friday.
"Everyday, the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons are being violated with little consequence for perpetrators," it added, urging the police "to conduct swift investigations and ensure the killers are apprehended and prosecuted".
The Kenya LGBTQ Feminist Forum in western Kenya where Chiloba lived, said he had used "fashion to deconstruct gender and advocate for the rights of the marginalized group".
"We want to know as a community as Kenyans, what happened to Edwin, why he was murdered and who dropped his body at the scene," the group's programs director Becky Mududa said.
The death of Chiloba comes after another LGBTQ activist was found murdered in April last year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican security forces captured on Thursday drug cartel leader Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, ahead of a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden next week.
Coming three years after a failed operation to detain Ovidio ended in humiliation for the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the arrest triggered a wave of violence that forced authorities to shutter airports and schools in the city of Culiacan.
Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told a news conference that security forces had captured the 32-year-old senior member of the Sinaloa Cartel. Ovidio, a fugitive since the previous arrest attempt, was now being held in the capital Mexico City, Sandoval said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - "That's an attack plane, Dad," said one of David Tellez's young children as they spotted Mexican military aircraft touching down alongside their Aeromexico passenger plane early on Thursday.
Then the gunfire began.
"As we were accelerating for take-off, we heard gunshots very close to the plane, and that's when we all threw ourselves to the floor," Tellez said after the incident in the northern city of Culiacan.
Violence broke out on Thursday throughout Culiacan after the arrest of Ovidio Guzman, the son of the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo, and a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel.
Aeromexico said nobody on Tellez's flight had been hurt. The Culiacan airport closed shortly after, as security forces patrolled the city, which was strewn with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Thursday, part of what the U.S. military calls routine activity but which riles China.
In recent years, U.S. warships, and on occasion those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada, have sailed through the strait, drawing the ire of China, which claims Taiwan against the objections of its democratically elected government.
In a statement, the U.S. military said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Chung-Hoon carried out the transit.
"Chung-Hoon’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific," the statement added.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said the ship sailed in a northerly direction through the strait, that its forces had monitored its passage and observed nothing out of the ordinary.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People's Republic of China.
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
China has never ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.
A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intense gunfire rocked a cartel heartland in northwestern Mexico on Thursday after security forces launched an operation in which a son of jailed drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was reportedly arrested.
Vehicles were set on fire and shooting shook several areas of Culiacan -- the state capital of the Guzmans' bastion, Sinaloa -- including the city's airport, an AFP reporter said.
A security source who did not want to be named told AFP that the violence had broken out after an operation to capture Ovidio Guzman, but did not confirm reports by Milenio TV and other media that he had been captured.
The drug lord's son has allegedly helped to run the notorious Sinaloa Cartel since his father was extradited to the United States in 2017.
His capture would be a high-profile win in the war on drugs as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to welcome US President Joe Biden next week for a North America leaders' summit.
The Sinaloa state government urged people to stay at home on Thursday as the unrest sparked panic among residents seeking shelter.
Lopez Obrador told reporters that his government would announce the result of the operation later in the day.
"El Chapo" is serving a life prison sentence in the United States for trafficking hundreds of tons of drugs into the US over the course of 25 years.
However, his cartel remains one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Ovidio Guzman was captured briefly once before in 2019, but security forces freed him after his cartel waged an all-out war in response in the streets of Culiacan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Greater Vancouver Zoo is being sued after a toddler was attacked by bears into whose enclosure she had reached.
"The notice of civil claim filed in British Columbia Supreme Court by the girl’s guardian, Richard Hanson, says the August, 2019, incident left her with a fractured wrist, and one of her fingers was partially amputated," said the report. "The lawsuit filed last month alleges the zoo and K-Bros Developments Corporation, which owns the property in Langley, B.C., owed a duty of care to the child, who was two years old at the time, given their control of the premises and the bears."
"It says the girl had reached through an 'unguarded chain link fence' at the zoo’s black bear exhibit and a 'group' of the animals 'attacked and mauled' her arm," said the report. "BC Emergency Health Services issued a statement shortly after the incident, saying a patient had been airlifted from the zoo in serious condition. Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court."
The lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being "vicious", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.
"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises," said the report. "It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl."
Zoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of "petting or feeding" the animals.]]></summary>

But France’s nuclear sector has been going through a tricky time, as a significant proportion of its reactors have had to close for maintenance. Analysts blame a mixture of bad luck and the consequences of a political deal from a decade ago.
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Europe’s energy crisis and climate change racks the world, you could expect France to be congratulating itself on its vast fleet of nuclear power stations. After all, nuclear energy produces barely any CO2 and does not leave countries relying on Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unknown vandals desecrated a Protestant cemetery in Jerusalem, damaging more than 30 gravestones, according to Israeli media reports.

Israeli radio reported considerable damage to the Zion cemetery on Wednesday, with gravestones damaged and crosses broken.
The Jerusalem Post, citing Jerusalem University College, reported that the perpetrators were two Jewish teenagers, saying the damage amounted to the equivalent of $99,700.
An Israeli police spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that an investigation was under way, but did not comment on the identity of the suspects.
A video shared on social media showed two figures throwing large stones at graves and overturning a cross.
The incident reportedly occurred on Sunday.
The cemetery, founded in 1848, also serves as a burial place for Jerusalem's German-speaking Protestant community. The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, spoke on Twitter of "contemptible criminal behaviour" by the perpetrators. "I hope the police will investigate, find these guys and bring them to justice."
