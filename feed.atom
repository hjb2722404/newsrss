        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has updated its information related to Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to include any forks that may occur.
In a Thursday update to an Aug. 16 blog post, Coinbase said it would assess all potential forks in the Ethereum blockchain on a case-by-case basis.” The crypto exchange previously said that he planned to ‘briefly pause’ Ether(ETH) and deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 tokens during the merger, which are expected to take place between September 10 and September 20.
“Should an ETH PoW fork occur after The Merge, this asset will be reviewed with the same rigor as any other asset listed on our exchange,” Coinbase said.

Rest assured that all potential Ethereum forked tokens, including PoW forks, will go through the same strict listing review process that is performed for any other asset listed on our exchange.
— Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) August 25, 2022

Exchanges and crypto companies dealing with ETH have made announcements informing customers of all the preparations needed before the merger, from proof of work, or PoW, to proof of stake, or PoS.  Many expect blockchain power consumption to drop precipitously, scalability to improve, and the network to be less vulnerable to attack.
It is unclear how crypto users might respond to a forked PoW token listed on Coinbase or any crypto exchange during Ethereum transitions.  Wednesday, the platform launched an ERC-20 token which will allow customers to use staked ETH while earning rewards, cbETH.

Binance too said On Thursday, it might offer support for new tokens created by a potential hard fork but would “guarantee no listings” without a review process.  BitMEX made a similar announcement on August 8, adding that the offer was “highly speculative” and “may never exist”.

 Insider: Bulgaria's return to Russian gas supply talks is 'inevitable' amid steep shortages, energy chief says 
* A return to Russian gas supply talks is "inevitable," Bulgaria's energy chief said on Monday. 
* "Given the demands of business and the trade unions, in reality, talks with Gazprom to renew supplies are inevitable," he said. 
Bulgaria's energy minister Rossen Hristov said the country would likely go back to talks with Russia on resuming gas deliveries from state-run energy supplier Gazprom. 
Gazprom provided 90% of Bulgaria's natural gas until April, when it cut supplies after Bulgaria refused to pay in rubles.  "Given the demands of business and the trade unions, in reality, talks with Gazprom to renew supplies are inevitable," Energy Minister Rossen Hristov said at a press event, according to Reuters.

        <updated>2022-08-26T17:19:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argentine authorities seized 1.6 tons of cocaine hidden in animal feed destined for Dubai and detained 12 people, police said on Friday.
The seizure, which took place overnight from Thursday to Friday in the central city of Rosario, highlights the role played by Argentine ports in trafficking South American drugs internationally.
The cocaine "is worth approximately $60 million," said Mariano Giuffra, head of the dangerous drugs department in the federal police.
The arrests took place at various sites around the country.
"They are all Argentines and some of them are known drug traffickers," added Giuffra.
Several firearms, sports cars and a large amount of cash were also seized.
Rosario, located 310 kilometers (190 miles) from Buenos Aires, is Argentina's third-largest city and the main port for agricultural exports to the Atlantic.
It is also the most violent city in Argentina, with a murder rate three times the national average.
The cocaine had been hidden in bags of corn fodder that was about to be loaded onto a container destined for Dubai.
Police said the cocaine probably originated in Colombia, the world's largest producer of the drug.
While most cocaine is produced by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia -- where growing coca leaf, which is the main ingredient in the white powder, is legal -- experts say Argentina has increasingly taken on an important role in trafficking the drug.
Argentina has several major ports, has a large supply of quality chemicals needed to turn coca leaf into cocaine, and provides ample opportunities for money laundering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Umit Bektas
MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Actors in a heavily bombarded city in southern Ukraine have returned to the stage, putting on their first performance since Russia's invasion in an underground shelter converted into a tiny theatre.
A few dozen theatre-goers descended steep concrete steps into the subterranean venue on Thursday for the opening night of a show put on by the Mykolaiv Art Drama Theatre. Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.
"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller," said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.
Theatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as "art-therapy", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.
Ievhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.
"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun'," he said. "There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good."

As a Resistance fighter in Lyon, rescuing Jews was at the core of René Nodot’s mission. But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.
“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”

BBC: Nato investigates hacker sale of missile firm data 
Nato is assessing the impact of a data breach of classified military documents being sold by a hacker group online. 
The data includes blueprints of weapons being used by Nato allies in the Ukraine conflict. 
Criminal hackers are selling the dossiers after stealing data linked to a major European weapons maker.  MBDA Missile Systems admitted its data was among the stash but claimed none of the classified files belong to the firm. 
The pan-European company, which is headquartered in France, said its information was hacked from a compromised external hard drive, adding that it was cooperating with authorities in Italy, where the data breach took place. 
 It is understood investigations are centred around one of MBDA's suppliers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Family members of 10 miners who have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for three weeks said on Thursday they rejected a government plan to find the miners that they said officials described as lasting from six to 11 months.
Three miners had been rescued and hospitalized, the Security and Citizen Protection Ministry said in an update on the rescue efforts at the mine in the Sabinas municipality of the northern state of Coahuila.
Television footage showed family members outside the mine clamoring for information on the missing men.
"I hope we find them safe," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier on Twitter. Lopez Obrador had said nine miners were likely to be trapped, but authorities revised the number later.
Some 92 soldiers were working at the scene, as well as specialists and rescue dogs, the president said.
The Labor Ministry said it had not received any complaints about safety at the mine, which began operations in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia on Friday tapped a former high court judge to investigate ex-prime minister Scott Morrison's decision to secretly appoint himself to several key ministerial portfolios.
Incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the creation of the inquiry, saying the country's system of "parliamentary democracy" had been tested.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, conservative leader Morrison appointed himself to the ministries of health, treasury, finance, resources and home affairs without telling colleagues or the public.
Albanese said the inquiry was essential "to ensure that this can never happen again".
The probe will be led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and will report by November 25.
"We need to have a quick and appropriate inquiry," said Albanese, adding this is "not about the politics, but how this happened, why this happened and who knew about it."

He did not rule out Morrison or other former government ministers from being compelled to give evidence if necessary.
Morrison has insisted he was right to take "emergency powers" during the tumult of the pandemic.
"I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest," he said in a defiant first public appearance after the scandal broke, dismissing critics who were "standing on the shore after the fact".
Three of Morrison's fellow conservative prime ministers have also criticized the former premier's behavior.

Euractiv: Scholz’s SPD lawmakers demand an end to Ukraine war, negotiations with Russia 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is steering his pacifist SPD party through precedent-breaking arms shipments for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, has been called on to engage in a diplomatic offensive by lawmakers. 
As a consequence of the “Zeitenwende” Scholz observed, the German government boosted its military budget by an extraordinary €100 billion and shipped arms into a hot conflict for the first time ever. Parts of the SPD struggled with these measures and have now sent a letter signed by multiple MPs and MEPs to Scholz, titled “The weapons must be silent!” 
“The escalation spiral must be stopped,” the letter reads, which calls for a “modus vivendi.”

"We need this place to fight on the cultural front too," says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.
The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides "a form of 'art therapy'" for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.
Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For almost a decade, farmer Qin Bin, 50, has toiled his plot, growing peaches and dragon fruits for sale to visiting tourists at his orchard on the outskirts of the Chinese megacity of Chongqing.
But this year's crop is devastated, another casualty of a blistering heatwave that has engulfed southern China in the country's hottest summer on record and subsumed half its land in drought.
"This is absolutely the first time in my life encountering such a disaster," he tells AFP.
"This year is a very miserable one.
"We should be harvesting fruits right now, but it's all gone, dead from the scorching sun."
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, forcing power cuts that have hit agricultural workers hard.

After 15 years, including four prior formal sessions, negotiators have yet to reach a legally binding agreement to address the growing environmental and economic challenges involving the high seas, also known as international waters -- a zone which encompasses almost half the planet.
Many had hoped that this fifth session, which began on August 15 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, would be the last and yield a final text on "the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction," or BBNJ for short.

Bloomberg: Torrent of cash for Ukraine arms puts Pentagon watchdog on alert 
As the Pentagon rushes to replenish billions of dollars in weapons sent to Ukraine, its inspector general says he’s on high alert for signs of fraud and abuse in the thousands of contracts being awarded. 
“We have developed a universe of thousands of Ukraine-related contracts” that come in under $2 million each, Acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell said in an interview. That’s more than 7,800 contracts valued at a combined $2.2 billion, O’Donnell added, even before an approaching deluge of bigger-ticket orders for advanced weapons such as the long-range HIMARS rocket systems prized by Ukrainian troops.

Moon Of Alabama: Ukraine Previously Cited High Casualty Rates - It Is Now Lowballing Those Numbers 
In June several Ukrainian officials admitted that their army had some 700 or even more casualties per day. The numbers were played up to gain access to more 'western' weapons.

Russia Hits Train Station in Deadly Attack on Ukraine’s Independence Day - New York Times

The attack, which took place in an area about 74 miles east of the city of Dnipro in Ukraine-controlled territory, was one of the deadliest strikes on the country’s railways since April, when more than 50 people were killed when a rocket slammed into a crowded railway platform in eastern Ukraine.

Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn is the latest in a series of US lawmakers to visit Taiwan amid tensions with China 
Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., landed in Taiwan for an unannounced visit on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the trip. 
Blackburn is only the latest in a series of U.S. lawmakers to fly to Taiwan, a trend that has outraged the Chinese government. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governed island in early August, and she was the highest-level U.S. official to do so since Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997. 
The Pentagon declined to comment on Blackburn's trip, stating that it does not comment on security details.

Breitbart: Winter of Discontent: Germany to Implement Energy Rationing Amid Fears of Gas Riots 
As officials in the country express their fears about future gas riots this winter, the German government has announced a host of new energy rationing rules that will come into effect from next Thursday. 
In what appears to be the latest attempt to avoid energy shortages this winter, the German government is to implement restrictions limiting the use of energy in the country. 
Ministers appear to be hoping that the rationing efforts will help reduce the risk of energy shortages this coming winter, with a number of bigwigs now openly fearful of a future of public unrest and gas riots should people be left unable to adequately heat their homes.

Reuters: “Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday.” 
As I arrived in Berlin today after a gap of almost a year, I noticed how big businesses and ordinary Germans are gearing up for a massive power crisis triggered by the dwindling Russian energy supplies. 
Government ministers, who haven’t done an honest day’s work in their lives, have taken it upon themselves to ‘educate’ hardworking Germans on how to save on electricity, room heating, and hot water. 
I have always considered German media and public debates, whether over Climate Change, Brexit, or pandemic, to be driven by wild hysteria and doom-and-gloom predictions. But this time, the German Angst is based on some challenging and bitter facts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zee News: China strongly opposes Indo-US military drills, calls it violation of bilateral agreement 
India and the US will kick-start an over two-week-long mega military exercise in Uttarakhand's Auli in October amid the fast-evolving regional security scenario. The 18th edition of exercise "Yudh Abhyas" is scheduled to take place from October 14 to 31. 
Beijing: China's defence ministry on Thursday said it firmly opposes any third party meddling in the border issue and hopes India will abide by the bilateral agreements to not hold military drills near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the very pacts it has been accused of violating in eastern Ladakh leading to a prolonged standoff. 
Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defence (MND), made the comments while replying to a question about reports of special forces of the US and India recently holding a joint combat exercise in the southern foothills of the Himalayas and their plans to conduct a joint military exercise code-named "War Exercise" (Yudh Abhyas) in October, close to the border.

Last year, Navy Adm. Phil Davidson, the former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, cautioned Congress that China is preparing to move against Taiwan by 2027. That assessment is shared by the current Indo-Pacific commander, the current CIA director, and Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state and ex-CIA director.

The musical case against the musicians — who face RICO charges for alleged gang activity — is built on decades of racist precedent.
 Back in May, rapper and record label exec Young Thug was arrested on suspicion of gang activity and conspiracy to violate Georgia’s criminal racketeering law. Days later, Gunna — Young Thug’s Billboard-topping protégé who is signed to his label — and 26 others were charged in a 56-count RICO indictment for gang activity, including robbery and murder. 
“Prosecutors are alleging that they are part of a gang that has committed a number of crimes throughout Atlanta,” said Jewel Wicker, editor-at-large for Capital B Atlanta in an interview with…]]></summary>

Three months ago, Sonya, a 25-year-old who works at a major mobile gaming company and moonlights as a tutor, made one of the toughest decisions of her life: She left Russia. 
She had an old but cozy communal apartment with her boyfriend and two other roommates in Moscow’s city center, a tight-knit group of friends, and spent several days a week taking classes at a local dance academy—her lifelong passion. 
 “It’s my home. My family, friends are there. My whole life. How can you possibly abandon all these things?" she told Fortune.

(CNN)Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is held by Russian forces, was completely disconnected from the power grid for the first time in its history on Thursday, according to the country's nuclear operator. 
The complex was disconnected Thursday due to fires at a nearby ash pits, causing the last remaining power line connecting to Ukraine's energy grid to disconnect twice, Energoatom said in a statement. 
"The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) from the power grid -- the first in the history of the plant," it wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes slammed Republicans for a history of giving favorable treatment to CEOs and other wealthy people.
During an appearance on Real America's Voice, Cortes said that Democrats were "smart" to forgive student loans for many borrowers.
"Privileged people, many of whom chose to go and pursue worthless degrees are getting a handout from Joe Biden," he told podcast host Steve Bannon. "In terms of political payoffs, and that's what this is, a crass political payoff, at least the Democrats are smart enough to payoff American voters."
"Establishment Republicans, they pay off CEOs and defense contractors," Cortes continued. "This about that contrast. If you're going to do power politics and you're going to do crass payoffs, at least the Democrats know where their bread is buttered and they're going to pay off voters."
The ex-Trump adviser added: "What Mitch McConnell does and establishment Republicans do is they reward the CEOs of places like Northrop Grumman and therein lies one of the key reasons why in America, as you often talk about, the Republicans have won election after election for decades while we are losing our country."
As president, former President Donald Trump signed a tax cut law that reportedly helps billionaires pay less in taxes than the working class.

LUANDA (Reuters) -Angola's ruling party, which has been in power for nearly five decades, looked set to win a national election with a solid lead over the main opposition on Thursday, after most votes had been counted amid accusations of fraud. 
A win for the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) would extend its continuous rule since independence from Portugal in 1975. 
Earlier on Thursday the opposition party UNITA's vice-presidential candidate Abel Chivukuvuku told Portuguese radio station TSF that the party was considering contesting the results because they did not "correspond to reality", fuelling fears of post-election violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.
Roizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.
The court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.
Roizman denies all the charges.
On Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words "war" and "invasion" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
State news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.
Roizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.

While August harvests used to be extremely rare, they are now becoming common due to climate change, say winemakers. And the warming weather may soon start forcing changes to how the famous sparkling wine is produced.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.
Russia's defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.
"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine," Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.
"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families."
Brown said the human toll of the attack was "just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine."
She cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.
"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain," she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 20,000 people have flocked to an Iranian museum showcasing renowned Western artists' works, some for the first time -- part of a treasure trove amassed before the Islamic Revolution.
The museum's collection is reputed to be the greatest line-up of modern masterpieces outside Europe and the United States, and includes multi-million-dollar pieces, much of which has been kept under wraps since the 1979 revolution.
The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art "surprises me every time," said visitor Shahin Rajabi, 35. "The current show is no exception."
The current "Minimalism and Conceptual Art" exhibition features 132 works by 34 world-famous contemporary artists, museum director Ebadreza Eslami said, including Marcel Duchamp, Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd and the duo Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost two decades after the Bali bombings left Thiolina Ferawati Marpaung with permanent eye injuries, news that one of the masterminds could be released early has caused fresh trauma.
Indonesia's latest reduction to Umar Patek's prison sentence -- revealed last week by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and confirmed by AFP -- means the bomber could be released on parole before the island marks the 20th anniversary of the attacks in October.
That is a galling prospect for survivors of the attack, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians.
"It is not that I don't respect other people's rights, but he has hurt the survivors and families with his evil and inhumane acts," Marpaung told AFP by phone from Denpasar, the resort island's biggest city.

China carried out its largest-ever military exercises around the democratically governed island after a visit this month by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The trip infuriated Beijing, which saw it as an attempt by Washington to interfere in China’s internal affairs. 
The overall proposed defense budget by President Tsai Ing-wen’s Cabinet sets a 13.9% year-on-year increase to a record T$586.3 billion ($19.41 billion).

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Another group of U.S. lawmakers will arrive in Taiwan on Thursday evening, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported, the third such visit this month and defying pressure from Beijing for these trips not to take place. 
China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory against the strong objections of the democratically-elected government in Taipei, launched military drills near the island after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came in early August. 
The Central News Agency did not name the lawmakers who were coming on Thursday, saying only that they would arrive on a U.S. military aircraft at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport and would meet Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday.

Reuters: Taliban say they've not found body of al Qaeda leader 
KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban have not found the body of Ayman al-Zawahiri and are continuing investigations, group spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said on Thursday, after the United States said they killed the al Qaeda leader in an airstrike in Kabul last month. 
The United States killed Zawahiri with a missile fired from a drone while he stood on a balcony at his hideout in July, U.S. officials said, in the biggest blow to al Qaeda since U.S. Navy SEALS shot dead Osama bin Laden more than a decade ago.

Update #2: Taliban say they’ve not found body of Al Qaeda leader Zawahiri (DAWN)   
WNU Editor: It is not in the Taliban's interest that Al Qaeda Leader Ayman al-Zawahiri's body is found. Verifying that he was killed at the home of a top Taliban leader would undermine current talks with the US to release billions in aid that have been frozen since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan last year.]]></summary>

The Pentagon said Wednesday it is looking into reports of an exchange of fire between pro-Iranian groups in Syria and the US coalition forces. 
Meanwhile during the evening (local time), The Jerusalem Post reports that President Biden has authorized a second round of US airstrikes:    
A second round of airstrikes by the US-led international coalition operating in Iraq and Syria targeted Iran-linked sites in the Deir al-Zor region of eastern Syria on Wednesday evening, according to local reports. 
 The airstrikes targeted Iran-backed militias in the city of Al-Mayadin and Saker Island, according to the reports.

L.A. Times: Six months of war in Ukraine — and it's only growing more dangerous 
Far from bogging down in a stalemate, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has evolved into an increasingly dangerous conflict as it passes the six-month mark, with fighting around Europe's largest nuclear plant, a high-profile assassination in Moscow, escalating threats and daring Ukrainian attacks in Russian-held territory.
"The dynamic of the battlefield" is shifting, said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of U.S. Army Europe. Armed with increasingly lethal weapons from the U.S. and other allies, Ukraine has been able to occasionally seize the initiative and surprise Russian forces. 
It is not clear, however, how long that can last or whether Ukraine can build on those small victories enough to dictate the course of the war.

WNU Editor: I am focused on the massive battles that are now occurring in the Donbas. This is where the main portions of the Russian and Ukraine armies are deployed, and if there is a collapse of the Ukraine army in the Donbas in the coming weeks that some are now predicting, the chaos that will ensue will put tremendous pressure on Ukraine's allies to get directly involved in the war. And if that happens, this war will then definitely be entering a very dangerous phase.]]></summary>

LONDON (Reuters) - Cold winters helped Moscow defeat Napoleon and Hitler. President Vladimir Putin is now betting that sky-rocketing energy prices and possible shortages this winter will persuade Europe to strong arm Ukraine into a truce -- on Russia's terms. 
That, say two Russian sources familiar with Kremlin thinking, is the only path to peace that Moscow sees, given Kyiv says it will not negotiate until Russia leaves all of Ukraine. 
"We have time, we can wait," said one source close to the Russian authorities, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The Russian leadership may want a quick end to the war, but for the past 2 - 3 months the Kremlin and Russian media narrative has been focused on telling Russians that this conflict is going to last a minimum of 2 years. Putin has calculated (correctly in my opinion) that time is on Russia's side.

The above Reuters analysis is correct that if Europe experiences a crippling energy crisis this winter, they have the power to tell Ukraine to capitulate and end the war or EU aid and support will end. Faced with such an option, Kyiv will have no choice but to sue for peace. But my gut tells me that the EU is going to stick it out. They have vested all of their credibility in a Ukraine victory that will be total and complete.]]></summary>

According to the report, the purpose of the operation - conducted with the US - was to simulate an aerial and maritime strike on Iran in the Red Sea. 
Israeli Air Force F-35 advanced fifth-generation fighter jets penetrated Iranian airspace multiple times over the last two months, according to the Saudi media outlet Elaph. Both Iranian and Russian radars failed to locate them, according to the report. 
According to the news site, Israel and the US have conducted large-scale exercises over the Red Sea in order to simulate an aerial and maritime strike on Iran and the seizure of Iranian vessels in the Gulf Sea. 
The exercises come as part of a series of drills conducted by the two countries both secretly and publicly in order to prepare for strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Defense One: China Could Overtake US in Space Without ‘Urgent Action,’ Warns New Pentagon Report 
America needs a long-term goal in space to be able to compete with Beijing, Pentagon industrial-base group writes. 
The United States could be eclipsed by China in orbit unless it unites around a common goal for space, as it did during the race to the Moon a half-century ago, according to a report released Wednesday. 
 China is working to become the world’s dominant space power “economically, diplomatically, and militarily” by 2045, according to the State of the Space Industrial Base report for 2022, which was written by officials from the Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit, Air Force, and Air Force Research Laboratory. 
They argue that the United States must quickly act to maintain its advantage over Beijing, including using more commercial technology and setting long-term, bipartisan policy goals.

Politico: U.S. reacts to Iranian comments on draft nuclear deal 
Negotiations appear to be inching toward the finish line. 
VIENNA — The U.S. and Iran are closing in on an agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal after almost 17 months of negotiations. 
The United States relayed to the EU on Wednesday its much-awaited response to Iran’s comments on the draft proposal to restore the nuclear deal, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told POLITICO. 
The spokesperson of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani confirmed that it had received the U.S. response via EU senior official Enrique Mora, who acts as a mediator and coordinator of the talks. 
Iran still refuses to talk directly with the U.S. “Iran has started reviewing the US comments, and after the review Tehran will submit its views to the coordinator,” Kanaani said.

Newsweek: What Is Russia's Anti-Putin 'National Republican Army'? 
Darya Dugina, daughter of an influential ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was killed in a suspected car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow organized by the so-called National Republican Army (NRA), according to a former member of Russia's Duma who is now living in exile.

Dugina was the daughter of Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, who has been credited with being a key architect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In 2018, shortly after Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Massachusetts lawmakers concerned about Roe’s possible overthrow passed a law contradicting archaic statutes targeting young women – known as the Wicked Women Act – repealing abortion and contraception bans still in effect but unenforceable at the time due to Roe and other court rulings.

London (CNN Business)The United Kingdom will have to find an answer to soaring energy bills soon or risk a humanitarian crisis. 
But freezing gas and electricity prices over the next two winters could cost the government over £100 billion ($118 billion), more than it spent paying millions of people's salaries during the pandemic. 
Earlier this year, the UK government tried to protect households against 90% of the expected increases in energy bills through tax cuts, energy bill rebates and direct payments. 
But natural gas and power prices have shot up since then, as have forecasts of future increases.

(CNN)Voters in the oil-rich African nation of Angola will go to the polls on Wednesday to decide who will lead the country -- the party that has been in power for nearly five decades, or an opposition promising a fresh start especially for disaffected youth. 
President João Lourenço of the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party is hoping for a second term in office. He has governed Angola since 2017. Lourenço wrapped up his campaign on Monday, claiming to have built "a new Angola."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - At least 15 people died and 50 more were wounded on Wednesday when Russian forces launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian railway station, said President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
In a video address to the United Nations, Zelenskiy said the rockets had hit a train in the town of Chaplyne, some 145 km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Four carriages were on fire, he said.

Reuters: Just over half of Americans say U.S. should back Ukraine until Russia withdraws - Reuters/Ipsos poll 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After half a year of war in Ukraine, a slim majority of Americans agree that the United States should continue to support Kyiv until Russia withdraws all its forces, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday. 
The polling suggests continued support for President Joe Biden's policy of backing Ukraine, despite economic worries and domestic political developments grabbing Americans' attention in recent months. 
The Biden administration has provided weapons and ammunition for Ukraine's bid to repel Russian forces and is expected to announce a new security assistance package of about $3 billion, a U.S. official said, as Ukraine's marks its Independence Day on Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram shut down what is believed to be a propaganda operation targeting China, Iran and Russia from the United States, according to Vice News.
Researchers from the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO), who coordinated with the private research company Graphika, said that the operation had been going on since 2017. 
"These findings unveil what we believe are the first major covert pro-America and Western operations identified and suspended by Twitter and Meta,” said one of the researcher who explored the efforts. 
Vice News explained that the operation was remarkably similar to what the Russian government did in the 2016 election, using memes, petitions and fake news. Photos were altered by artificial intelligence, and hashtag operations using pro-US propaganda were all used to undermine the Russian government.

Vice News also noted that the report showed tech companies were willing to take action against propaganda, even if it was by the United States. It just took them five years to do it.

The "joint investigation found an interconnected web of accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and five other social media platforms that used deceptive tactics to promote pro-Western narratives in the Middle East and Central Asia.”]]></summary>

But as they near a restoration of the 2015 agreement, Biden administration officials are unlikely to heed the Israeli calls. 
The Israeli government is ramping up pressure on the Biden administration to walk away from international efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal. 
But the White House isn’t budging.  Israeli national security adviser Eyal Hulata visited the White House on Tuesday, where he met with his U.S. counterpart, Jake Sullivan, to raise Israel’s concerns about the latest draft roadmap to a revival of the 2015 agreement.
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz is due to see Sullivan in Washington on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Biden orders airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria following attacks near base holding US troops last week 
(CNN)President Joe Biden ordered airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria on Tuesday, a little over a week after a number of rockets struck near a military base in northeastern Syria housing US troops. 
The airstrikes conducted by the US military targeted Iranian-backed groups in Deir ez-Zor Syria, US Central Command said in a statement. The strikes targeted "infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps," Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for CENTCOM, said in the statement. 
"At President Biden's direction, US military forces conducted precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor Syria today. These precision strikes are intended to defend and protect US forces from attacks like the ones on August 15 against US personnel by Iran-backed groups," he said, referring to last week's attacks on the Green Village base near the Iraqi border. The incident did not result in damage or injuries.

The government in Addis Ababa has said Tigrayan rebels launched an offensive after Tigrayan rebels said the opposite. One thing is clear, though: a months-old cease fire has ruptured, and fighting has resumed. 
Rebels in the Tigray region of Ethiopia accused the central government in Addis Ababa and militias aligned with them of launching what it termed a "large-scale offensive" Wednesday before the Ethiopian government turned around and accused Tigray of the very thing it had been accused of. 
The government in Addis Ababa did not immediately respond to the claims by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) but later said Tigrayan rebels had initiated an offensive.
