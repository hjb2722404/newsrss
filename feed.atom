CNBC: The U.S. Army is struggling to find the recruits its needs to win the fight over the future 
* The U.S. Army. fell short of its 2022 recruitment goal by 25%, and recently cut its projection for its total force for this year by 10,000. 
* U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said at the CNBC Work Summit on Wednesday that it’s become harder for the military to compete for recruits. 
* Like all large employees, a tight labor market is a factor, but the health issues of young Americans including obesity, and misperceptions about serving after 20 years of war, are big issues to overcome. 
The U.S. Army is spending more than ever before on technology to replace an aging military infrastructure, from artificial intelligence to new fighting machines moving 1980s tanks off the field of battle. 
But the Secretary of the U.S. Army says the nation risks falling behind in the race against China if it can’t recruit enough Americans into the service to be trained on how national defense is being remade for future conflicts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Europe now has so much natural gas that prices just dipped below zero  
London CNN Business  — Europe has more natural gas than it knows what to do with. So much, in fact, that spot prices briefly went negative earlier this week. 
For months, officials have warned of an energy crisis this winter as Russia — once the region’s biggest supplier of natural gas — slashed supplies in retaliation for sanctions Europe imposed over its invasion of Ukraine. 
Now, EU gas storage facilities are close to full, tankers carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) are lining up at ports, unable to unload their cargoes, and prices are tumbling. 
The price of benchmark European natural gas futures has dropped 20% since last Thursday, and by more than 70% since hitting a record high in late August. On Monday, Dutch gas spot prices for delivery within an hour — which reflect real time European market conditions — dipped below €0, according to data from the Intercontinental Exchange.

Update #2: Energy crisis: Europe's gas prices fall below €100 MWh for the first time since mid-June (Euronews)   
WNU Editor: No one expects this to last. Prices are still double from last year, and a cold winter is going to boost these prices to record highs.   I say enjoy the break in prices, and hope that this is going to be a warm winter.]]></summary>

A U.S. aircraft carrier is prepared to lead an international charge should Russia escalate attacks against Ukraine and its allies. 
The USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77), christened in 2006 and delivered to the Navy in 2009, is in the Adriatic Sea leading Neptune Strike 2022—a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) deployment that tests deterrence and defense in the Euro-Atlantic area. 
Allied and partner nations taking part include Albania, Canada, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.   
Read more ....   
Update: 'Ready for anything': US aircraft carrier crew training for war with Russia but aims to deter threats (SKY News)   
WNU Editor: Is Ukraine vital to America's strategic interests? Is it enough to justify the US going to war with Russia over this region? 
Sighhh .... so much has now been invested in this conflict by Western governments that I have to say yes. 
But are European and American citizens as committed as their governments to go to war? 
The polls say yes to providing aid .... Majority of Americans say U.S. should back Ukraine until Russia withdraws (Axios). But is there support for actually sending US forces to directly engage in war against Russia? To have an actual war with all the damage and destruction that it will cause on both sides? Maybe even resulting in a limited or massive nuclear exchange?

My gut says no. 
 Am I right?]]></summary>

With his experience from the <em>Napoleonic Wars</em> von Clausewitz knew that totalitarian regimes could end up conducting huge and ruthless military campaigns. Furthermore, he assumed that to win a war it is necessary to mobilize and indoctrinate the inhabitants of an entire nation. Such an endeavour is called <em>total war</em>, a term that actually can be applied to Putin’s war in Ukraine.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2022/10/26/32248">Read the full story, “War, Greed and Mass Manipulation”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

Olaf Scholz is abandoning Germany's most ambitious goal of becoming the military superpower. 
There should be no doubt that the Federal authorities of the West have a puppy love for the leaders in Kyiv. Germany has been the European Union’s most fervent proponent of Ukraine. Berlin provided Ukraine with 50 bunker-buster missiles, 21.8 million rounds for weapons, and 53,000 rounds for self-propelled anti-aircraft guns. 
However, the Bundeswehr (German Military) has suffered dramatically due to this blind love. Business Insider previously reported that Germany only has two days’ worth of ammo, much less than the NATO minimum or even the standard for a small militia.

Space News: China’s spaceplane raises orbit and national funding 
HELSINKI — A spaceplane launched by China in August has performed an orbit-raising maneuver and recently secured new funding to promote new modes of transportation. 
The “reusable experiment spacecraft” launched from Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert atop of a Long March 2F rocket Aug. 4. 
It has spent most of its 82 days in an orbit similar to the 346 by 593-kilometer orbit inclined by 50 degrees initially tracked by the U.S. Space Force’s 18th Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS). 
Robert Christy of Orbital Focus noted a change in the orbit occurred Oct. 23, with the spacecraft raising its perigee to shift to a near-circular 597 by 608-kilometer orbit.

New Politburo Standing Committee members, led by Xi Jinping, arrive to meet the media following the 20th National Congress of the CCP in Beijing, China October 23, 2022 [Tingshu Wang/ Reuters] 
Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: Meet The 7 Men Who Will Rule China 
Led by Xi Jinping, the seven men strode on the red carpet at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 23, revealing the new generation of China’s ruling elites. 
These powerful officials are members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) top decision-making body. 
Current leader Xi heads the committee again after closed-door meetings at which roughly 370 hand-picked Party representatives rubber-stamped the committee’s members. 
The lineup at the conclusion of the 20th Party Congress demonstrates Xi’s further consolidation of power, with all four newly appointed members being his protégés and allies. 
The following are the members who will run the Party for the next five years.

Daily Mail: New York and New England start RATIONING heating oil before winter as stockpiles slump by 70% and fears rise that families will be left in the cold

Heating oil suppliers in the Northeast and New England have begun rationing the key fuel ahead of winter, after stockpiles dropped to a third of their normal levels. 
Concerns are rising that supply shortages and soaring prices will leave families in the cold this winter, particularly in New England, which is more reliant on heating oil than other parts of the country. 
Chris Herb, president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, told Bloomberg recently that heating oil wholesalers are beginning to limit allocations for retail suppliers.

Reuters: Poland Mulls Barrier on Kaliningrad Border, Says Top Official 
WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland may have to build a barrier on its border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, a top Polish official said on Tuesday, as Warsaw suspects Russia plans to help African and Asian migrants cross over in the coming week. 
Poland accuses Russia and its ally Belarus of using migrants as part of a "hybrid warfare" campaign to destabilise Europe. 
With tensions running high due to the war in Ukraine, Poland fears a repeat of the 2021 crisis when thousands of African and Middle-Eastern migrants tried to cross the Belarus border.

The Fetterman campaign may have just watched what remained of its prospects in Pennsylvania circle the drain after tonight's sole debate between him and PA Senate candidate Dr. Oz. 
Fetterman, who suffered a severe stroke days before the May primary and cast his vote from a hospital bed, appeared unable to put together nearly a single coherent sentence throughout the entire debate while TV veteran Dr. Oz deftly and "surgically" sliced and diced his way through an hour of questioning, using Fetterman as a lifeless sparring dummy for a majority of the debate. 
Recovering from his stroke, Fetterman's answers ranged between somewhat inept and completely incomprehensible. The ugly performance started right from the beginning, with Fetterman bidding viewers "good night" as part of his opening statement.

WNU Editor: The New York Times said this was the must watch debate of this election season. 

Wrong call.
I feel sorry for Senate candidate John Fetterman. There were times that John Fetterman did not understand what was happening. He clearly has not recovered from his stroke. He also reminds me of my father after he had a stroke. Sighhh .... this was a hard debate to watch. My money is now on the Republicans winning the U.S. Senate. And to think $250 million has already been spent on this Senate campaign]]></summary>

Warzone/The Drive: Ex-Marine Corps Harrier Pilot Who Worked In China Has Been Arrested 
The arrest comes shortly after the revelation that retired Western fighter pilots were working directly with China’s air arms in concerning ways. 
Former U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier II attack jet pilot who had been working in China has been arrested in Australia. Daniel Edmund Duggan, 54, now likely faces extradition to the United States. It is an interesting development to occur in an ongoing crackdown on ex-military pilots from Western nations working in China, or on behalf of Chinese clients elsewhere. Namely, last week’s revelations that “at least 30” British former military pilots have been hired by China to provide training and intelligence to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). 
Duggan was arrested last Friday in Orange, New South Wales, by Australian Federal Police. He appeared in court there the same day, according to court records, two police sources, and his lawyer, Reuters reports. A request for bail was reportedly denied, leaving Duggan in jail in nearby Bathurst.
