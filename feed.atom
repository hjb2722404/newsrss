        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time: Biden Cast Doubt on Gaza’s Death Toll. Palestinian Officials Responded With 6,747 Names 
In the past three weeks, more than 1,400 people in Israel and 7,000 Palestinians have been killed amid fighting between Israel and Hamas. That is, if you believe the casualty figures coming out of the region. This week, U.S. President Joe Biden suggested that the Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which has been under heavy bombardment by Israel following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre, is not to be trusted. 
“I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging a war,” Biden said at a press conference on Wednesday. “But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.” The President didn’t offer further evidence for his skepticism of the Palestinian health ministry's data, which the U.S. State Department has cited both internally and publicly, in the latter case as recently as March. (When asked to provide evidence to support Biden's statement, the White House referred TIME to comments made by U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, who on Thursday reiterated the President’s assertion that the death toll cannot be taken “at face value” because the “Gaza Ministry of Health is just a front for Hamas.”)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Israel’s looming ground offensive against Hamas, and considering the population density of Gaza, urban warfare will certainly be a significant component of the conflict. Urban warfare in Gaza will not be a deft war of maneuver, but rather a slow, methodical grind of attrition. The Israel Defense Forces’ relatively small size in relation to the population density and urban sprawl of Gaza will strip away many of the Israeli military’s inherent asymmetries. Moreover, two additional factors will increase the voracity of urban warfare. First, due to Gaza’s small size, there is almost no land available to fight a war

Zero Hedge: Tucker Carlson Blasts Zelensky's Orwellian War On Orthodox Christianity & West's Deafening Silence 
A proposed new Ukrainian law which will ban the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for merely maintaining communion and ties to the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow is poised to go into effect. This after its churches and monasteries have already in some instances been subject to brutal raids by police or else ultra-nationalist thugs, which has been met with international silence despite the egregious violation of religions freedom. Bishops have been hauled before courts, priests have been thrown in jail, monks and nuns have been thrown onto the street.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An IDF spokesperson has claimed Israeli troops plan to “dismantle totally” all of Hamas’ military infrastructure in Gaza. 

Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told Sky News Australia the country was involved in a war it “did not start”. 

“It started by Hamas crossing into our communities and butchering more than one thousand of our civilians," he said.  

“In response to that we are going to dismantle, totally, all of the military infrastructure in Gaza which facilitated this attack and we are going to dismantle Hamas from ever being capable of doing it again.” 

The Lieutenant’s comments follow a targeted ground raid by Israel’s military in northern Gaza on Thursday.

Politico: The EU prepares for war — and this French ship is the tip of the spear 
France’s powerful amphibious helicopter carrier is a floating village with gyms and a boulangerie … plus missiles, machine guns, landing craft, choppers and tanks. 
ABOARD THE FRENCH HELICOPTER CARRIER TONNERRE — John Denver’s "Country Roads," a folk song from 1971, resounds through the Tonnerre. 
It’s 7:30 a.m., and some of the crew aboard the Mistral-class amphibious helicopter carrier are already eating breakfast — loading up on coffee, bread and jam ahead of a planned exercise to storm a Spanish beach. It's been a short night, and plans for the landing have changed several times. 
The French assault vessel — 199 meters long, 32 meters wide and able to carry 21,500 metric tons — is a key element in the European Union’s first live military exercise in October off the southern coast of Spain.

The footage gives insight into the claustrophobic conditions the Palestinian Islamist fighters have been operating in.

Many of them appear to be quite cramped and dark with footage showing the fighters slightly slouching as they move through the tunnels guided by headtorches.

New Delhi said in a statement that it attaches “high importance to this case” and will “take up the verdict with Qatari authorities.” 
Local media has reported that the eight men, who worked with a private company in Qatar, were arrested for spying in August 2022, but Reuters could not independently confirm the charges.

State Department — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Washington Thursday for meetings with senior U.S. officials on bilateral and regional security issues as the two countries aim to maintain open communication channels. 
 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is hosting Wang at the State Department for a working dinner after meetings in the late afternoon. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan is holding talks with him at Blair House, near the White House, Friday.

Update #1: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Washington for high-level meetings -- Washington Post 
Update #2: As world roils, US and China seek to ease strained ties and prepare for possible Biden-Xi summit -- AP 
WNU Editor: US President Biden will be talking with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi tomorrow .... Exclusive: Biden set to speak with China's top diplomat Wang Yi on Friday, sources say (Reuters). The Chinese are hoping this will pave the way to higher level talks .... Wang’s trip to US ‘crucial’, to pave the way for higher-level of interactions (Global Times).
As to what is my take .... I am skeptical. 
There is little common ground between the two governments. They differ on Taiwan, trade, the Israel - Hamas war, the Russia - Ukraine war, the South China Sea, and more importantly, they do not trust each other. Sighhh ..... but talking is better than not talking.]]></summary>

Slovakia's new populist Prime Minister Robert Fico said Thursday that his government was stopping military aid to Ukraine, in the first Western reversal of the kind. 
 Fico told MPs that the country would "no longer supply weapons to Ukraine", repeating promises made during his election campaign, but would still supply humanitarian aid to its war-torn neighbour. 
"I will support zero military aid to Ukraine... An immediate halt to military operations is the best solution we have for Ukraine. The EU should change from an arms supplier to a peacemaker," he added. 
Russia immediately dismissed the impact Slovakia's decision to halt military aid to Ukraine would have on the 20-month-old conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CBS News: Israeli forces raid Gaza as airstrikes drive up civilian death toll before expected invasion

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released video of the raid showing a bulldozer leveling a raised bank amid explosions and tank fire in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The timing of a long expected full-scale Israeli ground invasion remained unclear Thursday, but the consequences of Israel's relentless airstrikes, which started immediately after Hamas' brutal terror attack on Israel, have already been catastrophic for the 2.3 million people trapped inside Gaza.

“This is war. It is combat. It is bloody, ugly and it’s going to be messy and innocent civilians are going to be hurt going forward,” Kirby said when asked if the US thought Israel’s bombardment was a disproportionate response to the Hamas attack on southern Israel. 
“I wish I could tell you something different and wish that there wasn’t going to happen, but it is going to happen. And that doesn’t make it right, doesn’t make it dismissible,” Kirby added.

ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, in his strongest comments yet on the Gaza conflict, said on Wednesday the Palestinian militant group Hamas was not a terrorist organisation but a liberation group fighting to protect Palestinian lands. 
NATO member Turkey condemned the civilian deaths caused by Hamas's Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel, but also urged Israeli forces to act with restraint in their response. Ankara has strongly criticised Israel's bombardment of Gaza. 
"Hamas is not a terrorist organisation, it is a liberation group, 'mujahideen' waging a battle to protect its lands and people," he told lawmakers from his ruling AK Party, using an Arabic word denoting those who fight for their faith.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BulgarianMilitary.com: 155 mm shells price is growing – $8.6 million for 1,000 units 
The head of the NATO military committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, announced the current prices of conventional artillery 155-mm ammunition, which can really just shock. Because according to him, now their price is 8000 thousand euros for one piece of ammunition. 
This “price” is much higher than the current estimates, which were formed based on the Rheinmetall contract for last year, according to which one 155-mm projectile costs 3.3 thousand euros. 
The reasons for such a gallop in the price from 2 thousand euros at the level of 2021 to four times are quite clear: the need for a huge amount of artillery ammunition against the background of their relatively small current production. That is a deficit.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was not concerned by China increasing the capabilities of its nuclear arsenal, stressing Moscow's "advanced strategic partnership" with Beijing and China's sovereign right to ensure its own security. 
China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines, according to the Pentagon's latest report on China's military, giving it land and sea attack options that were once the sole province of U.S. and Russian vessels.

France 24: Putin oversees Russian rehearsal of 'massive retaliatory nuclear strike'

 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday oversaw ballistic missile drills remotely, the Kremlin said, hours after Russia moved to revoke its ratification of a landmark nuclear test ban treaty.   
Moscow's defence minister Sergei Shoigu also said Russia's forces would also be practising a "massive" retaliatory nuclear strike. 
The drills came 20 months into Moscow's Ukraine offensive -- which has raised some fears of nuclear war -- and hours after Russia moved to revoke a key nuclear arms control treaty. 
"Under the leadership of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armed forces, Vladimir Putin, a training exercise was conducted with the forces and equipment of ground, sea and air components of nuclear deterrent forces," the Kremlin said in a statement.

This is a region that has experienced far too much violence over the years.  Hamas’ desperate attacks on innocent civilians was intended to provoke an Israeli overreaction that would, among other things, jeopardise Israeli diplomatic negotiations with the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia and create generalised anxiety within Israel. It was also aimed at demonstrating Hamas’ military capacity and vengeance for years of a humiliating blockade of Gaza. Kidnapping Israeli civilians was callous and brutal but part of a plan to use hostages as bargaining chips around the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/25/35142">Read the full story, “The Hamas-Israel Conflict”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

Israel has reacted angrily to comments made by the UN secretary general about the Gaza war at the Security Council.

António Guterres said on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that it was important to recognise they "did not happen in a vacuum". 
Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan accused him of "justifying terrorism" and demanded his immediate resignation.

On Wednesday, Mr Guterres rejected "misrepresentations" of his statement. 
"I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council as if, as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas," he said. "This is false. It was the opposite."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a press conference in Israel on Monday, Cohen noted that he was both an American and Israeli citizen. And he thanked Graham for supporting Israel. Graham is in Israel as part of a bipartisan US Senate delegation.

	"But it starts at home," Cohen said. "And I'd like to ask any Democrat senator here that would like to speak to Rashida Tlaib. She still has a tweet up condemning Israel for a hospital attack."
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

	"We are here together, not to talk about the problems at home, which are many," Graham shot back.


	"You're not going to screw this up!" Graham shouted.


	"Get this guy out of here!" Graham exclaimed.


	"I'm an American," Graham said, pounding on the podium.

	"And I believe in free speech," Graham continued. "I don't believe what the squad has to say at all. But I came here with Democrats and Republicans to let everybody in the world know."


	Graham later apologized after his temper cooled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is pushing for a major American foreign policy change in his second administration that would likely upend decades of global national security infrastructure.
Sources tell Rolling Stone that Trump is planning to pull the United States entirely out of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance unless it caves to his demands that include one that would seem to undermine the entire purpose of the alliance.
In addition to his standard calls for other NATO countries to chip in more for their defense spending, Trump also reportedly wants to rip up the strategic doctrine that an attack on one NATO country represents an attack on all NATO countries.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"When he was in office, Trump would repeatedly scoff at this collective-defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, known as Article 5," the publication writes. "One former senior administration official recalls to Rolling Stone a moment in the Oval Office in mid-2018 when the then-president started reading from a written list of smaller NATO countries, some of which he argued most Americans had never even heard of before."
Tearing up Article 5 would be a major boon for the likes of Russia, which attacked non-NATO member Ukraine in 2022 but notably has not attacked other NATO members on its border such as Estonia and Latvia.
Dr. Aaron Stein, a Black Sea Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, tells Rolling Stone that Trump's plan would be a "tremendously stupid endeavor" and added that "trading away allies based on ignorance, and Trump is ignorant about this issue, is just silly for broader U.S. national security."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States warned Iran or its allies against any "escalation" in the wake of Israel's war with Hamas, two top US officials said Sunday, hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region.
With tensions mounting, Washington also announced Sunday it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq.
"We are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks against our own personnel, our own people," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS News. "We expect there is a likelihood of escalation."
"No one should take advantage of this moment to escalate to further attacks on Israel or, for that matter, attacks on us on our personnel."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The organiser of the Web Summit, one of the tech sector's leading events, announced his resignation Saturday following a backlash over his online posts following the Hamas attacks on Israel.
"Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event," Paddy Cosgrave of Ireland explained in a brief statement sent to AFP.
"I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused," added the co-founder of the tech mega gathering created in 2009 in Dublin but held in Lisbon since 2016.
A spokesperson for the organization said: "Web Summit will appoint a new CEO as soon as possible, and Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon will go ahead as planned."
This year's edition from November 13 to 16, is set to bring together some 2,300 startups and more than 70,000 participants, say organizers.
Several companies, including tech giants Google and Meta, which is behind Facebook and Instagram, as well as event headliners have announced they are boycotting the gathering since Cosgrave's remarks.
He had written on X, formerly Twitter, that he was "shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments" in support of Israel.
"War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are," he wrote on October 13.
Since shock Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, which left 1,400 dead, Israel has launched devastating air and ground bombardments of Gaza. The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.
The boycott by Meta and Google followed other exits by companies and tech figures, including Intel, Siemens and US comedian Amy Poehler and X-Files actor Gillian Anderson.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A first anniversary in office is normally a moment for a leader to celebrate, but Britain's Rishi Sunak hits the milestone this week with a mountain to climb to retain power in a general election expected next year.

Two by-election losses to the main opposition Labour Party on Thursday underscored how Sunak, 43, has failed to revive the Conservatives' beleaguered fortunes during his first 12 months in charge.
"The more people see of Sunak, the less they like him in some ways," Tim Bale, author of a book about the right-wing Conservatives since Brexit, told AFP.
"He doesn't really project authority, he doesn't necessarily give the impression that he's in control of events.
"He looks, in part, as if he's sort of lurching from one policy initiative to another in a desperate attempt to curry …]]></summary>

Simmering racial divisions were exposed earlier this month when just over 60 percent of Australians voted against a referendum to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders within the 1901 constitution.
In the wake of the result, many Indigenous leaders embarked on a "week of silence", asking for time to grieve what they saw as a crushing rejection at the hands of Australia's white majority.
Some leaders ended that silence in a scathing open letter addressed to the government, criticizing the "appalling and mean-spirited" outlook of milli…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A teenage Iranian girl, who fell into a coma earlier this month following an alleged encounter with officers over violating the country’s hijab law, is said to be "brain dead", Iranian state media reported on Sunday.
"Follow-ups on the latest health condition of Armita Geravand indicate that her health condition as brain dead seems certain despite the efforts of the medical staff," the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said.
Iranian authorities have denied claims by rights groups that the 16-year-old was hurt after a confrontation on Oct. 1 with officers enforcing the mandatory Islamic dress code in the Tehran metro.

The report on Geravand could revive nationwide protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini last year in the custody of morality police.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Norma slammed into Mexico's northwestern coast Saturday afternoon as a Category 1 storm, bringing dangerous rain and flooding, authorities said.
The storm came ashore about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of the resort city of Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California coast, gradually weakening from a Category 3 as it approached land.
Norma was moving northeast at 9 kph, packing winds of up to 130 kph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported at 2100 GMT. 
Norma was expected to bring rainfall of up to 45 centimeters (18 inches), producing "flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain," the NHC said.
"Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions" would affect the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for the next couple of days.
Hotel employees in Cabo San Lucas urged guests to stay indoors until authorities give the all-clear, Gustavo Matamoros, a hotel worker, told AFP.
Local authorities say about 60,000 tourists are staying in the area, most of them international visitors.
Footage from Milenio TV showed flooded streets as Norma arrived. No casualties have been reported by authorities.
Norma should continue to weaken to a tropical storm as it moves toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday.
Two people died last week when Hurricane Lidia struck the western states of Jalisco and Nayarit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A secret recording revealed by "60 Minutes Australia" exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. 
Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a "favor" for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do," admitting not only to the bribery but also that it's frequent behavior for him. 

"It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings," The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration's decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	"And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that's beyond the pale, isn't it?" the ABC host asked.


	"There's no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost," Scott opined.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
