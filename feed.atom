The volumes of natural gas that Turkey has found so far in the Black Sea are worth in excess of $500 billion, Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Dönmez told broadcaster CNN Türk. 
The huge gas finds would be enough to supply all households in the country for 35 years, or to cover total Turkish natural gas consumption, including from industry, for 15 to 20 years, the minister added. 
Last week, Turkish Petroleum (TPAO) said on Twitter that the installation of the pipes connecting the energy base in the Black Sea to the Sakarya Gas Field Land Facility had been successfully completed. The company said the inauguration of the start of the gas transmission from the field is expected to take place on April 20 in the presence of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Washington Post: Russia moves to tighten conscription law, pressing more men to fight 
RIGA, Latvia — When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a mobilization in the fall to commandeer reinforcements for the war against Ukraine, thousands of men fled the country or went into hiding. But tough new measures approved by Russia’s lower house of parliament on Tuesday will make it almost impossible for Russians to dodge conscription in the future. 
The law provides for electronic military summonses with bans on draftees leaving the country, making it possible to quietly sweep up thousands more men to fight — even as the Kremlin is denying plans for a controversial new mobilization. 
The State Duma, which is the lower chamber, approved the legislation with just one abstention. The upper house, the Federation Council, is expected to adopt it Wednesday, and send it on to Putin for his approval, which is widely expected.

Armed Forces Press: U.S. General: Russia Jamming American GPS Satellite Signals Used By Ukraine 
According to a top general in the U.S. Space Force, Russia has taken to using space weapons in its war against Ukraine. Russian forces have been jamming GPS signals from American satellites that are used by Ukrainian troops. 
Despite jamming signals from the satellites, Moscow has not yet attempted to destroy any of them, and one expert believes it's because Russia's space capabilities are not yet completely developed and would not survive a conflict with a major world power. 
Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, Chief of Space Operations for the U.S. Space Force, has confirmed that Russia has Earth-based lasers capable of attacking satellites along with electronic jamming equipment and anti-satellite missiles. 
"They have shown no qualms about testing these systems," Saltzman said on April 5 during a forum on space defense that was held by the Mitchell Institute of Aerospace Studies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The atmosphere was tense as residents confronted Amsterdam's mayor on a controversial plan to move legal prostitution from the city's historic red light district to a suburban "erotic center".
In a meeting hall in the south of the city, hundreds of angry locals who don't want a "mega brothel" on their doorstep found themselves unexpectedly on the same side as sex workers who want to stay in their red neon booths.
In the middle of the row is Amsterdam mayor Femke Halsema, who is sticking to a plan that few people seem to like despite being branded a "brothel madame" by opponents.
"It's not possible," one mother said in tears at the meeting in the south of Amsterdam, near one of three sites that Halsema has proposed for the 100-room erotic center.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patriotic badges showing Winnie the Pooh being punched in the face by a Taiwanese black bear -- a humorous dig at China's leader Xi Jinping -- have gone viral across the self-ruled island.
The iron-on patches being worn by some of Taiwan's air force pilots are a defiant message to Xi, who is often satirized for looking like the honey-loving cartoon bear.
Chen Kai-chu, another fan, said: "Wear this to go through Chinese customs."
China, which claims the island as part of its territory, launched three days of massive war games on Saturday that involved simulating attacks on democratic Taiwan.
The show of force from Beijing was a response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week.
Taiwan's defense ministry released a series of images and videos …]]></summary>

The Shiveluch volcano erupted just after midnight reaching a crescendo about six hours later, spewing out an ash cloud over an area of 108,000 square kilometres (41,699 square miles), according to the Kamchatka Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Geophysical Survey.
Lava flows tumbled from the volcano, melting snow and prompting a warning of mud flows along a nearby highway while villages were carpeted in drifts of grey ash as deep as 8.5 centimetres, the deepest in 60 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuba's government on Monday announced a surprise lifting of its ban on US dollar deposits in banks, reversing a policy which had been in place across the communist island nation since June 2021.
"From this moment on, financial and banking institutions will accept cash deposits of US dollars in bank accounts," said a Central Bank of Cuba (BCC) resolution published Monday in the country's Official Gazette.
The Cuban government had announced the ban almost two years ago, saying at the time that the move was due to continuing difficulties caused by the ongoing US embargo.
The policy reversal comes as the island faces its worst economic crisis in three decades, with mounting shortages of food, medicines and fuel worsening in recent weeks.
However it is also seeing its vital tourism industry pick up following a collapse during the pandemic, which the government cited as one of the reasons for the move on Monday.
Cuba has been subject to broad US sanctions since 1962, hindering its government's ability to transact in dollars.
After a relative easing under the presidency of Barack Obama, sanctions were ramped up during Donald Trump's tenure in the White House. During his administration's final days in office in January 2021, the United States added Cuba back to its list of state sponsors of terrorism.
That designation occurred the same month that Cuba's government moved to end its parallel currencies, phasing out a convertible peso that was pegged to the dollar, leaving only the regular, weaker peso, or CUP.
Since then, the currency has fallen from 24 to an official rate of 120 to the dollar. On the black market, the rate is 185.
Trump's successor Joe Biden has kept up the prior administration's restrictions on Cuba, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken in March said the United States had no plans to lift the state sponsor of terrorism designation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Investigations of leaked Pentagon documents take shape as DOJ probes source of leak  
Washington CNN  — The US government investigations into a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents are starting to take shape, with the Pentagon examining how the leak impacts US national security and the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into who may have been behind the breach. 
The interagency probe is being led by the Pentagon’s Office of Intelligence and Security, according to three US officials, and could take months to complete. It will chiefly examine whether any sources and methods have been compromised since the documents, many of which are marked Top Secret, were posted on a social media platform earlier this year. 
Milancy Harris, the deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, will be in charge of the effort on the Pentagon side, officials said. The investigation will also try to determine the scope of the leak, since officials do not yet know whether it has been contained or whether there are more classified documents still circulating online.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity in the United States has reached its highest point since 2020, years before his troops invaded Ukraine, according to new data. 
The Kremlin leader's popularity among Americans, as of the first quarter of 2023, stands at 21 percent, according to pollster YouGov. In the first quarter of 2021, Putin's popularity hovered at 15 percent, and shortly after Russia began the war with Ukraine, it was registered at 17 percent. 
Moscow's troops crossing into Ukraine in February 2022 was met with condemnation from Western countries, including the U.S. At the time, President Joe Biden said the Kremlin had "chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering."

Zero Hedge: 'No Business In The Public Domain': Kirby Warns Journalists Not To Report On Leaked Pentagon Documents 
Biden administration and National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed the media on Monday, asking in so many words that pretty please would journalists not report on the trove of highly classified documents which were leaked online. 
"This is information that has no business in the public domain... It has no business... on the front pages of newspapers or on television." But Kirby is a bit late, given already days ago major outlets from the NY Times to Washington Post to foreign outlets like The Guardian and RT have widely reported on them. They classified reports have circulated widely on English-language and foreign social media as well.

Washington Post: Macron's Taiwan comments anger allies, delight Beijing 
BRUSSELS — More people are mad at French President Emmanuel Macron. 
 After weeks of protests over an unpopular pension overhaul plan at home, the French president now faces outrage from allies abroad over his chummy trip to China and remarks on the need for Europe to stand apart from the United States on Taiwan and other issues. 
The visit and its aftermath have angered politicians and analysts on both sides of the Atlantic, highlighting gaps between the U.S. and French approach to China, showcasing division within the Eropean Union — and probably delighting Beijing. 
The interview in question took place during a three-day visit to China that raised eyebrows for its surprisingly upbeat tone, considering that Beijing has yet to condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Daily Mail: Major volcano eruption sends ash cloud 12 miles into the sky threatening aircraft and turning day to night in 'doomsday scenes' in eastern Russia 
* The Shiveluch volcano erupted just after midnight in the Kamchatka Peninsula 
* Lava flowed from the volcano, melting snow, and raising warnings of mud flows 
One of Russia's most active volcanoes has erupted, shooting a vast cloud of ash far up into the sky and smothering villages in drifts of grey volcanic dust.

The doomsday scene on Tuesday turned day to night as ash rose 12 miles (19 kilometres) above the Shiveluch volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula. 
The eruption took place just after midnight reaching a crescendo about six hours later, as a plume of ash sat above an area of 41,700 square miles (108,000 square kilometres) - an area larger than Scotland and Wales combined.

WNU Editor: This is a major event that is going to impact everyone. In the Northern hemisphere temperatures are going to drop significantly in the coming months, and may last 2 to 3 years. Expect a shorter growing season and lower crop yields. This of course will mean higher food and energy prices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Thick sandstorms will hit Beijing and several provinces through Wednesday, and Chinese forecasters have advised citizens of respiratory dangers and very low visibility while travelling, state media reported.
The capital Beijing has seen regular air pollution and an unseasonal number of sandstorms over the past few weeks.
Forecasters issued a blue weather alert warning for sandstorms. China has a four-tier, color-coded weather-warning system, with red representing the most severe warning and blue the least severe.
On Tuesday morning, smog and misty grey clouds could be seen enveloping Beijing and the city's real-time air quality index was at a serious pollution level, according to the website of the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.
The concentration of fine particulates in the air in Beijing is currently 46.2 times the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value, according to IQAir, a website that issues air quality data and information.
A dozen provinces, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Hubei, Inner Mongolia and metropolis Shanghai, will be affected by sandstorms and major dust until 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) Wednesday, the Central Meteorological Observatory said.
The sandstorms were again a hot dicussion topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, racking up 2.178 million chats.
One user wrote, "What! When I wake up, why doesn't anyone issue a holiday notice, do you still have to go to work in the dust today!"
Beijing has regular sandstorms in March and April as it is near the large Gobi desert.
A Chinese government official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recently said the number of sandstorms was now four times higher than in the 1960s, a consequence of rising temperatures and lower precipitation in the deserts of north China and neighbouring Mongolia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) -A possible intelligence leak by the United States was a "serious" incident, Angus Campbell, the chief of Australia's Defence Force, said on Tuesday, adding that the U.S. was engaging with its partners to understand the consequences.
Three U.S. officials have said national security agencies are reviewing how they share their most sensitive secrets inside the government and tackling the diplomatic fallout from the release of dozens of confidential documents.
"The issue of maintaining security of information is critical to the development of national capability and to the trust and confidence across allies and partners," Campbell said in response to questions after a speech at the Lowy Institute.
Asked if Australia had a role in any future conflict over Taiwan, Campbell said, "Anything that undermines the security, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region in which we live is of interest to Australia."
He added, "The question then might arise what particular circumstance or scenario enlivens what form of interest and in what form of response."
The war in Ukraine showed that there was no way to predict how any war would unfold, Campbell said.
"I encourage all parties to areas of international tension to find other ways to resolve that tension ... A stable secure free and open Indo-Pacific for all nations is in Australia's interest."

Republicans suggest everything from terrorist labels to an invasion to decimate drug cartels in Mexico. 
A growing number of prominent Republicans are rallying around the idea that to solve the fentanyl crisis, America must bomb it away.
In recent weeks, Donald Trump has discussed sending “special forces” and using “cyber warfare” to target cartel leaders if he’s reelected president and, per Rolling Stone, asked for “battle plans” to strike Mexico. Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) introduced a bill seeking authorization for the use of military force to “put us at war with the cartels.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said he is open to sending U.S. troops into Mexico to target drug lords even without that nation’s permission. And lawmakers in both chambers have filed legislation to label some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move supported by GOP presidential aspirants.

The Guardian: ‘They’re starting to die’: fears Ukraine’s drone supremacy may soon be over

 
Frontline drone operators say Russia is close to countering their most popular models – setting off a race to find replacements

Some are forced to lurk a few hundred metres from, or even on, the frontline. Without them, Ukraine’s efforts to hold on to the embattled city would be much harder, perhaps impossible. 
But the concern for Ukraine, according to three frontline drone operators deployed in the city over the winter, is that the Russians are close to countering the most popular models in operation, those made by the Chinese manufacturer DJI. “They’re adept and they are manufacturing these special jamming systems,” said Yaroslav, 31.

“I hope the comments don’t prove damaging, they do point to attitudes and approaches that at times are of concern in terms of not realising the challenges that are faced in relation to China’s efforts over a period of time to bend and push against the rules-based order in different ways,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.

“The establishment of military operations in the South China Sea, the of course, undermining of human rights in a number of areas … trade-based economic coercion in breach of WTO rules against Australia, these are all serious issues and an important point for any leader of a democratic nation to be mindful of is the need for us all to work together in defence of our values.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jerusalem Post: Iran kickstarts multi-front Middle East war against Israel - analysis 
The Islamic Republic's proxies and allies appear to have begun a multi-front conflict with Israel over the past week. 
A week of attacks on Israel, including rockets fired from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, represents the manifestation of an Iranian strategy to confront Israel with multiple threats on different fronts. Although different groups may be behind the attacks from those places, these groups are likely all linked to Iran. The groups involved include Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and others that may go by different or new names, but which are proxies of Tehran. 
Iran has long sought to bring its conflict with Israel to the Jewish state’s borders. Its backing of Hezbollah and Hamas was key to that strategy over the decades. For instance, Tehran supplies Hamas with financial support and also helped it develop longer-range rockets and a larger arsenal. Whereas Hamas rockets could once only travel a few kilometers, now they can reach most parts of Israel. 
The Islamic Republic also supported Islamic Jihad, which is even more of an Iranian proxy than Hamas. The group not only has an arsenal thought to include thousands of rockets, but it has gunmen in the West Bank and its leadership often resides in Damascus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) -A number of masked people attacked a police vehicle with petrol bombs and other objects at a parade opposing the Good Friday peace accord in Londonderry, police said on Monday, a day before U.S. President Joe Biden visits Belfast.
A Reuters photograph showed four young people in the mainly Irish nationalist area of Creggan throwing petrol bombs at an armoured police vehicle, which was covered in flames on one side.
The crowd dispersed shortly afterwards and police said nobody was injured.
Monday marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement that largely ended three decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland. There is still some sporadic violence by small groups opposed to peace.
Britain's MI5 intelligence agency late last month increased the threat level in Northern Ireland from domestic terrorism to severe - meaning an attack is highly likely.
It has been mostly at the second highest category since its introduction in 2010 and was raised after an off-duty police officer was left seriously injured following a gun attack by the new IRA, one of the small dissident militant groups.
Biden is due to arrive in Belfast on Tuesday and make an address at a Belfast university on Wednesday, before travelling to Ireland for a further three days.

NYPost: US troops in Taiwan 'on the table' if China invades, Michael McCaul says

W
ASHINGTON — House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul has said the US may send troops to Taiwan should China invade the self-governed island. 
“If communist China invaded Taiwan, it would certainly be on the table and something that would be discussed by Congress and with the American people,” the Texas Republican told Fox News. 
“Are they prepared to do this? Is Taiwan worth it? I can argue for a lot of reasons why it is.” 
The potential move would represent a stark contrast to the th
e war in Ukraine, where the US has sent billions in weaponry to Kyiv but has refused to send troops. 

“[To deploy troops,] you’re talking about an authorized use of military force that would come out of my committee or a declaration of war, which we haven’t utilized since World War II,” McCaul said during a three-day trip to Taipei at the head of a congressional delegation.

Update: Conflict with China 'last resort' but Congress will authorize troops if Americans support it: McCaul (FOX News).

 
WNU Editor: I do not see the American public supporting a policy to go to war against China to defend Taiwan. But I could be wrong.

 
Update #2: House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul is correct about this .... McCaul says China could influence, take over Taiwan in next election ‘without a shot fired’ (The Hill). Taiwan President Tsai’s party suffered losses in recent local elections (link here), and my gut tells me that many Taiwanese do not want to suffer the same fate as Ukraine. That diplomacy and accommodation with China are the preferred options. 

 
Update #3: The Chinese are sending a message to Washington .... China military ‘ready to fight’ after drills near Taiwan (AP).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis issued a renewed call for peace to mark the end of the Easter period on Monday.

Following the Regina Caeli (Queen of Heaven) chant on St Peter's Square in Rome, Francis prayed for "the gift of peace for the whole world."
Several thousand pilgrims gathered to celebrate the second Easter holiday with the 86-year-old head of the Roman Catholic Church.
The Regina Caeli replaces the Angelus normally said on a Sunday up to Pentecost Sunday, which falls this year on May 28.
Francis has made use of all the church's occasions this Easter to issue a call for peace at the climax of the Christian calendar.
Around 100,000 faithful were on hand on Easter Sunday to hear the traditional Urbi et Orbi address, when Francis urged peace in Ukraine, praying for both Ukrainians and Russians.]]></summary>

The U.S. State Department says it's "monitoring closely" a Chinese maritime operation in the Taiwan Strait this week that includes boarding and inspecting ships. 
Why it matters: Officials in Taipei believe the unprecedented action in the Taiwan Strait is in reprisal for their president's D.C. meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, arrive at a joint news conference in Beijing on Thursday. | AFP-JIJI

 
Politico:  Europe must resist pressure to become ‘America’s followers,’ says Macron 
 The ‘great risk’ Europe faces is getting ‘caught up in crises that are not ours,’ French president says in interview. 
ABOARD COTAM UNITÉ (FRANCE’S AIR FORCE ONE) — Europe must reduce its dependency on the United States and avoid getting dragged into a confrontation between China and the U.S. over Taiwan, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview on his plane back from a three-day state visit to China. 
Speaking with POLITICO and two French journalists after spending around six hours with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip, Macron emphasized his pet theory of “strategic autonomy” for Europe, presumably led by France, to become a “third superpower.” 
He said “the great risk” Europe faces is that it “gets caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy,” while flying from Beijing to Guangzhou, in southern China, aboard COTAM Unité, France’s Air Force One.

WNU Editor: French President Macron's trip to Beijing must have been an eye--opener for him to make such a remark. Not surprising. US politicians are reacting (see below).

Funny to see how American politicians are suddenly very concerned about Europe's course towards Ukraine.
Why would Europe trust a 'partner' who destroys NordStream to sell their expensive gas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Northern Ireland on Monday marks the 25th anniversary of its landmark 1998 peace accords, with the UK province mired in political dysfunction and security concerns which threaten to overshadow the historic milestone.
No large-scale public events are planned for the day itself, but British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden will arrive Tuesday to launch several days of high-profile commemorations.

Charles, 74, immediately became king when Queen Elizabeth II died last September after her record-breaking 70-year reign but will be formally crowned at a May 6 service inside London's Westminster Abbey.
The three-day weekend will also feature a star-studded concert, nationwide "big lunch" and volunteering initiatives, as well as the traditional royal processions associated with the coronation.
Unveiling a host of ceremonial details, Buckingham Palace said the new emoji created to mark the historic occasion is based on the 17th-century St Edward's Crown.

In October, Lee Jong-chul's 24-year-old son was among more than 150 people killed in the disaster in the city's popular Itaewon district. Grief-stricken, he spoke to media, pleading with South Korean politicians to take action.
Then, as has happened after incidents from the Sandy Hook mass shooting to the disappearance of British woman Nicola Bulley, an internet mob formed: Lee and his family's personal tragedy was mocked, belittled and misrepresented online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report from Politico suggests that Republicans are increasingly embracing what was once a fringe idea floated by former President Donald Trump: That America should bomb Mexico in the name of battling drug cartels.
Although it was once considered unthinkable to conduct a military invasion of the United States' neighbor to the south, Politico documents how launching attacks against the country is becoming mainstream within the GOP.
"Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and Mike Waltz (R-FL) introduced a bill seeking authorization for the use of military force to 'put us at war with the cartels,'" the report states. "Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said he is open to sending U.S. troops into Mexico to target drug lords even without that nation’s permission. And lawmakers in both chambers have filed legislation to label some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move supported by GOP presidential aspirants."
Although some traditionally hawkish Republicans, including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) have expressed skepticism that bombing Mexico would be an effective strategy for stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States, the idea is nonetheless gaining traction.

Even so, some foreign policy experts warn Politico that a war in Mexico has the potential to be a complete foreign policy disaster for the United States.
"If you thought Iraq was a bad situation, wait until you invade a country on our border,” a House Republican congressional aide told the publication. “Our grandchildren will be dealing with this.”]]></summary>

Like the U.S. military, the PLA is working on wearable sensors and other ways to hone and maintain troops' fighting spirit. 
China’s military is increasingly at work on wearable technology and a dedicated psychological support system to win at what it views as the crucial space of cognitive warfare—manipulating enemy troops’ state of mind to shape their behavior and hardening its own forces against such efforts. 
“In future cognitive domain operations, the influence of rational factors such as science and logic on individual cognition is likely to be weakened, and cognitive confrontation may become a contest of emotions,” says one recent article in PLA Daily. 
“The rapid development of intelligent technology is changing the logic of information dissemination in an all-round way, making the impact of information on thinking and consciousness more profound and comprehensive, and human brain cognition has truly risen to an important field of military confrontation.”

China has finished three days of military drills around Taiwan, which included "sealing off" the island and simulating targeted strikes. 
Taiwan said it had detected jets to its east, while China said its Shandong aircraft carrier had taken part. 
Beijing began the exercises on Saturday after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met the US House Speaker in California. 
After the drills ended, Taiwan's defence ministry said it would not stop strengthening its combat preparedness. 
The drills have not been as big as those that followed Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taipei last August.

BBC: China simulates hitting 'key targets' on Taiwan 
China has simulated precision strikes against key targets on Taiwan and its surrounding waters during a second day of military drills. 
The drills - which Beijing has called a "stern warning" to the self-governing island - are a response to Taiwan's president visiting the US last week. 
As the Chinese military simulated an encirclement of the island, the US urged China to show restraint.

Taiwan said about 70 Chinese aircraft flew around the island on Sunday. 
Eleven Chinese ships were also spotted.

On Saturday, Taiwan said that 45 warplanes either crossed the Taiwan Strait median line - the unofficial dividing line between Taiwanese and Chinese territory - or flew into the south-western part of Taiwan's air defence identification zone. 
The operation, dubbed "Joint Sword" by Beijing, will continue until Monday. Taiwanese officials have been enraged by the operation.

“There were always sort of murmurings within the media that the relationship between the Sussexes and the Cambridges had really broken down at the time,” said writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue. 

“Clearly that relationship had broken down quite significantly already and obviously the walkabout was not her idea, it was her husband Prince William’s idea so she had to go along with it because it was seen as extending an olive branch,” Ms Krakue told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.

“But I can imagine it’s quite difficult for someone to play nice publicly with people that have had no qualms in slating you and defaming your character in the way that they have done.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fox News said on Sunday it has reached a settlement with a Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil, ending a defamation case in which Khalil said he was falsely accused on air of helping to rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election against Donald Trump.
Khalil had filed a defamation suit against the news outlet and former host Lou Dobbs, arguing in filings that they had fabricated claims he and other Venezuelans were involved in "orchestrating a non-existent scheme to rig or fix the election" against the former Republican president.
A short letter sent to U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan on Saturday said the parties had reached a "confidential agreement to resolve this matter" and expected to file a joint stipulation of dismissal next week.
"This matter has been resolved amicably by both sides. We have no further comment," Fox News said in a statement on Sunday.
Lawyers for Fox News and Dobbs referred Reuters to the statement. Khalil's lawyer did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Trump has continued to repeat debunked claims of widespread voting fraud as reason for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election even after they have been roundly rejected by courts, state governments and members of his own former administration.
Jury selection is set to begin on Thursday ahead of a separate trial in Dominion Voting Systems Corp's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corp over their coverage of debunked election-rigging claims.

Saudi and Omani delegations have held talks with Houthi officials in the Yemeni capital Sanaa as part of international efforts to find a settlement to Yemen’s nine-year conflict, Houthi-run media reported. 
The visit indicates progress in the Oman-mediated consultations between Riyadh and Sanaa, which run parallel to United Nations peace efforts. 
Negotiations also gained momentum since archrivals Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to re-establish ties in a deal brokered by China.

NYPost: Russian fighter jet nearly shot down British spy plane, according to leaked US military documents 
A Russian fighter jet nearly shot down an unarmed British reconnaissance plane over the Black Sea in September — a confrontation described in leaked US military documents as more significant than previously known, according to a report Sunday. 
UK Defense Minister Ben Wallace told the British House of Commons in October that one of the two Russian Su-27 fighters that intercepted the RC-135 surveillance plane off the coast of Crimea “released a missile” at a distance, according to the Washington Post. 
He attributed it to a “technical malfunction,” and said he’d spoken to his Russian counterparts about the incident.

But the mid-air scuffle appears to have been more serious than that, according to one of the leaked documents circulating online, the Washington Post reported. 
That document referred to the incident as a “near-shoot down of UK RJ,” which is a reference to a commonly-used nickname for the British spy plane, the report said.

Defense One: NATO Plans Record Air Exercise as Finland Joins Alliance

 
Air Defender 2023 exercise will include 100 U.S. aircraft, 2,000 troops, in “largest transatlantic movement” the Air National Guard has ever done. 
As NATO brings Finland into the fold, the U.S. and Germany are preparing for the largest deployment of U.S. air forces to Europe since the formation of the U.S.-led security alliance. 
The upcoming exercise, Air Defender 2023, will test the Air National Guard’s “ability to rapidly deploy and rapidly employ [forces],” similar to what the United States would have to do if the Ukraine war spreads to NATO, said Lt. Gen. Michael Loh, director of the Air National Guard. “It is the largest transatlantic movement we've done.” 
The Air National Guard, which maintains units for “prompt mobilization during war” in addition to its role in homeland defense, will send about 100 aircraft to Germany for the 10-day exercise in June, Loh said during a press conference Tuesday. The exercise will include aircraft the U.S. is about to retire, such as A-10s and F-15Cs, as well as new aircraft, such as F-35s, upgraded F-16s, and KC-46s, Loh said.

Politico: Biden’s informal review of Saudi Arabia 
The Biden administration just can’t quit Saudi Arabia.

After Riyadh-led OPEC+ cut oil production last year, a move that would bulge Russia’s wallet, the administration promised to reevaluate the state of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. 
President JOE BIDEN even threatened “consequences” for the kingdom, a signal that the decadeslong cozy relationship was poised for a downgrade. 
Many months later, there haven’t been any consequences or shifts. CIA Director WILLIAM BURNS even made an unannounced visit to Saudi this week to reaffirm close intelligence ties between Washington and Riyadh. 
The reason is that the administration never actually conducted a formal review, per multiple U.S. officials NatSec Daily spoke to. There were numerous inter-agency discussions and sensitive diplomatic conversations during the course of the normal policy making process. But there was neither a determined start to the reevaluation, nor will there be an end. It’s an ongoing, amorphous conversation.

Israeli jets hit Syrian military targets on Sunday in response to rockets launched towards Israeli controlled territory overnight, Israel’s military said, as violence flared again following cross-border exchanges of fire during the week. 
State media in Syria reported explosions in the vicinity of the capital Damascus as Israel said its forces continued to hit Syrian territory after six rockets were fired overnight towards the Golan Heights. 
Israel said artillery and drone strikes hit the rocket launchers and were followed by airstrikes against a Syrian army compound, military radar systems and artillery posts.

US show of force comes as Pentagon extends aircraft carrier deployment following last month's lethal attack by Iran-backed militias on US personnel in Syria. 
The US Navy deployed a nuclear-powered submarine capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Middle East waters via the Suez Canal, a spokesperson revealed Saturday. 
The Pentagon's rare disclosure of the location of one of its Ohio-class submarines came amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran after an American military contractor was killed by a drone attack on a US base in Syria last month. 
The USS Florida arrived in the region before transiting the canal on Friday "to help ensure regional maritime security and stability," Cdr. Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for the US Navy's 5th Fleet, told Al-Monitor via email.

Middle East Eye: US leaked documents allege Mossad urged protests against Netanyahu's reforms

 
Israel vehemently denies reports which suggest that Washington spied on its ally 
Leaked US intelligence documents allege that the Israeli spy body Mossad secretly encouraged people to join protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed judicial overhaul. 
The documents, dating back to "early to mid-February", state that Mossad's leadership had "advocated for Mossad officials and Israeli citizens to protest the new Israeli government's proposed judicial reforms including several explicit calls to action that decried the Israeli government". 
The intelligence memo does not state who made the order to encourage Mossad employees and civilians to join the protests but notes that the intelligence came from signals intelligence - meaning the US spied on its closest ally in the region.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
