        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent statement released by French authorities has pledged France and Australia to “rebuild” a bilateral relationship – after accusing the previous Morrison government of a “breach of trust”. 

It comes as France accused its allies “of stabbing it in the back” – when Australia opted for nuclear-powered submarines to be built with US and British technology.

Following Australia’s federal election outcome, French President Emmanuel Macron called Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to congratulate him on his election win.

The full statement released by French authorities says:  

“After acknowledging the severe breach of trust following the decision of the previous prime minister, Scott Morrison to terminate the submarine contracts, the French president and Australia's prime minister have agreed to rebuild a bilateral relation based on trust and respect to jointly overcome global challenges, foremost among which is the climate emergency and the strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jurors have finished hearing evidence from actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard in their defamation trial.

Ms Heard returned to the stand for the last time ahead of closing arguments.

She claims she has been "harassed, humiliated and threatened" every day since accusing her former husband of physical and sexual abuse.

She was questioned if she was surprised by the number of people testifying against her.

British model Kate Moss denied rumours she was pushed down stairs by Mr Depp while they were dating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British supermodel Kate Moss denying Amber Heard's claim her former boyfriend Johnny Depp abused her was the "quickest testimony" of the whole trial, says Mitry Lawyers' Richard Mitry.

Mr Mitry said Ms Moss' testimony was not pivotal to the outcome of the case but was important because it "directly refuted" Ms Heard's claim about Depp in her statement.

During Ms Heard’s testimony, she mentioned Kate Moss and a rumour that the actor once pushed the model down a flight of stairs, leaving the door open for Depp’s legal team to bring her in to take the stand.

Ms Moss denied rumours she was pushed down stairs by Mr Depp while they were dating.

"By Kate Moss not only denying that in all of three minutes, which is probably the quickest testimony in this whole trial, categorically stating good things about him – naturally it's going to help his case."]]></summary>

CNN: US preparing to approve advanced long-range rocket system for Ukraine 
Washington (CNN)The Biden administration is preparing to step up the kind of weaponry it is offering Ukraine by sending advanced, long-range rocket systems that are now the top request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials say. 
The administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. 
Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a gamechanger in their war against Russia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Here's How Russian Crude Is Finding Its Way To Customers 
* Refinitiv Eikon: Greece has emerged as a new hub for Russian oil via ship-to-ship (STS) loadings. 
* Vortexa: Russia has been increasing fuel exports to Greece, with shipments set to jump to about 2.5 million barrels. 
* Trading Russian crude and oil products remain legal for now. 
Small tankers and ship-to-ship transfers are being used to keep the flow of Russian oil to China steady, Bloomberg reported this week, citing sources from the brokering industry.
Typically, the report notes, Russian ESPO crude is shipped directly to China. But lately, buyers are opting for loading the crude on small tankers and shipping it to South Korean waters, from where it is loaded onto supertankers and then taken to China. 
According to Bloomberg’s sources, the change is a result of reprioritization among buyers as shipowners avoid loading Russian oil because of Western sanctions. Currently, almost all of the ESPO available for sale is going to China.

WNU Editor: As high as oil prices are right now, I shudder when I think on what would happen if all Russia oil and energy exports are banned. The cost of oil would then go through the roof.

Rigzone/Bloomberg: Saudi Arabia Making $1B From Oil Exports Every Day  
Saudi Arabia’s oil exports reached $30 billion in March, the highest in at least six years, driven by a rally in oil prices and rising production. 
The value of crude exports, now almost $1 billion a day, increased by 123% year on year, the kingdom’s statistics office said. 
Saudi Arabia’s crude production rose to 10.3 million barrels a day in March, with Brent oil prices averaging $112 a barrel. Prices have jumped almost 50% this year, mostly due to the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The higher revenues helped the kingdom post a 57.5 billion riyal ($15 billion) budget surplus between January and March. It will be one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to make breaking European Union sanctions against Russia a crime, a move that would allow EU governments to confiscate assets of companies and individuals that evade EU restrictions against Moscow. 
Breaking EU sanctions on Russia is now a criminal offence in 12 EU countries. It is either an administrative or a criminal offence in 13 and two treat it only as an administrative offence, Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said. Penalties for sanction breaking across the EU vary accordingly. 
The Commission proposal aims to unify that approach to make sanctions evasion a serious crime in all members of the 27-nation bloc, he told a news conference.

ABC News Australia: US and Japanese warplanes in show of strength following North Korean missile launches 
US jet fighters have joined Japanese warplanes in a show of strength, a day after North Korea launched ballistic missiles into the waters separating it with Japan. 
The exercise was meant to "showcase combined capabilities to deter and counter regional threats", the US military said in a statement. The flight of eight aircraft consisted of four American F-16 jets and four Japanese F-15 warplanes, according to Japan's Air Self-Defence Force. 
Japan and the United States wanted to show their combined resolve in the wake of North Korea's latest missile launches, two US officials told Reuters anonymously.

Rigzone: Oil Inventories Down to Dangerously Low Point 
 Crude oil inventories are down to a dangerously low point across Europe, North America, and OECD Asia just as OPEC+ spare production capacity has dwindled to the lowest levels since April 2020. 
That’s according to a new BofA Global Research report, which was sent to Rigzone on Monday. The report also highlighted that petroleum product inventories have fallen to “precarious levels” for middle distillates and gasoline “as the market heads into the peak of the U.S. driving season”. 
“As a result, refined petroleum cracks have recently spiked to record levels, contributing to boost volatility across the oil complex,” the BofA Global Research report stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]  The Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study (HKIAS) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) continues to connect scholars around the globe, allowing them to explore interdisciplinary ideas and address real-world issues.   The most recent HKIAS Distinguished Lecture Series on Electronics and Photonics, held in March and April, was  supported in part by Kwang Hua Educational Foundation. The discussion topics covered nanotechnology, antenna design, 6G networks and much more, with five leading scientists outlining the latest research and potential applications of breakthrough technologies. The series attracted an international audience of over 2,000 scholars and guests.     The power of plasmonic biosensors    Nanotechnology and its biosensor applications are becoming ever more prevalent in the field of biomedical microsystems.   Kicking things off on March 1, Professor Stella W. Pang, Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Centre for Biosystems, Neuroscience, and Nanotechnology at CityU, spoke about “Nanotechnology for High-Performance Devices and Sensors”.     Noting the increased use of plasmonic sensors, she explained the ability of nanoimprint technology “to generate a large area of nanostructures within a few seconds”, showing high reproducibility and throughput. The novel 3D multiple layer plasmonic biosensors exhibit enhanced electric fields and a much higher sensitivity. This made it possible to detect lung cancer A549 live cells and nanoscale DNAs at very low concentrations by monitoring the highly sensitive resonance peak shift.   Also, hybrid coupling of plasmonic and photonic crystal modes leads to a record high sensitivity of 1376 nm/refractive index unit. “Combining these biosensors with 3D engineered platforms, we can separate cancer cells from normal cells for identification, which will further improve the sensitivity such that cancer patients could be diagnosed at a much earlier stage, potentially saving millions of lives,”…]]></summary>

   CNN: 'They were shooting directly at the journalists': New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted attack by Israeli forces 
(CNN)Several shots ring out in quick succession, cutting through a clear, blue spring morning in Jenin, in the West Bank. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack. 
The cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: "Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!" 
When the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue.   There's no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked "Press."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No man is an island — and perhaps, instead of an individual buyer, that’s why the affluent suburb of Darien, Connecticut is buying a large private island right in the heart of town.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the city – about 80 km from New York – concluded a contract to buy the roughly 60-acre Great Island, owned by the descendants of baking powder entrepreneur William Ziegler, for more than $100 million.  It is one of the largest remaining undeveloped parcels of land in the area. 
Ziegler, who died in 1905, bought it around 1900 to use as a summer residence.
“There will never again be an opportunity for the city to control the fate of this property, or add an asset to all of us like this,” Darien First Selectman Monica McNally said at an April meeting of the City Board of Selec…]]></summary>

Reuters: Biden's public approval falls to 36%, lowest of his presidency -Reuters/Ipsos 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell this week to 36%, the lowest level of his presidency, as Americans suffered from rising inflation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday. 
The two-day national poll found that 59% of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance. His overall approval was down six percentage points from 42% last week. 
Biden's approval rating has been below 50% since August, raising alarms that his Democratic Party is on track to lose control of at least one chamber of Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm election.

Israel turned down a U.S. request to allow Berlin to supply Ukraine with anti-tank missiles produced in Germany with Israeli technology under an Israeli license, two U.S. and Israeli officials said. 
Why it matters: The issue of weapons supply is one of the last policy differences between the U.S. and Israel when it comes to the war. 
Under pressure from the Biden administration, Israel has adjusted its policy toward Moscow and gradually taken a more pro-Ukraine position than it did when Russia began its invasion. But it has so far not supplied advanced weaponry to Ukraine. 
Driving the news: Amir Eshel, director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, visited Washington two weeks ago for talks with Pentagon officials on security cooperation between the U.S. and Israel.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday called for “total help” from other countries as Russian forces continue to advance in the eastern region of Ukraine amid Moscow’s ongoing invasion of the country. 
In an address, Zelensky stressed Ukraine’s need for aid from other countries, saying that Russian forces have significantly more equipment and soldiers than Ukraine in some places and adding that Moscow’s “desire to fight still remains.” 
“The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who defend the state are resisting the extremely fierce offensive of Russian troops in the east. 
In some areas, the enemy is substantially superior in terms of equipment, number of soldiers,” Zelensky said. “The Russian authorities have made an illustrative decision — they have allowed to hire older people for contract service. That is, they no longer have enough young people, but the desire to fight still remains.”

The Hill: Zelensky rips Kissinger over suggestion Ukraine cede territory to Russia 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday slammed former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for suggesting earlier this week that Ukraine cede some territory to Russia in the name of peace. 
In a Wednesday address, Zelensky said Kissinger “emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia” and that Kissinger’s “calendar is not 2022, but 1938” — a reference to the Munich Agreement, which allowed for Nazi Germany to annex land in western Czechoslovakia. 
“Behind all these geopolitical speculations of those who advise Ukraine to give away something to Russia, ‘great geopoliticians’ are always unwilling to see ordinary people,” Zelensky said. “Millions of those who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace. You must always see people.”

ABC News Australia: China seeks region-wide Pacific Islands agreement, FSM decries draft plan as threatening 'regional stability' 
Foreign Minister Penny Wong is promising to blitz the Pacific with a host of visits over coming weeks as Australia grapples with the fallout from a renewed push by China to dramatically expand security and commercial ties with the region. 
On Wednesday, Reuters revealed that China will seek a region-wide deal with almost a dozen Pacific islands, covering policing, security and data communications cooperation. 
A draft communique and five-year action plan sent by Beijing to 10 Pacific islands ahead of a foreign ministers meeting on May 30 prompted pushback from at least one of the invited nations, which says it showed China's intent to control the region and "threatens regional stability".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan placed Bitcoin’s (BTC) fair price at $38,000, 28% higher than its current level of around $29,500, according to a note to clients the bank released on Wednesday.  “Last month’s crypto market correction looks more like a capitulation from last January/February and looking forward, we see an upside for bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,” the note reads.  Bank strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was the main author of this document.
A note from bank investors placed the fair value of bitcoin at the same level in February.  It was trading around $43,000 at the time.
Crypto has outmoded real estate as the preferred “alternative asset” of the bank, along with hedge funds, continues the note.  This mentioned:

“So far, there is little evidence of VC [venture capital] funding dries up after Terra’s collapse.  Of the $25 billion in VC funding year-to-date, nearly $4 billion has come after Terra.  Our best guess is that venture capital funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be avoided.

Venture capital funding would be key to avoiding this crypto winter, he added.
On the same day, the great venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its fourth cryptocurrency fund at $4.5 billion.  Also on Wednesday, crypto-focused venture capital firm NGC Ventures launched its third blockchain fund with $100 million raised from investors such as Babel Finance, Huobi Ventures and Nexo Ventures.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly said expressed his personal antipathy to cryptocurrency, going so far as to call it a fraud, but the bank itself has taken a more practical stance.  This becomes the first major bankin the Metaverse earlier this year.  Dimon praised crypto for its ease of cross-border payment.

The fact that CPAC Hungary even happened should have made headlines in America.  Not only because Hungary is a country that is increasingly moving away from democracy and back towards authoritarianism, but because the event included video messages from the two leading figures of the Republican Party: donald trump and Tucker-Carlson.
Not to mention the fact that CPAC Hungary took place in the shadow of Orban-ally by Vladimir Putin brutal invasion of Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mark F. Cancian, CSIS: What Does $40 Billion in Aid to Ukraine Buy?  
Congress has approved $40 billion in aid for Ukraine and other countries affected by the conflict―the sixth aid package since the war began. A major change is that this package looks ahead months rather than weeks. 
The aid package provides $19 billion for immediate military support to Ukraine, continuing the effort that has been vital to sustaining Ukrainian resistance, and $3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe. The package also contains about $16 billion for economic support to Ukraine, global humanitarian relief, and a wide variety of international programs as well as $2 billion for long-term support to NATO allies and DOD modernization programs. 
Although some elements of the aid package will be available quickly, many will take years to fully implement. This raises questions about why long-term elements could not have gone through the regular congressional authorization and budget processes.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: This is where the $40 billion US aid package is going .... 
$3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe 
$16 billion for economic support to Ukraine and global humanitarian relief 
$2 billion for long-term support to NATO allies and DOD modernization programs 
Hmmmm .... $21.9 billion already spent and none of it is going to the Ukraine military. 
As for the rest .... 
$6 billion for training, equipment, weapons, logistic support, supplies and services, salaries and stipends and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of Ukraine (and the specifics of the expenditures remain to be determined). 
$9 billion to replenish U.S. weapons stocks already sent to Ukraine. 
$4 billion for the Foreign Military Financing Program (this allows a foreign country like Ukraine to buy brand new weapon systems). 
The last number .... $4 billion .... is what the Ukraine military will be getting to spend on new weapon systems.

The superintendent emphasized that the district remains flexible to adapt to new threats from Covid-19.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angela Lansbury, acclaimed and adored star of stage, film and television, will be honored this year with a special Tony Lifetime Achievement Award.
Lansbury, 96, who has already won five competitions Tony Awardwill receive the lifetime achievement award on June 12, when this year’s ceremony will take place at Radio City Music Hall and air on CBS.
Lansbury first appeared on Broadway in 1957, in a farce titled “Hotel Paradiso,” and in 1964 she starred in her first Broadway musical, “Anyone Can Whistle,” a flop most remembered for. that the songwriter was Stephen Sondheim.


She was already a three-time Oscar nominee, including for ‘The Manchurian Candidate’ in 1962, when she landed her role on Broadway, starring as the free-spirited lead character in 1966’s ‘Mame’. She won his first Tony Award for this performance.


She starred in several Sondheim musicals, winning Tony Awards for playing the theater’s most famous stage mother, Momma Rose, in “Gypsy,” as well as the scheming pastry chef owner Mrs. Lovett in ” Sweeney Todd”.  His most recent Tony nomination, in 2010, was for his work in a revival of another Sondheim musical, “A little night music.”
Lansbury also won Tony Awards for a short-lived musical titled “Dear World” and a revival of Noël Coward’s play “joyful spirit.”
Her last Broadway appearance was in a 2012 revival of “The best man», a play by Gore Vidal.
Lansbury also had a long career in film – she memorably voiced Mrs. Potts in ‘Beauty and the Beast’ – and in television, where she was the longtime star of ‘Murder, She Wrote’.
The Tony Awards are set to begin June 12 at 7 p.m. EST with an hour-long segment airing on Paramount+ hosted by Darren Criss and Julianne Hough, followed at 8 p.m. EST by a three-hour segment aired on CBS hosted by Ariana DeBose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One night in May 1997, in Tacoma, Washington, Kimonti Carter machine-gunned a car he believed to be carrying rival gang members.  It wasn’t – not that it should matter.  One of the five passengers in the car, a student, Corey Pittman, 19, was killed.  Carter, who had just turned 18, was sentenced to life in prison.
In director Gilda Sheppard’s sympathetic documentary “Since I Been Down”, punishment is also a crime.
Filled with archival visuals of Tacoma in the late 1980s and 1990s, when crack cocaine and gang violence took their toll, the documentary’s greatest strength is its listening tour, with Carter as the main guide.


Because Carter fired from a car, he was charged with aggravated first-degree murder, which carries an automatic mandatory life sentence.  (His reconviction hearing is scheduled for July 8.) He is not the only one facing harsh prison terms.  Washington state’s three-stroke sentence (which abolished parole in 1984) can be particularly difficult for young offenders.


Over the decades, Carter expressed remorse, but it was his role as a beneficiary and leader of inmate-led initiatives, the Black Prisoner Collective and TEACH, or Taking Education and Changing History, that suggests a transformation.
Other inmates here share their insights, as do two former detectives, some former gang members, and the mothers of victims and perpetrators.  One former inmate, Tonya Wilson, who served 17 years, is particularly insightful about the personal and societal forces that led to her incarceration.
Another prisoner said, “We say that a lot of the answers that people are looking for in society will be found in prison.
“We caused pain,” said this inmate, “mainly because we are in pain.”
Far from looking like an excuse, in “Since I Been Down”, this observation sounds like a way to take account and change.

Buddy Cole makes particular sense when he’s become an elderly gay royal – the way, Thompson said, he imagine the character decades ago – and Thompson’s two iconic queens reappear in a sketch in which Her Majesty dedicates a risque monument to Buddy’s beloved former bathhouse.
Sometimes the new tracks lean too obviously on aging gags, like a pain skit about 60-year-old strippers.  (There’s a fair amount of nudity in the season, more lucratively deployed in other segments.)
But the most surprising thing about the season is how hard it tries to evolve children’s comedy and take it in new directions.  It’s not just the “The Kids in the Hall” the band would have done had t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jen Psaki, who became famous as President Biden’s first White House press secretary, presiding over 200 briefings and earning TikTok stardom for his sometimes thorny exchanges with reporters, will join cable news channel MSNBC later this year.
She will serve as a political analyst throughout this year’s midterm elections and during the 2024 presidential campaign, the channel said on Tuesday.  She is also set to host a show starting next year on a streaming-only channel, MSNBC on Peacock.
Ms Psaki’s last day in the West Wing was May 13 and her appearance on television news was widely expected.  Speculations on his potential work at MSNBC started this year while she was still presiding over the White House pulpit.  Ms Psaki said at the time that she adhered to ethical guidelines while discussing future job prospects.
She is the second major hire by MSNBC from the Biden administration. Symone D. Sanders, a former spokeswoman for Vice President Kamala Harris, hosts a weekend show for the network.  Ms. Psaki said in a statement provided by MSNBC that her program would focus on “factual, thoughtful conversations about the big issues that matter to people across the country.”


MSNBC is popular with Democrats and left-leaning viewers, and its election and main-evening coverage already includes savvy hosts like Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace.  Now its viewers will receive real-time commentary from a key member of Mr. Biden’s first term inner circle.
Ms. Psaki previously worked as an on-air contributor to CNN.  Prior to that, she served as White House Communications Director for former President Barack Obama and Chief Spokesperson for former Secretary of State John Kerry.

A possibility is that the planet was much larger – perhaps twice its current mass or more.  Billions of years ago, this nascent proto-Mercury, or super Mercury, could have been hit by a large object, stripping away its outer layers and leaving behind the rest we see.

Is this the time for Ukraine to export the very food that it needs to feed its population? 
I have family, friends, and contacts in Ukraine who are telling me how serious the humanitarian crisis is in Ukraine right now. Having not enough food is one of them, and it is a situation that everyone is telling me is going to get worse.
But the Western narrative is that Ukraine must export its crops to avoid a global food crisis.

The world faces an unprecedented wave of famine and hunger triggered by a further “explosive” increase in food prices, experts have warned, after new figures revealed the extent to which the war in Ukraine will decimate global supplies of wheat. 
Forecasts supplied exclusively to The Independent suggest that Russia’s brutal campaign, including its blockade of vital Ukrainian ports, is likely to cause even deeper disruption to food supplies than was previously feared. 
Wheat production is now expected to be halved this year – a significantly worse outcome than previous forecasts predicted, said MHP, one of Ukraine’s largest exporters.

Sky News Australia discussed the issue with Sky News Business reporter Edward Boyd.

"Reserve Bank in New Zealand has been lifting the cash rate sharply, it's at one and a half per cent right now, it's going to get up to two per cent probably by the end of today.

"We haven't actually seen inflation start to come down in New Zealand and that's a pretty good indicator for Australia as well. 

"Our Reserve Bank's lifting the cash rate and so far it hasn't really had any impact on inflation – I think they're going to need to lift it a lot more to start pushing down those inflationary pressures."
 
Mr Boyd said the RBA isn't expecting inflation to start declining until the middle of next year.

"It's going to peak at about six per cent headline inflation at the end of this year and slowly start to fall in mid 2023."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Hungary's pro-Putin Prime Minister Viktor Orban announces new State of Emergency due to concerns over Ukraine – replacing the Covid one that would have expired next week 
* Hungary has declared a legal 'state of danger' in response to war in Ukraine 
* Orban's party passed a constitutional amendment to allow the declaration 
* The government can now enact laws by decree without parliamentary oversight 
* A similar measure introduced amid Covid was set to expire on June 1 
* Despite Hungary's NATO membership, Orban has maintained strong relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin 
Hungary has declared a legal 'state of danger' in response to Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, the prime minister announced Tuesday, allowing the right-wing nationalist government to take special measures without the participation of the legislature. 
In a video on social media, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the war in Ukraine represents 'a constant threat to Hungary' which was 'putting our physical security at risk and threatening the energy and financial security of our economy and families.'

WNU Editor: Hungarian Prime Minister Orban believes that the world is on the brink of an economic crisis brought on by the Ukraine war. Here is an easy prediction. In the coming months many European governments (and governments outside of Europe) are going to be doing the same thing.

(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least three suspected ballistic missile Wednesday, just hours after as U.S. President Joe Biden wrapped up a visit to American allies South Korea and Japan, where he discussed the security threat posed by Kim Jong Un’s regime. 
The projectiles were fired at around 6 a.m., 6:37 a.m. and 6:42 a.m. from an area near Pyongyang’s airport and flew toward waters off North Korea’s east coast, the South’s Joint Chief of Staff said. 
Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said officials were looking at the whether at least one of the rockets was an intercontinental ballistic missile and told reporters two suspected ballistic missiles appear to have already splashed down outside of the country’s exclusive economic zone. 
Kishi said the launches were unacceptable.

Bush by smuggling in Middle East kill team through Mexico as revenge for the invasion of Iraq': FBI informants uncovered plot from asylum seeker in Ohio, WhatsApp messages and videos from former president's Dallas home 
* The FBI reportedly foiled a plot this year to murder George W. Bush

* The warrant was unsealed in the Southern District of Ohio this week 
An FBI search-warrant application alleges that an ISIS operative plotted to assassinate George W. Bush with a plan that included smuggling a kill team into the country via Mexico. 
The application was filed on March 23 and briefly unsealed this week in the Southern District of Ohio 
It describes how the suspect, Shihab Ahmed Shihab, an Iraqi asylum seeker, visited Dallas in November and took video footage of the area around the former president's home.

The Guardian: YouTube removes more than 9,000 channels relating to Ukraine war  
Exclusive: Platform takes ‘unprecedented action’ to address content guideline violations since invasion 
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. 
The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. 
YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion.

WNU Editor: Fortunately my favorite Russian YouTube channels are operating. But I think it is only a matter of time before the platform is shut down by Google/Alphabet or the Kremlin.]]></summary>

In two samples, Haskins had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20% and 0.24% at the time of his autopsy, according to the report, more than double the legal limit of 0.08% in Florida.  Ketamine, a sedative that is also considered a recreational hallucinogen, was also found in Haskins’ system, according to the report.
Through an attorney, Haskins’ wife Kalabrya in a statement Monday asked for patience and privacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But Osaka is uncertain, although she may travel to Berlin to play in the new grass-court event that will count towards her ranking.
“Overall, I feel like I’m going to stop telling myself I’m bad on these surfaces,” she said of grass and clay, “and at the place, keep your head down and keep working really hard, because I think that’s what I’ve been doing all year. I can’t expect everything to happen at once. I hope so that, gradually, I will have the results I want.
So far, she has four Grand Slam singles titles, all on hard courts, most recently at the 2021 Australian Open about 16 months ago.  The pecking order changes and is not in his favor.  After breaking down in tears mid-match at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., in March after a heckler rocked her in a second-round loss, she bounced back to reach the final of the Miami Open, where Swiatek beat her, 6-4, 6-0.
Osaka, who plays for Japan and is based in the United States, remains one of the biggest stars in the sport and the highest paid female athlete in the world by far.  She has enough lucrative long-term endorsement deals to justify recently break up with IMG to set up his own management agency with Stuart Duguid, his agent.
But Osaka will be ranked around world No. 40 after Roland Garros, and while his portfolio looks strong in redwood, how does that affect the bottom line and his place in the sporting landscape if a young player like Swiatek takes the real control of the sport and younger, possibly hungrier players like Anisimova continue to dominate Osaka at the start of major tournaments?
To what extent, in the age of social media, should results and stardom continue to align once the millions of followers are already acquired?
Osaka, left ankle wrapped, seemed genuinely determined to change her luck on Monday, digging into the corners and maintaining positive energy almost to the end.  But Anisimova has been more consistent on serve and more devastating from the baseline and, crucially, on the returns.

For thousands of years, there have been rules to control the types of weapons in warfare - for instance, the use of poison in armed combat was forbidden in Ancient Greece. 
But it wasn’t until the 19th century that international agreements were made to legally regulate the types of weapons that are allowed (and banned) in wars around the world. 
In the infographic below, Visual Capitalist's Carmen Ang and Sabrina Fortin outlines the weapons that are banned or limited in war, according to international humanitarian laws that are outlined in the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).

Washington: US President Joe Biden said in a memorandum that he officially designated Colombia to be considered a major non-NATO ally to the United States.
“By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America… I hereby designate Colombia as a Major Non-NATO Ally of the United States for the purposes of the Act and the Arms Export Control Act,” Biden said in the memorandum on Monday. 
The designation will provide Colombia the opportunity to benefit from special access to US military and economic programs, but it does not provide security guarantees like those given to NATO members.

Veteran US statesman Henry Kissinger has urged the West to stop trying to inflict a crushing defeat on Russian forces in Ukraine, warning that it would have disastrous consequences for the long term stability of Europe. 
The former US secretary of state and architect of the Cold War rapprochement between the US and China told a gathering in Davos that it would be fatal for the West to get swept up in the mood of the moment and forget the proper place of Russia in the European balance of power. 
Dr Kissinger said the war must not be allowed to drag on for much longer, and came close to calling on the West to bully Ukraine into accepting negotiations on terms that fall very far short of its current war aims.

WNU Editor: Henry Kissinger is also saying that Taiwan should not be the core issue between China and the U.S. .... Henry Kissinger says Taiwan cannot be at the core of negotiations between the U.S. and China (CNBC). 
Henry Kissinger gave more details on his views on the Russia - Ukraine war at a Financial Times event two weeks ago (see video below).

“I think we worked really well at bat,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.  “Gerrit Cole has great stuff.  It’s an ace.  He’s an ace for a reason and to be able to score some runs against him, I’m proud of our hitters.


Urías started Baltimore’s four-point third with a double down the left field line, then broke a tie at 4 by fielding a 0-1 fastball on the short porch to right field past Cole (4-1).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday, the advantage belonged to Boston all along.  The Celtics were quicker to drop balls, more active in disrupting passing lanes, and more coordinated in switches, limiting quality looks for Miami.  They were more pressing to get back on defense and turn in the paint, not allowing the Heat to push for quick breaks like they did on Saturday.  Boston’s defense was so effective that Miami only fired two 3-pointers in the first quarter, limiting its chances of closing the deficit until it was too late.  That was exactly the kind of energy Boston was sorely lacking in the first half of Game 3. Miami’s starters combined for 18 points.
What made the game even weirder was that the Celtics didn’t play well offensively.  They were just 5 for 27 of 3 when they entered the fourth quarter with 2…]]></summary>

The new draft law “On Mining in the Russian Federation”, dated May 20, appeared in the database of the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma.  The document has several significant changes from the previous version, present by the co-sponsors on April 29. 
While the text remains unchanged in general, the new draft misses the subsection on a register of mining operators, which companies should register in order to continue their work.  In the latest version, to start mining, crypto mining companies must register as sole proprietor or self-employed.  Companies would follow a standard procedure for company registration.

Another correction swept away the promise of tax amnesty in the first year of registration.  The grace period would apply to the clearance of mining equipment, any profits made before the law was passed, and any violations of strict limits on money transfers abroad adopted by the Russian government on March 8. .  local media, in its review of the project, the legal department of the State Duma critical registration and tax amnesty initiatives, stating that they could “eventually incur costs on the federal budget”.
On April 7, the head of the State Duma’s Financial Markets Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, revealed that changes to the federal tax code regarding crypto should be adopted. by the end of summer parliamentary session.  It is unclear if they would include specifications regarding mining.
