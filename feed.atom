        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States on Friday criticized Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye after he called for public stoning of same-sex couples, the latest anti-gay broadside by an East African leader.
"The United States is deeply troubled by President Ndayishimiye's remarks targeting certain vulnerable and marginalized Burundians," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.
"We call on all of Burundi's leaders to respect the inherent dignity and inalienable rights, including equal access to justice, of every member of Burundian society," he said.
The statement did not explicitly mention LGBTQ rights, a delicate topic in much of Africa, but was a clear reference to remarks by Ndayishimiye at a public event late last month.
Responding to a question on gay couples, Ndayishimiye said, "Personally, I think if we see these kind of individuals in Burundi, we should put them in a stadium and stone them."
Burundi's relationship has improved in recent years with the United States, which had imposed sanctions in 2015 over a deadly crackdown on dissent as Ndayishimiye's predecessor Pierre Nkurunziza controversially sought a third term.
The United States in 2022 agreed to a five-year aid package with Burundi after removing sanctions, in part crediting reforms by Ndayishimiye.
The US statement Friday did not threaten repercussions. Last month, the United States restricted visas to officials from Uganda who implement a new law that carries potential death sentences for homosexual relations.
President Joe Biden promised on taking office in 2021 to advocate forcefully at home and abroad for LGBTQ rights, although US diplomats often say a quiet approach is more effective.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts.
