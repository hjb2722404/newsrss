Wall Street Journal: Pentagon Prepares for Space Warfare as Potential Threats From China, Russia Grow  
White House’s spending request includes plans for simulators, equipment to train Space Force members for battle 
The Pentagon is gearing up for a future conflict in space as China and Russia deploy missiles and lasers that can take out satellites and disrupt military and civilian communications. 
The U.S. military long ago dropped the notion of crewed, orbiting space weapons in favor of satellites because the logistics of supporting people outside of Earth’s atmosphere were formidable. 
The physics of space also make it impossible to sneak up on an enemy or quickly change orbit or direction. And earthbound tactics don’t work in space, where the U.S., China and Russia are all turning to satellites and sensors to wage and win any conflict. 
 “You can’t dig trenches in space,” said Marty Whelan, senior vice president of the Defense Systems Group at The Aerospace Corp., a federally funded research group. 
“If deterrence fails, you can’t wait until something bad happens to get ready. You have to have the full infrastructure together,” said Mr. Whelan, a former Air Force major general, who led a strategic review of space systems for the Pentagon and the intelligence community. 
The White House this month proposed a $30 billion annual budget for the U.S. Space Force, almost $4 billion more than last year and a bigger jump than for other services including the Air Force and the Navy.

BBC: Ukraine war: Germany sends much-awaited Leopard tanks 
The first shipment of Leopard 2 tanks from Germany has been sent to Ukraine, the German defence ministry says. 
Eighteen cutting-edge main battle tanks were delivered after Ukrainian crews were trained to use them. 
Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said he was sure the tanks could "make a decisive contribution" on the frontlines of the war. 
Challenger 2 tanks from the UK have also arrived, according to reports from Ukraine. 
Ukraine has been calling for more modern vehicles and weapon systems for months to help fight Russia's invasion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian authorities said Monday they seized 2.3 tonnes of cocaine disguised as ceramic tiles destined for Turkey via a growing maritime route for illicit drugs.
The drug bust happened Friday at a warehouse at Peru's biggest port, El Callao, just outside the capital Lima, police said.
"This is the first incident that we know of (in which the cargo was in) Peruvian ports and its final destination was Turkey. Usually we are aware of ports in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and France," said El Callao's police chief, Colonel Luis Angel Bolanos.
At a press conference Monday, police displayed the cocaine, which had been fixed to rubber sheets to appear as hundreds of ceramic tiles packed in wooden boxes inside a shipping container.
Bolanos said the seized cocaine was valued at "at least $20 million."
The Andean nation seized a record 86.4 tonnes of drugs and illicit substances last year, 28 tonnes of which were cocaine hydrochloride, police data shows.
Peru and nearby Colombia are among the top global producers of cocaine and of the coca leaf it is made of, according to the United Nations.

   EurAsian Times: US Acquires ‘Critical’ Military Base Overlooking Taiwan & Claimed By China; Beijing Calls The Move ‘Provocative’ 
Amidst Chinese criticism mounting over the American role in the South China Sea, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr announced that four new military bases under a defense agreement with the US would be scattered across the country, including one in a province overlooking Taiwan. 
“There are four extra sites scattered around the Philippines — there are some in the North, there are some around Palawan, there is some further South,” Marcos told reporters on the sidelines of the Filipino army’s founding anniversary. 
The announcement comes after one of the most advanced fighter jets of the US Air Force, the F-22 Raptor, exercised with the Philippines Air Force (PAF) earlier this week, making it the first time the top-notch jet had visited the nation. 
The Filipino President further stated that his country and the US would reveal the locations of the bases soon, adding the sites would strengthen the country’s capabilities to protect the “eastern half” of its main island, Luzon.

* The CEO told the FT that the company's growth is being "challenged by the storage of cat videos." 
A Norwegian arms manufacturer said that a TikTok data center is eating all the electricity in the region, meaning that the company cannot keep up with the surging global demand for ammunition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Euronews/AP: EU threatens more sanctions if Russia moves nukes to Belarus Access to the comments 
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus about allowing Russia to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.
Borrell tweeted: “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation & threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” 
In an interview on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move was triggered by Britain’s decision last week to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium. 
Tactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield. They have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles.

Update #1: EU Threatens More Sanctions If Russia Stations Tactical Nuclear Weapons In Belarus (Zero Hedge/Epoch Times)  
Update #2: EU will respond to Kremlin's nuclear blackmail with new sanctions - Borrell (Ukrinform)   
WNU Editor: There is not much left to sanction. This nuclear deployment to Belarus also tells me that any Western hope for regime change in Belarus is not going to happen. 
And as for Ukraine receiving depleted uranium shells that resulted in the Kremlin making the announcement of deploying tactical nuclear missiles to Belarus, those munitions are now on their way .... Depleted-uranium shells, the armour-busting munitions heading to Ukraine (France 24).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 16 people have died in a landslide triggered by months of heavy rainfall in the south of Ecuador, the government said on Monday.
The mudslide happened late on Sunday night, burying dozens of homes, injuring 16 people and affecting around 500, the Risk Management Secretariat (SNGR) said in a statement.

President Joko Widodo’s statement that he prefers credit cards used by the government to be issued by domestic issuers rather than foreign companies has been met with positivity from Indonesia’s credit card issuers. 
Executive Director of the Indonesian Credit Card Association (AKKI), Steve Marta said that the government should encourage the use of government credit cards that utilise local issuers and public credit cards. 
“It’s not only government credit cards but I think we should also have local credit cards one day,” Marta told CNBC Indonesia on Thursday, 6th March 2023. 
Marta stated that the banking sector’s credit card issuers would also endorse this measure, citing security risks associated with credit cards issued overseas, as highlighted by Jokowi’s comments about US sanctions against Russia during the Ukraine conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Myanmar army chief vows to crush resistance in rare speech 
The pageantry of Myanmar's annual military parade did little to mask the sinister message - the country's armed forces won't stop fighting those opposing their rule, whatever the cost. 
A civil war has engulfed the country since a military coup in 2021. 
The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, and more than a million have been displaced. 
But General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, showed no signs of backing down in a rare speech.

Today, the Church in Kenya is calling for dialogue between the ruling regime and the opposition. The issue here is not about dialogue, but the legitimacy of the President William Ruto. The situation in Kenya reminds me of a similar situation in Rwanda in early 90s.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/03/27/33427">Read the full story, “Africa's Dark Road to Democracy”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC/Reuters: Largest strike in decades brings Germany to a standstill 
* Airports and bus and train stations across Germany were at a standstill on Monday, causing disruption for millions at the start of the working week. 
* Employees are pressing for higher wages to blunt the effects of inflation, which reached 9.3% in February. 
* The Airports Association ADV estimated that 380,000 air passengers were affected. 
Airports and bus and train stations across Germany were at a standstill on Monday, causing disruption for millions at the start of the working week during one of the largest walkouts in decades as Europe’s biggest economy reels from inflation. 
The 24-hour strikes called by the Verdi trade union and railway and transport union EVG were the latest in months of industrial action which has hit major European economies as higher food and energy prices dent living standards. 
Terminals were largely deserted as airports, including two of Germany’s largest in Munich and Frankfurt, suspended flights, while rail services were cancelled by railway operator Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL). Striking workers wearing yellow or red high-visibility jackets blew horns, sirens and whistles, held up banners and waved flags during protests.

French President Emmanuel Macron summoned government ministers for a crisis meeting on Monday, as tensions ran high a day before another major round of strikes and protests against his pension reforms. 
Nearly two weeks after Macron rammed the new law through parliament using a special provision sidestepping any vote, unions have vowed no let-up in mass protests to get the government to back down. 
They have called for another big day of action on Tuesday, the 10th such mobilisation since protests started in mid-January against the controversial law, which includes raising the retirement age to 64 from 62.
Macron, whose approval ratings in opinion polls are at a low point, said last week he accepted the "unpopularity" that came with the reform. 
Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, meanwhile, said that while there was no plan to drop the legislation, she was ready for fresh dialogue with unions.

Naval News: U.S. Navy Commences USS Connecticut (SSN 22) Repairs 
Naval News reached out to NAVSEA to ask the status of repairs on the Seawolf-class nuclear-powered attack submarine, USS Connecticut (SSN 22). The submarine hit a seamount in international waters in the INDO-PACOM area on October 2, 2021. According to a previous Naval News story on the Connecticut, repairs supposedly started in February 2023. 
In general, the U.S. Navy considers submarine operations “Classified Secret”. Therefore, information on submarine repairs remains elusive at best. A search of government contracting websites reveals no (detailed) information on the ordering of parts for the USS Connecticut as of March 2023.

WNU Editor: 16 months to start repairs on a critical US Navy submarine. This is just more evidence on the US Navy's lack of infrastructure to take care of its fleet. 
Update: The reason for the accident was revealed in an investigation that was made public last year .... Investigation: USS Connecticut South China Sea Grounding Result of Lax Oversight, Poor Planning (USNI News).]]></summary>

Axios: 6 Army bases named after Confederate leaders get dates for new names 
Several U.S. Army bases will officially get their new names in the coming months as the military seeks to redesignate bases that currently honor Confederate leaders. 
Driving the news: Fort Hood, the major Army base in central Texas, will be redesignated as Fort Cavazos on May 9, the base announced Friday.

The Army paused its new multi-million dollar advertising campaign Sunday after its featured actor was arrested the day before, officials said. 
Jonathan Majors, who stars as the on-screen narrator in the first wave of “Be All You Can Be” advertisements, faces charges of assault, strangulation and harassment, a New York Police Department official told Army Times. 
The police official said officers responded to a 911 call shortly after 11:00 a.m. at an apartment in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood, where they found Majors and a 30-year-old woman with injuries to her head and neck. Officers did a “preliminary investigation” and arrested the actor.

Cuba is holding elections Sunday to pick lawmakers at a time when the ruling communist party is struggling to keep a lid on public anger caused by rampant inflation, hunger and blackouts. 
The vote, decried as a sham by human rights groups, will pick 470 candidates who were pre-selected by the government to the powerful National Parliament for a five-year term. The system has allowed the Communist Party to control the parliament since its inception in 1976.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The outcome of this Cuban election has already been determined. There are no opposition candidates on the ballot .... Cuba holds national elections with no opposition candidates (AP). 
I have always closely followed the news from Cuba. Been there many times, and I was always felt that if there is a country in the Caribbean that would succeed, it would be Cuba. But the system is now so rigged to benefit a few (I would estimate about 5% of the population), that the rest of the country (i.e. the other 95%) are exploited and abused. A true "Hunger Games" scenario for those who are familiar with the movie.]]></summary>

KABUL (Reuters) - Sofia logs in to class on a laptop in Kabul for an online English course run by one of a growing number of educational institutes trying to reach Afghanistan's girls and women digitally in their homes.
But when the teacher calls on Sofia to read a passage her computer screen freezes.
"Can you hear me?" she asks repeatedly, checking her connection.
After a while, her computer stutters back to life.
"As usual," a fellow student equally frustrated with the poor communications sighs as the class gets going again.
Sofia, 22, is one of a growing stream of Afghan girls and women going online as a last resort to get around the Taliban administration's restrictions on studying and working.

The Swiss government was compelled to intervene to save Credit Suisse Group AG as the troubled bank wouldn’t have survived another day of trading amid a crisis of investor confidence, Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said. 
 “CS would not have survived Monday,” Keller-Sutter said in an interview with Zurich newspaper NZZ. “Without a solution, payment transactions with CS in Switzerland would have been significantly disrupted, possibly even collapsed.” 
The impact of a disorderly bankruptcy may have been as much as double Swiss economic output, the minister said, citing expert estimates. More broadly, “we should have expected a global financial crisis” as “the crash of CS would have sent other banks into the abyss.”

The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‘Eggs’ in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‘Welcome to Egginton’ signs bookending the village, now read ‘Welcome to …Inton’ leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‘Eggs’ back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‘Easter obsessed’ village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs – one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.]]></summary>

“I’m concerned that the only reports we’ll get out of it will be by state-run media in China and I’d really like to know what the purpose is of this visit,” Mr Tehan told Sky News Australia.

“I mean he should clearly articulate what the purpose is, why he’s going, what is the outcome he’s seeking to achieve from this secret, secret trip that he’s taking that he will not take any reporters with him on.”]]></summary>

Jerusalem CNN  — Massive crowds filled the streets of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv late Sunday night after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul. 
Waving Israeli flags and chanting “democratia,” protestors could be seen blocking streets and bridges, including the Ayalon Highway.  Protesters lit several fires on the main highway in Tel Aviv, their acrid, black smoke billowing into the sky, partly obscuring some of the city’s iconic skyscrapers. 
Demonstrators also gathered beside the highway, burning scrap metal and wood with almost no police around.

        <updated>2023-03-27T00:17:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - The United States is deeply concerned by events in Israel and "strongly urges" leaders there to find compromise as soon as possible, a White House spokesperson said on Sunday after the firing of Israel's defense minister triggered mass protests.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday, a day after Gallant broke ranks with the government and urged a halt to a highly contested plan to overhaul the judicial system.
"We continue to strongly urge Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as possible. We believe that is the best path forward for Israel and all of its citizens," White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.
Some three months since taking office, Netanyahu's nationalist-religious coalition has been plunged into crisis over the bitter divisions exposed by its flagship judicial overhaul plans.
The overhaul package would tighten political control over judicial appointments, handing the executive wider freedom to name judges to the Supreme Court.
"As the president recently discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu, democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship," Watson said.
"Democratic societies are strengthened by checks and balances, and fundamental changes to a democratic system should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea has fired a ballistic missile off its east coast, South Korea's military said on Monday.
Japan's Coast Guard said the projectile believed to be North Korea-fired missile has already fallen.
Other details, such as its flight range, were not immediately available.
The launch is the latest in a series of weapons tests by the North, including the firing of multiple cruise missiles on Wednesday which Pyongyang said was aimed at practicing tactical nuclear attacks.

New York Times: From Rockets to Ball Bearings, Pentagon Struggles to Feed War Machine 
WASHINGTON — The Navy admiral had a blunt message for the military contractors building precision-guided missiles for his warships, submarines and planes at a moment when the United States is dispatching arms to Ukraine and preparing for the possibility of conflict with China. 
“Look at me. I am not forgiving the fact you’re not delivering the ordnance we need. OK?” Adm. Daryl Caudle, who is in charge of delivering weapons to most of the Navy’s East Coast-based fleet, warned contractors during an industry gathering in January. “We’re talking about war-fighting, national security, and going against a competitor here and a potential adversary that is like nothing we’ve ever seen. And we can’t dillydally around with these deliveries.” 
His open frustration reflects a problem that has become worryingly apparent as the Pentagon dispatches its own stocks of weapons to help Ukraine hold off Russia and Washington warily watches for signs that China might provoke a new conflict by invading Taiwan: The United States lacks the capacity to produce the arms that the nation and its allies need at a time of heightened superpower tensions.

Vanity Fair is appalled at Ron DeSantis’s “flip flopping.”  They are not so much concerned with Fauci’s, or other “experts.”  Remember how Fauci said masks were useless before they were lifesaving?  Or when getting a vax meant you would not get Covid, before you could only get a mild case, before you needed 5 boosters?  Or when vaccines prevented the spread of Covid before they didn’t?  Or when Covid originated on the w…]]></summary>

The reported valuation is less than half of the $44 billion that Musk paid to acquire the social media platform, pointing to a drop in Twitter's value.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters' emailed request for a comment.
Musk said in December that Twitter is on track to be "roughly cash flow break-even" in 2023 as top advertisers slashed their spending on the social-media platform after the billionaire' s takeover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian Labor Party in New South Wales claimed power in a state election on Saturday, with voters backing the centre-left party's pledges on anti-privatisation and cost of living relief.
The election in Australia's most populous state had been touted as a tight race between the incumbent Liberal-National coalition and Labor, but the vote count on Sunday showed Labor on track to take the 47 seats needed to form majority government, after three terms in opposition.
The win marks further endorsement of the party of Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, who joined his state counterpart Chris Minns - who is set to become New South Wales' 47th premier - in Sydney on polling day.
"A huge congratulations to @ChrisMinnsMP ... and the whole NSW Labor team on your election victory," Albanese said on Twitter late on Saturday.
Labor's win in New South Wales means the party now governs at state and federal level across Australia's mainland, leaving island state Tasmania as the conservative outlier.
"After 12 years in opposition the people of New South Wales have voted for a fresh start," Minns told supporters in Sydney late on Saturday.
"The people of New South Wales voted to put in a government that would put people at the heart of all decision-making".
Labor's campaign in the state featured a pledge to rule out further privatisation of state assets, and a promise to boost public sector wages, amid cost-of-living concerns.
Outgoing premier Dominic Perrottet, a social conservative Catholic and former state treasurer, was elected premier in 2021 after his predecessor resigned after a corruption watchdog probe into whether she was involved in conduct that "constituted or involved a breach of public trust".
Albanese, in the lead up to polling day, had urged voters in his home state to back Labor, saying the coalition government was "in shambles" due to infighting.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
