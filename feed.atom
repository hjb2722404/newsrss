Hanna Oneshchak, 12, on accordion, accompanied the other seven as they sang a Ukrainian folk song, “Ta nema toho Mykyty”, about a man who decides to leave the country to seek a better job, but looks then towards the mountains and, struck by their beauty, changes his mind.


“Whatever sorrow we have”, they sang in Ukrainian, “I will not go to American soil”.
The children, students of the Open-Minded Kids Studio theater school in Lviv, were rehearsing the song ahead of two weekend performances of the play ‘Mama Po Skaipu’ (‘Mom on Skype’) at the Irondale Center in Brooklyn.  It will be the American premiere of the 80-…]]></summary>

These are concerns that are, in essence, legal, but really more philosophical and moral.  Acknowledging a source of inspiration, direct or indirect, is good business practice but also, in the age of internet-centric hyperresponsibility, something akin to playing offense as well as defense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the pandemic closings hit the real estate sector, showings were halted, homes were taken off the market and municipal offices that process closing documents were closed.  As a result, in March 2020, almost 18% of purchase contracts in the United States were canceled – although it took only a few months to return to normal levels.
But in 2022, the frequency of canceled transactions started to rise again, reaching almost 15% in June – the highest rate since the peak of the pandemic, according to a recent report by red finwhich represents approximately 60,000 failed home sales across the country.
The likely culprit: rising mortgage interest rates.  The journey between the accepted offer and the closing day can take up to two months or more, and interest rates sometimes change in the meantime.  Buyers can lock in rates for certain periods, but not all do, and even a small increase can stretch monthly payments out of reach and kill a deal.  And the rate increases this year have been substantial.  Consider, for example, that the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose from 3.79% in January to 5.3% in July.  This change would increase a monthly payment approximately $90 for every $100,000 borrowed.


The places with the highest percentage of deals failed in June – including many in the south and southwest – are among the most popular with buyers.  In Las Vegas, just over 27% of trades failed in June, the highest rate of any market, according to Redfin.  Preferred Florida destinations followed, including Lakeland, Florida at just under 27% and Cape Coral, Florida at just under 26%.


This week’s chart shows the US metropolitan markets where the highest share of trades failed in June.

I’m a librarian in my late twenties, and due to a wave of retirements, I’ve risen through the ranks very quickly.  My supervisors like me and I recently applied and was offered a job that puts me in charge of my own library.  It’s just another person and myself working there.  The other librarian has been in the business almost as long as I’ve been alive, and I know she applied for the job.
It created some awkwardness and that’s something we didn’t discuss.  We barely talk to each other.  She was very surprised and upset that she was not chosen for the job.  I think she can eve…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the summer sun is blazing, the mere idea of ​​turning on the oven – even for the most wonderful dish – is revolting.  Sure, you might have air conditioning, but why heat the kitchen if it’s not necessary?  (You came inside to escape the stickiness and sweat!) You could cleverly put together a salad or put together a meal without cooking – and we have so many beautiful ones here and here – but ultimately, you’re going to want a hot meal.  Enter the slow cooker.
The recipes below are the simplest type of slow cooker recipe, the fix and forget type.  There’s no pre-searing or sautéing, and very little prep.  Just throw the ingredients in the slow cooker and let it simmer while you head to the beach or to work, or just curl up with a good book in front of the air conditioner.  A few hours…]]></summary>

Then on Friday, New York City health officials announced they had found the virus in sewage samples, suggesting polio was likely circulating in the city again. 
Parents of young children have wondered —  perhaps for the first time in their lives and collectively for the first time in generations — how worried they should be about polio.
Anabela Borges, a designer who lives in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood, said she has friends whose children are likely unvaccinated.  After Friday’s announcement, she said she planned to “raise awareness among her friends.”

Her Seattle Storm teammate Natasha Howard had preceded her as a wide receiver, as she usually did whenever Bird was leading the offense in transition.  Howard realized it was open under the basket and stiffened.  Bird, she knew, would find her as always.  She just didn’t know how.
Bird slipped into the lane, drawing in a defender.  Then, without looking, she whipped the ball above his head and in Howard’s waiting palms.
“My hands were always ready for Sue when she passed the ball to me,” said Howard, now with the Liberty.  She added, “It’s just there, it’s like, ‘Wow, OK, Sue. You’ve got eyes in the back of your head.'”

On Monday, 30 booted cretins from the FBI violated this fundamental principle of a free society when they besieged to the former president that of Donald Trump Mar-a-Lago mega mansion golf resort to search for such materials.

Wright designed the house for him before his death in 1959, making it one of his last works, although it was erected posthumously. 
For 48 years, Fawcett remained the sole owner of the property.  After his death in 2009, Fawcett Farm was listed for the first time.  In 2012, its new owners undertook a thorough and ultimately award-winning restoration of the property with the help of…]]></summary>

President Joe Biden bragged about the report listing those cost increases on Wednesday, saying inflation was “zero percent” for July, a claim repeated or slightly modified and repeated by most media outlets.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures released Wednesday are calculated and released, as economic data always is, taking into account a variety of factors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ancient NFL linebacker Channing Crowder is right when he says    this Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson is a square.

Wilson loves his wife, the Bible and his children.  He’s one of the best players in the NFL, listens to smooth R&B, and was once married to a woman who made this face when he was drafted.

He also recently got out of his truck wearing his own NFL jersey on a casual day. 

So, yes, he is absolutely a square, at least in the sense of being someone who is not “cool” or “in the know”.  Wilson and “knowledge” are not friends;  even if he had the help of a GPS, I don’t think Wilson could find “knowledge”.  (Crowder also referred to Wilson as “lame”, which has much the same meaning but has the advantage of also being a ableist insult.)

The Cases in Which Artificial Intelligence Saved Our Lives
The world learned about Artificial Intelligence, or AI, as the way to make machines play chess better than people. Spielberg’s movie with the same name was more fantasy than science fiction. It was called “Artificial Intelligence”. Even so, there has been a lot of talk in the past few years about this technology and parts […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To hear the voices of older Americans facing high drug costs month after month is to hear fear and worry, anger and stress.  Many say they’re figuring out how to get by, skipping vacations and other niceties they’ve been saving up for.
For Kim Armbruster, 65, who recently retired from a 40-year career as a nurse, cut costs for her medications for diabetes, psoriatic arthritis and Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disease affecting the thyroid , has been a rush since she started receiving Medicare.  in March.
Ms Armbruster, of Cary, Illinois, said she saved extra insulin on prescriptions filled when she had commercial insurance, enough to cut costs before a monthly cap took effect.  But his other conditions caused immense financial pressure.
By June, she had reached Medicare’s threshold for catastrophic coverage after paying more than $7,000 for Enbrel, a drug she takes for arthritis;  Synthroid, which she takes for Graves’ disease;  Eliquis, for atrial fibrillation, insulin and its insulin pump.
“It’s about thinking ahead, looking for alternatives and strategizing for the home budget so that you can take the necessary medications,” she said.  Learning to cope with costs, she added, has been like “a baptism by fire, learning everything I can possibly learn about managing drug costs and staying healthy without complications.”
The drug carousel taken by Mr Spring, the dementia patient who died in April, included sky-high prices for drugs including Eliquis, for heart disease, and Namenda, an Alzheimer’s drug.  Mr. Spring also took an antidepressant and medication to lessen the side effects of Namenda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent real estate roller coaster is finally heading in a beneficial direction for buyers.
After report on report On the national housing shortage, the tide has finally turned: According to data from last month, active listing inventory across America has grown more than 30% since 2021 — a record growth rate. 
This is according to Realtor.com July Housing Market Reportwhich further found that July marked the third consecutive month of unprecedented inventory growth rates. 
“Nationally, the inventory of homes actively for sale on a typical day in July has increased 30.7% over the past year, the largest increase in inventory in history. data and higher than last month’s growth rate of 18.7%, which was itself a record.”, notes the July report. In terms of the number of listings, this means that potential buyers saw 176,000 homes more when researched last month than they would have had in 2021. 
	
The increase in the number of available homes – the first of its kind since September 2019 – is a sign that the housing market “continues to move towards more balance”, with buyers now having more options available to them, analyzes The report. 
“With increased inventory, buyers will have more bargaining power,” Realtor Chief Economist Danielle Hale told Bloomberg, adding that the benefits of the pandemic are now a thing of the past for owners.  “The two years of a strong market tilt in favor of sellers appear to be in the rearview mirror.”
The record trend and breath of relief for buyers, however, coincides with median asking prices that remain breathtaking: In June, the nationwide median list price was $449,000, a 17% increase from 2021 and closest to the highest ever reached.  , reported Bloomberg. 
Rising mortgage rates have also had a significant impact and chilling effect on the market recently.
