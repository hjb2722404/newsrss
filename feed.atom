        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has extended her lead over fellow candidate Rishi Sunak in the bid for UK’s top job as prime minister after a poll of Conservative Party members revealed she was the strong favourite. 

The poll showed 62 per cent of Tory members would vote for Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and 38 per cent would go for Mr Sunak.  

“The thing about me is what you see is what you get,” Ms Truss said. 

“I’ve always been honest with people about what I can deliver, I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I will completely level with the public about, first of all, how tough things are going to be. 

“But also, the hope that they can have about the future because I have a positive vision for Britain, and I will be helping families immediately with the cost of living.”]]></summary>

Sputnik: Scoop: NATO Doesn’t Trust Ukraine With HIMARS, Operating Advanced Artillery Themselves, Source Says 
The US has delivered 12 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine, and the Pentagon announced Wednesday that Washington would soon send at least four more in the near future. The Russian military and the Donbass People’s Militias have accused Kiev of using the installations to strike civilian areas. 
The HIMARS mobile artillery operating Ukraine are manned by outstaffed career NATO military personnel, and information regarding the advanced weapons systems’ operation is not being transferred to the Ukrainian side due to a lack of trust, a Russian security source has told Sputnik, citing intelligence received from sources inside the Ukrainian military.

WNU Editor: A lot of bombshells in the above report. 
NATO does not trust Ukraine to operate these weapons. Manned by "out-staffed career NATO military personnel?!?!?!? Guarded by private military contractors close to the Pentagon?!?!?! Targets are being selected by US intelligence and US military personnel. 
I do not know if this report is true, but Russian media and the Russian government do believe it is true. That NATO is now directly engaged on the ground against Russian forces in Ukraine.]]></summary>

Foreign crude sales could be suspended if US-driven scheme succeeds, top official says 
 Russia will stop global oil exports if the West’s proposed price cap makes it unprofitable to continue production, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday.

WNU Editor: Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak's background is in the energy industry. In Russia his word is gospel when it comes to energy issues.

Pelosi is now the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the war, with the surprise visit adding to the growing momentum behind the West’s support for the country's fight against Russia.

Politico: Pelosi to Blinken: Label Russia as terrorist state, or else Congress will  
Her comments highlight the chasm in the actions lawmakers want the administration to take and what the secretary is comfortable doing.  
Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a message for Secretary of State Antony Blinken: Designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism — otherwise, Congress will. 
The warning, made on a call between the two earlier this week, was described to POLITICO by two sources familiar with the conversation. Spokespersons for the State Department and Pelosi’s office declined to comment. 
Congress gave the power to label another country as a state sponsor of terrorism to the secretary of state. Some in Congress, though, say lawmakers could pass a law to make the designation without the State Department, thus pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin on their own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla said on Wednesday that second-quarter profits fell nearly a third from the first quarter as deliveries slowed due to shutdowns and shortages of raw materials at the automaker’s Shanghai plant.
Profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, Tesla said, up from $3.3 billion in the first quarter, which was a record.  Sales fell to $16.9 billion from $18.8 billion in the first quarter.
The automaker was also hit by a sharp drop in Bitcoin price.  Tesla said in early 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency.  The company said on Wednesday that it had sold around 75% of its Bitcoin by the end of June.


Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profit almost doubled.  And earnings for the quarter beat analysts’ estimates.  But because Tesla is a fast-growing company, its progress, o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wall Street’s most talked about recession indicator is sounding its loudest alarm in two decades, heightening investor concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.
This indicator is called the yield curve, and it is a way of showing how the interest rates of various US government bonds compare., including three-month treasury bills and two- and ten-year treasury bills.
Usually, bond investors expect to be paid more for tying up their money for a long time, so interest rates on short-term bonds are lower than those on longer-term bonds.  Plotted on a graph, the different bond yields create an upward sloping line – the curve. 


But from time to time, short-term rates exceed long-term rates.  This negative relationship distorts the curve into what is called an inversion and signals that the norm…]]></summary>

Mattarella branded the move "inevitable" following the political upheaval faced by the European Union's third largest economy over the last 24 hours.

If polls continue to hold, it looks like this group will take power, and if they do it will be a geo-political earthquake for Italy and in the EU as a whole .... Italy’s far right celebrate Draghi’s downfall and look poised to take power (The Guardian).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Are you sure you want to run again Joe? Biden's national approval rating nosedives to 31% and hits the lowest in Iowa of any President in history at 27%: More disastrous polls show more than 70% of Americans DON'T want him to run in 2024 
* Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove 
* A whopping 71 percent of Americans do not want to see Biden run again in 2024 - including a majority of Democrats, 54 percent 
* The findings contrast with support for Donald Trump on the Republican side - 69 percent of Republicans said they want to see him run again in 2024 
* Republicans in Congress scored even worse than Biden by the Quinnipiac poll, where 23 percent of respondents approved, 68 percent disapproved 
More Americans are unhappy with President Biden's job in office than at any point in his presidency, according to a dim new Quinnipiac poll. 
Just 31 percent of adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency while 60 percent disapprove. 
Among registered voters, 33 percent said they approved while 59 percent disapprove.   The low approval spelled bad news for Biden's 2024 prospects.

WNU Editor: The poll is here .... Biden Approval Hits New Low Amid Public Discontent With Both Parties, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Nearly Half Of Americans Worry About Being Mass Shooting Victim (Quinnipiac). 
What caught my eye in this poll is that Congressional Democrats ( a negative 30 - 63 percent job approval rating) are polling better than Congressional Republicans (a negative 23 - 68 percent job approval rating). Maybe the Democrats will keep control of Congress after this year's midterms?]]></summary>

ABC News Australia: CIA estimates about 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine war  
Around 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and a further 45,000 have been wounded in the war in Ukraine, the United States believes. 
CIA director William Burns said Russia's efforts to occupy about a fifth of Ukraine had come at a great cost for both countries. 
"The latest estimates from the US intelligence community would be something in the vicinity of 15,000 [Russian forces] killed, and maybe three times that wounded," he said.

WNU Editor: The CIA Director gives out the Russian casualty number, but he admits in his interview that this is an estimate, and no one really knows what the real number. Translation. He does not know. 
The BBC did a thorough analysis on the number of Russian military casualties a few weeks ago, and their estimate is around 4,000 .... War in Ukraine: Can we say how many people have died? (BBC). This number does not included casualties among Chechen and separatist forces (who have been doing a great deal of the ground fighting since April). 
My sources in Russia tell me that the BBC number is about right, and if you include Chechen and separatist forces the number is around 10,000. 
Ukraine also does not report its casualties. But the numbers that I hear from my sources in Ukraine that I trust are shocking, and I am going to wait until there is an official statement before posting it here.

William Burns' comment is a blow to Putin's critics who believed the Russian leader was ill.   Vladimir Putin is “entirely too healthy,” CIA Director William Burns said Wednesday, throwing cold water on constant rumors that the Russian president is suffering from illness as he pursues his war on Ukraine. 
Burns, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, noted that his declaration was “not a formal intelligence judgment.” Still, given his position, Burns’ comment could help dampen hopes among Putin’s adversaries that the Russian’s demise is near.

During his remarks, President Biden was describing the fumes emitted from the oil refineries near his childhood home in Claymont, Delaware.

"That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer and why for the longest time Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation,” President Biden said.

The White House was forced to make a quick clarification, stating that Mr Biden was referring to the non-melanoma skin cancers he had removed before his presidency.]]></summary>

However, the decision has not gone down well with protesters.  

Many in Sri Lanka consider Mr Wickremesinghe as a close associate of the Rajapaksa family, who they blame for the country’s economic crisis. 

On the spot where presidents are normally sworn in, protest leaders demanded Mr Wickremesinghe’s removal.  

“We will not stop this protest until Ranil Wickremesinghe is stepped down from the presidency and we get a president … the whole country can accept as one president,” a protester said.]]></summary>

Mr Biden was discussing the effects of oil refinery emissions when he indicated he had cancer.

“The fact that he said he had cancer very clearly too, I think, is part of a general decline of his cognitive ability,” Mr Creighton told Sky News Australia. 

“In the 14-15 months I’ve been following his remarks closely, it’s getting worse and worse.”]]></summary>

* The plan asks the 27 EU nations to cut their gas consumption by 15% between 1 August 2022 and 31 March 2023. 
* The plan comes as Russia’s energy giant Gazprom claims it cannot fulfill gas contracts with the bloc.

WNU Editor: The situation is becoming incredibly difficult in Europe. Implementing a 15% reduction in the consumption of natural gas will not only be difficult to maintain, but near impossible if Europe experiences a severe and cold winter.

* Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin met face-to-face in Iran on Tuesday 
* It was the first meeting between the two leaders since war in Ukraine started 
* But Erdogan kept Putin waiting for 48 seconds in what appeared to be a snub 
* Putin was 'humiliated', Ukraine foreign ministry adviser said, while others said it showed how far his standing has fallen since the war 
Vladimir Putin was snubbed by Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who left him twiddling his thumbs in front of TV cameras during a summit in Iran yesterday. 
The Russian leader was holding face-to-face talks with his sometimes-ally in Tehran on Tuesday for the first time since ordering the invasion of Ukraine back in February. 
 But he was left waiting for a toe-curling 48 seconds in front of the world's press as Erdogan failed to arrive on time for a hand-shaking photo-op.

Update #1: Erdoğan keeps Putin waiting in awkward moment ahead of Tehran talks (The Guardian) Update #2: Fidgety Putin kept waiting for Erdogan ahead of talks (Euronews)   
WNU Editor: Putin has a history of making leaders wait. But he has also waited for leaders. I recall a decade ago he was waiting 5 minutes for his friend and Italian leader Berlusconi.]]></summary>

 (Bloomberg) -- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said geopolitics today requires “Nixonian flexibility” to help defuse conflicts between the US and China as well as between Russia and the rest of Europe. 
While warning that China shouldn’t become a global hegemon, the man who helped reestablish US-China ties in the 1970s said that President Joe Biden should be wary of letting domestic politics interfere with “the importance of understanding the permanence of China.” 
“Biden and previous administrations have been too much influenced by the domestic aspects of the view of China,” Kissinger, 99, said in an interview Tuesday in New York with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “It is, of course, important to prevent Chinese or any other country’s hegemony.”

WNU Editor: The Biden administration is not listening to what Henry Kissinger is saying. But China is listening .... Kissinger warns Biden on China ties amid Washington's enhanced provocations against Beijing; consequences would be 'fatal, unbearable' for Biden (Global Times). 
As to what is may take. 
 Henry Kissinger should also issue the same warning to Beijing.]]></summary>

(CNN)China warned Tuesday it would take "resolute and forceful measures" if US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan, in what would be the highest-level delegation from the United States to the self-governing island in 25 years. 
Pelosi, who is second in line of succession to the US presidency, has reportedly outlined plans to take a delegation to Taipei in August, according to the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Pelosi's office declined to comment on her travel plans.  August 1 is the anniversary of the founding of China's People's Liberation Army.

Sri Lanka's parliament has chosen six-time Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as president to succeed the ousted leader who fled the country amid an economic crisis. 
"I thank parliament for this honour," the 73-year-old said after his victory was announced by the secretary-general of the legislature. 
He secured 134 votes in the 225-member house, while his main rival, ruling party politician Dullas Alahapperuma, got 82. 
The Marxist candidate, Anura Dissanayake, won three votes.  Mr Wickremesinghe became acting president after Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week and resigned by email.

DNYUZ/New York Times: Putin signals Russian gas will resume in a key pipeline but at a reduced level. 
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested late Tuesday that natural gas would resume flowing to Europe after the Nord Stream 1 pipeline’s maintenance shutdown, but warned that supplies may be severely curtailed. 
Speaking to reporters in Tehran after meeting with the leaders of Iran and Turkey, Mr. Putin said that shipments via Nord Stream 1 had been hampered by repairs necessary for turbines made by the German company Siemens. 
Even before the pipeline was shut down on July 11 for annual maintenance, flows from Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, had been reduced to only 40 percent capacity.

Ukraine wants to be an arena in which more-powerful nations prove out weapons in real-world combat against Russian forces.   Ukraine is openly offering itself as a venue for NATO allies to donate and demonstrate advanced weaponry in real-world combat scenarios. 
The countries would then benefit from the combat experience of Ukrainian soldiers using those weapons against Russian forces, according to Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.  Ukraine “is essentially a testing ground,” Reznikov said on July 19 during a live webcast conversation with John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center. 
The entire interview can be viewed in the below video.

More mobile artillery rocket systems, drones, and longer-range rockets would be a “game changer” said top Ukrainian defense official. 
The recent addition of new long-range fires capabilities to Ukraine’s arsenal has played a key role in defending against stalled Russian forces. 
But additional mobile rocket batteries and longer-range rockets would allow Ukraine to mount more effective counter attacks and reclaim territory stolen by Russia, Oleksii Reznikov, minister of defense of Ukraine, said Tuesday. 
Ukraine currently has eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, able to strike ranges of 85 kilometers or 52 miles, as well asf Howitzer cannons with a range of 18 miles. Another four HIMARS are on the way as of last week, according to the Defense Department, and the White House expects to announce another shipment later this week. 
Speaking at an Atlantic Council event Tuesday, Reznikov said the HIMARS had already helped Ukraine destroy approximately 30 Russian command stations, as well as ammunition storage areas.

Daily Mail: Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Ukraine and the West will face a 'Judgement Day' response should they attempt to militarily dispute Russia's control of Crimea. 
* Medvedev said a Western or Ukrainian attack on Crimea would see a major retort 
* Russia illegally annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 
* 'Judgement Day come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide,' he said 
* Comments came a day after a Ukrainian military intelligence official said Kyiv could hit targets in Crimea with U.S.-made HIMARS missiles 
Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Ukraine and the West will face a 'Judgement Day' response should they attempt to militarily dispute Russia's control of Crimea. 
The refusal of Ukraine and Western powers to recognise Moscow's ownership of the peninsula poses a 'systemic threat' for Russia, the former president said yesterday, before declaring the Kremlin would hit back with maximum force if the territory is attacked. 
'Judgement Day come very fast and hard. It will be very difficult to hide,' he announced, according to Russia's TASS news agency.

WNU Editor: The Kremlin believes the US has given the green light to Ukraine to attack targets in Crimea. If this is true, and Ukraine does launch such attacks, to me it is a given that Russia is going to respond massively.

Reuters: Ukraine wants to avoid winter war, says top presidential aide  
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's top presidential aide said on Tuesday that Ukraine does not want the war to last into winter, as this would give Russian forces time to dig in and make any Ukrainian counter-offensive more difficult. 
 In an interview with Ukrainian magazine NV, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak expressed hopes that the U.S. arms lend-lease to Ukraine will provide a sufficient quantity of weapons before winter to allow Ukrainian troops to achieve "victory" before then. 
"It is very important for us not to enter the winter. After winter, when the Russians will have more time to dig in, it will certainly be more difficult," Yermak said.

There are also a lot of reports (from the Ukrainian side) that the U.S. has indicated to Kyiv that should the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk fall, followed by the fall of Donetsk oblast, Washington will be re-evaluating its commitment to supporting Ukraine in this war. 
This probably explains why Ukrainian President Zelensky has ordered  the town of Siversk, which Russia needs to capture Donetsk, to be hold at all costs. Needless to say I have been hearing and reading of heavy loses for the Ukrainians in their attempt to hold onto this piece of territory.
Russia is also intensifying their attacks in the southern part of Ukraine, with heavy casualties being reported on both sides.]]></summary>

Listening to television commentary and interviews of retired U.S. generals, one would be forgiven for believing Russia is on the ropes, and Ukraine was winning the war. Looking at on-the-ground battlefield reality in Ukraine, however, it quickly becomes apparent that the generals’ boasts continue a decade-long trend of rosy combat proclamations that all too often turn out to be disastrously wrong. American media, Congress, and the public need to start applying a little more scrutiny to what these officers say.

WNU Editor: The best part of this commentary is the last paragraph .... 
.... The danger in these types of statements is that they give false hope to the people of Ukraine, give an inaccurate picture to the American people of what’s possible, and encourages Congress to continue funding a strategy that almost certainly will fail.

Reuters: EU to Soften Sanctions on Russian Banks to Allow Food Trade 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will amend its sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday by allowing the unfreezing of some funds of top Russian banks that may be required to ease bottlenecks in the global trade of food and fertilisers, a draft document showed. 
The move comes amid criticism from African leaders about the negative impact of the sanctions on the trade, which may have exacerbated shortages chiefly caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its blockading of ports in the Black Sea.

Update #2: EU to soften sanctions on Russian banks to allow food trade (FOX News)   
WNU Editor: This is a major reversal of sanctions, and one that I ma sure Ukraine is not happy with. 
So why the move to help Russian banks now? 
IMHO the "softening" of these sanctions is to not only to allow the trade of food and fertilizer, but to also dissuade any Russian move to make customers for its food and fertilizers pay in rubles thereby undermining the value of the euro even further.]]></summary>

Five outfielders finished ahead of him in the ballot, with Ronald Acuña Jr., Mookie Betts and Joc Pederson taking the starting spots.
