   WNU Editor: This story is making the rounds in both Russian and Ukrainian social media .... The Kremlin's chief propagandist Solovyov exposed Zelensky's "double" - bodyguard Maksym (TSN.ua). 
The use of "doppelgangers" by leaders during wartime is nothing new. So the possibility that one of President Zelensky's personal bodyguards looks like him should surprise no one. 
As for Putin. Western media has been speculating for years that Putin uses "doppelgangers" .... Putin has 'doppelgänger on standby' in case he's 'unable to fulfil engagements' (Metro).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lack of women nominees was a talking point on Friday at the Cesar Awards, France's answer to the Oscars, despite the top prize going to a film focusing on femicide.
Best Film went to "The Night of the 12th", a thriller based on the true story of a young woman's murder. 
There was a spot of Hollywood glitz thanks to a surprise cameo by Brad Pitt, presenting David Fincher (who directed him in "Fight Club" and "Seven") with a lifetime achievement award. 
But there was a lot of focus on the lack of female nominees, with no women up for best director -- indeed, none have won the award since 2000 (Tonie Marshall for "Venus Beauty Institute").
The only woman filmmaker whose movie was in the running for best film was Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, sister of France's former first lady and singer Carla…]]></summary>

It was the first commemoration of the uprising since Marcos Jr took office in June 2022. He has praised his father's 20-year regime, which critics describe as a dark period of human rights abuses and corruption that left the country impoverished.
As leftist rock music blared over a loudspeaker, hundreds of protesters, including survivors of the elder Marcos's martial law crackdown that led to the killing, torture and imprisonment of thousands of political foes and critics, marched on the "People Power" monument in Manila in memory of the brutal era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US First Lady Jill Biden arrived in Kenya on Friday, kicking off a visit aimed at focusing attention on the worst drought to hit the Horn of Africa in decades.
Five straight seasons of poor rainfall have killed millions of livestock, destroyed crops and left some 22 million people at risk of hunger in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, with a sixth season also forecast to fail.
Biden travelled to Kenya from Namibia, part of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent, which has become a renewed diplomatic battleground following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.
The first senior White House official to travel to the region since her husband President Joe Biden came to power, the 71-year-old community college professor's visit will also focus on the empowerment of women and youth.

The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Biden said his country was "all in" on the hotly courted continent.
During her visit to Namibia, Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies.
"We're committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners," Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek on Thursday.
This is Biden's first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

"There's no business at the market. We've all just been sitting here since the morning," said market trader Ishola as she sat outside her stall selling beads and jewelry. "There's no people. Do you see anybody around? Nobody."
Across the street, another trader, named Kabiru, sat looking forlorn behind a case of unsold watches.

Wilson is a scathing critic of the MAGA movement, and the affinity that so many MAGA Republicans have for Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of the reasons why he holds Trumpism in such low regard.
It was a year ago, on February 24, 2022, that Russian forces acting on orders from Putin launched a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. That war has brought the worst fighting in Europe since World War 2, yet Putin's admirers in the MAGA movement haven…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan's military said it alerted aviation authorities after spotting a balloon floating in its airspace Friday, one week after the self-ruled island found remnants of what was believed to be a crashed Chinese meteorological instrument.
According to its initial analysis, the air force said the object in "northern airspace" on Friday afternoon was for meteorological and scientific research purposes.
"As it could affect aviation safety, we have notified the aviation control units to remind air planes to beware," the air force statement said.
"We will continue to monitor until the target disappears."
The statement did not say where the balloon came from or provide a more detailed location.
The sighting comes after an order by President Joe Biden to shoot down what the United States has since called a "sophisticated high-altitude spying vehicle" that sparked the latest row between Washington and Beijing.
US officials said it was part of a fleet allegedly floating around the globe, while China has said the balloon was an errant weather observation aircraft with no military purpose. Both sides have since accused each other of espionage.
Taiwan, a self-governed democracy claimed by China, said last week that it had found the remains of a suspected Chinese meteorological balloon and would increase patrols at military facilities.
Taiwan's defence ministry revealed on February 14 that Chinese balloons have previously flown over the island, without providing details on the number or frequency.
At that time, the ministry said it would shoot down any targets that pose a "high level of threat", but added that it had not encountered any such threats.
Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure in recent years on Taiwan, which China has vowed to seize one day, by force if necessary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential term, provisional data showed Friday.
Surveillance satellites had detected 209 square kilometers (80.6 square miles) of forest destroyed,, according to the INPE space research institute's DETER monitoring system.
This is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.
The INPE report included data only up to February 17, but was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.
Last month, Amazon deforestation was down 61 percent from a year earlier, according to the same source.
But experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a "reversal" of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.
The February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.
Over Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade.
Bolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.
Having previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula took office on January 1 this year with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro.
He has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.
In order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors.

Six graphics illustrate the extraordinary level of support the United States has provided Ukraine this past year in its war against Russian invaders.  
Every year, the United States sends billions of dollars in aid—and much more than any other country—to beneficiaries around the world in pursuit of its security, economic, and humanitarian interests. 
Heading into 2022, U.S. foreign assistance was driven by various priorities of the Biden administration, including combating climate change, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and countering authoritarianism. But since Russia’s invasion in February of that year, Ukraine has become far and away the top recipient of U.S. foreign aid. It’s the first time that a European country has held the top spot since the Harry S. Truman administration directed vast sums into rebuilding the continent through the Marshall Plan after World War II.

Originally from New Zealand, the "kunekune" pigs -- a Maori word meaning "round and fat" -- snuffle through the earth supporting neatly planted rows of grapevines.
Their "thorough" and "precise" work can fight weeds as well as mildew and other fungi and aerate the soil, says wine industry consultant Olivier Zebic.
First tested last year in the Bordeaux wine-growing region, the pigs may be a better choice than the other eco-friendly solution, sheep -- who "just trim" unwanted plants, Zebic adds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Emmanuel Macron was under fire from the French left on Friday for handing billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos the country's highest order of merit.
Critics said the award showed Macron really was "the president of the rich" as he is regularly labelled by members of the opposition.
Macron's office on Friday confirmed a press report from a day earlier, saying Bezos had been given the Legion d'Honneur (Legion of Honour), the French republic's highest award, in a small ceremony.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States marked the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Friday with new sanctions, export controls and tariffs against Russia and its allies aimed at undermining Moscow's ability to wage war. 
Washington also said it would provide another $2 billion in weaponry for Kyiv as it prepares for a spring offensive. The aid did not include F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested. 
President Joe Biden consulted leaders of the G7 bloc of wealthy nations and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy to discuss more aid.

WNU Editor: Countries and middlemen are making a fortune by evading/ignoring Russian sanctions to sell their resources to nations that need it. They are not going to stop, and these sanctions are not going to impact the bottom line of the Russian economy. 
The only way these sanctions can work ifs if you blockade Russian ports and seize ships that are carrying Russian resources. But such actions will not only mean a direct war against Russia, but also a breakdown in relations with countries that are dependent on Russian resources (China and India to name a few).

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Fully Reopens Crimea Bridge to Cars on Eve of Anniversary 
Moscow on Thursday announced the full reopening to road traffic of the controversial Crimea Bridge, which has been closed and under repair since it was badly damaged in an explosion in October. 
The announcement came on the eve of the first anniversary of the Russian offensive in Ukraine, with both Moscow and Kyiv keen to control the narrative and project images of victory. 
Moscow has always blamed Kyiv for the attack on the bridge, which links the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula to mainland Russia and is known to be a prestige project for Russian President Vladimir Putin personally. Kyiv has always denied its involvement in the attack, however. 
 "All lanes of the Crimean bridge are fully open to car traffic 39 days ahead of schedule," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said, according to his press service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko has spoken of a "tragic and psychologically exhausting" year, on the anniversary of the start of Russia's war against Ukraine.
"But we are fighting, we believe in ourselves and in our country. That is why we will overcome everything and win," he wrote on his Telegram channel on Friday, alongside a video message.
While many Ukrainians had not believed there would be a "barbaric war" by Russia, the capital had been preparing for a possible attack, he said.
"Volunteers who joined the territorial defence and our military helped to protect and hold the capital."
Russian troops advanced into the suburbs of Kiev after the war began on February 24, but did not get far.
"Kiev is the heart of Ukraine, Kiev was and remains a target of Russia, of the Russians and of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin," Klitschko told dpa in an interview on Wednesday.
At the same time, he said he did not believe Russia could succeed in a new attack on the capital. "I don't think Russia will win."]]></summary>

The bloc chose economic ruin to be a vassal of the US, Moscow’s envoy to the UN has said  
Relations between the European Union and Russia are practically nonexistent, consumed by the abyss of EU subservience to the US, the Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on Thursday. 
Moscow had said in June 2022 that the “bottom had fallen out” when it came to relations with Brussels, Nebenzia said in his speech at the UN. 
“It turns out there was an entire abyss below still, that swallowed up not only our relations – which are basically nonexistent now – but also the EU itself,” he said. 
“A year after completely severing ties with our country, the GDP growth of the EU has stuck near zero. At the same time, record inflation rates are measured by double-digit indicators. Rejoicing that it jumped off the ‘Russian gas needle,’ the EU got hooked on ‘hard drugs’ – expensive American liquefied natural gas,” the Russian diplomat added.

Less than 24 hours after claiming Ukraine is preparing to carry out a false-flag attack in Transnistria, Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Thursday evening that it had detected a “significant build-up” of Ukrainian troops and military vehicles near the “Ukrainian-Transnistrian border.” 
The operation that Moscow accused Ukraine of planning “poses a direct threat to the Russian peacekeeping force” in Transnistria, the Russian agency reported, vowing that Russia’s military will “respond appropriately” to the attack.

Reuters: Putin says Russia to deploy Sarmat nuclear missiles 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would pay increased attention to boosting its nuclear forces by deploying a much delayed new intercontinental ballistic missile, rolling out hypersonic missiles and adding new nuclear submarines. 
A year since ordering the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has signalled he is ready to rip up the architecture of nuclear arms control - including the big powers' moratorium on nuclear testing - unless the West backs off in Ukraine. 
Putin on Tuesday sought to underscore Russian resolve in Ukraine by suspending a landmark nuclear arms control treaty, announcing new strategic systems had been put on combat duty and warning that Moscow could resume nuclear tests.

The position paper issued by the Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Friday called for ending hostilities, protecting nuclear plants, resuming peace talks and eliminating unilateral sanctions — a provision the US has consistently rejected. 
“All parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive cease-fire,” the ministry said.

Over 75 years have passed since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and more than 12,000 nuclear warheads are still scattered across the world from silos in Montana to isolated corners of European airbases and even to the ocean depths where ballistic missile submarines lurk as a deterrent nearly impossible to detect. 
Hiroshima was the first of two atomic bombings in 1945 and it involved a 15-kiloton device while the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki three days later had a 22 kiloton yield. Modern nuclear warheads are far more powerful with the U.S. Trident missile yielding a 455 kiloton warhead while Russia's SS ICBM has an 800 kiloton yield.

* US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro voiced concern in remarks on Wednesday 
* Said China has 340 active warships, compared to about 280 for the US Navy 
* Claimed US naval shipyards can't match the output of Chinese ones 
The US Secretary of the Navy has raised the alarm that China's naval fleet surpasses America's in number of ships, and is growing faster than the US has current capacity to match. 
'It is no secret that the People's Republic of China seeks to upend our dominance on the oceans across the globe,' said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in remarks at the National Press Club in Washington DC on Wednesday. 
Del Toro said that China's navy has recently added over one hundred combatants to its fleet, calling it 'a naval buildup that is a key component of its increasingly aggressive military posture globally.'

“I want to pay tribute to the courage and resilience and determination of the people of Ukraine, led by President Zelenskyy and with such courage, who withstood an invasion by a much larger and more powerful country," Mr Albanese said on Friday.

"They have made enormous sacrifice, a sacrifice in lives, a sacrifice in infrastructure, a sacrifice in their standard of living.

"And yet they have stood tall ... not just in their interest but in the interests of all who hold democratic values so clearly around the world.

“That is why Australia continues to stand with the people and government of Ukraine”.]]></summary>

(Bloomberg) -- The US and South Korea held discussions over ways they would respond to possible nuclear attacks by North Korea, which has been steadily building up its capability to deliver a credible atomic strike against the two. 
The so-called table-top exercise held in Washington focused on hypothetical scenarios of North Korea’s use of nuclear weapons, the Pentagon said in a statement late Thursday. They were the first of their sort since South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol took office about a year ago and bolstered joint military exercises with the US, a move that angered Pyongyang and led it to step up its provocations. 
“Both sides discussed various options to demonstrate the Alliance’s strong response capabilities and resolve to respond appropriately to any DPRK nuclear use,” the Defense Department said, referring to North Korea by its formal name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - The United States has transferred two brothers from the Guantanamo Bay U.S. detention facility in Cuba to Pakistan, bringing the total number of people held at Guantanamo down to 32, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
The Guantanamo camp was established by Republican President George W. Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.
It came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. "war on terror" because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.
There were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.
On Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.
Both were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon's website.
"The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility," the Pentagon said in a statement.
A total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.

Strategic cruise missiles hit a target after travelling 2,000km, says state media, to demonstrate ‘war posture’ of nuclear force
North Korea test-fired four strategic cruise missiles during a drill designed to demonstrate its ability to conduct a nuclear counterattack against hostile forces, its state media said. 
The exercise on Thursday involved an apparently operational strategic cruise missile unit of the Korean people’s army, which fired the four Hwasal-2 missiles in the area of Kim Chaek city, North Hamgyong province, towards the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, the news agency KCNA said. 
Other units conducted firepower training at hardened sites without live firing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French police on Thursday detained for questioning the husband of a woman whose dismembered body was found in plastic bags at different locations in a popular Paris park, a source close to the investigation told AFP.
The body parts of the woman had been discovered in the Buttes-Chaumont park in the north of the French capital earlier this month.
Prosecutors told AFP that an individual had been detained in the case but warned that no further information would be made public for now.
The discovery shocked residents of the capital where the park is hugely popular with joggers and families due to its unusually hilly landscaping.
The woman, 46, had been reported missing by her husband on February 6. The pair lived in the Seine-Saint-Denis department northeast of Paris, prosecutors said.
The Le Parisien daily, which first reported his detention, said that the couple had three children and the husband had only reported her disappearance a week after she vanished.
Police investigating the disappearance had not turned up any leads until now.
Park workers found the lower torso of a woman in a plastic bag hidden under leaves and further remains, including the head, were found during a thorough search of the park by police a day later.
French channel BFMTV had reported last week that the husband had come under suspicion in the investigation after giving contradictory evidence.
Prosecutors then launched another investigation into how this information had been leaked to the channel.
Built during the major relandscaping of the French capital under Napoleon III in the 19th century, the park most recently starred as the setting for a romantic picnic in the third series of "Emily in Paris".
It has also been a popular setting for classic French films ranging from Eric Rohmer's "The Aviator's Wife" to Gaspar Noe's more recent film "Love."

Moscow Times/AFP: G7 Presses IMF to Provide More Aid to Ukraine on Eve of Invasion Anniversary 
G7 finance chiefs pressed the IMF on Thursday to urgently provide more aid to war-stricken Ukraine on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion.
"On February 24 last year, Russia launched its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which is also an attack on the rule of law and the principles of the UN Charter," the G7 said in a statement issued by current chair Japan. 
After talks in India, the group urged the International Monetary Fund "to deliver a credible, ambitious, fully financed and appropriately conditioned IMF program by the end of March 2023." 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire previously said he wanted the IMF to provide $15 billion over four years.

The Kremlin strongman hoped to take the capital Kyiv in a few days and overthrow President Volodymyr Zelensky, without the West reacting. Far from being welcomed as liberators, the Russian soldiers were rapidly stopped and repelled. What was supposed to be a ‘blitzkrieg’ has turned into brutal trench warfare. Whole cities have been destroyed and millions of Ukrainians are now refugees. According to varying casualty tolls, tens or even hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or wounded on both sides. FRANCE 24 looks back at this brutal conflict.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Lady Jill Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies, as she visited Namibia on Thursday.
Biden arrived in the southern African country on Wednesday in the first stop of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent.
"We're committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners," Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek.
In the capital the 71-year-old community college professor met with President Hage Geingob and First Lady Monica Geingos. 
Africa has become a renewed diplomatic battleground, with countries aggressively courted by Russia, China and the West. 
Biden's trip is to focus on hunger in the Horn of Africa and the empowerment of women and youth.
On Friday, she will head to Kenya where she is to draw attention to the Horn of Africa's worst drought in decades, which has left more than 20 million people with acute food shortages.
The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Joe Biden said his country was "all in" on the hotly courted continent. 
This is Biden's first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

Legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso, whose death will be commemorated for the 50th time on April 8, is the focus of this year's Madrid Contemporary Art Fair ARCO. Ricardo Rubio/EUROPA PRESS/dpa
The legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year's ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.
The 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.
A hyper-realistic replica of Picasso's "corpse," wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.
Spanish artist Eugenio Merino's sensational sculpture, entitled "Aquí murió Picasso" (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso's native city of Málaga.
Long queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.
Many visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.
Alongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.
There is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is "The Mediterranean: A Round Sea."
A total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.]]></summary>

CNBC/Reuters: China and Japan square off over arms and balloons at first security talks in four years 
China said it was troubled by Japan’s military build up and Tokyo took aim at Beijing’s military ties to Russia and its suspected use of spy balloons during the Asian powers’ first formal security talks in four years on Wednesday. 
The talks, aimed at easing tensions between the world’s second- and third-largest economies, come as Tokyo worries that Beijing will resort to force to take control of Taiwan in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, sparking a conflict that could embroil Japan and disrupt global trade. 
Japan in December said it would double defense spending over the next five years to 2% of gross domestic product — a total of $320 billion — to deter China from resorting to military action. Beijing, which increased defense spending by 7.1% last year, spends more than four times as much as Japan on its forces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Commission on Thursday banned TikTok on official devices used by staff amid concerns over data protection as the EU seeks to bolster its cybersecurity.
TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is Chinese, has faced increasing Western scrutiny in recent months over fears about how much access Beijing has to user data.
The new ban also means European Commission staff cannot use the video-sharing app on personal devices including phones that have official EU communication apps installed.
Employees must remove the app as soon as possible and should do so by March 15.
EU spokeswoman Sonya Gospodinova said the corporate management board of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, had made the decision for security reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A six-decade archive charting pop icon David Bowie's career will open in London in 2025, providing a "new source book for the Bowies of tomorrow", a museum director said Wednesday.
Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Tristram Hunt said the "incredible" collection had more than 80,000 items of Bowie memorabilia.
They range from hand-written lyrics and letters to sheet music, original costumes, photography and album artwork.
A number of instruments owned by Bowie as well as music videos, set designs and awards are also due to go on display.
Bowie, originally from south London, died in 2016 at the age of 69.
The collection will be housed at the Bowie Centre for the Study of Performing Arts, a new outpost of London's Victoria and Albert Museum.
The museum was delighted to be become "custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public", said Hunt.
"Bowie's radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style -– from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monae to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons," he added.
Bowie enjoyed an extraordinary career generating around 140 million record sales and taking in styles from glam rock to jazz, as well as stage personas such as Ziggy Stardust.
The new centre will be located at the V&A East Storehouse venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.
The museum said this had been made possible through a £10 million (around $12 million) joint donation by the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.
Bowie's estate sold the publishing rights to his "entire body of work" to Warner last year.
The centre meant his life's work was now taking its "rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses", said a spokesperson from the David Bowie Estate.
The behind-the-scenes access the new venue offers "will mean David's work can be shared with the public in ways that haven't been possible before".

* Emily Kohrs has been giving clues about grand jury in series of interviews 
* She has been on a cable TV media tour touting her involvement in the case 
* Trump cited her and bashed Georgia's 'illegal Kangaroo Court' 
The forewoman on the Georgia grand jury that could indict Donald Trump laughed and said she 'kind of wanted' to subpoena him just to get the chance to swear him in – on a bizarre media tour that is already causing headaches for prosecutors. 
In just one of her multiple interviews about a usually shrouded process, forewoman Emily Kohrs told MSNBC why she personally wanted to hear from Trump.   'I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly, I wanted to subpoena the former president because I got to swear everybody in,' she said.
'And so I thought it would be really cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump, of me looking at him and be like, "Do you solemnly swear," and me getting to swear him in,' she continued.

* Trump praised the courage of local workers and law enforcement 
* Said they had been the victims of 'betrayal' and 'indifference' by those in power 
* He brought truckloads of water for the residents reeling from the derailment 
Donald Trump told residents of East Palestine they are victims of 'betrayal' by President Biden and the federal government, and said his visit finally sparked them to act during a tour of the toxic train derailment site on Wednesday. 
The former president greeted crowds furious at the lack of action from the White House, 19 days after the disaster in Ohio, and brought in thousands of bottles of his own water, cleaning supplies and canned food. 
He then stopped at a local McDonald's where he ordered Big Macs for first responders and members of his team, and handed out signed MAGA hats to the customers.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants.

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
