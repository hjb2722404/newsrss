RT: US military could create ‘global biological crisis’ – Russian MOD 
The Pentagon is especially interested in studying infections that could be used as weapons, Moscow has claimed 
The US military is studying pathogens that could be used as biological weapons as the nation prepares for a potential new pandemic, the commander of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, claimed on Wednesday. 
The list of diseases that have attracted the attention of US specialists includes anthrax, tularemia, and various coronaviruses, Kirillov told a media briefing. Some of these pathogens are listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as “high-priority” threats that can be used as “bioterrorism agents.”

However, the fear of failing to display loyalty to "our group" makes it controversial to condemn fascism. Are we then nazi apologists?
— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) August 17, 2023
  
The Grey Zone: Zelensky Holds Court With Ukraine's Most Notorious Neo-Nazi 
Western media has dismissed evidence of neo-Nazi influence in Ukraine by citing President Zelensky’s Jewish heritage. 
But new footage published by Zelensky shows the leader openly collaborating with a fascist ideologue who once pledged to “lead the white races of the world in a final crusade…against Semite-led Untermenschen.” 
Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky has uploaded a video to his Telegram channel showing him holding court with one of the most notorious neo-Nazis in modern Ukrainian history: Azov Battalion founder Andriy Biletsky.

 
Read more ....

 
WNU Editor: Patrick Lancaster has documented some of the war crimes committed by Azov in Mariupol last year (link here).

But here is the shocker. There are some who are even worse than Azov founder Andriy Biletsky. 

I am not surprised about the existence of these extremist groups. I have known about them for a long time, and I have documented some of them in the blog before this war started. 
But what catches my attention about this story is the Western media's coverage of these groups. In the case of the New York Times, they call this "complicated" .... Nazi Symbols on Ukraine’s Front Lines Highlight Thorny Issues of History (New York Times). 
Sighhh .... it is not complicated at all.  

Update: Check out Azov's emblem to the emblems that were used by German units in the Second World War (see picture below).]]></summary>

iNews: Russia puts captured Western tanks, howitzers, missiles, and drones on display at Moscow propaganda show

 
Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine had ‘debunked many myths about the superiority of Western military standards’ 
Russia has placed captured Western and Ukrainian weapons on display at a military expo in the Moscow region, including armoured vehicles, artillery guns, missiles, and drones. 
The annual event showcased more than 800 weapon types captured from the battlefield in Ukraine, Russian state media claimed.

Defence Minsister Sergei Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine had “debunked many myths about the superiority of Western military standards” in a speech at the expo. 
“We have data on… the destruction of German tanks, American armoured vehicles, British missiles and other weapons systems,” he said. “We are ready to share our assessments… with our partners.”

Newsweek: Ukraine Faces Major F-16 Jet Blow 
Ukraine will not receive F-16 fighter jets before next year, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson has said, as Kyiv's backers still hesitate to take the plunge on providing Ukraine with advanced Western jets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Biden turns to Camp David diplomacy for first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea  
President Joe Biden is using the presidential retreat at Camp David to help with a diplomatic mission – hosting the first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea, two countries that are putting aside a fraught history in the face of shared security challenges.
Biden’s summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is meant to serve as a show of force as the countries grapple with persistent provocative behavior from North Korea. It also comes as the president has sought to deepen ties with allies in the Indo-Pacific amid concerns about a rising China.

WNU Editor: China's position on this summit is clear .... US-Japan-South Korea summit to form 'destructive' mini NATO structure (Global Times). 
As to what is my take. 
This is all about optics. American media and the US foreign policy establishment are playing up this summit as a big event for President Biden. But I predict the only substantive thing that will be coming out of this summit will be a hotline .... U.S., Japan, South Korea to work toward security hotline at summit (Nikkei Asia). More here .... Biden to broker crisis hotline with Japan, South Korea (Axios).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US Army's 1st Infantry Division soldier trains on electronic-warfare equipment on September 6, 2019. US Army/Staff Sgt. Simon Mictizic
Insider: The US Army is rushing to rearm its electronic warriors after watching Russia and Ukraine jam each other's drones 
* Electronic warfare has played a prominent role during the war in Ukraine. 
* Ukraine and Russia are both using EW to interfere with each other's operations and aid their own.
* That has added urgency to the US Army's efforts to update its own EW weaponry. 
After years of neglecting electronic warfare, the US Army is rushing to revitalize its jamming capabilities. 
The catalyst is the Ukraine war, where cheap but plentiful drones are playing a vital — almost decisive — role, doing everything from spotting for artillery to destroying armored vehicles. 
At the same time, jamming has emerged as perhaps the most effective counter-drone weapon: Ukraine may be losing 10,000 drones a month — many to Russian electronic-warfare systems — while it strives to boost its jamming capabilities. Rather than using scarce and expensive antiaircraft missiles and guns to shoot down a drone that may cost only a few hundred dollars, it's easier to disrupt the link between the drone and its operator, causing it to crash.

A Hawaiian Studies major, Kaleo prefers a traditional, holistic "One Water" approach where water is revered, not used.

To do so, she surrounded herself with pragmatic politicians with government experience and set them to work.

ACCRA/NIAMEY (Reuters) -The West African bloc ECOWAS stands ready to intervene militarily in Niger should diplomatic efforts to reverse a coup there fail, a senior official told army chiefs who were meeting in Ghana on Thursday to discuss the details of a standby force. 
Niger military officers deposed President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26 and have defied calls from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him, prompting West African heads of state to order the standby force to be assembled. 
"Let no one be in doubt that if everything else fails, the valiant forces of West Africa...are ready to answer to the call of duty," ECOWAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security Abdel-Fatau Musah said.

Update #2: 'We are going into Niger' if all else fails: West Africa bloc (TRT)

 
WNU Editor: ECOWAS is an economic institution. Not a military alliance. 

Such an intervention can only occur if the US and France provide the logistical support to transport these Western African bloc forces into Niger. But many are already warning that such an intervention will only destabilize the entire region .... Russia warns of “protracted confrontation” if Ecowas invades Niger (Military Africa). 
As to what is my take. 
An intervention of this magnitude will only lay the groundwork for another failed state to develop in Africa. One only has to look across the Niger border to Libya to see what Western intervention in African affairs usually ends up as.,]]></summary>

More than one million people have fled Sudan to neighboring countries since April, according to the United Nations, as fighting between two warring factions plunges the country into civil war.
The conflict in Sudan has displaced more than 3.4 million people inside the country, a report released on Tuesday by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. 
Those who escaped Sudan have arrived in other countries in the region including Egypt, Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia. 
Heavy fighting broke out between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in mid-April, triggering a mass exodus of refugees from the East African country, where allied militias have been accused of killing civilians, ransacking houses and ethnic cleansing, leading to accusations of crimes against humanity.

TBILISI (Reuters) -Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month. 
The U.N. Security Council discussed the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a "genocide" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate. 
Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

The Guardian: Nato official apologises over suggestion Ukraine could give up land for membership

 
Secretary general’s chief of staff says statement was ‘mistake’ and part of wider discussion – but does not completely rule out idea 
A senior Nato official has apologised and clarified his comments a day after he said publicly that Ukraine could give up territory to Russia in exchange for Nato membership and an end to the war. 
Stian Jenssen, the chief of staff to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told a Norwegian newspaper that he should not have spoken as simplistically as he did, after his initial comments prompted an angry reaction from Kyiv. 
At a panel event in Norway on Tuesday, Jenssen had said that while any peace deal reached would have to be acceptable to Ukraine, alliance members were discussing how the 18-month war might be brought to an end.

The government said the decision was in response to changes in the geopolitical situation and threats to national security, as well as smuggling.

Tucker Carlson posted his latest episode on Monday, a roughly hour and a half sit-down with Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in which the two discussed a wide range of topics including Ukraine, bio-labs, and who is responsible for his uncle’s assassination. 
On the subject of bio-labs, the former Fox News host brought up how Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland acknowledged that Ukraine “has biological research facilities.” 
Carlson asked Kennedy why the U.S. would provide funds for such labs, prompting a lengthy explanation from the Democrat. 
“Because we’re developing bioweapons,” RFK Jr. claimed, before getting into the history of the move.

Moscow has claimed that two F-35 jets from the pro-American coalition came dangerously close to two Su-35 belonging to Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria on August 14, marking the latest episode in a series of confrontations between the US and Russian military aircraft. 
Deputy head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of the Warring Parties (CPVS) in Syria, Rear Admiral Vadim Kulit, alleged on August 15 that the incident occurred in the Al-Tanf area. 

Kulit highlighted that the Russian Su-35 fighter jets were conducting a prearranged flight along the southern border of Syria. 
“On August 14, from 12:35 to 12:50, in the Al-Tanf area at an altitude of about 9,100 meters, there was a dangerous rapprochement between two coalition F-35 fighters and two Su-35 aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces, which were making a planned flight along the southern border of Syria. Russian pilots, demonstrating high professionalism, took the necessary measures promptly to prevent a collision with coalition fighters,” he said.

Poland is holding its largest military parade in decades on Tuesday, in a flex of defensive muscle that comes as tensions rise on the border between the NATO nation and key Russian ally Belarus. 
Poland’s Defense Ministry said the celebration of Polish Army Day on Tuesday would be marked by a showcase that includes 200 units of Polish and foreign military equipment, 92 aircraft and 2,000 service members. 
The parade includes some of the latest technology Poland has in its arsenal, including US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, South Korean K2 tanks and K9 self-propelled howitzers, HIMARS rocket launchers, Krab self-propelled howitzers, as well as US-made Patriot missile batteries systems, which are part of the Polish “WISŁA” air defense system.

Zero Hedge: 'Raped And Pillaged': Maui Fire Survivors Describe Nighttime Looting, Botched Supply Drops 
The tragic disaster that we just witnessed in Hawaii should break all of our hearts. 

The death count just keeps going up, and it is being reported that these were the deadliest fires in the United States in more than 100 years. 
 In addition, Hawaii Governor Josh Green is telling us that this was actually “the largest natural disaster” that his state has ever experienced. 
More than 2,700 structures have been burned down in Lahaina alone, and it is being estimated that the value of the property that has been destroyed is over 5 billion dollars.

WNU Editor: I visited Maui in 2005. Even stayed at Lahaina for a day. When you have 2,700 structures destroyed in two days you are experiencing an incredible disaster. The lack of response from local, state, and federal offices does not surprise me. I am also not surprised that a lot of stories are not making the evening news. The optics of the government not responding adequately is something that the elites who govern us never want to be publicized.]]></summary>

* An engineering expert says the Russian air force is being depleted through overuse in Ukraine. 
* The arrival of Ukraine's F-16s could worsen the problem, wrote Rand's Michael Bohnert. 
* Ukraine says it urgently needs F-16s to reduce Russia's air dominance. 
Russia's fighter planes are malfunctioning because of overuse, handing Ukraine a potential advantage in its air battles against the Russian air force, an engineering expert said. 
In an article for Defense News, Michael Bohnert, an engineer at the Rand Corporation think tank, said that Russia's warplanes were running out of "aircraft life". 
"Overuse of these aircraft is also costing Russia as the war drags on," he wrote, adding that by his calculations as many as 57 Russian planes, many repurposed Soviet-era machines, might have been lost because they broke down since the start of the war.

* Fitch Ratings cut its assessment of the banking industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. 
* But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score from AA- to A+ would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC.

Reuters: US, South Korea, Japan to launch new defence steps at Camp David: Officials 
WASHINGTON – The United States, Japan and South Korea will launch a series of joint initiatives on technology, education and defence when the countries’ leaders gather at Camp David on Friday, according to senior US administration officials, amid mounting shared concerns about China. 
While the summit is unlikely to produce a formal security arrangement that commits the nations to each others’ defence, they will agree to mutual understanding about regional responsibilities and set up a three-way hotline to communicate in times of crisis, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
US President Joe Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol to the storied presidential retreat in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains as the Asian nations work to mend their tattered diplomatic relations in the face of greater regional threats posed both by China’s rise and North Korea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Boureima Balima and Abdel-Kader Mazou NIAMEY (Reuters) -Niger's junta on Tuesday rejected the latest diplomatic mission from West African countries aimed at restoring constitutional order after a July 26 coup, resisting pressure from the United States and the United Nations to come to the negotiating table. Heads of state from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are preparing for a summit on Thursday to discuss their standoff with the junta, which defied an Aug. 6 deadline to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. ECOWAS defence chiefs agreed on Friday on a possible m...]]></summary>

After achieving a degree of success with the EV6 two years ago, the Koreans have upped the ante with an imposing and well-equipped EV9, albeit it at a high price. The first lavishly equipped Launch Edition with all-wheel drive will bend your bank balance to the tune of €83,190 in Europe. Prices for the base version with no gizmos hover around €70,000. The snub-nosed EV9 is big but not brutish. It stands at 5 metres from bumper to bumper in length and is designed to lure SUV buyers as well...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London-based sex worker Marin Scarlett and right-wing populist Nigel Farage might initially appear unlikely campaigning allies, but when it comes to the pitfalls of banking in Britain they share a common cause.
"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second-ranking US diplomat met Niger's military leaders on Monday to press to reverse a coup but reported no headway a day after an ultimatum from the West African bloc ECOWAS was ignored.
Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.
A source close to ECOWAS said an immediate military intervention to restore Bazoum was n…]]></summary>

The musician's funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

Ukraine has not taken direct responsibility for the string of attacks, including on the capital Moscow, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that "war" is coming to Russia.
Polls show the former stand-up comedian's crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country's most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.
Offering a rare glimpse at Ukraine's homegrown explosive drones, Prytula recently shared images of himself with a fleet in an undisclosed location.

This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

They arrived on board the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing "greater flexibility and maritime capability" to the Fifth Fleet, the statement added.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
