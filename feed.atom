The 41-year-old made the announcement via a social media message posted on Twitter on Thursday. 

The sporting icon cited injuries as the main reason behind his decision to retire. 

“As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries,” Mr Federer said. 

“I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form, but I also know my body’s capacities and limits and its message to me lately has been clear. 

“Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognise when it is time to end my competitive career.”]]></summary>

Daily Mail: White House pledges new military aid package for Ukraine 'very, very soon' that will put the total over $14B - as John Kirby says China hasn't done 'anything overt' to aid Russia's war effort and Putin meets Xi to laud Beijing's 'balanced position' 
* New package expected to include more long-range and artillery weapons 
* It would be the 21st military and economic aid package 
* Ukraine is appealing for more arms after battlefield gains 
* Russian President Putin met China's Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan and praised China for its 'balanced' position on the war 
* Putin and Xi last met before Russia launched its invasion 
The White House is preparing to announce yet another military aid package for Ukraine as its military continues to make territorial gains in its effort to seize back territory from Russia in its northeast and south.

The body, formed in the 2001 as a talking shop for Russia, China and ex-Soviet states in Central Asia, expanded four years ago to include India and Pakistan, with a view to playing a bigger role as counterweight to Western influence in the region.

During a discussion about Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introducing a bill on Tuesday that would have banned abortion after 15 weeks – with exceptions for the mother’s life in danger, rape or incest – Haines noted that 15 weeks is the first week of the second trimester of pregnancy.
“By the way, 15 weeks for anyone who doesn’t know is a week in your second trimester,” she said.  “And just to clear up a myth that’s often used to get a certain political outcome, there’s no such thing as people having late-term abortions.”
“There’s no such thing as people having late-term abortions,” Haines reiterated, after some encouragement from the co-host Whoopi Goldberg.

In the world in which Russians live today, a tiger may very well have wings, a beak and fins, if the Kremlin wishes.  But in this reality, even darker things are possible.

Russian and Chinese naval forces are conducting a joint military exercise in the Pacific Ocean, Russia's defense ministry announced on Thursday, just hours before Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping were set to meet in Central Asia. 
Warships of the Russian Navy and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy were scheduled to drill in tactical maneuvering, signals communication, artillery fire and shipboard helicopter operations as part of an "international military cooperation" program, the ministry said on Telegram, according to a report by Russia's Tass news agency.

— AFP News Agency (@AFP) September 15, 2022
   BBC News: Putin-Xi talks: Russian leader reveals China's 'concern' over Ukraine 
Vladimir Putin has acknowledged China's "concern" over Ukraine, in his first face-to-face talks with President Xi Jinping since the Russian invasion. 
But speaking in Uzbekistan, Mr Putin also thanked China for its "balanced position" - and said US "attempts to create a unipolar world" would fail. 
Mr Xi said China was willing to work together with Russia as "great powers". 
China hasn't endorsed Russia's invasion but has grown trade and other ties with Moscow since it was launched. 
The two leaders' meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Samarkand comes at a crucial point in the Ukraine war, as Russian troops lose ground in parts of the country.   
Read more .... 
WNU editor: My Chinese sources tell me that Chinese President Xi's concerns stem from what Putin told him during the Winter Olympics in February when it came to Ukraine, and what has happened since. 
Bottom line. 
Russia is China's most important strategic ally. The last thing that Beijing wants to see is the war in Ukraine resulting in a very unstable Russia.

(see Yevgeny Prigozhin(unofficial head of the Wagner group's speech below). 

The speech is quite direct...

    As to what is my take on the head of the Wagner Group looking for recruits at Russian prisons. He is going to be very successful. I have met people who have served time in Russian prisons, and it is not a place you want to be. I would not be surprised if a good chunk of these long term prisoners (100,000 prisoners serving over ten years) will take the offer. 
This is also nothing new. Ukraine did the same thing when the war started .... Ukrainian prisoners will be released from jail to fight in war (Washington Examiner)]]></summary>

* Vice President Kamala Harris insisted on Sunday that the southern border was 'secure' during an interview on Sunday 
* But migrants arriving in DC, close to her home, have said that they thought it was open despite the comments - with one happily telling reporters 'we came here illegally' 
* Texas Governor Greg Abbott has sent yet another bus of illegal migrants from his state in what appears to be a direct retaliation for the comments 
* More than 100 people travelled from Eagle Pass to the Naval Observatory on Thursday morning , just yards from Harris' DC home 
* The home is best known as the 'President's Guest House' - the 14 bedroom home is a fully-staffed compound spread across 60,000 square feet across four townhouses 
* Those who arrived on the bus said that they had travelled from Venezuela, with many women, children and families smiling as they got off the vehicles 
Kamala Harris has been mocked by illegal migrants bussed to her Washington DC residence who said they'd strolled across the southern border unimpeded - days after she insisted it was secure. 
 One unidentified man filmed outside the Naval Observatory on Friday told Fox News: 'The border is open, not closed. 
Everybody believes that the border is open.   'It is open because we enter. We come in free, no problem. We came illegally, not legally.'

The New Voice Of Ukraine: US, EU trying to force Turkish banks to disconnect from Russian payment system  
The United States and EU are increasing pressure on Turkey over concerns that the country's banking sector is a potential loophole through which Russia can evade sanctions. 
The United States has focused its attention on Turkish banks that work with the Russian payment system Mir, the newspaper noted. At the same time, Brussels is preparing a delegation to express its concerns directly to Turkish officials. 
“We will send a very clear signal that financial institutions of third countries should not connect to the Mir payment network, because, as you know, this involves some risks of evading sanctions,” said one of the publication’s sources. 
The pressure on Turkey has come as Western countries have shifted from imposing new sanctions to tightening restrictions that are already in place. 
“We need to close the loopholes,” another FT source said.

The Intercept: U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine Grows to Historic Proportions — Along With Risks  
Ukraine is on track to become the largest recipient of U.S military assistance in the last century. But questions surround the policy. 
Since Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February, the U.S. government has pumped more money and weapons into supporting the Ukrainian military than it sent in 2020 to Afghanistan, Israel, and Egypt combined — surpassing in a matter of months three of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid in history. 
Keeping track of the numbers is challenging. Since the war started, U.S. officials have announced a flurry of initiatives aimed at supporting Ukrainian defense efforts while keeping short of a more direct involvement in the conflict. On Thursday, on a surprise visit to Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new $675 million package of U.S. military equipment as well as a $2.2 billion “long-term” investment to bolster the security of Ukraine and 17 of its neighbor countries. Weeks earlier, President Joe Biden unveiled a $3 billion aid package, the largest yet, symbolically choosing Ukraine’s Independence Day for the announcement. The administration noted on that occasion that the total military assistance committed to Ukraine this year had reached $12.9 billion, more than $15.5 billion since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. And this month, Biden also asked Congress to authorize an additional $13.7 billion for Ukraine, including money for equipment and intelligence.

Reuters: Russia says longer-range U.S. missiles for Kyiv would cross red line 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that if the United States decided to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, it would cross a "red line" and become "a party to the conflict". 
In a briefing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added that Russia "reserves the right to defend its territory". 
Washington has openly supplied Ukraine with advanced GMLRS rockets, fired from HIMARS launchers, that can hit targets up to 80 km (50 miles) away. 
"If Washington decides to supply longer-range missiles to Kyiv, then it will be crossing a red line, and will become a direct party to the conflict," Zakharova said.

Kyiv also requested tanks, drones, artillery systems, additional Harpoon antiship missiles and HIMARS missiles 
Kyiv asked Washington for long-range missiles to continue its successful counter offensive against the Russian army, according to a document shared with US lawmakers on Monday. 
The list of requested military aid included 29 types of weapons and ammunition, among which is the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which has a range of nearly 190 miles, 
The Wall Street Journal reported after viewing the document. Kyiv also wants tanks, drones, artillery systems, additional Harpoon antiship missiles and 2,000 missiles for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, which had proven to cause significant damage to the Russian forces in recent months.

WNU Editor: The official position from the US is that there will be no long range missiles for Ukraine .... US sees the aid its given Ukraine as effective, likely won’t provide longer-range systems for now (CNN). But last month's strikes in Crimea has raised speculation within Russia and the US main stream media itself that Ukraine is being supplied with these missiles .... Is the U.S. giving Ukraine some weapons secretly? (Politico). That while the US is not officially sending Ukraine long range missiles directly, it is using third parties in Europe to do so. 
The U.S. also has a history of saying that they will not send advanced weaponry to Ukraine, but are doing so anyway .... The US has been quietly giving Ukraine radar-hunting missiles that could really be a problem for Russia (Insider).]]></summary>

RT: Russia reacts to US ‘boasting’ about Ukraine involvement 
The Pentagon is openly aiding Kiev and bragging about it, the Russian envoy to Washington said 
It is cause for “deep concern” that the US government is “openly boasting” that Ukraine’s battlefield successes were achieved with the Pentagon’s direct involvement, the Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said in an interview on Wednesday. 
“Against this background, Washington’s statements that the US is not a party to the conflict sound absolutely ridiculous and unfounded,” Antonov told RIA Novosti. “Facts and interviews of former and current politicians and generals say otherwise.”  “Videos currently shown on Western channels clearly demonstrate that soldiers and officers who speak fluent English, many with pronounced British and American accents, are fighting against us,” the ambassador added.

Aspiring young talents of Ensemble Traversée will perform seven novel, cross-genre, cross-cultural, and cross-generational works composed by three faculty composers and four outstanding student composers. Hailing from The University of Hong Kong (Prof. Chan Hing-yan, Austin Leung, Jing Wang), South China Normal University (Dr. Yeung-ping Chen), The Tianjin Juilliard School (Dr. Yiwen Shen) and the Bard College Conservatory of Music (Samuel Mutter, OGA), they broke new ground by composing for mixed ensemble of Chinese and Western instruments that respond to their selected ink artworks from M+.  Breaking new ground with young talents    The genesis of the year-long multi-party collaboration ‘Ink Art and New Music’ Creative Exchange Project started back in 2018 when Prof. Chan, Dr. Chen, Dr. Robert Martin (former director of the Bard Conservatory), Dr. Jindong Cai (director of the US-China Music Institute), Dr. Lesley Ma (former curator at M+ and current associate curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Sharon Lu (programme director of HKU MUSE) met up in Hong Kong. “Ink art and Chinese musical instruments are part of Chinese culture with a long history; both need to find a contemporary voice. So we came up with the idea to create new music with a mixed ensemble featuring a very unique combination of instruments that responds explicitly to specific ink paintings. It has never been done before,” explains Prof. Chan.   Divided into three phases, the project eventually kicked off in September 2021 under the auspices of the HKU MUSE series, whose mission is to inspire a life-long passion for the arts through innovative and educational programmes. Run by the HKU Cultural Management Office, HKU MUSE has presented many innovative educational programmes. They include the Literature X Music Series with Musical Pushkin and…]]></summary>

Global weekly deaths down to 11,118 on 5 September – the lowest level since March 2020 
The end of the Covid-19 pandemic is “in sight”, the World Health Organization has declared, after revealing that weekly deaths from the virus around the world were at the lowest level since March 2020. 
The weekly global deaths figure on 5 September 2022 was 11,118, according to the WHO’s website. 
March 2020 was the month that the UK entered its first national lockdown.  The WHO also estimated that 19.8m deaths were averted in 2021 due to Covid-19 vaccines being administered and that 12bn doses had been given around the world.

   Warzone/The Drive: Russia Has Begun Using Iranian Kamikaze Drones On Ukraine 
The first evidence has come to light of an Iranian loitering munition, or ‘Kamikaze’ drone, used by Russia in its war in Ukraine.   Ukrainian officials are claiming the destruction of the first example of an Iran-supplied drone used by Russia in the war in Ukraine. 
The assertion is backed up by photos showing the apparent remains of what looks very much like an Iranian Shahed-136 loitering munition, or ‘suicide’ drone, reportedly found in eastern Ukraine. 
This appears to confirm that Iranian-made drones have not only been delivered to Russia but are now being employed in combat, including in strike missions.

A B-1 bomber and a KC-135 tanker made emergency landings on Guam and in Japan after a refueling incident high over the Pacific.

Both aircraft were able to get on the ground safely at the respective bases and there were no reported injuries as a result of the incident.

The SUN: Mystery as ‘top secret hypersonic 5,000mph US spy plane’ spotted flanked by two fighter jets flying near Britain 
FLYING high over the North Sea, a mysterious "black triangle" shape flanked by two US fighter jets was spotted by an oil rig worker. 
The sighting came as there was a flurry of reports of unusual aircraft, unexplained sonic booms, ear-splitting high-pitched shrieks and fast-moving radar dots around Britain. 
For years during the late 80s and early 90s the British Isles seems to have been menaced by these shapes and sounds, with the reports often being branded as UFOs.

   VICE: Watch the U.S. Army Prepare for a 40 Drone Swarm Attack

The Ukrainian military has reportedly been making advances over the past week on the Eastern front, gaining back territory in the regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk that were taken by the Russian military after its invasion of the country that started in late February. Around 3,000 square kilometers were retaken, according to accounts that cannot be independently verified, and many towns liberated. The Russian side meanwhile spoke of a "regrouping" of its troops as apparent videos from the front showed abandoned Russian tanks and other vehicles. Russian shelling of infrastructure like power stations intensified with the recent developments, causing blackouts in the affected regions.

Business Insider: The US has given Ukraine nearly a million 155 mm artillery shells. Now it's looking for US companies to build more of them. 
* The US Army is looking for companies that can build up to 12,000 155 mm artillery shells a month. 
* The Army's survey comes as the US supplies Ukraine with arms, including some 800,000 155 mm rounds. 
* The scale of the effort to supply weapons has raised concerns about the status of US stockpiles. 
With US ammunition stockpiles being depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, the US Army is looking for new manufacturers for 155 mm howitzer shells. 
The Army recently put out a market survey to identify US and Canadian companies that can manufacture up to 12,000 M795 155 mm high-explosive shells a month. 
The M795 is the standard shell for Army and Marine 155 mm howitzers and would be the prime ammunition for any US-designed 155 mm howitzers sent to Ukraine, which is already using M777 towed 155 mm guns sent by the US and Canada.

Reuters: Exclusive-U.S. considers China sanctions to deter Taiwan action, Taiwan presses EU 
The United States is considering options for a sanctions package against China to deter it from invading Taiwan, with the European Union coming under diplomatic pressure from Taipei to do the same, according to sources familiar with the discussions. 
The sources said the deliberations in Washington and Taipei's separate lobbying of EU envoys were both at an early stage -- a response to fears of a Chinese invasion which have grown as military tensions escalate in the Taiwan Strait. 
In both cases, the idea is to take sanctions beyond measures already taken in the West to restrict some trade and investment with China in sensitive technologies like computer chips and telecoms equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Queen Elizabeth II is still dead, several American media continued to confirm it on Monday.
The 96-year-old British monarch died on Thursday, ending a 70-year reign.  Her death sparked a relentless barrage of media coverage about her and the royal family – not just in the UK, but in the US, which has said no to the monarchy.

Theodorou died on Sunday surrounded by his family and loved ones “after an arduous struggle with metastatic colon cancer”, according to one posted statement on its website and social media accounts on Monday. 
“He faced his end while living his life eternally, irrationally and infectiously optimistic,” the statement said.  “It’s impossible to capture all facets or all of his accomplishments in a single post to ‘summarize the story’.”
The Canadian mixed martial arts fighter had a professional record of 19 wins and 3 losses.  He competed in the UFC middleweight division and rose to number 13 until being released from the company in 2019. He went on to compete in three other fights outside the UFC and went u…]]></summary>
