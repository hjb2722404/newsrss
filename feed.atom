        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Israel Gaza war: Hamas-run health ministry says Gaza death toll passes 10,000 
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month.

More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry said. 
The number surpasses the UN's figure of about 5,400 killed in Gaza in all of Israel's previous conflicts with Hamas since it took control of the territory in 2007.
Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed 1,400 people and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October. 
It says it is destroying Hamas infrastructure and killing its fighters so that it will no longer be able to pose a threat to Israel.

CNBC: ‘It’s going to be bloody’: Why Israel’s long war ahead will be nothing like what it’s faced before  
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned his country that a “long and difficult war” lay ahead. 
* The IDF is supplementing heavy aerial bombardment of the besieged territory with what’s been described as a ground incursion, the details of which have been kept closely guarded. 
* Prolonged urban combat will bring a slew of deadly challenges for the IDF – and likely some key advantages for Hamas, military analysts say. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned his country that a “long and difficult war” lay ahead. 
The Israeli Defense Forces, after launching the largest military mobilization of troops in its history, has now entered into the “second phase” of its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 
The IDF is supplementing heavy aerial bombardment of the besieged territory with what’s been described as a ground incursion, the details of which have been kept closely guarded.

WNU Editor: The attack by Hamas on October 7th was different in many ways(the size of the attack and the high civilian casualty numbers and kidnapped Israelis). Israel's declaration of war while making it a commitment to completely wipe out Hamas was also new and unprecedented.
Bottom line. Israel is facing urban and attrition warfare coupled with astronomical casualty numbers. And when completed, Gaza is going to look like what Mosul looked like after the Iraqi army was successful in wiping out ISIS. 
So yes. Israel’s long war ahead will be nothing like what it’s faced before]]></summary>

At least 10,022 Palestinians have been killed including 4,104 children in Israeli strikes on Gaza since Oct. 7, the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza said. 
GAZA (Reuters) - U.N. agency leaders saying "enough is enough" demanded a humanitarian ceasefire on Monday nearly a month into Gaza's war, as health authorities in the enclave said the death toll from Israeli strikes now exceeded 10,000. 
Israel has rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire, saying hostages taken by Hamas militants during their rampage in southern Israel on Oct. 7 should be released first. 
"An entire population is besieged and under attack, denied access to the essentials for survival, bombed in their homes, shelters, hospitals and places of worship. This is unacceptable," the U.N. chiefs said in a joint statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNYUZ/New York Times: Netanyahu suspends a minister who said that dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza was an option. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel took the highly unusual step on Sunday of suspending a far-right minister from his government, after the minister said that dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza and killing everyone there was “one way” of dealing with the threat from Hamas. 
Mr. Netanyahu’s swift action came amid an immediate and broad outcry over the comments made on Sunday morning by Amichay Eliyahu, the minister of heritage from the ultranationalist Jewish Power party. 
In his remarks, made to a Hebrew radio station, Mr. Eliyahu also said that there was no such thing as noncombatants in Gaza.

The Aviationist: In A First, Israeli F-35I Adir Shoots Down Cruise Missile 
The kill, scored against a missile likely launched from Yemen, is the first interception of this kind by the 5th gen fighter. 
The Israeli Air Force disclosed today that one of its F-35I Adir fighters recently shot down a cruise missile which was about to enter Israeli airspace from the southwest. 
The cruise missile, possibly launched from Yemen, was detected and tracked by the air defense as F-35Is were scrambled to intercept it, scoring the first cruise missile kill by the 5th generation fighter.

NBC News: Israel shot down a ballistic missile fired from Yemen, U.S. officials say 

  Israel says that it took down the missile with its Arrow system and that Israeli fighter jets intercepted drones launched from the same direction. 
Militants believed to be Houthi rebels fired a medium-range ballistic missile from Yemen toward Israel on Tuesday, according to two U.S. officials. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the missile was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow air defense system, which was jointly developed by Israel and the U.S. The IDF confirmed that a surface-to-surface missile had been fired toward Israeli territory from the direction of the Red Sea, but not did specify whether it had originated in Yemen.
The U.S. officials said the missile, which had a range of 2,000 kilometers (about 1,240 miles) or more, did not threaten U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea or U.S. troops or personnel in the area.

 Business Insider: An Ohio-class submarine, possibly equipped with ballistic missiles, has arrived in the Mediterranean 
* CENTCOM on Sunday confirmed an Ohio-class submarine has traveled to the Mediterranean Sea. 
* Ohio-class submarines can be equipped with advanced ballistic or Tomahawk missiles. 
* The sub was pictured appearing to sail through the Suez Canal in Egypt, which connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas. 
An Ohio-class submarine, a type of vessel which can be equipped with advanced ballistic or Tomahawk cruise missiles, has arrived in the Mediterranean as the US continues to bolster its defensive posture amid the Israel-Hamas war. 
CENTCOM, the Department of Defense combatant command with authority over US forces in the Middle East and West and Central Asia, posted a photo on Sunday of the submarine on X, formerly Twitter, confirming it had arrived in the region. 
The disclosure of the submarine's location is significant as the whereabouts of the vessels are typically kept secret for security regions.

Reuters: US plans $425 million Ukraine weapons aid announcement 
The Biden administration plans to announce a $425 million military aid package for Ukraine on Friday including counter drone rockets and munitions, two U.S. officials said on Thursday. 
The package is not expected to include additional ATACMS missiles. Senior congressional Republicans have urged President Joe Biden to send longer-range missiles to Ukraine, despite pushback from some conservative lawmakers against more aid. 
The planned aid package for Ukraine includes about $300 million worth of laser-guided munitions to shoot down Russian drones, according to a document seen by Reuters and one of the officials. The funds for those munitions come from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) program, which allows the Biden administration to buy weapons from industry rather than pull from U.S. weapons stocks.

To mark the occasion, the Mint is looking for 75 people turning 75 years old this year, to give them a special £5 coin, in honour of the King’s birthday. To honour the King’s lifelong commitment to sustainability, a special birthday coin has also been made from a blend of silver recovered from industrial and medical x-ray films. Those celebrating their 75th birthday in 2023 can submit their name and contact details via the Royal Mint to be in with a chance of receiving an uncirculated £5 commemorative coin. The winners will be drawn at random and asked to provide photographic evidence of age. They will be contacted via email from early December 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive explosions are hitting Gaza City and its surroundings as Israel continues on with its deadliest campaign to destroy Hamas following the terrorist group's unprovoked attack on October 7.

The IDF on Sunday said its troops were “encircling Gaza city” and conducting “widespread strikes”.

Health officials in the Palestinian territory claimed 53 people died in two blasts at refugee camps.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his rejection for a ceasefire on Sunday until the some 240 hostages taken by Hamas on October 7 are released.

"There will be no ceasefire without the return of the hostages. This should be completely removed from the lexicon," Mr Netanyahu said.

"We say this to our friends and to our enemies. We will simply continue until we defeat them. We have no alternative."]]></summary>

Reuters: Pro-Palestinian crowds try to storm air base housing U.S. troops in Turkey 
ADANA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish police used tear gas and water cannon as hundreds of people at a pro-Palestinian rally on Sunday tried to storm an air base that houses U.S. troops, hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due in Ankara for talks on Gaza. 
Turkey, which has stepped up its criticism of Israel as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened, supports a two-state solution while hosting members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Since the Israel-Hamas war started, protests have erupted across the country. 
Earlier this week, the IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation, an Islamist Turkish aid agency, organised a convoy to travel to the Incirlik air base in the Adana province in southern Turkey to protest Israeli attacks on Gaza and U.S. support for Israel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protesters gathered outside the residence of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to express their anger at the failures that led to last month's deadly attack by Hamas gunmen. The protest coincided with a poll showing that over three-quarters of Israelis believe Netanyahu should resign. Netanyahu has not taken personal responsibility for the failures that allowed the surprise assault, which has led to growing public fury and criticism of the government's response.

Anticipating a more robust financial year ahead, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has forecasted a 2.8 percent expansion in Russia’s GDP in 2023, a significant bounce-back from a 2 percent contraction experienced in the previous year. Siluanov attributes this hopeful outlook to full compensation for last year’s decrease and the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. 
Rebound from Economic Contraction 
The predicted growth in Russia’s economy marks a recovery from the challenging economic climate of 2022 when the nation grappled with a 2 percent economic decline. Siluanov, however, projects a promising 2.8 to 3 percent expansion in the upcoming year, viewing it as a reparation for the previous year’s downturn.

Update #1: Russia's economic situation develops steadily – Putin (TASS)
 
Update #2: Russia brings back capital controls to shore up the ruble (CNN)

 
WNU Editor: The Western media likes to focus on the rise and fall and rise of the Russian ruble, but the Russian economy is more than just that. So here is my recap. The civilian economy is booming and it is causing problems (inflation, labor shortages, etc.). And as for that part of the economy that is dedicated to military production .... I cannot even express in words on how huge of an impact that is having on the economy as a whole. 
But the big story on the Russia economy that many in the West have not caught up on is the Kremlin's priority to re-industrialize the country. I know the money is there to make it happen,  but the big problem that I see will be having the workers to make this all happen. 
Update #3: The Duran's analysis on the Russian economy (see below) concurs with what I know is happening in Russia.]]></summary>

A Russian nuclear-powered submarine has conducted a ballistic missile test, with the projectile traveling several thousand kilometers from the northern to the easternmost part of the country, the Defense Ministry has said.
In a statement in the early hours of Sunday, the ministry said that the submarine ‘Emperor Alexander III’ had “successfully launched the Bulava sea-based intercontinental ballistic missile from the White Sea to the Kura test range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.” It added that the missile was fired underwater and that its warheads reached the target on time.

Correspondent Enrique Acevedo talks with Mexico City's minister of culture Claudia Curiel De Icaza about the city's celebrations; with acclaimed chef Elena Reygadas about baking traditional pan de muerto; and with author Regina Marchi, who has documented the holiday's growing popularity on both sides of the border in her book, "Day of the Dead in the U.S.A."]]></summary>

Bulgarian Military: Trucks brought two dismantled F-16s to Ukraine from Poland – Rybar 
Rybar, a Russian think tank, asserts that two disassembled F-16s were transported into Ukraine from Poland on the night of November 3. 
The organization further reports that since the beginning of November, there has been an influx of no less than five dismantled F-16s into Ukrainian territories, inclusive of the two aforementioned jets delivered on November 3rd. 
In a recent delivery update shared on his X account [which was once Twitter], Rybar informs his followers that “the eagerly anticipated shipment is now in possession,” referencing the arrival of two F-16 jets delivered via truck transportation.

WNU Editor: There are reasons to believe that Ukraine is already receiving these jets. For one, the Dutch Prime Mminister said last week that F-16s are going to be delivered to Romania for shipment to Ukraine within two weeks ....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pentagon has announced plans for a new nuclear bomb 24 times as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. It comes days after it emerged China plans to double its arsenal of nuclear warheads to over 1,000 by 2030

 
Daily Mail: Maps show devastating impact of America's new super-nuke on Russian capital: B61-13 'gravity bomb' has 24 times more power than the one dropped on Hiroshima 
* The Biden administration is developing a new nuclear bomb - the B61-13 has the potential to cause significant devastation in Moscow 
* Simulation of bomb's estimated maximum yield of 360 kilotons of TNT could see many deaths with more than 300,000 killed and hundreds of thousands injured 
* Development of the weapon is primarily intended as a deterrent and to provide assurance to allies 
Maps have been released depicting the destruction that could be unleashed should a new type of nuclear bomb being developed by the Biden Administration be dropped on Moscow. 
The Pentagon announced this week that it is developing a new nuclear 'gravity bomb' that is 24 times more powerful than the nuke detonated in Hiroshima. 
The B61-13 is the 13th variant of the B61 family of 'gravity bombs,' which fall to their target rather than being guided.

Israeli airstrikes hit two refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip on Sunday, killing at least 45 people, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. The strikes came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his Middle-eastern tour with an unannounced visit to Iraq, as Washington tries to prevent a regional spillover. Tensions increased with neighbouring Lebanon as an Israeli strike in the south of the country killed three children and their grandmother, Lebanese authorities said.

France 24: Gaza conflict 'taking away focus' from Ukraine, Zelensky says

 
President Volodymyr Zelensky denied on Saturday that Ukraine's war with Russia had reached a "stalemate", pushing back at suggestions Western leaders were lobbying for peace talks. 
The sprawling frontline between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked. 
"Time has passed, people are tired... But this is not a stalemate," Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv with EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. 
The Ukrainian leader also rejected the idea Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks would entail.

Thousands of people are newly displaced, with some crossing into China, as fighting intensifies between Myanmar's junta and ethnic rebel groups in areas near the border. 
The junta launched a second day of air strikes on Wednesday, bombing territory in the northernmost Kachin state controlled by ethnic armed group Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a rebel spokesperson told AFP. 
Since Friday, the junta also has been battling an alliance of ethnic rebel groups across the neighbouring north-eastern Shan state.

Business Insider: Pentagon says there are no limits on how Israel uses US weapons as death toll climbs amid airstrikes in Gaza 
* The Pentagon says there are no limits on how Israel uses US-provided weapons in their attacks in Gaza. 
* A spokesperson said it's up to the IDF how it uses the weapons. 
* Israeli airstrikes have devastated the Gaza Strip, and a new ground offensive could do further damage. 
The US is not putting any limits on how Israel uses US-provided weapons in its bloody war against Hamas that has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and destroyed parts of the Gaza Strip, the Pentagon says as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ramps up its retaliatory attacks in the area. 
On Monday, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told that "we are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that [are] provided," Voice of America National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin reported. 
"We're not putting any constraints on that," she said.

Newsweek: Hezbollah Targets Israel With 'Volcano' Rockets as Tensions Soar 
The militant group Hezbollah launched missile strikes against Israel on Saturday using rockets dubbed "The Volcano," as tensions continue to soar along the country's northern border with Lebanon. 
The Associated Press reported Saturday that Israel had launched airstrikes along the Lebanese border, as Hezbollah carried out several strikes of its own against Israeli military sites. 
One of these Israeli sites, known in Lebanon as Jal al-Allam, was struck by two large Burkan missiles, according to the AP. 
Translated as "volcano" in Arabic, Burkan missiles have an operational range of 500-2,000 meters and are outfitted with sizeable warheads that can weigh hundreds of kilograms.

The Israeli military exchanged fire with Hezbollah militants on Saturday as skirmishes with the group continue at the Lebanon-Israel border. 
Israel launched airstrikes on multiple Hezbollah positions near the Lebanese border as the Iran-backed militant group launched rockets towards Israeli targets, the Associated Press reported.

Hezbollah has repeatedly threatened escalation amid Israel’s war with Hamas, an ally of the group, in Gaza. 
“What the Israelis do to Lebanon will also determine how we will act,” leader Hassan Nasrallah said Friday. “All options are on the table on the Lebanese front.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[She tried to censure and it came up short. 
Now she's shaming the names who didn't vote in favor. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib," Greene said on Wednesday. "This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC."

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.
"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger," she said. "And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate."
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.
"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib," tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: "motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans."

And CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: "House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.]]></summary>

That line is budging. 
Officials are fuming at  Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) after it was discovered over the weekend that Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith, who had been doubling as both the top No. 1 and No. 2 Marine Corps leader since July, suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized on Sunday — leaving a three-star general to hold the prestigious post, according to a report published by Politico.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
The potential overextension of Smith and the stalling of more than 300 critical leadership roles was iced out by Tuberville's blockade installed as a protest against the Pentagon's policy to permit time off and reimbursement for abortions.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
