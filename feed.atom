The war began in the early morning hours with a massive bombardment — China’s version of “shock and awe.” Chinese planes and rockets swiftly destroyed most of Taiwan’s navy and air force as the People’s Liberation army and navy mounted a massive amphibious assault across the 100-mile Taiwan Strait. Having taken seriously President Joe Biden’s pledge to defend the island, Beijing also struck pre-emptively at U.S. and allied air bases and ships in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. managed to even the odds for a time by deploying more sophisticated submarines as well as B-21 and B-2 stealth bombers to get inside China’s air defense zones, but Washington ran out of key munitions in a matter of days and saw its network access severed. The United States and its main ally, Japan, lost thousands of servicemembers, dozens of ships, and hundreds of aircraft. Taiwan’s economy was devastated.

Oil prices rose early on Wednesday as Chinese data showed crude imports into the world’s top oil importer jumped in May, recovering from a weak April. 
As of 8:13 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, ahead of the EIA weekly inventory report, WTI Crude prices were up by 0.99% at $72.45. The international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded at $76.98, up by 0.94% on the day.

Following a slump on Tuesday, oil prices recovered some of the losses early on Wednesday, as China’s data showed crude oil imports jumped in May by 12.2% year-on-year and by 17.4% compared to April.

The Diplomat: India Not Planning to Invite Ukraine to G20 Summit in September

 
Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited to participate in last year’s G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. 
India is not planning to invite Ukraine to the summit of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in September, its external affairs minister said Thursday.
“In our view, G-20 participation is for members and organizations we have invited. That list we declared as soon as we assumed the G-20 presidency” in December, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told reporters. 
Ukraine is not a G-20 member, but Russia is part of the grouping. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the two remain at war. India has avoided condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine and has sought to end it through diplomacy and dialogue.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised that India has made this decision. Countries like India, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, etc., want the G20 to be focused on economic affairs, not on the West's obsession with Ukraine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: NATO's show of strength to Putin: Alliance prepares for its biggest ever air force drills over Europe with 10,000 personnel from 25 nations responding to simulated attack 
* The Air Defender 23 exercise starting next week will have 10,000 participants 
* 250 aircraft from 25 nations will respond to simulated attack on Nato member country 
Germany is preparing to host the biggest air deployment exercise in Nato's history - a show of force intended to impress allies and potential adversaries such as Russia, officials said. 
The Air Defender 23 exercise starting next week will see 10,000 participants and 250 aircraft from 25 nations respond to a simulated attack on a Nato member country. 
The United States alone is sending 2,000 US Air National Guard personnel and about 100 aircraft to take part in the June 12 to 23 training manoeuvres.

WNU Editor: You can take this to the bank. Russian forces (both conventional and nuclear) are going to be on extreme high-alert during the duration of these exercises. 
Update: Not everyone is onboard with this exercise .... Hundreds demonstrate in Germany ahead of Air Defender 2023 exercise (DPA). 
Update #2: Yup! .... Air Defender 23 doesn't show NATO's strength but rather its US dependency (Washington Examiner).

(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon is set to announce as early as Friday a long-term arms package for Ukraine heavy on air defense munitions valued at more than $2 billion, according to administration officials. 
The money, to be awarded under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, will bankroll the purchase of Hawk missile launchers and missiles and two types of advanced Patriot air defense missiles. 
One is the Patriot Advanced Capability Missile-3, or Pac-3, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp. The other is called the Guidance Enhanced Missile, or GEM-T, made by Raytheon Technologies Corp that it says “provides improved ability to defeat tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or enemy aircraft in complement to the PAC-3 missile.”

 RT: Putin comments on Ukrainian counteroffensive 
Kiev’s long-anticipated push to retake lost territories has started, the Russian president says  
The much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive has started, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. He cited the deployment of Kiev’s strategic reserves as a telltale sign of the operation. 
“We can state with absolute certainty that this Ukrainian counteroffensive has begun, and the use of strategic reserves points to it,” Putin said at a press conference on Friday. 
The president noted that particularly heavy fighting has been ongoing for five days, with Russian troops managing to hold their positions. 
He also claimed that the Ukrainian military has suffered far heavier casualties than the “classic” three-to-one ratio often expected during an offensive.

CBS News: Putin puts a date on his plan to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus
 Russia will start deploying nuclear weapons in Belarus when the necessary facilities there are ready there in early July, President Vladimir Putin told the Belarussian leader at a Friday meeting. 
It was the first time Russia's president has suggested a specific timeframe for his plans, announced in March, to deploy "tactical nuclear weapons" to the country just north of Ukraine, which is one of Russia's few allies in the region. 
"Everything is going to plan," Putin said in a televised portion of his meeting with Belarus' longtime authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi, on Russia's Black Sea coast, adding that the two countries were deepening their cooperation on security.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Friday it had repelled fierce Ukrainian offensives in the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions, killing more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops and destroying dozens of tanks and armoured vehicles. 
Russia's top military brass briefed President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that their troops had successfully pushed back a series of attacks which Moscow says are part of a so-far unsuccessful counter-offensive by Ukraine since Sunday. 
"The armed forces of Ukraine continued attempts to conduct offensive operations in the southern Donetsk and Zaporozhzhia directions," the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. 
It said Ukrainian forces had attacked Russian lines four times with two battalions supported with tanks just south of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk, but were pushed back.

Russian forces had also repelled two attacks just south of city of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said.

Washington Post: U.S. had intelligence of detailed Ukrainian plan to attack Nord Stream pipeline 
Three months before saboteurs bombed the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline, the Biden administration learned from a close ally that the Ukrainian military had planned a covert attack on the undersea network, using a small team of divers who reported directly to the commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces. 
Details about the plan, which have not been previously reported, were collected by a European intelligence service and shared with the CIA in June 2022. 
They provide some of the most specific evidence to date linking the government of Ukraine to the eventual attack in the Baltic Sea, which U.S. and Western officials have called a brazen and dangerous act of sabotage on Europe’s energy infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Eurozone in recession as rising prices hit spending 
The eurozone fell into recession this winter, revised figures show, as consumers were hit by rising prices. 
The economy of the 20 nation-bloc contracted by 0.1% between January and March, after also shrinking in the final three months of 2022. 
A recession is generally defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods, or quarters, in a row. 
As in other regions, the eurozone has been hit by rising food and energy prices that have weighed on households. 
Spending by households in the bloc fell by 0.3% in the first three months of 2023, and by 1% in the previous quarter.

Breaking Defense: Sentinel ICBM faces year delay, Air Force One and F-15EX also at risk: GAO

 
A new watchdog report warns of a year-long delay for America's next ICBM, as well as potential schedule slips for F-15EX, KC-46A and the Air Force One replacement. 
WASHINGTON — The Air Force’s $96 billion Sentinel program that will field a new fleet of nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles is staring down a delay of about a year, the Government Accountability Office warned in a new report today. 
GAO’s annual review of Pentagon weapon systems [PDF] also raised concerns about other key Air Force programs, such as the F-15EX, KC-46A and Air Force One replacement known as the VC-25B. 
Top officials have signaled in recent months that the Sentinel could fall behind, pointing to issues such as supply chain constraints and workforce disruption. A timeline graphic compiled by GAO now states the missile’s initial operational capability (IOC) date is estimated for between April and June 2030, a delay of approximately one year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong recently welcomed Mrs Jo Duncan, Headmistress of Wycombe Abbey UK, to its Hong Kong campus to talk about the synergy between the two schools and to discuss what makes a Wycombe Abbey education special.   “It’s very exciting to have a family of international schools and there’s a great deal that we can do together as we look to the future, both in terms of pupil and staff interactions and the sharing of best practice,” said Mrs Duncan, who was appointed to the role of Headmistress at the UK school in 2019.    This was Mrs Duncan’s first visit to the Hong Kong campus since she took up her role and she was impressed by the eye-catching architecture of the purpose-built Hong Kong school, with its grand atrium and massive glass ceilings that allow natural light to filter in to its corridors. She noted what a privilege it was to study in such a lovely space.     “Coming from Britain where we often work in older, listed buildings where you can’t easily alter things because they’ve been there for hundreds of years, it is wonderful to see WASHK’s bright, modern building,” she said.   But beyond the four walls, Mrs Duncan was most excited to connect without staff and pupils and to talk about what is at the heart of a Wycombe Abbey education and how the ‘DNA’ from the UK school is transferred to the school in Hong Kong.   “It’s looking at how to take the ‘DNA’, and the heart of what makes Wycombe Abbey the school that it is and how we can best share that with our sister schools,” she said.      Founded in 1896, Wycombe Abbey UK consistently ranks as one of the top all-girls independent boarding and day schools and has educated a list of notable people including Dame Sarah Springman, former Rector at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, one of the foremost technical universities in the world, and Principal of St Hilda's College at the University of Oxford, and actor Sally Phillips, and CNN…]]></summary>

Washington Post: USAID cuts food aid supporting millions of Ethiopians amid charges of massive government theft 
The U.S. government is suspending food aid to Ethiopia after an investigation uncovered a widespread scheme to steal donated food, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said Thursday, a move that will affect millions of the world’s poorest people. Leaked documents given to donors and shared with The Washington Post indicate that the scheme was coordinated by elements within both the country’s federal and regional governments. 
Officials have been diverting aid from those who need it to feed the military and ex-combatants, and selling it on the open market to millers who re-exported the flour, according to an investigation by USAID that was summarized to The Post by officials familiar with the investigation.

A statement posted by Semafor reporter Max Tani revealed the group is "shocked and deeply offended" by the merger. They explained that the LIV Golf league is "bankrolled by billions of sports washing money from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi operatives played a role in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and now it is bankrolling all of professional golf."
"PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan co-opted the 9/11 community last year in the PGA's unequivocal agreement that the Saudi LIV project was nothing more than sportswashing of Saudi Arabia's reputation," said 9/11 Families United Chair Terry Strada. …]]></summary>

The leaked documents indicated that an unnamed European intelligence body told the US spy agency in June 2022, four months after Russia invaded Ukraine, that Ukraine military divers reporting directly to the country's military commander-in-chief were planning the attack.

"I come bearing the sad news that my grandmother became a star today and is next to my grandfather Joao Gilberto," Sofia Gilberto wrote on social media early Tuesday.
The singer died at home in Philadelphia, in the United States, where she had lived since the 1960s, according to Brazilian news site G1.
Gilberto was born in Salvador, capital of Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, in 1940 and was married to Joao Gilberto, a pioneer of the bossa nova genre who died in 2019.

A state of emergency was declared following an explosion at the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine that also destroyed an adjacent hydroelectric power plant.
"The city is flooded," said Vladimir Leontyev, the Moscow-appointed mayor of Nova Kakhovka. The power plant is also underwater, he said.
On the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River, Leontyev said a total of 600 houses in three regions were affected by severe flooding.
An explosion destroyed the dam early Tuesday morning. Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up the dam and the nearby hydroelectric power station to disrupt the planned Ukrainian counteroffensive. Moscow denies this and claims that the Ukrainian army shelled the plant.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A huge Soviet-era dam on the Dnipro River that separates Russian and Ukrainian forces in southern Ukraine was breached on Tuesday, unleashing floodwaters across the war zone.
Ukraine said Russia had destroyed it, while Russia said Ukraine sabotaged it to cut off water supplies to Crimea and distract attention from a "faltering" counter-offensive.
What is the dam, what happened - and what do we not know?
THE KAKHOVKA DAM
The dam, part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, is 30 metres (98 feet) tall and 3.2 km (2 miles) long. Construction was started under Soviet leader Josef Stalin and finished under Nikita Khrushchev.
The dam bridged the Dnipro river, which forms the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the south of Ukraine.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's ruling party comfortably captured a major historic stronghold of the opposition in an election on Sunday, consolidating President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's hold on power ahead of the battle to succeed him next year.
Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) won the State of Mexico gubernatorial contest by more than 8 percentage points, according to preliminary results from the state's electoral institute.
The victory adds Mexico's most populous region to the 21 other states MORENA already controls, now more than two-thirds of the total. Another state is governed by a group allied to MORENA, giving the party a huge power base heading into the presidential elections due to be held on June 2, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Off the spectacular Greek tourist island of Santorini, divers drag deadly "ghost nets" from the depths of the Aegean Sea which have claimed the lives of thousands of fish.
"These abandoned nets are like fish traps," said diver Mika Panagiotopoulou, one of a group of volunteers who have been descending up to 45 meters to fish out discarded nets, tyres and plastic bags from the crystalline blue waters.
"For half a century the build-up of these abandoned nets has swept up thousands of fish and caused incalculable damage to the flora and fauna of our seas," said Santorini's mayor Antonis Sigalas, as the rubbish was gathered up at the little port of Vlychada before being recycled.

"For World Environment Day we want to highlight the dangers of abandoned fishing nets for our seas," said George Sarelakos, co-founder of Aegean Rebreath, the Greek NGO behind the clean-up.
"Discarded fishing nets account for about a tenth of the world's marine pollution and it's a real challenge because up to now it has been invisible -- because most people have no idea of what in hidden in the depths," he added.
Over the last five years, Aegean Rebreath's 300 volunteer divers have removed more than 28 tonnes of nets and hundreds of thousands of plastic bags -- one of the greatest scourges of the aquatic world -- from Greek waters.
Despite a tax being levied on plastic bags in Greece since 2018, shops still hand them out with abandon.
However, Sarelakos said there has been some progress. "There has been a change of mentality among fisherman and now they are handing (nets) over to be recycled."
"It is hard for a fisherman to survive so they put down more and more nets, which leads to fewer fish. It's a vicious circle," he said.

Harry, 38, is expected to take the witness stand at London's High Court in a trial considering unlawful information-gathering claims against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).
King Charles III's younger son and other high-profile figures allege that the publisher engaged in illegal activities, including phone hacking, at its titles and are seeking damages.
The case is one of several that Harry has brought against British newspaper groups since stepping down from royal duties in early 2020 and relocating to the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 500 people were evacuated from their homes in northern Ecuador on Sunday following flooding caused by heavy rains, President Guillermo Lasso said.
No one had been reported dead or missing, he said.
Dozens of residents climbed onto the roofs or balconies of their homes to protect themselves from the rising waters, according to images released by the Ministry of Defense.
Rain had fallen for 12 hours without interruption, causing six rivers to overflow, Lasso said.
"The priority is to save their lives, let's protect them! We have already rescued 500 people and the work continues," he wrote on Twitter.
Authorities evacuated around 500 people by boat and another 30 by helicopter, the Risk Management Secretariat said.
Around 11,750 people were affected by the floods and 16 lost their homes in the province of Esmeraldas, which borders Colombia.
Classes were suspended in several towns where schools were damaged.
Five health centers were also affected.
Between January and May, 36 people have been killed and more than 99,000 affected across Ecuador.
In March, a landslide caused by heavy rains in the Andean town of Alausi buried dozens of houses, killing around 60 people.
Rescuers are still working to recover the bodies of 13 people who went missing in that disaster.

The car, in full working order and registered in France, beat expectations when it went under the hammer in the central town of Tours on Sunday.
The body of the 2CV was hand-crafted out of wood with the same famous curves as the post-war French classic.
It was snapped up by Paris-based collector Jean-Paul Favand, who owns a museum of vintage fairground attractions.
"I'm having difficulty talking after this bet," Favand told AFP by telephone afterwards.
The auction house had issued a guide price of 150,000-200,000 euros, saying it was "much more than a car -- it's a work of art".

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Monday its forces had thwarted a major Ukrainian offensive at five points along the front in the southern Ukrainian region of Donetsk and killed hundreds of pro-Kyiv troops.
It was not immediately clear whether or not the reported attack represented the start of a Ukrainian counteroffensive which Kyiv has been promising for months to recapture territory taken by Russian forces after the invasion of February 2022.
Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine had attacked with six mechanised and two tank battalions in southern Donetsk, where Moscow has long suspected Ukraine would seek to drive a wedge through Russian-controlled territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VIENNA (Reuters) — Saudi Arabia will make a deep cut to its output in July on top of a broader OPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024 as the group seeks to boost flagging oil prices.

Saudi's energy ministry said the country's output would drop to 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from around 10 million bpd in May, the biggest reduction in years.
"This is a Saudi lollipop," Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference. "We wanted to ice the cake. We always want to add suspense. We don't want people to try to predict what we do... This market needs stabilisation".
OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, pumps around 40% of the world's crude, meaning its policy decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.

He began by discussing the Chinese plans for flying close to a U.S. jet and a ship sailing close to a U.S. Navy destroyer. According to Bolton, it's China trying to intimidate the United States and the Taiwanese government. 

"These incidents, as you reported, indicated both on the sea and in the air, are part of a larger Chinese project," said Bolton.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
