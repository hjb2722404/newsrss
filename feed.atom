ASU's Competitive Statecraft Initiative will produce Inter Populum, a new academic journal dedicated to issues surrounding irregular warfare
https://news.asu.edu/20231121-global-engagement-journal-look-complexities-more-psychological-way-war
Arizona State University has long had the reputation and designation as a military-friendly school. From the celebrated McCain Institute to the Pat Tillman Veterans Center to the Global Security Initiative, the university’s connection to the United States military runs deep.
Ryan Shaw, who served as an officer in the U.S. Army and earned his commission at West Point, is working to add more components to ASU’s mission. In addition to his direction and leadership over ASU’s Competitive Statecraft Initiative, he recently helped launch Inter Populum: The Journal of Irregular Warfare and Special Operations, a new peer-reviewed academic journal that will be published twice a year.
According to Shaw, a professor of practice in history and strategy, managing director of strategic initiatives and senior advisor to ASU President Michael Crow, Inter Populum will explore everything from lessons learned through historical case studies to current best practices to the nature of future conflict.
Shaw spoke to ASU News about the academic journal, irregular warfare and what it means for the world going forward.

2 reported killed as Hamas encourages civilians to go back to war zone; IDF drops flyers, tries to prevent flow; 13 hostages to be freed at 4 p.m.; humanitarian aid enters Gaza

Overnight Thursday-Friday, Hamas urged Gazans to return to the north of the Strip, where the IDF has focused its ground offensive for the past three weeks. The truce deal, under which the Gaza-governing Hamas terror group is set to free 50 Israeli hostages over four days from Friday, bars Gazans from returning to the north of the Strip.

Srettha Thavisin confirms release of a dozen of at least 26 nationals being held after weeks of negotiations 
A dozen of the 26 Thai nationals taken hostage by Hamas in the 7 October attacks in Israel have been released, Thailand’s prime minister has said. 
Srettha Thavisin said on X he had received confirmation of their release, and that Thai embassy officials were going to pick them up. “[We] will know more information in an hour,” he said on Friday evening. 
It had earlier been reported by Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site that 23 Thai nationals were set to be freed by Hamas without any conditions, after weeks of negotiations by the Thai government, which last month met representatives of the militant group in Tehran in an attempt to secure their release. 
At least 26 Thai nationals were being held by Hamas, while 39 Thai nationals have been killed, according to Thai officials. Three people remain in hospital.

As Seoul claims Russia helped Pyongyang carry out spy satellite launch, North Korea warns of stronger armed forces on border 
North Korea has warned it will deploy new weapons and stronger armed forces along its heavily armed border with South Korea, as officials in Seoul claimed that Russia had helped Pyongyang carry out a satellite launch. 
In a sign of rising tensions on the peninsula, North Korea said on Tuesday it would restore “all military measures” it had halted under a 2018 confidence-building agreement with South Korea. 
South Korea had already said it would suspend some of the measures, which are designed to reduce the possibility of an accidental conflict along the demilitarised zone (DMZ), after North Korea launched a satellite – apparently successfully – for the first time late on Tuesday. Seoul added that it would step up surveillance along the DMZ.

CNBC: ECB’s Lagarde: Increasing signs that the global economy is fragmenting into competing blocs 
* Focusing on Europe, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said that a continuous decline in the working age population looks set to start as early as 2025, alongside climate disasters which are increasing every year. 
* Her answer to these shocks was that massive investment would be needed in a short space of time, requiring what she called “a generational effort.” 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Friday said Europe is now at a critical juncture, with deglobalization, demographics and decarbonization looming on the horizon. 
“There are increasing signs that the global economy is fragmenting into competing blocs,” she said at the European Banking Congress, according to a transcript.

Some 80 rockets fired by terror groups at Israel on Thursday; IDF strikes rocket launchers, terror cells and infrastructure in response

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at northern Israel on Thursday in one of the largest barrages fired from Lebanon since October 7, sending thousands of people in northern towns and communities rushing to bomb shelters. 
In one salvo after midday, the IDF said some 35 rockets launched from Lebanon crossed the border into Israel. Hezbollah claimed responsibility, and said it had launched 48 rockets at an army base near Safed.

Hezbollah also took responsibility for several anti-tank guided missile and mortar attacks at different targets in northern Israel, including a strike against Kibbutz Menara in the Upper Galilee that caused damage to some buildings, Army Radio reported.

With almost all votes counted, Geert Wilders' far-right PVV party is well ahead of its closest rival. The anti-Islam populist has vowed to form a government. 
With 98% of the votes counted on Thursday, Geert Wilders' far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) won 37 of the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. 
The populist party was well ahead of a joint Labor-Green bloc with 25 seats and the conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte with 24 seats.

WNU Editor: The affordability crisis is what propelled Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) to their showing in these elections. But they only won 37 of 150 seats. He will still need to form a coalition government with some of the other parties to effectively govern. 
Update: We shall see .... Geert Wilders is just the start of Europe’s Right-wing wave (Unherd).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. military aid to Ukraine in October under the Presidential Drawdown Authority was the lowest in nearly a year and a half. November may be worse. 
 PBS/AP: Almost half of Americans think U.S. spending too much on Ukraine aid, AP-NORC poll says 
As lawmakers in Washington weigh sending billions more in federal support to Kyiv to help fight off Russian aggression, close to half of the U.S. public thinks the country is spending too much on aid to Ukraine, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 
Those sentiments, driven primarily by Republicans, help explain the hardening opposition among conservative GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are rebuffing efforts from President Joe Biden to approve a new tranche of Ukraine aid, arguing that the money would be better spent for domestic priorities. 
Yet opposition to aid is down slightly from where it was a month ago in another AP-NORC poll. Now, 45% say the U.S. government is spending too much on aid to Ukraine in the war against Russia, compared with 52% in October. That shift appears to come mostly from Republicans: 59% now say too much is spent on Ukraine aid, but that’s down from 69% in October. 
Nonetheless, the Republican resistance to continued Ukraine aid remains strong.

Newsweek: Ukraine Has 'Every Right' To Kill Putin Given the Opportunity: Zelensky 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that his country has every right to kill his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin if the opportunity arises, if doing so would protect Ukraine and his people. 
Zelensky made the remarks in a wide-ranging interview with The Sun in Kyiv, telling the tabloid newspaper that he has lost track of the number of times Moscow has attempted to assassinate him since Putin launched a full-scale invasion of his country in February 2022. 
"That's war, and Ukraine has all the rights to defend our land," the Ukrainian leader said when asked if Kyiv would take a chance to assassinate Putin if such an opportunity arose.

Times of Israel: 1,000 boats said set to leave Turkey for Gaza waters in new ‘Freedom Flotilla’

 
Reminiscent of infamous 2010 Mavi Marmara protest, large maritime convoy plans to remain in international waters off Ashdod and disrupt sea trade route to Israel 
Approximately 1,000 boats will gather in Turkey on Wednesday before heading toward Gaza in an attempt to break the Israeli blockade and disrupt maritime trade coming into Israel during the war with Hamas, in an apparent repeat of similar attempts from over a decade ago. 
In an interview with Turkish news website Haber7, Volkan Okçu, one of the organizers of the protest, indicated the boats will carry 4,500 people from 40 countries, “including anti-Zionist Jews.”

Among the 1,000 vessels would be 313 boats filled with Russian activists, and 104 filled with Spanish activists, he said. Only 12 Turkish vessels will join the flotilla, he told Haber7.

Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance -- the largest crypto exchange in the world -- after he and the company pleaded guilty on Tuesday to sweeping US money laundering violations and agreed to fines of more than $4 billion.
Here are three of the highest-profile crypto executives who have fallen foul of the law since last year:
- Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao -
Born in China in 1977, Zhao moved with his family to Canada in the 1980s and later got a degree in computer science from McGill University, according to his profile in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
He founded Binance in 2017 in Shanghai, and led the company's explosive…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dutch voters cast ballots Wednesday in an unpredictable election that will usher in a new political era after Prime Minister Mark Rutte's record 13-year stint in charge.
Opinion polls suggest the result is far too close to predict, with any of four candidates -- including one from the far-right -- within striking distance of power in the EU's fifth-largest economy.
The vote is being closely watched across Europe and further afield: the Netherlands tends to punch above its weight in the EU and on the world stage, with steadfast support for Ukraine and eurozone fiscal discipline.
Polls suggested huge numbers were undecided going into election day, making the result a literal coin-toss for one voter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chinese government has expanded its campaign of closing mosques to regions other than Xinjiang, where for years it has been blamed for persecuting Muslim minorities, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Wednesday.
Authorities have closed mosques in the northern Ningxia region as well as Gansu province, which are home to large populations of Hui Muslims, as part of a process known officially as “consolidation,” according to the report, which draws on public documents, satellite images and witness testimonies.
Local authorities also have been removing architectural features of mosques to make them look more “Chinese," part of a campaign by the ruling Communist Party to tighten control over religion and reduce the risk of possible challenges to its rule.
President Xi Jinping in 2016 called for the “Sinicization” of religions, initiating a crackdown that has largely concentrated on the western region of Xinjiang, home to more than 11 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.
Chinese authorities have decommissioned, closed down, demolished or converted mosques for secular use in regions outside Xinjiang as part of a campaign aimed at cracking down on religious expression, according to Human Rights Watch.
Additionally, the ablution hall of one mosque was damaged inside, according to videos obtained by the group.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World leaders on Wednesday welcomed a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that agreed a four-day halt to the devastating war in Gaza, accompanied by the release of dozens of hostages held by the militant group in return for Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The agreement marks the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since Hamas’s bloody cross-border October 7 attack on southern Israel that prompted Israel to launch a bombing campaign and ground offensive in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
Israel’s government and Hamas agreed to a four-day pause in fighting to allow the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The deal, which was brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US, came after five weeks of negotiations, according to a US official.
US President Joe Biden said late Tuesday he was deeply relieved that some hostages taken when Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7 will soon go free.
Qatar on Wednesday provided more details on the deal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who was convicted in the beating of a Jewish man in New York City back in 2021 yelled out "Free Palestine" inside a courtroom during his sentencing hearing, The New York Post reported. 
Mahmoud Musa, 23, was sentenced to seven years in prison in connection to the attack on Joseph Borgen which took place during a confrontation between supporters of Israel and Palestinian.

As he was being led away in handcuffs, he yelled "Free Palestine," which sparked an uproar in the court room from his supporters, with some of them calling the judge a "racist." Musa's supporters were then escorted out of the courtroom by security, according to reports.
From The New York Post: "Borgen, who was wearing a yarmulke, was pepper-sprayed by a pack of men as they hurled antisemitic slurs at him while beating him in an attack captured on video that later went viral. He said he still suffers from post-traumatic-stress-disorder and wrist pain as a result of the attack, which left him with a concussion and other injuries."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare nugget of information about the famously enigmatic street art superstar Banksy emerged Tuesday when he gave his first name as "Robbie" in an unearthed 2003 BBC interview.
In the interview, one of the few known to exist with the global art phenomenon, he is asked if his name "Robert Banks", to which he replies: "It's Robbie."
His identity has long been the source of speculation, with some claiming his name was Robin or Robert Banks.
Banksy talks about his distinctive stencilling style in the interview, a podcast bonus part of a series called "The Banksy Story".
"It's quick... I want to get it done and dusted," he is heard to say of his work.
The artist was in his 20s at the time, and was promoting the opening of his "Turf War" show in east London.
The series also contains a 2005 interview the artist purportedly gave with US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR).
In it, the host asks: "We assume that you are who you say you are, but how can we be sure?" The interviewee responds: "Oh, you have no guarantee of that at all."
Banksy, known to hail from Bristol in southwest England, boasts an A-list client list and has sold his works for tens of millions of pounds at auction since achieving notoriety in the early 2000s.]]></summary>

The 16-year-old high school student, identified only as Thomas, was stabbed at the weekend when a group of outsiders descended on a festive crowd of around 400 people gathered in Crepol, in the southwestern Drome region, for a dance party in the village hall.
He died on his way to hospital. Eight others were injured, two of them seriously.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told parliament that seven people had been arrested and investigators would now ascertain if they were behind "this odious crime".

The country's parole board on Monday said it would be "considering the profile of Oscar Pistorius on Friday, 24 November 2023".
But even if Pistorius's application was to be successful the ex-athlete might have to wait for weeks before being let out of prison pending an "internal process" by the Department of Correctional Services (DCS), according to the Steenkamp family lawyer, Tania Koen.

North Korea's previous efforts to put a spy satellite into orbit in May and August both failed, and Seoul, Tokyo and Washington had repeatedly warned Pyongyang not to proceed with another launch, which would violate successive rounds of UN resolutions.
Seoul's military "detected at 10:43 pm (1343 GMT) one alleged military surveillance satellite launched from the Tongchang-ri area in North Pyongan province," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.

Still wearing their helmets, the men could be seen peering at the endoscopic camera sent by rescuers down a thin pipe through which air, food and water are being sent.

"Today I toured the main quarters. It was a spectacular city; I say 'was' because today more than half has been consumed by fire," the French emperor wrote.
In the missive, on sale for $58,300, he also remarked on the city's inventory of alcohol.

        <updated>2023-11-20T17:45:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who infamously peddled conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that were concocted by a woman who believes she can talk with the wind, is now floating wild conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19.
While there is still some debate over whether COVID-19 may have originated from a viral research lab in the city of Wuhan, Bartiromo on Monday took things several steps farther — and suggested that the virus was part of a deliberate plot to bring down former President Donald Trump.
During an interview with Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, "Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?"
In fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.
ALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.
Regardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to "disrupt" America to "get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden."
Wenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released "accidentally."

But even though same-sex marriages are not officially recognised in Israel, Omer Ohana has since won gay soldiers' partners the same rights to a widow's pension as married couples.
His partner Sagi Golan was killed at Beeri kibbutz on the night of October 7.
A reserve captain in the Lotar anti-terrorism unit, he decided to head to Beeri, one of the worst-hit locations, 100 kilometres (60 miles) to the south, when they learned of the attacks.
The 30-year-old "jumped out of bed, and after a minute or two already he was wearing his uniform", Ohana said.
"I made him a coffee to take with him, and we kissed," Ohana said. "I told him not to be a hero."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
