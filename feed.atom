        <updated>2024-02-22T00:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was criticized online Wednesday after social media users dragged up an old post in which she fully endorsed a now-arrested informant accused of lying about Joe and Hunter Biden of taking bribes from abroad.
Greene posted on the topic in July 2023, saying, "Joe Biden is a criminal and is compromised! And he is leading us into WW3 because Zelenskyy has proof of more Biden crimes."
"This is the FBI’s FD-1023 UNCLASSIFIED form from the FBI’s most trusted informant that reveals then VP Joe Biden took a $5 million dollar bribe from Zlochevsky to get Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired," Greene wrote at the time. "Joe delivered by withholding $1 billion in US aid until Shokin was fired."
Attached to that social media post were images purporting to show allegations made by the now-indicted claimant.
Unfortunately for Greene, the internet never forgets.

"This aged well...." said historian Heather Cox Richardson Wednesday.
Legal analyst Marcy Wheeler, of EmptyWheel, posted that it was, "Super interesting, actually, given that Smirnov was involved in talks to end the war."
National security attorney Bradley P. Moss also chimed in Wednesday.

"Hi Congresswoman," he wrote to Greene. "This person has been indicted for fabricating the whole thing, in reliance in no small part upon Russian disinformation efforts. Any comment?"
An elections podcast host, Miles W., said, "Aged like milk."
The issue of the arrest has been a thorn in the side of House Republicans, who sought to use the purported insider information in order to justify impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden. Jim Jordan has suggested that the arrest doesn't change the fundamental facts of the case against Biden, but experts have suggested the opposite is true.]]></summary>

LockBit and its affiliates have targeted governments, major companies, schools and hospitals, causing billions of dollars of damage and extracting tens of millions in ransoms from victims.
Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA), working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Europol and agencies from nine other countries in Operation Cronos, said it had infiltrated LockBit's network and taken control of its services.

Russian prosecutors have charged Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich with espionage -- the first time such a criminal accusation has been levelled against a Western reporter in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Gershkovich, his employers and the White House all reject the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.
"Gershkovich will remain in custody until March 30, 2024," the Moscow courts service said in a statement following a hearing at the Moscow City Court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump skewered Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Tuesday, saying at a Fox News town hall that he might cut ties with the minority leader upon regaining the White House. 
“He’ll probably end up endorsing me. I don’t know that I can work with him,” Trump said, as NBC News reports. “He gave away trillions of dollars that he didn’t have to, trillions of dollars. He made it very easy for the Democrats.”

The Republican bigs' bromance soured after McConnell drew a line after Jan. 6, 2021 when hordes of Trump sympathizers stormed the Capitol to thwart the certification of the presidential election to then President-Elect Joe Biden.  
McConnell likened Trump’s role in the fiasco as a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” when he, along with 42 other Republicans voted "not guilty" when he was charged of incitement of insurrection.

"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it," McConnell said at the time. "The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president."
The Republican senator added, "And having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth."
McConnell has yet to endorse Trump's third White House bid. 

It's unclear if McConnell will even seek another term in office, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-TX). 
“That’s a decision for Mitch to make," Cruz said. "Obviously, there’s a lot of bad blood between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. Mitch will have to make that decision. What I want to see is I want to see Republicans in the Senate stand and lead and fight."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Mann covers the U-S opioid and fentanyl crisis for NPR. That means he talks to a lot of people struggling with addiction. Again and again, he's heard stories of people who have succumbed to their addiction — last year 112, 000 — more than ever in history.   
But when Mann traveled to Portugal to report on that country's model for dealing with the opioid crisis, he heard a very different story. Overdose deaths in Portugal are extremely rare.
The country has taken a radically different approach to drugs – decriminalizing small amounts and publicly funding addiction services – including sites where people can use drugs like crack and heroin. 
Portugal treats addiction as an illness rather than a crime. No one has to pay for addiction care, and no one scrambles to navigate a poorly regulated recovery system. Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/chile-to-reopen-probe-into-mystery-of-poet-pablo-neruda/"/>
        <updated>2024-02-20T17:22:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chile will once again try to resolve the mystery of what really killed the Nobel laureate poet Pablo Neruda, who many believe was poisoned by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a court said Tuesday.
The appeals court ordered the reopening of the investigation into the death of Neruda, who was a prominent member of Chile's Communist Party when military dictator Augusto Pinochet took power in 1973.
In a statement, the court said that the "investigation has not been exhausted as there are precise procedures that can be carried out to clarify the facts."
Neruda had been preparing to flee into exile in Mexico to lead the resistance against the Pinochet regime when he died in hospital just 12 days after the coup.
The government claimed the 69-year-old had died of prostate cancer.
An investigation into the cause of Neruda's death began in 2011 when Manuel Araya -- his driver and personal assistant -- asserted that the poet was given a mysterious injection in his chest just before he died.
Araya died in June last year, aged 77.
In 2017, a group of Chilean and international experts concluded that Neruda did not die of cancer, but said they could not determine what did kill him.
And in 2023, a scientific panel investigating Neruda's death was also unable to determine whether he had been poisoned, even though they detected dangerous botulism-causing bacteria in his system.
Judge Paola Plaza ordered the probe to be closed in December 2023, but Neruda's family and the Communist Party appealed that decision soon after.
Neruda is remembered especially for sensual poems about love.
However, in recent years his romantic image has been tainted after his admission in his posthumous memoirs that he had raped a woman came to light after the emergence of the #MeToo movement.
Pinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years, oversaw a regime that killed some 3,200 leftist activists and other suspected opponents.
The dictator died in 2006 aged 91 without ever being convicted for crimes committed by his regime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Forward-looking family businesses have demonstrated remarkable resilience around the world, empowering them to weather market volatility and commercial shifts. These enterprises have not merely survived but thrived.  A common trait among these businesses is the founders’ foresight for strategic, long-term planning. This includes diversifying revenue streams and segregating business operations to facilitate efficient succession by future generations.   Such planning allows subsequent generations to maintain the founders’ core values and continue their legacy. It also lays a foundation for future generations to not only preserve the family wealth, but also expand the business.   Mabel Lui, Head of Greater China Commercial at Withersworldwide, an international law firm, says that a family enterprise’s key feature is ‘by the family, for the family.’  Family relationships’ complexities can sometimes spark rivalries among family members.

        <updated>2024-02-20T13:12:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter on Tuesday suspended the account of Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.
According to Sky News, it is not clear why Navalnaya's account was suspended, and her latest posts were demands to the Russian government to return her late husband's body.
The account was suspended for roughly an hour, though as of this writing, it appears to be back online.
Twitter CEO Elon Musk has a long history of attacking American foreign policy when it comes to aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia, although it's not known at this point if Musk had any role in the decision to suspend Navanaya's account.
The death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has further diminished a rapidly shrinking Russian opposition, which has seen its members assassinated, sentenced to lengthy prison terms or forced into exile as Russian President Vladimir Putin makes it clear he will not tolerate challenges to his regime.
It was widely feared that Alexei Navalny was risking his life by positioning himself as Putin’s most vocal critic in an increasingly repressive Russia, even challenging him for the presidency in 2018.
Navalny narrowly survived being poisoned with novichok – a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union – in 2020 and spent months recuperating in Germany. He earned admiration from Russia's disparate opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia the following year.
His death comes just a day before the official launch of campaigning ahead of a new round of presidential elections set for March 15-17.
Putin oversaw changes to the constitution in 2021 that will allow him to run for two more six-year terms, meaning he could stay in power until 2036. Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.
On December 8 Putin announced his candidature for re-election and is widely expected to win, given the lack of political alternatives and the Kremlin's iron grip on the state apparatus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's review of a U.S. request to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on espionage charges has been moved to June, with his lawyer telling court on Thursday the whistleblower is in poor health.
The United States has slapped 18 charges against the 47-year-old Australian, who had been hiding in London's Ecuadorian embassy for seven years until his arrest on April 12.
Sweden has since reopened a 2010 rape investigation against Assange and could file its own extradition request.
The Westminster Magistrates Court in London held a brief hearing on Thursday at which it moved the US case to June 12.
Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot referred to Assange as "not very well", with the next hearing possibly taking place at the Belmarsh prison where he is serving a separate 50-week sentence for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez was extradited to the United States Thursday to stand trial for allegedly aiding the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine to America and receiving millions of dollars in bribes.
The 53-year-old, whose 2014 to 2022 stint as president was plagued by allegations of corruption, risks spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
AFP witnessed Hernandez’s departure from an air force base in Tegucigalpa on a Drug Enforcement Administration plane destined for the United States. He is due to appear in a New York court on Friday.
Hernandez is accused of having facilitated the smuggling of some 500 tons of cocaine – mainly from Colombia and Venezuela – to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before his presidency.

Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias, who made "Pepe", one of the buzziest titles at this week's Berlinale festival, said filming the animals on location in Namibia and Colombia had been dicey for his crew.
"One time we didn't know there were hippos there and then they almost took the boat that we were in and so we almost lost the camera," the Dominican filmmaker told AFP.
"Another time a mother -- they are the most aggressive ones -- started running and the sound guy almost lost his equipment."
De los Santos Arias noted the animals can run "up to 35 kilometres (22 miles) per hour, these five tonnes of fat".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia's FSB security services said on Tuesday it had arrested a US-Russian woman suspected of treason for raising funds for the Ukrainian army.
The FSB in the central Urals city of Yekaterinburg said it had "suppressed the illegal activities" of a 33-year-old woman, a resident of Los Angeles with dual citizenship, and taken her into custody.
It said the unnamed woman had been "proactively collecting funds... which were subsequently used to purchase tactical medical items, equipment, means of destruction and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces".
Russian state news agency RIA Novosti posted a video from the FSB showing hooded officers handcuffing and escorting a woman in a white coat with a white hat pulled down over her eyes.
The FSB said she had been acting "against the security of our country" and had been supporting the Ukrainian army while in the United States.
Treason is punishable by up to life in prison under legislation toughened since the start of the military offensive.
Several US nationals are currently imprisoned in Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
He was arrested last year on espionage charges that he, his employer and the US government have rejected.
Another joint US-Russian citizen, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, is also being held in pre-trial detention.
He faces charges of failing to register as a "foreign agent" and contravening Russia's strict military censorship laws.
Former US marine Paul Whelan has been in prison in Russia since 2018, serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to negotiate a prisoner exchange to swap Russians imprisoned abroad for US citizens detained in Russia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jon Stewart decided to take some much needed reporting lessons Monday night from the "journalist" he respects the least: Tucker Carlson.


	With joy in his eyes, Stewart took out pen and paper then asked Carlson to explain how best to do his job.  Stewart then minced clips of the conservative pundit during his controversial reporting trip to Russia — which included an interview with President Vladimir Putin — with journalistic tips he gleaned.


Lie about what your job is 
Lie about what your duty is
Disguise your deception and capitulation to power as moral and noble and based in freedom.

	Stewart described Carlson's demeanor while interviewing Putin as a mixture of "shame, arousal and irregularity." He then showed a clip of Carlson responding "of course" to Putin's description of how World War II was instigated.


	Stewart asked Carlson if great journalism could include field trips. Yes, it could.


	A clip of Carlson sneering at homeless people and taking a deep inhale of bread, of course, spurred some scorn from Stewart.


	Ultimately, Stewart slammed Carlson for failing to provide important context about economic hardship and political oppression.

"I am happy to be here today and to see you," he said as he presented medals to combat troops during a ceremony at a command post near the city of Kupiansk in the war-battered Kharkiv region. 
In his daily video address released in the evening, Zelensky described the situation as "extremely difficult in several parts of the frontline."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A legal analyst is concerned that the damages Donald Trump was hit with in the fraud trial only compounds his financial problems — and presents a major security threat.
On Monday, Allison Gill of "Mueller, She Wrote" joined with co-host Dana Goldberg on "The Daily Beans" and called the fraud trial fine of $355 million a "doozy." 
Goldberg explained that Trump is going to work on getting the amount down in an appeal, but for now "it's pretty beautiful."
"Plus interest!" Gill chimed in. "So if you take the $355 [million] that Trump owes ... plus 5 percent interest, plus what he owes E. Jean [Carroll], plus 9 percent interest, also in New York, you're looking at $550 million. So, it's going to be pretty difficult."
"All I can think though, is that there's classified documents missing," Gill cautioned. 
"Humm, I know. Highest bidder," agreed Goldberg. 
"How is he going to get this money?" asked Gill. "I mean NRC [National Republican Committee] is broke, NRA [National Rifle Association] is broke, Trump's Save America PAC is bleeding cash from legal representation not just for him but his adult children, and Jared and Ivanka. So, I mean, I guess he can borrow it from Jared?" 
Last month, Trump was hit with $83.3 million in damages after being found liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. He also faces millions in legal fees associated with his four ongoing criminal trials.

On Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron slapped the $355 million demand on him after finding that he and his company inflated the value of Trump Organization properties to secure favorable loans and interest. He has also been barred from conducting business in New York for three years.

Every two months, Michelangelo's masterpiece completed in 1504 undergoes a careful cleaning at its home in Florence's Accademia Gallery, where it has resided for over 150 years.
Considered by many awestruck viewers to represent the perfect man, the 17-foot-high (5.1 metre) sculpture carved from a single block of marble stands alone under the skylight of the domed gallery on Mondays, when the museum is closed.
His personal restorer, Eleonora Pucci, climbs on a scaffolding for an up-close view -- part of a monitoring and cleaning ritual necessary for the preservation of the Renaissance icon visited by over two million visitors last year.
Despite David's good looks and Biblical heritage, the slayer of Goliath needs upkeep.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
