Rumble("play", {"video":"v1rnv1m","div":"rumble_v1rnv1m"}); WNU Editor: From Small Dead Animals (see below): 
Tarl Warwick (aka ‘styxhexenhammer666’) has a comprehensive take on how incredibly bad the FTX scandal is.  In case you’ve been sleeping under a rock, the basic scam is this: 
* The Democrats have ginned up the Ukrainian War and convinced Congress to donate billions in taxpayer money to Ukraine. 
* FTX convinced its investors that a good portion of its profits would be donated to the National Bank of Ukraine. 
* There are strong suspicions that some portion of this money sent to Ukraine was not used to fight Russia but was instead reinvested in FTX. 
* The Chief of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, was the #2 donor to the Democrats, just behind George Soros. To think that this didn’t buy him some “protection” would make you very naive. 
The fact that the legacy media is not openly reporting this massive scam is telling.   
Update: One half of The Duran provides his analysis, about 5 minutes into this video.

Washington Post: Congress seeks to arm Taiwan quickly as China threat grows 
Mindful of lessons learned from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Congress is pushing to arm and train Taiwan in advance of any potential military attack by China, but whether the aid materializes could depend on President Biden himself. 
Deliberations on an unprecedented package of billions of dollars in military assistance to the self-governing island democracy come as Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meet in Bali on Monday, with maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait a top item of discussion. 
The bipartisan effort would enable the U.S. military to dip immediately into its own stocks of weapons like Javelins and Stingers — something done at scale only for Ukraine, officials said — and provide weapons for the first time to Taiwan through the foreign military financing program, paid for by the United States.

KYIV -- Ukrainian authorities have revoked the accreditations of several international journalists over their reporting from the city of Kherson in the early hours after it was liberated by Ukrainian armed forces from Russian troops over the weekend. 
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Facebook on November 13 that the move was made because some foreign news organizations violated regulations on reporting from combat zones.

Update #2: CNN and Sky News journalists stripped of their accreditation for reporting from Kherson (Ukrainska Pravda) 
WNU editor: A friend of mine who reports on the war from the Ukraine side told me that these journalists went into Kherson without the military's approval. But what really irked the authorities was that the videos they took only showed 100 - 200 civilians going out to greet the Ukrainian forces when they entered the city. The mass majority of the residents stayed inside their homes. This ruined the media narrative of thousands showing up that they wanted. 
Even Zelensky's visit to Kherson today did not result in large crowds of people going on the streets to greet him. This was a tightly controlled PR event, and the videos that were released showed mostly close-ups or the camera was positioned at ground level. Very few if any camera shots from above looking down and giving a wide angle view.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: The human race at 8 billion 
Eight billion humans are living on planet Earth — a huge milestone officially projected for and being recognized Tuesday by the U.N. 
Why it matters: People are living longer, with generally better access to health care, food, clean water and sanitation than in past generations. A smaller share of humans live in extreme poverty. 
* There are still challenges — ongoing ramifications from the pandemic, a record number of forcibly displaced people and worsening climate change. 
“It is a momentous milestone for humanity," Natalia Kanem, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), told reporters last month. 
* "Some express concerns that our world is overpopulated with far too many people and insufficient resources to sustain their lives. I am here to say clearly, that the sheer number of human lives is not a cause for fear."

Daily Mail: Rishi Sunak labels Russia a 'rogue state': Prime Minister slams Vladimir Putin for not attending G20 summit in Bali to explain his invasion of Ukraine as he declares President 'responsible for so much bloodshed' 
* Rishi Sunak was pictured on flight to the G20 summit in Bali which starts today 
* He believes Vladimir Putin is making no effort to explain his actions in Ukraine 
* Putin will not be at the summit and is sending Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov 
* PM is expected to confront Lavrov over the invasion of Ukraine by a 'rogue state' 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak labelled Russia a 'rogue state' as he attacked President Vladimir Putin for not attending the G20 summit in Bali. 
Mr Sunak believes that the president's no-show at today's summit means the Kremlin leader is making no effort to explain his actions, despite being 'responsible for so much bloodshed in Ukraine'. 
Moscow's foreign minister and Putin's attack dog Sergey Lavrov will instead go to the G20 summit. He is expected to take a battering from leaders at today's session.

* 'They've been saying Putin is sick for last ten years,' he said in video from hotel 
* But the 72-year-old diplomat did not specifically deny visiting hospital in Bali 
* Lavrov is attending the G20 instead of Putin following his invasion of Ukraine 
Russia's foreign minister has mocked reports that he was taken to hospital with a heart problem after arriving at the G20 summit in Indonesia. 
Sergei Lavrov, 72, arrived in Bali via jet yesterday evening and was taken ill early this morning with a 'heart condition', according to local officials. 
But Lavrov, who is standing in for President Vladimir Putin at the summit, appeared in photos and videos shortly afterwards showing him sitting by his hotel pool and leafing through papers ahead of the economic conference, which begins tomorrow.

WNU Editor: It is a staged short video clip, but he looks OK. 
As for the video clip. Who wears dress shoes in shorts? 
He also has a cell phone. I would love to know the brand.

Euronews: Ukraine's 2023 budget has a $38 billion gap. Who will help cover it? 
Russia's war has ravaged Ukraine's public coffers, leaving the country with an ever-widening deficit that requires urgent foreign assistance to keep the economy afloat. 
The widespread havoc wreaked by Russian forces has triggered insolvency, brain drain, rising unemployment, soaring inflation and a drastic fall in exports, wiping away billions in revenue and tax income. 
An initial forecast by the World Bank that predicted a 35% contraction of Ukraine's GDP has worsened as a result of the Kremlin's continued attacks against key infrastructure. 
The country is now scrambling to find sources of revenues to sustain its 2023 budget, which includes a record-breaking deficit of $38 billion (€36.9 billion).   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: This deficit projection was published before Russia started to attack Ukraine's electrical grid. I would not be surprised if the real budget deficit is tens of billions more. 
These funds have to be covered. They pay the salaries for government officials and military personnel. It covers the pensions and all other bills. 
Failure to cover these bills will mean that the Ukraine government will be forced to print money. This means inflation. Maybe even hyper-inflation. This is an economic nightmare that Kyiv must avoid at all cost.   
Update: It looks like this gap is not going to be covered by the EU .... EU ‘will find it hard to look Ukraine in the eye’ after breaking financial promise (Express).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Political analyst Eric Ham says many of the advisors surrounding former US president Donald Trump are “begging” and pleading with him not to announce a bid for the presidency in 2024. 

“Ever since Donald Trump got elected in 2016, Republicans have lost the House, the White House, the Senate and now we see in this election, they have lost again massive seats,” Mr Ham told Sky News Australia.

“Not just at the national level, but also if you look at what took place at the state level, four state legislatures across the country flipped from red to blue.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Political analyst Eric Ham says pollsters and pundits in the United States “failed to recognise and pay attention to” the effect of the early vote in the midterm elections. 

“Early voting across the United States began back in October, the first week of October,” Mr Ham told Sky News Australia. 

“At that point, polls simply did not matter. What you needed to do was look at what voters were actually doing, not what they say they were going to do, what they were actually doing. And what we saw was voters in droves going to the polls early and voting.

“That’s how Democrats are able to blunt what we are seeing.”]]></summary>

Reuters: Biden says U.S., Japan, South Korea are 'more aligned than ever' on North Korea 
PHNOM PENH (Reuters) -The United States, Japan and South Korea are "more aligned than ever" on North Korea's "provocative behaviour," U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sunday, as his national security adviser promised a joint response if Pyongyang carries out a seventh nuclear test. 
Speaking in Cambodia after a trilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, Biden called their countries "critical allies" that share the United States' concerns about North Korea's missile tests. 
The three leaders issued a joint statement lauding "the unprecedented level of trilateral coordination" they had achieved, and pledged to forge even closer ties, especially in the security realm. 
Biden also underscored the "ironclad" U.S. commitment to defend both allies, the statement said.

FOX News: Secret spaceplane returns to Earth sending sonic booms across Florida 
People throughout Central Florida heard the rumble of the sonic booms Saturday. 
At first a mystery, the booms were caused by the X-37B space plane returning to Earth, landing on the old space shuttle runway at Kennedy Space Center. The landing marks the end of a more than 900-day spaceflight. 
 The sound of sonic booms across Central Florida marked the return to Earth of Boeing's X-37B, an autonomous spaceplane returning after more than 900 days in space on a U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force mission. 
People from Cape Canaveral and as far inland as Orlando heard the rumble of the sonic booms about 5 a.m. Saturday. At first a mystery, the U.S. Space Force confirms the booms were caused by the X-37B spaceplane returning to Earth, landing on the old space shuttle runway – now called Launch and Landing Facility – at Kennedy Space Center.

Washington Post: U.S. intelligence report says key gulf ally meddled in American politics 
U.S. intelligence officials have compiled a classified report detailing extensive efforts to manipulate the American political system by the United Arab Emirates, an influential, oil-rich nation in the Persian Gulf long considered a close and trusted partner. 
The activities covered in the report, described to The Washington Post by three people who have read it, include illegal and legal attempts to steer U.S. foreign policy in ways favorable to the Arab autocracy.
It reveals the UAE’s bid, spanning multiple U.S. administrations, to exploit the vulnerabilities in American governance, including its reliance on campaign contributions, susceptibility to powerful lobbying firms and lax enforcement of disclosure laws intended to guard against interference by foreign governments, these people said. Each spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.

Bloomberg: Biden to Tell Xi to Help on North Korea or Face More Drills 
(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden will warn Chinese leader Xi Jinping of an expanded US military presence in the region if Beijing doesn’t help rein in North Korean military provocations, according to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One Saturday morning shortly before Biden arrived in Cambodia, Sullivan said North Korea is a threat to the US, Japan, South Korea and to “peace and stability across the entire region.” 
Biden won’t make any demand of Xi but will share his perspective, Sullivan said. 
“If North Korea goes down this road, it will simply mean further enhanced American military and security presence in the region,” Sullivan said. “And so the PRC has an interest in playing a constructive role in restraining North Korea’s worst tendencies; whether they choose to do so or not is of course up to them.”

Breaking Defense reviewed video of the laser disabling a quadcopter UAV, part of tests that show directed energy system could be “viable.”  
WILTSHIRE, England — DragonFire, the UK Ministry of Defence’s Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW), is one step closer to becoming an operationally “viable” solution after completing its latest round of live fire tests that included targeting a small drone and metal targets designed to approximate ship and aircraft skin. 
On Tuesday, the MoD-sponsored Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) announced it had successfully completed tests of the high energy laser (HEL) at its range facility in Porton Down, Wiltshire, on Oct. 28.

The new warhead has multiple applications, further broadening the APKWS guidance kit’s flexibility. 
The Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System, or APKWS, laser guidance kit designed by BAE Systems has been tested in a surface-to-surface role with a new highly versatile, multi-purpose warhead that is capable of taking on armor and other targets. The new warhead is provided by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems. The test demonstrated added flexibility for not only the APKWS itself, which is most often employed in air-to-ground applications against more lightly armored targets, but also for all platforms that are capable of firing APKWS rockets.

Pentagon — The U.S. Air Force chief of staff is warning that the U.S. military must "change" if it wants to stay ahead of China and Russia. 
“Our adversaries have continued to advance their capabilities at the same time we’ve been using some of the same capabilities we’ve been using for the past 30 years,” Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr. told VOA in an exclusive interview this week. 
“The threat we were up against is not the threat we'll see in the future," he said. "And that's why we've got to, we've got to change." 
One Air Force change will be front and center next month, when the United States unveils its new B-21 stealth bomber on December 2. The B-21 is set to replace the Air Force’s B-1 and B-2 bombers, which have been around since the 1980s.

* The AP called Nevada race for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto on Saturday evening 
* It gives Democrats 50 seats in the Senate and means they retain control 
* Cortez Masto fought off the challenge of Trump-endorsed Adam Laxalt 
* Laxalt played a key role in trying to overturn Trump's 2020 defeat in the state 
* Chuck Schumer said voters had rejected 'extremist MAGA Republicans' 
Democrats will keep control of the Senate after multiple news organizations forecast on Saturday night that Catherine Cortez Masto would hold on to her seat.
It means Democrats have won 50 seats, enough to hold the majority with Vice President Kamala Harris's casting vote - and with one race still undecided in Georgia. 
Cortez Masto beat Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

Six people are feared dead after a historic World War II-era P-63 Kingcobra slammed into a B-17 plane in midair outside of Dallas, Texas on Saturday. 
The two World War II-era planes collided in mid-air at the Wings Over Dallas event, sending debris flying and igniting a fire nearby.

It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities in western Iran went on strike Wednesday in solidarity with mourners marking 40 days since security forces killed dozens in a crackdown on protests in the country's strife-torn southeast, a rights group said.
Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.
The crackdown on nationwide protests since her death has killed at least 304 people, including 41 children and 24 women, according to a combined toll issued…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
