The Ukrainian 'counteroffensive' in the southern Kherson region has made little progress and binds a lot of Ukrainian resources and available units. 
Despite that, and against advice from the U.S. military, Ukraine has now launched a second 'counteroffensive' in the north-eastern Kharkiv region of Ukraine. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I am skeptical of the above report. The U.S. is the country that is supplying the most weapons, actionable intelligence, and funds to Ukraine. Not the U.K. or anyone else. I am sure the U.S. has a lot of strings to this aid, and taking their advice and recommendations is one of them. 
So is the Pentagon against this second counter-offensive? Maybe. But in this case my gut is telling me that it is the US State Department and the White House that is pushing this new front, and they outrank the Pentagon.]]></summary>

Risky assets have come under selling pressure in recent days as investors fear the Federal Reserve will continue its aggressive tightening policy. 
FedWatch CME Tool shows that the probability of a 75 basis point rate hike at the September meeting has risen to 80% from 69% a week ago.  This prolonged the rise of the US dollar index (DXY), which closed above 110 on September 6. 
US stock markets and cryptocurrency markets attempt a relief rally on September 7, but the recovery is only expected to continue after the DXY shows signs of bottoming out.

It’s not easy to persuade this column to watch tennis, but the task becomes easier when the US Open features classic American history.  As I write, Frances Tiafoe of the United States is about to start her quarter-final match against Russia’s Andrey Rublev.  Whatever the turn of the day, Mr. Tiafoe provided a refreshing example of courage in a country still teeming with opportunity. 

Watching the US Open can be particularly difficult because, no matter what religion one reads the New York Post’s …]]></summary>

Modified: 06/09/2022 19:52:11



In recent Gazette coverage of the annual Town/Robe Breakfast, the Chancellor was quoted, comparing UMass Amherst to other college towns, in terms of the number of students each school provides housing for, for show that UMass has a large percentage of students on campus, and therefore they are not responsible for the imbalances this causes in Amherst, with outside investors buying several houses, which then prevents families from moving here.
Amherst has a population of 40,000, more than half of whom are students.  That means we’re a city of 20,000 year-round residents.
And half of the homes in Amherst are rentals, most of which are student rentals, many of which are overcrowded, overpriced and poorly maintained.  I recently received another call from a telemarketer, hoping to persuade me to sell my house to a certain investment company.
Chancellor compared Amherst to the college towns of Bloomington, Indiana (population 84,691), College Station, Texas (population 115,802) and St Paul/Minneapolis (population 730,413).
    This is clearly a false equivalence.  We are the second smallest city in the nation to house a flagship state university.  That’s great for the city in many ways, but there are other repercussions that UMass shouldn’t sweep under the rug.
I urge the leaders of city and university government to have the robust and urgent conversations needed to resolve the issue fairly and effectively.  It’s one of those “if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem” thing.

A medieval-inspired luxury home in New York’s Tony Hamptons – one that looks like it’s straight out of the HBO animated series”Dragon House— caught the attention of deep-pocketed show fans wanting to make it their own, according to Jam Press.
The outlet notes that they believe they have made offers to buy it, but the owner won’t budge.
That owner is Sir Ivan Wilzig – the music producer, reality TV star, banking heir and philanthropist – who moved into “the Castle” in 1997. (Wilzig and his brother, Alan, created the broadcast after buying 5 acres of land from Water Mill for less than $1 million in 1995.)

* An Army general warns that young Americans are either too fat or criminal to join the armed services, as recruitment numbers run to historic lows 
* Lt. Gen Xavier Brunson said young people are unqualified to enlist due to obesity or pre-existing medical conditions 
* Only 23 percent of people of age to serve are physically eligible to enroll 
* The Army won't meet its 2022 recruitment goal of 485,000 - falling short by a staggering 20,000 recruits 
* Smaller recruitment numbers come after the Army announced all soldiers must receive the COVID-19 vaccine 
Recruitment numbers for the Army are at historic lows as Americans are either too fat or criminal to join the defend the country, an Army general warned. 
 Lt. Gen Xavier Brunson, the commander of Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, theorized as to why recruitment is so low following a July statement from the Army that announced it wouldn't meet its 485,000 recruitment goal for 2022, falling short by a staggering 20,000 recruits. 
Officers across the country are failing to meet recruitment numbers as fewer youth are qualified to serve, which some blame on the COVID-19 pandemic.

RFE: U.S. Military Announces Test Launch Of ICBM, Notifies Russia 
The U.S. military will test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on September 7, the Pentagon says, adding that Russia has been notified. 
A Pentagon spokesman described the test as routine and said it was meant to demonstrate the readiness of the U.S. military's nuclear forces and "provide confidence in the security and effectiveness of the nation's nuclear deterrent." 
It will be the second test launch of the country's nuclear defenses in less than a month. The last occurred on August 16 and tested a Minuteman III ICBM that carried a test reentry vehicle, which in a strategic conflict could be armed with a nuclear warhead. The vehicle traveled about 6,760 kilometers to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific.

Bloomberg: Xi, Putin to Meet for First Time Since War at Summit in Uzbekistan 
(Bloomberg) -- Xi Jinping will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in-person for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Tass reported, as the two authoritarian leaders push back against rising geopolitical pressure from the US. 
Xi will sit down with Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit that runs from Sept. 15-16 in Uzbekistan, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrey Denisov said Wednesday, according to the state-run news agency. 
“We are planning a serious, full-fledged meeting of our leaders with a detailed agenda, which we are now, in fact, working on with our Chinese partners,” Denisov told reporters, according to the report.  Xi is also expected to travel to neighboring Kazakhstan on Sept. 14 for a state visit. Beijing has not confirmed either trip.

Reuters: Russia says United States is behind Europe's gas supply crisis 
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the United States had fomented Europe's gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the "suicidal" step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. 
Europe is facing its worst gas supply crisis ever, with energy prices soaring and German importers even discussing possible rationing in the European Union's biggest economy after Russia reduced gas flows westwards. 
When asked what needed to happen for Nord Stream 1 to begin pumping again, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters: "Listen, you are asking me questions that even children know the answer to: those who started this need to finish this."

European households should brace for an expensive winter owing to the continent’s deepening energy crisis that will likely send electricity and heating bills soaring. 
Energy affordability in Europe is reaching a “tipping point” that could peak next year, with total spending on bills across the continent growing by 2 trillion euros ($2 trillion), a Goldman Sachs research team, led by Alberto Gandolfi and Mafalda Pombeiro, said in a note published Sunday.

WNU Editor: To prevent massive social unrest EU governments are going to impose a price cap on prices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new lease for Shinhan Bank of South Korea brought occupancy to 91% at 750 Seventh Ave.  The 15,279 square foot deal takes up the entire 26th floor.
The 36-story tower recently underwent major capital improvements by owner FosterLane Management, including two floors of tenant-only amenities.
CBRE’s Howard Fiddle, Brett Shannon, Arkady Smolyansky, Evan Fiddle and Jacob Rosenthal replaced the owner.  Howard Fiddle praised the building as “one of the best locations in Manhattan”.  Upper floors feature floor-to-ceiling windows, 13-foot ceiling heights, and panoramic views.  
Matthias Li and Cole Chartash of Cushman & Wakefield replaced Shinhan.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and United States have ramped up buying key industrial metals from Russia, data showed, despite logistical problems spurred by the war in Ukraine and tough talk about starving Moscow of foreign exchange revenue. 
The metal shipments highlight the West's difficulty in pressuring Russia's economy, which has performed better than expected and seen its rouble currency surge as buoyant oil revenue has helped offset the impact of sanctions. 
EU and U.S. imports of Russia's main base metal products aluminium and nickel during March-June increased by as much as 70%, official trade data compiled by Reuters from the United Nations Comtrade database show. 
The total value of EU and U.S. imports of the two metals from March to June were $1.98 billion, the data showed. 
The West has imposed repeated waves of sanctions on a wide range of Russian products, people and institutions, but has largely spared the industrial metals sector.

Many of the Conservative-supporting papers focus on Truss's message that she will "deliver" as the country reels from a series of crises. One tabloid, the Daily Star, calls this the "end of an error", referring to Johnson's hapless hold on power. Another tabloid, the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror, dismisses Truss's leadership victory as just the "same old Tories".]]></summary>

* “I have said this a number of times now over this year and I’m educating also policymakers. Look, the worst is still to come,” Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told CNBC on Tuesday at Gastech 2022 in Milan. 
* Russia’s state-owned energy giant, Gazprom, on Friday indefinitely halted gas flows to Europe via a major pipeline, stoking fears that parts of the Continent could be forced to ration energy through winter. 
* Uniper, as Germany’s biggest importer of gas, has been hit hard by vastly reduced flows via pipelines from Russia, which have sent prices soaring. 
German energy giant Uniper on Tuesday warned the worst is still to come as concerns over Russian gas supplies to Europe through fall and winter continue to push up prices. 
“I have said this a number of times now over this year and I’m educating also policymakers. Look, the worst is still to come,” Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble at Gastech 2022 in Milan. 
“What we see on the wholesale market is 20 times the price that we have seen two years ago — 20 times. That is why I think we need to have really an open discussion with everyone taking responsibility on how to fix that,” he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin was shown in an awkward encounter with his military chief of staff on Tuesday as he inspected war games in Russia's Far East, thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine. 
The Zvezda military news service published video of Putin and chief of staff General Valery Gerasimov entering an observation booth, sitting down with a wide space between them and maintaining an uncomfortable silence while waiting for Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to arrive. 
Gerasimov stroked his hair and shuffled papers and Putin picked up and peered through a pair of binoculars, at one point acknowledging a comment from the general by nodding tersely. 
The awkward body language drew scrutiny from political and military analysts on social media.

He also said that Moscow has “vast plans” in terms of rebuilding Donbass, which has ended up being the main battlefield in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Freshwater Strategy Director Dr Michael Turner says there could be a bit of a problem if outgoing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson decides to “stick around” in parliament.

Dr Turner said incoming UK prime minister Liz Truss gave a nod to Mr Johnson during her victory speech. 

“In part, I think that is a signal to say that she is going to respect his legacy,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“But I also think there could be a bit of a problem if Boris decides to stick around in parliament.”]]></summary>

“There’s over a dozen different investigations into his conduct in office, in leaving office,” she said. 

However, Mr Trump’s request to have a “special master” appointed to review documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate by the FBI has been approved by a US federal judge in Florida.

This has the potential to “hamper” the Department of Justice’s investigation into the former president, according to Ms Nielsen.]]></summary>

RT:  NATO struggling to supply winter uniforms to Ukraine – Der Spiegel 
Kiev has reportedly asked the military bloc to urgently provide it with hundreds of thousands of uniforms and other equipment 
NATO members have been scraping the barrel in their efforts to supply Ukraine with sufficient winter uniforms and field camp equipment, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday. 
Kiev has apparently called on the bloc to urgently provide the necessary equipment before the cold weather sets in. 
According to Der Spiegel, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov wrote a letter to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg back in late July, calling on the military alliance to provide cold-proof field tents along with clothing for as many as 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers. 
The uniforms and equipment should be delivered as quickly as possible, the minister added, according to the magazine.

Reuters: Putin approves new foreign policy doctrine based on 'Russian World' 
LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a "Russian World", a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers. 
The 31-page "humanitarian policy", published more than six months into the war in Ukraine, says Russia should "protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World". 
While presented as a kind of soft power strategy, it enshrines in official policy ideas around Russian politics and religion that some hardliners have used to justify Moscow's occupation of parts of Ukraine and support for breakaway pro-Russian entities in the east of the country.
"The Russian Federation provides support to its compatriots living abroad in the fulfillment of their rights, to ensure the protection of their interests and the preservation of their Russian cultural identity," the policy said.

TASS: Gazprom’s production not falling, but rising, Putin says  
The Russian leader pointed out that the replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential 
PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, September 5. /TASS/. Gazprom’s production is not falling, but it is even rising, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. 
"Gazprom’s production is not falling, or you will scare everyone now, but [it is] only rising," he said at a meeting devoted to Kamchatka’s social and economic development after Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that as a program for Kamchatka’s gasification and field development was adopted 15 years ago Novatek started production, but the resource base was not confirmed, which caused a decline in production over the past years. The replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential, he added.

WNU Editor: Some differ with Putin's Gazprom assessment .... Russian state-energy giant Gazprom saw its natural-gas production in July slump to its lowest level since 2008 (Insider). 
As to what is my take. 
Gazprom's export of natural gas has declined this summer because of pipeline and turbine issues, and with Nord Stream 1 now shut down indefinitely, its production will fall even more. But I think this is temporary. There is now a push to export natural gas to energy hungry countries in Asia .... Gazprom discussing accelerated redirection of gas supplies eastward — Energy Minister (TASS). Ditto with oil production/exports .... Russia able to adapt to EU oil embargo — Energy Minister (TASS).]]></summary>

RT: Ditching Russian gas no way to reach climate goals – Putin 
EU should have been better prepared for its green energy transition, the Russian president says 
The EU’s decision to slash natural gas imports while trying to reach climate goals was a mistake, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday during an environmental forum in Kamchatka in Russia’s Far East. 
“First, they (EU) jumped ahead, and then, after cutting off Russian gas supplies, returned everything that was reviled,” Putin stated. 
He emphasized that all nations are in favor of reducing emissions into the atmosphere, noting however that everything should be done in a timely manner. “And if you jump ahead, get cheap Russian gas, and then cut off the supply of this gas yourself and immediately switch back to everything that was previously condemned, including coal-fired generation, this, of course, is not the best option for solving global problems,” the Russian president said.

Pro-Russian forces are to blame for the protest against the Czech government’s foreign and economic policy in which 70,000 people gathered, according to Czech conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala. 
The event was organised by radical political groups, including Communist Party and Freedom and the Direct Democracy Party. 
Organisers criticised the high energy prices and the pro-Western course of the current government. They also demanded short-term contracts for cheap gas and oil supplies or replacement of the management of the public TV and Radio broadcasters. 
The demonstration was called “Czechia First”. Some participants carried anti-EU or anti-NATO banners.
