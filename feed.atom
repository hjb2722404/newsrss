The underdog made a comeback. But these three questions will determine the future of the war.
 Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russia has defied the odds, and it has sent Russian President Vladimir Putin to a new point of desperation. 
On October 10, Russia rained dozens of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and some nine other cities, many deep into the country and away from the battlefield. The strikes killed at least 14 people and injured more than 90 others, according to Ukrainian officials, and in the days since, Russia has continued to strike…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of Justice Department prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.
Bloomberg reports:
A group of Justice Department prosecutors believe there is enough evidence to charge Donald Trump with obstruction of justice, but the path to an actual prosecution is far from clear.
The team as part of the classified records investigation has yet to make a formal recommendation to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who would ultimately approve or reject the move, according to people familiar with the matter. In several of Trump’s other investigations into potential crimes, officials are also unlikely to bring only obstruction charges, the people said.
Some FBI agents opposed accusing Trump because the case would be “political.” Other FBI agents supported the charges against Trump, but as Bloomberg noted, the FBI deemed it irrelevant because they didn’t make a decision on the charges.
Attorney General Merrick Garland and his team will ultimately decide whether Donald Trump is charged. The Justice Department is unlikely to bring obstruction of justice charges against Trump alone. Trump is more likely to face charges of theft, mishandling and refusal to hand over government documents.
The Justice Department will not bring any charges against Trump, and they will seek to build the best and most likely winning case before charging the former president.
Donald Trump has Multiple violations of the law before, during and after the end of his presidency. It is up to the DOJ to decide which case is most likely to result in a conviction.

The causeway, the only road connecting islanders to the rest of the state, has been severely damaged by Hurricane Ian. Temporary repairs were completed early Wednesday and access to the bridge over the causeway was restored.
“Removing bureaucratic red tape and delivering on our promise to keep Sanibel Island operational has always been a priority. By restoring access on the causeway… residents will be better able to recover from this storm,” Republican Gov. Ron R. Ron DeSantis said.
The quick completion of the repairs required 100 FDOT workers and diving teams, who put in a combined 36,000 hours of work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s its own pocket of sunshine.
Singer/songwriter Natasha Bedingfield is the latest star to buy a house in Bedford, NY.
Bedingfield and her husband, businessman Matt Robinson, recently paid $1.44 million for a five-bedroom apartmentfive-bathroom home on Mianus Bluff Drive. 
The 5,618 square foot Colonial was built in 1994 and sits on 5.57 acres;  its offerings include a chef’s kitchen that opens to a large outdoor deck as well as a library and finished basement.
Bedingfield (who was replaced by Compass broker Melissa Marcogliese) joins A-listers Matt Damon, who bought an $8.5 million four-bedroom apartment Westchester estate with his wife Luciana Barroso in July, and Ryan Murphy (once dubbed TV’s most powerful man for creating shows like “Glee” and “American Horror Story”), who bought the nearby Pound Ridge estate from Richard Gere in May for $28 million through Coldwell Banker listing broker Diane Hackert.

During the height of the pandemic in 2020, Bedingfield and Robinson sold their house in Hollywood Hills for $2.53 million — $289,000 more than requested — in less than two weeks. 
The buyer was actress Sydney Tamiia Poitier, the daughter of actors Sidney Poitier and Joanna Shimkus.

He said Ms Truss’ tax cuts caught people “off guard” and there didn’t seem to be a “solid plan”. 

“The fallout came not necessarily because the public thought that tax cuts were bad per se, but because the key stakeholders in society … reacted very badly to it, they weren’t informed,” Dr Turner told Sky News Australia. 

“And actually being Prime Minister is as much about the communications as it is about the policy, and you need to bring people with you.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says Labor’s decision to reverse the former government’s recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was “completely unnecessary”. 

“This is a completely unnecessary decision by the Albanese government, handled in the most shambolic of ways,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“If we look through what has occurred, at the last election, senior Labor figures, the Attorney-General as he is now and others, reassuring Australia’s Jewish community there was no difference between the parties in relation to their support for Israel and their position on these sorts of matters,” Mr Birmingham said. 

“Then we had leaks coming out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this week, suggesting that there was to be a change in relation to Australia’s recognition of West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital – these were then emphatically denied by Minister Wong’s office itself.
 
“And yet then hours later, we have the Minister coming out and making an announcement there has been a change in position – she did so on a holy day in the Jewish calendar, showing complete disrespect for the Israeli and Jewish communities in particular.”]]></summary>

Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced on Tuesday that Australia’s position has “always been and remains” in Tel Aviv.

Mr Birmingham said Mr Albanese should have “got on the phone” to Israel’s Prime Minister Yair Lapid before the decision was made and “consulted on the decision and advised and informed before it was being publicly announced”. 

“The test now is whether he will get on the phone and apologise for the shambolic way in which it was handled,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.

“He should be apologising for failing to at least show the basic diplomatic courtesies of engagement prior to announcement.”]]></summary>

How Trump responds to the subpoena will be interesting.Trump may shout witch hunt and try to create a lot of distractions to cover up the fact that he is afraid to appear and testify because Michael Cohen suggested.
The 1/6 committee will likely provide Trump with a live forum where he wants to testify, although reports say the committee doesn’t generally agree on these topics.
Trump’s subpoena day is approaching.
The race will begin immediately as the former president will try to run out of time and avoid testifying.
Either way, once the committee issues the subpoena, pressure on Trump will increase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW YORK — House Republicans chair Elise Stefanik said legislation on energy production, gun rights and parental rights has been drafted in hopes of Republicans gaining a House majority in the midterm elections.
The New York Republican said the Republican majority will introduce the bill in the first 100 days of the next Congress, underscoring the problems they pose to Democrats on the campaign trail.
“We’ve brought in most of the legislation. Of course, Nancy Pelosi hasn’t brought it to the floor. House Republicans will be in the first 100 days,” Ms. Stefanik said on the campaign trail in St. Lawrence County. The Washington Times said in an interview.
The GOP legislation, rooted in the conference’s “Commitment to America” ​​agenda unveiled last month, aims to achieve U.S. energy independe…]]></summary>

The warning from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy is the first official signal that Kyiv could be facing a tougher fight for funding as it fends off Russia's invasion, with bipartisan support beginning to wane in the United States.

The REPowerEU plan has been announcement in May in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had a profound impact on European energy supplies.  The Russian crisis was an opportunity “to accelerate the clean transition”, the European Commission said.

Former president donald trump is no longer in the White House, but he is still the presumed leader of the Republican Party.  His endorsements have proven key in recent primaries, and his efforts to secure the vote will be key to his party’s success.

Vote yes to question 2 to ensure dental insurance companies pay for dental care.  We are voting on four issues on the ballot this year.  I am writing to recommend that you vote yes to question 2, which requires insurance companies to spend our dollars on actual dental care, instead of executive salaries, corporate profits, and administration.  I think patient money should be spent on patient care.  A yes vote to question 2 would require dental insurance companies to spend at least 83% of our premiums on members’ dental expenses.  And it would protect against increases in dental premiums above the CPI, unless approved by the state.

Democrats here had hoped to tilt the playing field in their favor, but after a Republican lawsuit and a court ruling, the state ended up with a more neutral map for the next decade.  The new lines have already caused heartburn-inducing primaries for Democrats this summer, and could bring more twists in the critical midterm elections in November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Biden says the conservative Supreme Court majority and extremist Republicans are about to discover women’s political power.
Video of President Biden:

The president said: “With Dobbs’ decision, the court actually dared women to move on, lead, be heard. In my opinion, one of the most unusual parts of the decision was when most wrote, “Women are not without Suffrage or political rights”. Let me tell you one thing. The courts and extreme Republicans have spent decades trying to overthrow Luo. They’ll know in a minute.”
Biden later added: “The only way to stop these extremist laws that endanger women’s health and rights is for Congress to pass a law, I said in court nearly 50 years ago that Roy was right and I believe Congress should codify Roy once and for all.”
Biden said that if more Democrats are elected to the House and Senate, “If we do that, here’s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. When Congress passes it, and I will sign it in January, 50 years after Roy first decided the land law, “Together we will restore the right of choice for every woman on this land.  “
Speaker Pelosi dismisses Andre Mitchell’s GOP talking points on midterms When Mitchell tried to claim that voters were more interested in the economy and crime than choice.
Biden is right. Republicans are about to discover the political power of women who make up the majority of the country, and when they flex their political muscle, the repercussions will be felt across the country.
Polls have consistently underestimated women’s turnout in special elections. If the trend continues on Election Day, the president will be vindicated and Democrats can retain their one or two majorities in Congress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Officials confirmed that their plane crashed at a car dealership in Marietta, Ohio, Tuesday morning, killing two people.
The plane crashed in the dealership parking lot just after 7 a.m., and the Ohio Highway Patrol said the dealership and some vehicles in the parking lot were damaged.
Officials said no one else was injured.
The 1974 Beechcraft King Air E90 took off from Columbus at 6:35 a.m. for Parkersburg, West Virginia.
Marietta is a town of approximately 13,000 people in southeastern Ohio, located north of Parkersburg on the Ohio River. The dealership is located in the main business district of the town. Some Marietta residents said they were awakened by the crash and saw a cloud of smoke rising into the sky.

The fire at the crash site has been extinguished by firefighters.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have launched an investigation into the cause of the crash.
                        
The names of the pilots and passengers killed in the crash have not been released.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James Bond actor Daniel Craig on Tuesday received the same honor held by his fictional character, as he is set to retire from the role.
The 54-year-old British actor who played Bond for the fifth and final time in 2021 film "No Time To Die", was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, a rare honor that author Ian Fleming bestowed on his fictional agent.
Craig bowed his head and smirked as Princess Anne, wearing naval uniform, put the order on its ribbon around his neck during an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The actor received the honor for his outstanding contribution to film and theatre.
Craig was in the British capital for the European premiere of whodunnit drama "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery", which closed the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday.
"We've been expecting you", the royal family's official Twitter account captioned its photograph, quoting a line famously used by a Bond villain.
James Bond was said to have received the honor in his obituary in "You Only Live Twice," Ian Fleming Publications tweeted.
It was not the first time Craig reprised his Bond role with the royal family in on the joke.
He donned a tuxedo to film a spoof clip with Queen Elizabeth II and her corgis for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Games Olympics hosted by London. .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu released his memoir Tuesday, reaffirming an ambition to return to power in the coming elections and retracing his up-and-down relations with US presidents.
Netanyahu, also commonly known as Bibi, is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, with a first term from 1996 to 1999 and an unprecedented 12-year stretch until 2021.

Between the two presidential rounds, Bolsonaro is blowing hot and cold on the issue – making threats to galvanize his base, then backing down to reassure undecided voters. If re-elected, however, the far-right president could well find the numbers to make changes to the court.
The outcome of the bitter contest between Bolsonaro and social democratic ex-president Lula Inacio de Silva is hard to predict, ahead of the second round of Brazil’s presidential election on October 30.

The main suspect, identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders, was questioned earlier Monday alongside an older man suspected of sheltering her.
The 24-year-old has been charged with the rape and murder of a minor aged under 15 along with torture and abuse, the source said.
A judge ordered that she be held in provisional custody.
Prosecutors said in a press release Monday that under questioning, the woman made "varying statements, switching between admitting and denying the facts of the case."
But she eventually said she had brought the girl -- identified only by her first name, Lola -- …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Russia's Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from "our enemy", a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament's lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.
"Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy," Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.
Russia uses the term "special military operation" to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.
The move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.
They were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.
Another deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the "special military operation". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.
"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies," Svintsov said.

Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said Australia "will always be a steadfast friend of Israel" and was committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestine coexist in peace within internationally recognized borders.

The protesters claimed that all the evicted students were women in a move that comes as the Taliban has increasingly restricted girls' access to education.
"Today's protest was for girls who have been expelled," organizer Zholia Parsi told AFP after Taliban forces dispersed the rally.
Organizers also called for the reopening of girls' secondary schools, which have been shut since the Taliban returned to power last year.
In several cities, women have staged sporadic protests against harsh restrictions imposed by the hardline Islamists.

The proof of stake (PoS) blockchain has seen millions of investments from venture capitalists and previously claimed the ability to process 160,000 transactions per second (TPS).
However, some community members have pointed out that the claimed TPS is well below expectations on the mainnet.
According to the Aptos blockchain explorer, the network is seeing around 4 TPS at the time of writing, while some Twitter users have reported not being able to send transactions.
Others on Twitter noticed Aptos Discord was shut down for a few hours after the mainnet launched, accusing the team of trying to shut down discussions abou…]]></summary>

He’s a wizard on the basketball court, at least. 

For the Brooklyn Nets (when he’s playing), Irving is one of the toughest players to keep.  It’s lightning fast, can stop and start in no time, and has an unparalleled layup package.  He’s literally what kids call these days, “a walking bucket.” 

But something happened to the New Jersey native.  It’s something that can happen to anyone when they go too far down the rabbit hole and can’t find their way back. 

The NBA champion has apparently become the Black Alex Jones.

Or playing basketball Dr Umar Johnson.

Irving is a conspiracy theorist who has read a few books that aren’t even that deep into the conspiracy theory playbook.  Then he started spouting nonsensical, ill-informed “hotepian” nonsense (think “Harr…]]></summary>

“I have always opposed my party to opposing reckless spending. I will do it again and again. We need people who say no,” the Republican said in his second term. 
Lee has repeatedly pointed to his voting record and twice told the Utah Valley University audience that he voted less in line with Trump than all but two Republican senators – Rand Paul and Susan Collins. 

“To suggest that I’m indebted to either party, that I’ve been a bootlicker for either party, is crazy. And it’s contradicted by the simple facts,” Lee said.

“Criminal businesses are finding that UI fraud is a low-risk, high-reward crime,” the inspector general said.  “They invest their fraudulent UI proceeds in other criminal activities, such as buying guns and drugs.”
The office, contacted by The Washington Times, declined to elaborate on the crimes, but did point to the Justice Department indictment.

In the seventh episode, she's fighting with her former friend/current stepdaughter Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy), and eventually slices open Rhaenyra's arm with a knife. The ostensible source of Alicent's outrage is that Rhaenyra's son took our her son's eye in an otherwise childish brawl. But the rant exposes her deeper motive: plain old envy. Alicent and Rhaenyra were friends growing up, but turned on each other when their lives took very different paths. Alicent was married off to King Viserys (Paddy Considine), Rhaenyra's father. She must spend the rest of her days in a lovele…]]></summary>

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Russian missile struck an apartment building in the Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv early on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said, the latest strike on a city hours after the United States warned that it would hold Russia accountable for war crimes.

A fire crew pulled the dead body of a man from the rubble, the witness said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. 
The Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. 
“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”
The official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”
The FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. 
"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”
“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States said Monday that it had confidence in Pakistan's ability to control its nuclear arsenal after President Joe Biden expressed alarm, leading Islamabad to summon the US ambassador.
"The United States is confident of Pakistan's commitment and its ability to secure its nuclear assets," State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
"The US has always viewed a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests and, more broadly, the US values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan," he said.
Biden made the off-the-cuff remarks on Pakistan's nuclear program Thursday while at a private Democratic Party fundraiser in California where he began to discuss challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China, a close ally of Pakistan.
"And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion," Biden said, according to a White House transcript.
Pakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a "responsible nuclear state" and that it takes safety measures "with the utmost seriousness."
US officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan's Taliban.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden's remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.
But Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.
Patel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.
"This is a relationship we view as important and it's something that we're going to continue to remain deeply engaged in," he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.
In an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned "peace plan" between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine's continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.
"This is a classic Putin play," she said of Musk's recent attempts to interject himself as a "peacemaker" between Russia and Ukraine. "Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin."
Hill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.

"He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process," she explained. "He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian-launched "kamikaze drones" attacked Kyiv early Monday, the Ukrainian presidency said, describing the strikes as an act of desperation nearly eight months into a war that has claimed thousands of lives.
Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv shortly before the first explosion at around 6:35 am (0335), followed by sirens across most of the country.
"The capital was attacked by kamikaze drones," the president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.
"The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation," he added.
"We need more air defense systems and as soon as possible. More weapons to defend the sky and destroy the enemy."
The attacks come exactly a week after Russia unleashed a massive wave of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital and cities across the coun…]]></summary>

But few were prepared for the scale of the sound and fury – least of all Truss herself.
In just six weeks, the prime minister’s libertarian economic policies have triggered a financial crisis, emergency central bank intervention, multiple U-turns and the firing of her Treasury chief.
Now Truss faces a mutiny inside the governing Conservative Party that leaves her leadership hanging by a thread.
Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon fumed on Sunday that the last few weeks had brought “one horror story after another.”
“The government has looked like libertarian jihadists and treated the whole country as kind of laboratory mice on which to carry out ultra, ultra free-market ex…]]></summary>

"We are astonished by the accusations that the kingdom is standing with Russia in its war with Ukraine," the Saudi defense minister, Prince Khaled bin Salman, tweeted late Sunday.
The Saudi-led OPEC+ cartel -- which includes Russia -- has angered Washington by deciding to cut production by two million barrels per day from November, adding further pressure on soaring crude prices.
"It is telling that these false accusations did not come from the Ukrainian government," Prince Khaled wrote. "Although the OPEC+ decision, which was taken unanimously, was due to purely economic reasons, some accused the k…]]></summary>

EU border agency Frontex confirmed to AFP the arrival of the group in circumstances which the Greek ministry for civil protection said sent out an "inhuman image."
"The Frontex officers reported that the migrants were found almost naked and some of them with visible injuries," said Paulina Bakula, spokeswoman for the organization.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet that it was "deeply distressed by the shocking reports and images of 92 people, who were reported to have been found at the Greek-Turkish land border, stripped of their clothes".

Stormy US-Saudi relations have seen new strain over Riyadh's recent support for oil production cuts, with Biden warning of unspecified "consequences."
The move last week by OPEC+ -- composed of the Riyadh-led OPEC cartel and an additional group of 10 exporters headed by Russia -- would reduce global output by up to two million barrels per day from November.
It could send energy prices soaring amid an energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, and as inflation-weary American voters prepare to cast ballots in midterm elections.

Lula attacked Bolsonaro as the "king of fake news," drawing accusations of lying, corruption and a "disgraceful" record in return, as the rivals sparred in the first debate for their polarizing second-round showdown on October 30.
Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-president (2003-2010) who is seeking a comeback at 76, was particularly fiery criticizing Bolsonaro over his handling of Covid-19, which has killed 687,000 people in Brazil, second only to the United States.

Near the southern border with Equatorial Guinea, eight villages have registered complaints with the Campo Ma'an national park, a vast area of virgin forest from where the animals emerge.
An estimated 500 gorillas and more than 200 elephants -- both endangered species -- roam the reserve's 264,000 hectares (652,000 acres).
A week after elephants flattened his banana plantation close by the park, Simplice Yomen, 47, is struggling to cope.
"We are at the end of our tether," he sighs.
The elephants eat the new growth inside the banana tree trunks after splitting them open.
