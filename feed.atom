"Once you've got sizeable jurisdiction, like for example the European Union and a number of others, legislating for a global minimum tax ... it becomes self-defeating and counterproductive for other countries not to follow suit," Mr Cormann told Sky News Australia.

President Wickremesinghe is an ally of the president who protesters just forced out. 
 Ranil Wickremesinghe is the interim president of Sri Lanka per a parliamentary vote, after an unprecedented popular protest brought down former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s administration. But while naming an interim president may help the country manage some of its staggering debt, it’s unlikely to bring about the kinds of change protestors demand.
Gotabaya appointed Wickremesinghe prime minister in May after his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned from the post durin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: British spy chief says Russia is about to 'run out of steam' in Ukraine, opening the door for Ukrainian forces to 'strike back' 
* The UK's spy chief said Russia is likely to "run out of steam" in Ukraine soon. 
* He said this will give Ukraine an opportunity to strike back against invading forces. 
* Other military and Russia experts have offered similar assessments as the conflict morphs into a war of attrition. 
The Russian military offensive in Ukraine will likely lose momentum in the near future, offering Ukrainian forces an opportunity to "strike back," Richard Moore, chief of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), said on Thursday at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. 
"I think they're about to run out of steam," Moore said of the Russians. "They will have to pause in some way, and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back." 
Moore said that it's important for Ukrainian morale that they "demonstrate their ability to strike back."

MI6 head Richard Moore is also saying the Russian Army is exhausted. That may be true, but from what I am seeing it is the Ukraine Army that is looking exhausted.

Bussiness Insider: Zelenskyy says there's no point in negotiating with Russia until it gets 'smashed in the face' and all Ukrainian territories are liberated 
* Zelenskyy told WSJ that Ukraine can't agree to a ceasefire until it takes its territory back from Russia. 
* A ceasefire "means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest," Zelenskyy said. 
* He said Russia would just resume its offensive later on after regaining strength. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a new interview with The Wall Street Journal that establishing a ceasefire in the war with Russia while allowing it to maintain control of parts of Ukraine would result in a prolonged conflict.
"Freezing the conflict with the Russian Federation means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest," Zelenskyy said, adding, "They will not use this pause to change their geopolitics or to renounce their claims on the former Soviet republics." 
Zelenskyy said Russia would use a ceasefire to regain strength and then resume its offensive against Ukraine later on.

   Moon of Alabama: Ukraine Grain Exports - Myths And Reality  
A deal between Ukraine and Russia aims to ease the global food crisis. - New York Times - Jul 23, 2022       
BRUSSELS — Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement in Istanbul on Friday to free more than 20 million metric tons of grain stuck in blockaded Black Sea ports in Ukraine, a deal aimed at bringing down soaring grain prices and alleviating a mounting global hunger crisis. 
The highlighted claims are as false as much of the other NYT reporting on Ukraine.   
Ukraine grain exports reach 47.2 million tonnes so far for 2021-22 - World-Grain.com - Jun 6, 2022   
KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine has exported 148,000 tonnes of grain in the first five days of June, pushing its July to June 2021-22 marketing year total to 47.2 million tonnes, the country’s agriculture ministry said on June 6, Reuters reported. 
The ministry said the total volume included 18.578 million tonnes of wheat, 22.4 million tonnes of corn and 5.7 million tonnes of barley, with corn shipments dominating the June start, Reuters reported.     ...     Ukraine reached 54.9 million tonnes of wheat, corn and barley exports in 2019-2020, but dipped to 44.9 million tonnes in 2020-21, mostly on lower wheat production, according to the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Feb. 1 Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) quarterly report. 
Before Russia's invasion, Ukraine had been projected to export 63.7 million tonnes of the grains in 2021-22. 
The above numbers are more than 6 weeks old. Back then the difference between projected exports and exports up to June 5 was 63.7 - 47.2 = 16.5 million tons.

Daily Mail: Missiles sent to Ukrainian troops could end up on black market as criminal gangs try to intercept Western supplies 
* Security source claims gangs are entering Ukraine and paying cash for weapons 
* Only the higher-grade systems of the military aid sent to Ukraine are tracked 
* Police fear that gangs, and even terrorists, could exploit the lack of oversight 
Criminal gangs are trying to intercept Western weapons supplies sent to Ukraine amid fears they will be sold on the black market, the Daily Mail can reveal. 
British anti-tank rockets are among an estimated £7billion of military aid to have flooded the country during recent months to help repel Russia’s invasion. 
Only the higher-grade systems are tracked, prompting police to fear gangs, and even terrorists, could exploit the lack of oversight which has seen equipment ‘disappear’.

WNU Editor: The Ukraine Defense Ministry is calling concerns of Western missiles ending up on the black market as an "artificial" concern .... Amid flow of weapons to Ukraine, DefMin says black market smuggling is ‘artificial’ concern (Breaking Defense). But after saying it is an "artificial" concern, Kyiv has set up a commission to monitor arms transfers .... Ukraine invites allies to check on their weapons donations (Politico). 
As to what is my take. 
To me it is a given that a portion of these Western weapons will find itself on the Black market. There is just too much money to be made.]]></summary>

KYIV (Reuters) - The United States promised more military support for Ukraine, including drones, and is doing preliminary work on whether to send fighter aircraft, as fighting raged on in the east of the country five months into Russia's invasion.
Moscow and Kyiv signed a landmark deal on Friday to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports. However, representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the agreement ceremony in Istanbul, reflecting wider enmity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Friday's agreement as unlocking around $10 billion worth of grain exports, needed to ease a food crisis.
But on the war, he said there could be no ceasefire unless lost territory was retaken.

The U.S. will send Ukraine an additional $270 million in military assistance to help the country thwart Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, John Kirby, the White House National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, announced Friday.   
Why it matters: The new aid package, which brings the U.S. total security assistance to Ukraine to $8.2 billion since the start of the Biden administration, will include four more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 36,000 ammunition rounds for howitzer artillery pieces and 580 additional loitering munition drones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Jakubonis attacked gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during his bail reform speech on Thursday. Jakuboniswas arrested and released hours later under the state's lenient bail laws 
  
Daily Mail: How can they let him out? Fury after military vet who tried to assassinate NY governor candidate Lee Zeldin with 'Made in USA' blade is still roaming free under state's lax bail laws as politician says he's ramped up security for remainder of campaign 
* Military veteran David Jakubonis, 43, was released without bail hours after he attacked Zeldin, who, fittingly, was giving a speech on bail reform 
* Jakubonis, 43, approached the candidate on Thursday and told him: 'Okay, you're done' 
* 'The suspect will likely be right back out on the street immediately,' Zeldin predicted after the attack 
* The suspect was quickly subdued by Marine Corps combat veteran Joe Chenelly 
* Photos from the scene show authorities recovered what appeared to be a set of brass knuckles with a sharp blade in the shape of a cat 
* New York's GOP chairman blamed Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul for the attack after her campaign posted details about Zeldin's event 
A man who attempted to stab US Rep. Lee Zeldin at a New York campaign rally on Thursday is still roaming free as the New York gubernatorial candidate said his ‘guard’ was completely down when he saw the attacker approach him wearing a veteran's hat. 
'The first thing I saw was that he was wearing a hat that says he was a veteran and the way that I'm wired when I see somebody wearing a hat that is a veteran - my guard couldn't possibly be more dropped,' Zeldin said at a Friday press conference.

U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hinted that the Pentagon expressed concern her plane "would get shot down" by the Chinese if she makes a rumored visit to Taiwan this summer. 
The California Democrat is planning a trip to the self-governing island next month, a report in the Financial Times earlier this week claimed, drawing an angry response from Beijing. 
Pelosi refused to confirm the trip during a weekly press conference Thursday, saying "I don't ever discuss my travel plans."  "You never even hear me say if I'm going to London, because it is a security issue," she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General's office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
"Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense," said the statement.
"Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime."
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira's heart -- as a motive for the killing.

When the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, won a landslide victory in May, 2022, he went to visit the home of his mother Imelda, former first lady and wife of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
In a video showing mother congratulating son, one detail in Imelda’s opulent home stood out. On the wall, was a distinctive painting of an abstract nude rendered in blues and greens, on a red and orange bed. It was unmistakably Pablo Picasso’s “Femme Couchée VI”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department issued two general licenses on Friday authorizing certain transactions related to Russia sanctions.
One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury's website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's nuclear regulator on Friday formally approved a plan to release more than a million tonnes of treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean.
The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO's plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the "reliability and transparency of its handling".
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a sprawling landfill near Madrid, hundreds of white storks dodge garbage trucks as they look for scraps of food among the mountains of multicoloured garbage bags.
The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
"For us they are part of the landscape," said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones "where there is fresh garbage," he added.

The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned "Iroojlaplap", or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a "Kailoojoj" in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.
The blowing of a conch shell heralded each stage of the elaborate ceremony, whic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.
Biden on Thursday insisted he was "doing great", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery," Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the "next ten days", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: "Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia and Ukraine are due Friday to sign an elusive agreement designed to resume grain shipments across the Black Sea for the first time since the Kremlin's invasion in February.
Here is what we know about the deal:
Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.
Its location in Istanbul is both a nod to Turkey's central location and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's key role in resolving a dispute which has often seemed to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has extended her lead over fellow candidate Rishi Sunak in the bid for UK’s top job as prime minister after a poll of Conservative Party members revealed she was the strong favourite. 

The poll showed 62 per cent of Tory members would vote for Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and 38 per cent would go for Mr Sunak.  

“The thing about me is what you see is what you get,” Ms Truss said. 

“I’ve always been honest with people about what I can deliver, I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I will completely level with the public about, first of all, how tough things are going to be. 

“But also, the hope that they can have about the future because I have a positive vision for Britain, and I will be helping families immediately with the cost of living.”]]></summary>

Reuters: Iran doesn't want a nuclear deal, British spy chief says 
ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) -Britain's spy chief said on Thursday he was skeptical that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei actually wants to revive a nuclear deal with world powers but said Tehran won't try to halt talks either. 
Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) known as MI6, said he still believed that reviving the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement was the best way to constrain Iran's nuclear program.  Under the deal, Iran had limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.

London (CNN)Boris Johnson will be succeeded as prime minister of the United Kingdom by either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss after the Conservative Party leadership race was on Wednesday narrowed down to the final two candidates. 
Johnson resigned as party leader earlier this month after a series of scandals led to dozens of ministerial resignations. Ten Conservatives stood in the contest to replace him, and over five rounds of voting, members of parliament whittled those down to two. 
Sunak won 137 votes and Truss got 113 votes in the final round, while Penny Mordaunt with 105 votes lost out. 
Both of the final two candidates took to Twitter to comment on the result.

   Daily Mail: Moment blade-wielding assailant tries to STAB NY gubernatorial hopeful Lee Zeldin at Rochester campaign rally before group of onlookers manage to subdue attacker: Unhurt candidate immediately retakes stage to finish speech 
* Republican gubernatorial candidate for New York Lee Zeldin was in the midst of a speech on bail reform at a VFW when he was attacked 
* A man went on stage from behind Zeldin and told the GOP hopeful: 'Okay, you're done' 
* The suspect was quickly subdued by Marine Corps combat veteran Joe Chenelly 
* Photos from the scene saw authorities recover a sharp pair of brass knuckles 
* New York's GOP chairman blamed Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul for the attack after her campaign posted details about Zeldin's event 
New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin was nearly stabbed at a campaign rally on Thursday in Perinton, New York, a small town just outside of Rochester. 
The Republican was in the midst of a speech at VFW location about bail reform as part of his 'United to Fire Hochul' campaign when he was confronted. 
Video from the scene shows the suspect enter the stage from slightly behind Zeldin, walk calmly up to him and eventually raise up his arm towards the candidate's upper body.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailers for Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” one of the summer’s most anticipated movies, have raised some intriguing questions.  Is it a western?

In a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey the Duke of Sussex revealed that prior to the birth of their son, an unnamed family member asked what color baby Archie's skin would be. The Duchess said that there were "several conversations" but the Duke said “That conversation, I am never going to share. At the time, it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.”
She later explained that Harry wanted to stress that the comments did not come from his elderly grandparents.

Sputnik: Scoop: NATO Doesn’t Trust Ukraine With HIMARS, Operating Advanced Artillery Themselves, Source Says 
The US has delivered 12 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine, and the Pentagon announced Wednesday that Washington would soon send at least four more in the near future. The Russian military and the Donbass People’s Militias have accused Kiev of using the installations to strike civilian areas. 
The HIMARS mobile artillery operating Ukraine are manned by outstaffed career NATO military personnel, and information regarding the advanced weapons systems’ operation is not being transferred to the Ukrainian side due to a lack of trust, a Russian security source has told Sputnik, citing intelligence received from sources inside the Ukrainian military.

WNU Editor: A lot of bombshells in the above report. 
NATO does not trust Ukraine to operate these weapons. Manned by "out-staffed career NATO military personnel?!?!?!? Guarded by private military contractors close to the Pentagon?!?!?! Targets are being selected by US intelligence and US military personnel. 
I do not know if this report is true, but Russian media and the Russian government do believe it is true. That NATO is now directly engaged on the ground against Russian forces in Ukraine.]]></summary>

Pelosi is now the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the war, with the surprise visit adding to the growing momentum behind the West’s support for the country's fight against Russia.

Politico: Pelosi to Blinken: Label Russia as terrorist state, or else Congress will  
Her comments highlight the chasm in the actions lawmakers want the administration to take and what the secretary is comfortable doing.  
Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a message for Secretary of State Antony Blinken: Designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism — otherwise, Congress will. 
The warning, made on a call between the two earlier this week, was described to POLITICO by two sources familiar with the conversation. Spokespersons for the State Department and Pelosi’s office declined to comment. 
Congress gave the power to label another country as a state sponsor of terrorism to the secretary of state. Some in Congress, though, say lawmakers could pass a law to make the designation without the State Department, thus pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin on their own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of "I take care of Mexico," an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the "seriousness of the injuries" in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
"We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women's human rights and fight against gender-based violence," UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor's behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son's health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
"You're going to die," and "I'm going to burn you alive," the messages read.
"How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family," she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.]]></summary>

Dr. Bruno Oberle, the director-general of IUCN—the world's leading scientific authority on species conservation—said the new listing "highlights the fragility of nature's wonders, such as the unique spectacle of monarch butterflies migrating across thousands of kilometers," a reference to the insects' remarkable biannual journey across North America.
"To preserve the rich diversity of nature, we need effective, fairly governed protected and conserved areas, alongside decisive action to tackle climate change and restore ecosystems," Oberle added. "In …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla said on Wednesday that second-quarter profits fell nearly a third from the first quarter as deliveries slowed due to shutdowns and shortages of raw materials at the automaker’s Shanghai plant.
Profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, Tesla said, up from $3.3 billion in the first quarter, which was a record.  Sales fell to $16.9 billion from $18.8 billion in the first quarter.
The automaker was also hit by a sharp drop in Bitcoin price.  Tesla said in early 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency.  The company said on Wednesday that it had sold around 75% of its Bitcoin by the end of June.


Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profit almost doubled.  And earnings for the quarter beat analysts’ estimates.  But because Tesla is a fast-growing company, its progress, o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wall Street’s most talked about recession indicator is sounding its loudest alarm in two decades, heightening investor concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.
This indicator is called the yield curve, and it is a way of showing how the interest rates of various US government bonds compare., including three-month treasury bills and two- and ten-year treasury bills.
Usually, bond investors expect to be paid more for tying up their money for a long time, so interest rates on short-term bonds are lower than those on longer-term bonds.  Plotted on a graph, the different bond yields create an upward sloping line – the curve. 


But from time to time, short-term rates exceed long-term rates.  This negative relationship distorts the curve into what is called an inversion and signals that the norm…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workers who filed for a union election at a Chipotle in Augusta, Maine, accuse the company of seeking to undermine their campaign by closing the restaurant.
The company informed employees of the closure on Tuesday morning, hours before the two sides are set to take part in a hearing before the National Labor Relations Board about a possible election.
“We were unable to provide enough staff for this remote restaurant,” Laurie Schalow, the company’s director of general affairs, said in a statement.  Ms Schalow added that “due to these staffing challenges, there is no likelihood of reopening in the foreseeable future, so we have made the decision to permanently close the restaurant”.

You don’t need the help of someone familiar with the city’s 22 km of public beaches to have a perfect day.  But I recently enjoyed a tour from a dedicated guide around Brighton Beach, and was looking forward to sharing it with you all.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, endorsed the recommendation of a panel of vaccine experts who had unanimously approved the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.  The decision removes the final regulatory hurdle for the fourth Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the United States.
The Novavax vaccine is expected to play a limited role in the country’s vaccination campaign, at least initially.  Last week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized it as a primary vaccination for adults, but has not yet considered it for a booster shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Basque Country, the pandemic has reminded us how much food forms the fabric of local life.  Eating well is a priority throughout the autonomous community of northern Spain, and seems, for some local chefs, even more so now.
The region is an endless party.  Culinary destinations are available to you beyond the many Michelin-starred restaurants.  You’ll find pintxo bars littered with waxy paper napkins and people munching on savory two-bite snacks, like croquetas or Spanish tortillas, on a slice of bread and skewered with a toothpick;  and sidrerías (cider bars) nestled in the verdant mountains, with patrons slicing into a forearm-sized fire-grilled steak while sipping sparkling natural cider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES — It takes remarkable insurance to turn down $440 million.  No baseball player has ever earned so much in a single contract.  Most of us would sign eagerly.
But most of us aren’t major leaguers, and even within that tight community there’s only one Juan Soto.  Few people can match his talent, and perhaps none can match his showmanship.
Fans did not vote for Soto to start the All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday.  Five outfielders finished ahead of him in the ballot, with Ronald Acuña Jr., Mookie Betts and Joc Pederson taking the starting spots.  Soto hasn’t quite lived up to his career standards for much of this season, and his team, the Washington Nationals, has the worst record in baseball.


Still, Soto is there, and when Soto shows up at a stadium, remarkable things t…]]></summary>
