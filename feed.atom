        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: A NATO country could soon have a pro-Russian leader 
Slovakia is getting ready to elect its fifth prime minister in just four years, and with Kremlin sympathizer Robert Fico’s opposition party leading the polls, it is one being watched with alarm in the West. 
 Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Slovakia has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies. The two countries share a border, Slovakia was the first country to send air defenses to Ukraine and it welcomed tens of thousands of refugees. 
But all that could change if Fico comes to power. The former prime minister makes no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and has blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Russia’s President Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Putin has used to justify his invasion.

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year 
Russia said Thursday that it plans to raise defense spending by almost 70% next year, funneling massive resources into its Ukraine offensive to fight what it calls a "hybrid war" unleashed by the West. 
With Moscow's "special military operation" now dragging through its 20th month, both sides have been digging deep and procuring weapons from allies in preparation for a protracted conflict. 
The announcement came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the defense ministers of Britain and France visited Kyiv, where President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied for more air defense systems.

A US official confirms to Fox News Digital that US Army Private Travis King is safely in US custody

Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday called on Azerbaijan to allow international observers into Nagorno-Karabakh, to show Baku's commitment to protecting the people living there. 
US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has also underlined the need for international observers and humanitarian aid in the region in a talk with Azerbaijan's President Aliyev, Washington says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The big news that I have been hearing for the past two days from Russia is that the Russian Ministry of Defense believes if current trends continue, Russia will be well positioned to end the SMO (Special military Operation) by 2025. 
I am not that optimistic. 
In the past few days I have been reflecting on the war, and I do not see this ending in the next year or two. I see the opposite. This Ukraine counteroffensive has burned its best troops and thousands of pieces of Western equipment, and in any other situation a government would sue for peace. But the West, specifically the U.S. government and some of its allies, are hell-bent on continuing this war. They are going to continue the flow of monies and war equipment to Kyiv, even if it will mean the death of hundreds of thousands of more Ukrainians. And if President Biden is re-elected in 2024, God only knows where this conflict is going to end.]]></summary>

DW: South Korea, China and Japan make plans for rare summit 
Diplomats from Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo have met to explore restarting regular three-way summits to foster regional cooperation. 
The initiative has been on hold for the past few years.

South Korean, Chinese and Japanese senior diplomats agreed on Tuesday that their national leaders should meet at the "earliest convenient time," Seoul's Foreign Ministry said after a rare meeting. 
The sides are seeking to reboot trilateral exchanges after regular annual meetings were put on hold because of strained relations and the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Royalty graced the Asian Games on Tuesday with Thai Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana saddling up in the equestrian after being encouraged by the king to "go for it".
The 36-year-old, who competed at the 2006 Games in badminton, is part of Thailand's dressage contingent, riding in the team and individual competitions in Hangzhou.
"I will do my best for (the people of Thailand)," she said at the Tonglu Equestrian Centre.
"They're my cheerleaders, my power, my fuel. I play for the Thai people."
The princess, the only daughter of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his former wife Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, is at her third Asian Games.
As well as badminton in 2006, she also rode in the 2014 Games in South Korea.
"Luckily our father is supporting us. He has always said, 'Go for it! You want to do it? Do it,'" said the princess, who learned to ride aged nine and trained in France.
"He knows that what drives my heart is horses and badminton. Since my grandfather's time, the royal family has always competed in sports."
She is the latest in a line of royals to compete in top-level equestrianism -- Britain's Zara Phillips was a 2012 Olympics silver medallist.
Away from the sporting domain, Sirivannavari is a keen fashion designer and has had shows at Paris Fashion Week.
She cited her sister as inspiration for being in China.
"I do it for my sister. My sister is a horse-lover and a show-jumper and she wants to be on the national team, but she cannot make it," she said.
"So she gave everything to me: all the information, all of her strategy, all of the equipment."
Her elder sister, Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol, was hospitalised late last year for heart, lung and kidney issues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea staged its first military parade in a decade on Tuesday, showcasing its advanced arsenal in the face of plummeting ties with nuclear-armed North Korea.
Pyongyang regularly puts on huge military parades but such events in Seoul are traditionally arranged every five years to mark South Korea's Armed Forces Day.
The last parade was in 2013. Five years later, then-president Moon Jae-in chose to hold a celebratory ceremony instead of a military event, in line with his conciliatory approach to North Korea.
Around 4,000 troops marched through central Seoul on a rain-soaked afternoon, cheered by umbrella-bearing crowds who waved South Korean flags.
They were accompanied by 170 pieces of military equipment, including air and sea drones, tanks and missiles.

Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian reportedly sought to travel to visit Iran's consular interest section following the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
"They did make that request and it was denied by the State Department," spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
"We do have an obligation to allow Iranian officials and other officials of foreign governments to travel to New York for UN business. But we do not have an obligation to allow them to travel to Washington, DC," he said.
"Given Iran's wrongful detention of US citizens, given Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism, we did …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuba's embassy in Washington was attacked by a man using two Molotov cocktails on Sunday night, the country's foreign minister said, describing the incident as a "terrorist attack".
"The Cuban embassy in the US was the target of a terrorist attack by an individual who launched 2 Molotov cocktails. The staff suffered no harm," said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.
This was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. 
The Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.
In New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel's presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.
"The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about," said Rodriguez after Sunday's attack.
In April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d'affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his "energetic protest" over what he called a "terrorist aggression" against his embassy.
That shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. 
US authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.
Alazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including "violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon", according to the US Justice Department.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
