The US Navy will scrap nine warships worth $3.2 billion - despite some being just three years old - because their technology is already obsolete. 
Anti-submarine systems on the Freedom-class combat warships, four of which were commissioned in 2019 and 2020, 'did not work out technically', the Navy's operations chief said. 
Admiral Michael Gilday asked Congress to sign off on the scrapping, which will save the Navy $391 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global warming can affect hurricanes, in part because a warmer ocean provides more energy to power them.  But that’s not the only factor at play: a study published Wednesday confirms that, for the frequency of hurricanes, the effects of particulate air pollution are even more important.
Over the past four decades, new research shows that the decline in pollution in the form of tiny aerosol particles from transportation, energy production and industry in North America and Europe was responsible for the increase in the number of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic.  .
During the same period, increased pollution from the growing economies of India and China had the opposite effect, reducing hurricane activity in the western North Pacific, according to the study.

19FortyFive: Forget Retirement: The A-10 Warthog Can Kill Tanks with ‘Reactive’ Armor 
The A-10C Thunderbolt II Just Became Even More Deadly – The Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt II was tailor-made for close-air support, and with its unique GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm (1.18-inch) cannon, it has proved to be among the most effective anti-tank aircraft ever devised. Earlier this year, the United States Air Force demonstrated how the aircraft, which has also earned the nickname “Warthog” among its pilots, is able to knock out modern tanks equipped with armor improvements. 
The first-ever tests were conducted at the Nevada Test and Training Range, February 14-25, 2022 – and the 422nd and 59th Test and Evaluation Squadrons successfully proved that modern-day armored vehicles equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor were still vulnerable to the A-10C Thunderbolt II’s GAU-8 Avenger.

Navy Times: Navy hush-hush after secret boat’s unexplained sinking  
A Navy vessel sank under unclear circumstances, at an undisclosed location, while testing out some secretive technology last December — and that’s about all the sea service will say on the subject. 
The vessel’s name and the nature of the technology tests were not disclosed, though officials did say it took on water and sank while moored. 
That’s the extent of information made public by the Navy regarding the Dec. 7 Class A mishap, the highest mishap category, denoting damages of at least $2.5 million.

Business Insider: US special-operations leaders are figuring out what skills to bring with them into 'the 5th modern era' of special ops 
* US special operators are shifting focus to great-power competition after 20 years of counterterrorism. 
* Special-ops leaders told lawmakers in April that in a new era they will focus on an old skill: supporting conventional forces. 
During a Senate hearing at the end of April, US special-operations leaders provided insight into how the US special-operations community is gearing up for future challenges. 
Near-peer adversaries — mainly China, but also Russia — are the primary threats to US national security, and the US military, including US Special Operations Command, is adjusting accordingly. 
When asked how the shift from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations to great-power competition is affecting their planning and investment decisions, the commanders emphasized a shift to supporting operations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“With privacy, it’s like once it’s out, it’s out,” Professor Meiklejohn said.
Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, a physician and director of Women on Waves, a nonprofit that provides resources for abortion seekers, found this to be the case when she tried to create her own crypto wallet.  “It had the exact same due diligence demands as a normal bank account, where you have to provide ID and other information,” she said.
She could see how anonymous transactions could attract abortion providers, whose work could soon turn them into legal targets.  But, she says, “I haven’t found any cryptocurrency where you can do that.”
Lawyers are not convinced that cryptocurrencies would protect patients in most cases.  Abortion bans “will cover everything whether you pay in cash or crypto,” said Rachel Rebouché, acting dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law and author of a forthcoming paper titled “The New Abortion Battleground.”
“If abortion is illegal in your state — it doesn’t matter if you have a surgical abortion, a medical abortion, whether you self-manage your abortion — if it’s illegal, it’s illegal,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School which focused on reproductive rights.  (In the first three months of this year, 22 states introduced more than 100 restrictions on abortion pills approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.)
Still, organizations like Planned Parenthood are keeping an open mind about how they might raise and distribute funds.
Alexis McGill Johnson, the organization’s president and CEO, said Planned Parenthood was “looking into a number of things” in the cryptocurrency space, but would not divulge specifics.
“At the end of the day, all options are on the table,” she said.

Why exactly mother octopuses engage in a form of self-harm that leads to death right after breeding remains a mystery.  But a study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology uses the California two-spotted octopus as a model to help explain the physiology of this strange behavior.
Z. Yan Wang, assistant professor of psychology and biology at the University of Washington and author of the study, explained that the female of the species goes through three stages of reproduction.
After mating, the mother produces her eggs and handles them with care.  She takes each egg, one at a time, carefully threading them into long strands.  Then she cements them to…]]></summary>

After that, Wednesdays became their regular fixture at the Mean Eyed Cat.  They also started taking the kids on regular outings — to the park’s wading pool, picnics or the pool at Ms. Thompson’s apartment complex just outside Austin.
In mid-July 2019, “we made the relationship official,” Ms Thompson said.
In December, they broke up for about a month, the first of three breakups.  “Jeni needed some space, but we were still in touch,” Ms. Thompson said.
Ms Pandolfi said: ‘I’m a typical non-committal person.
“But I didn’t want to lose her,” she added.
The following year, after a week-long breakup in June 2020, the two received another set of tattoos in October featuring their and their children’s birth month flowers: Ms. Pandolfi included roses, for her and Beau, and Mrs. Thompson included thrush.  , for Juniper, and concern for herself.
She proposed to Ms. Pandolfi weeks later, on November 11, 2020, at a local Airbnb – a converted garage where Ms. Thompson set up battery-powered candles, red wine and charcuterie.
In 2021, after a breakup from February to June, Ms Pandolfi proposed on November 11, a year to the day after Ms Thompson had proposed to her.  At the Sekrit Theater, an Austin event space, Ms. Pandolfi had arranged a marquee inside a greenhouse to read, “Marry me.”

He was 92 years old.
His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his son Dennis, the president of Cakebread Cellars.
Mr. Cakebread, an auto mechanic with a sideline in photography, was returning from filming in northern Napa County when in 1972 he visited a couple of family friends at their farm in Rutherford.  He was 42 and only vaguely curious about what a life beyond car repair might be like.

The Rangers trailed 2-0 after one period and the Penguins, playing without Sidney Crosby, their star center and captain, were 40 minutes away from qualifying for the second round.  But Zibanejad scored two one-time slapshots in 76 seconds to tie the game.
“There is no giving up,” Zibanejad said of the comeback.  “That’s what I love about this team.”
A few minutes later, there was another crazy breakaway.  The game started when Rangers keeper Igor Shesterkin took advantage of a poor Penguins line change and delivered a perfect 100-foot pass on Zibanejad’s stick.  Zibanejad was alone again.
“His passing is better than all of us sometimes,” Zibanejad said of Shesterkin’s stickwork.
penguin keeper Louis Domingue made the initial save on Zibanejad, but Kreider was there with his teammate, and he slammed the rebound to put Rangers ahead, 3-2.  If that sounds like the Game 5 scoring pattern at Madison Square Garden, it was, and would continue, until the last goal in an empty New York net at the end.
Evgeni Malkin scored for the Penguins to even things up, 3-3, on a breakaway late in the second period.  The game remained tied until just 1:28 remained.  Kreider then fired a high slap shot which Domingue saved in front of his chest, but the puck spun over his head and landed behind him and into the net.
“Nobody said it was going to be easy,” Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said.  “They are a very good team. They have a lot of talented players who can score goals.

Her achievements were limited on the pitch due to a series of self-imposed layoffs to deal with her mental health issues, motivational issues and occasional physical issues, but she was wildly successful off the pitch, cementing her status as one of the highest paid athletes in the world and by far the highest paid female athlete.
As she sits out the Italian Open nursing an Achilles injury and preparing for the second Grand Slam event of the year, the French Open, scheduled for later this month, Osaka announced that she was going to set up a representative agency to gain more control over her editing.  business portfolio.

Given Manny Machado’s torrid start for the San Diego Padres this season, it would be predictable to joke that the five-time All-Star plays chess while his peers play checkers.  But in Machado’s case, it’s also true: when he’s not beating opposing pitchers and stealing hits with acrobatic defensive plays, Machado can be found keeping his mind sharp with contemplation. calm on a chessboard.
“Chess is interesting,” said Machado, who learned the game from former Orioles player and manager Brady Anderson in Baltimore in 2017. “It’s something you can’t just play. anticipate what …]]></summary>

In the broader discipline of trail running – which includes everything from 100-mile ultramarathons to ultra-steep kilometer races – he is also part of the pantheon of all-time greats, as a four-time world champion and four-time winner at Pikes Peak Ascent, one of the toughest races in the country.
Gray’s specialty, mountain running – a type of running at higher altitudes, with difficult, technical surfaces, and considerable elevation gain and loss – is still a niche sport.  But trail running as a whole is booming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delaware State University is a historically black university, and about 70% of the team members are black, according to its coach, Pamella Jenkins.
The team bus was returning to Delaware from a game in Florida on the morning of April 20 when Georgia police arrested the bus driver, Ms Jenkins said in an interview.  The driver stopped on a freeway off-ramp, she said, and an officer boarded, saying the bus was mistakenly driving in the left lane.
Within five minutes, she said, one of the student-athletes drew attention to officers pulling backpacks, team duffel bags and other belongings from under the bus. – for inspection by a drug-sniffing dog.  Then two officers boarded the bus announcing a drug search in an interaction that Ms Jenkins, who is black, described as “racially motivated”.
“When he raised narcotic dogs, the first thing he went to was marijuana, which is stereotypically associated with African Americans,” Ms Jenkins said.  She added that the officer had an “accusatory tone: he was not asking”.
When a student asked how the routine traffic stop turned into a drug search, she said, an officer replied that charter buses on this section of the highway were known to drug and human trafficking.  Although nervous and scared, Ms Jenkins said she tried to stay calm, as students gathered by the window to look outside and others sat in shock.  She said she feared a single bad word could inflame the situation.
The university’s student newspaper, the hornet, published an article on traffic control by Sydney Anderson, a member of the team.  Ms Anderson and the other team members did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Ms Anderson wrote in the article that the police tried to get the players to admit they had drugs, and she accused them of carrying out an unlawful search without probable cause.  She said “the majority of the team members had never encountered the police, which made this a traumatic incident for them”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judge Thomas said the left had tactics adopted that the Conservatives would not use.
“You would never visit Supreme Court justices’ homes when things weren’t going our way,” he said.  “We didn’t throw tantrums.  It is our responsibility to always act appropriately and not give up.
He added that conservatives had “never trashed a Supreme Court nominee”.  He acknowledged that Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, “didn’t get a hearing, but he didn’t get trashed.”
“You won’t see the total destruction of just one candidate,” Judge Thomas said.  “You also won’t see people going to other people’s houses, attacking them while dining out, throwing things at them.”
He said Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh had been the victim of particular abuse, but he only made a cursory reference to his own brutal confirmation hearings, during which he angrily denied the accusations of sexual harassment.
Taking sides on a disputed point, Judge Thomas said the Senate Republicans who blocked Mr. Garland’s nomination were following a rule that then-Senator President Biden proposed, “which is to say you get no audience in the last year of an administration.”
Judge Thomas, the most senior member of the current court, was a fierce opponent of Roe.
On Friday, he said opposition to his nomination in 1991 was “by these people who were trying to get me out of court because of an abortion.”
During his confirmation hearings, however, he said, to the astonishment of many, that he never discussed Roe, even though it was published while a student at law school in Yale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in New Delhi arrested two people suspected of flouting fire safety regulations on Saturday after at least 27 people died in a blaze at a building housing a manufacturing unit for surveillance cameras.
Rescue teams worked overnight to clear the burnt out four-storey building near a railway station in the western suburbs.
More than 75 people were in the building when the fire broke out on Friday evening. Some jumped from windows to save themselves, according to eyewitnesses, and firefighters broke the glass and rescued people with ropes.
Authorities said fire started in an office on the first floor and spread rapidly. Two owners of the company were arrested as part of probe to identify suspected safety violations.
Offering condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 200,000 rupees ($2,580) in compensation for the victims' next-of-kin.

Ukrainian hopes of being able to repurpose frozen Russian assets to pay for war damage were dashed on Saturday as Germany's foreign minister highlighted the hurdles to such an approach.
Ukrainian officials have pushed for weeks for frozen Russian assets to be transferred to Kiev, to cover the costs of repairing destruction caused by Russia's invasion or even to pay for Ukraine's defence efforts.
But German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at the end of a G7 foreign ministers' conference she hosted, said there were multiple problems with such an approach.
"Gaining access to frozen money is legally ... anything but easy," she said. She noted that there could be sound reasons to attempt such an act, but noted that they had to be aligned with the law.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had again proposed the idea at the session held on the Baltic coast.
"We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe," he said, arguing that Russia should be forced to pay for the war, not only in political or economic terms, but also financially.
Beyond legal issues, many European leaders fear attempts to liquidate and transfer Russian funds will lead to countries like Russia and China seeking to set up an alternative international financial system, which would make sanctions a weaker tool in the future.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Saturday the spread of COVID-19 had thrust his country into "great turmoil" and called for an all-out battle to overcome the outbreak, as 21 daily deaths were reported among people with fever.
North Korea this week acknowledged for the first time a COVID outbreak, imposing a nationwide lockdown. But there was no sign of a rigorous testing or treatment campaign in the isolated country's rudimentary healthcare system.
"The spread of the malignant epidemic is a great turmoil to fall on our country since the founding," Kim told an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, according to state news agency KCNA.

Russian President Vladimir Putin told Finnish President Sauli Niinistö that Helsinki's moves towards joining NATO are a mistake and that Russia does not pose a threat to Finland, according to a Kremlin statement.
Finland's departure from its traditional neutrality would cause the two countries' good neighbourly relations to deteriorate, Putin said.

A day after the Taliban issued a decree on May 7 ordering women to fully cover their faces in public – ideally with the burqa – a group of women took to the streets of Kabul to protest the edict.
One of the women at the protest, who declined to be identified for security reasons, said the Taliban did not let them continue the demonstration.
"They insult us. We can't even reply because they have guns and their fingers are always on the trigger. They don't care that we are women, they don't value women. I am not just defending my own rights, but the rights of all women in Afghan…]]></summary>

Or maybe a Greek with a death wish, a slinky Lithuanian chanteuse with a jet-black bowl cut or a Serbian germaphobe?
The line-up for Saturday's grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest is typically outlandish, but with the roars of war on the continent's eastern front, a hiphop lullaby from Ukraine is the song to beat.
Riding a wave of public support following Russia's invasion, Kalush Orchestra's tribute to the motherland is the bookmakers' favorite to triumph at the world's biggest live music event, watched by tens of millions of people.
Kitschy and quirky, Eurovision embraces the eccentric and the contest's 66th edition held in Italy's northwestern city of Turin is no exception, with its natio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates' de facto leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan was elected president of the Gulf Arab state by a federal supreme council on Saturday, solidifying his rule over the OPEC oil producer and key regional player.
The council, which groups the rulers of the seven emirates of the UAE federation, elected Sheikh Mohammed, known as MbZ, a day after the death of his half-brother, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, who was also ruler of Abu Dhabi.
"We congratulate him and pledge allegiance to him as do our people...and the entire country will follow his leadership to glory," Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also UAE vice-president and premier, said in a Twitter post.
MbZ, 61, had already been wielding power for years in a period when Sheikh Khalifa suffered bouts of illness, including a stroke in 2014.
He becomes president at a time when the UAE's long-standing ties with the United States have been visibly strained over perceived U.S. disengagement from its Gulf allies' security concerns.
MbZ led a realignment of the Middle East that created a new anti-Iran axis with Israel. He also bolstered the military might of the UAE which, coupled with its oil wealth and business hub status, extended Emirati influence in the region and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Russia CUTS electricity to Finland: Moscow-run state energy company says it will stop supplying Helsinki tomorrow over 'payment issues' amid tensions over NATO 
* RAO Nordic has said it will suspend its electricity import to Finland from May 14 
* The supplier firm is a subsidiary of Russian state energy holding Inter RAO 
* This is due to RAO Nordic not being able to pay for imported electricity, it said 
* Blamed suspension on not having received payments for electricity sold in May 
Finland was preparing for Russia to cut off electricity supplies early today due to its failure to pay the provider. 
Russian state-owned power firm Inter RAO will stop exports because it has not been paid for energy sold via the pan-European exchange Nord Pool since May 6. 
No reason was given for the non-payment. 
It comes as Finland prepares for Moscow to cut gas supplies in retaliation for the country making moves to join Nato.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My subconscious registered my first vaginal birth as a rape.

Unlike my abortion at 22, my pregnancy at 32 was planned.  All paternalistic boxes have been checked this time.  I was married, healthy, low risk, fully insured and ecstatic.  I looked forward to a happy and carefree labor and birth, but as a survivor of sexual assault, my body associated the experience of spreading my legs unceremoniously apart while succumbing to out-of-control momentum and pain. of my control as a violent act culminating in anguish.

And he urged local leaders to keep the money flowing.
“My message is clear: Spend this money,” Biden told the Rose Garden.  “Do it quickly before the summer, when crime rates typically spike.”
As Republicans take advantage of rising violent crime to portray the White House as weak on law and order, Mr Biden is scrambling to show he is a strong advocate for policing ahead of the midterm elections in Congress in November.

Niko Omilana, who received 49,628 votes and finished in fifth place in London's 2021 mayoral race, traveled to Harrison, Arkansas — which he described as "America's most racist town."
In a local Walmart, Omilana was told that Thomas Robb was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Police then asked him to leave the store.
Omilana set up an interview with the man by saying it was for "BBC" and asked him to give a shout-out to supporters of the KKK in the United Kingdom who voiced excitement for the interview on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The inspiration for “One Night,” the nine-hour theatrical event at the Target Margin Theater in Brooklyn, began about 3,000 nights ago.  Or, to tell the story another way, it started over 1,000 years ago when certain folk tales from the Middle East and India first appeared in Arabic collections.  “One Night” distills these intertwined tales, known as “One Thousand and One Nights” or the “One Thousand and One Nights.”  Some editions include dozens of tales;  few hundreds.

At Benjamin Cleary’s reflective film takes place in a near future that seems within reach: people travel in sleek trains and driverless electric cars;  they have cameras in their contact lenses.  And although it is not (yet) widespread, human cloning has become a reality.  Because he has a terminal illness, Cameron (Mahershala Ali, wearing the film effortlessly) decides to secretly replace himself with a body double so that his wife (Naomie Harris) and their young son are spared the grief of his death.  Cameron flees to an isolated facility run by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close), where his consciousness is uploaded into a “molecularly regenerated” copy of his body.

        <updated>2022-05-13T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The daughter of a GM die-maker, Ms Barra, 60, grew up in Royal Oak, Michigan, and started working at a GM plant as an intern at 18 while studying electrical engineering at technical college of business, now called Kettering University.  Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a master’s degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.
In January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.
In a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.
Removing loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years “helped change the mindset,” she said.  “The whole company kind of said, ‘Well, it’s a new day.  “”
GM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.
Along the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Maritime traffic to and from Russia has remained relatively heavy in recent months as companies rush to fulfill contracts to purchase energy and other assets before the full force of global sanctions does not come into force.
With the European Union about to introduce a ban on Russian oil in the coming months, this situation could change significantly.  But the data so far shows that while trade with Russia has been reduced in many cases, it has not yet been crippled.
Crude and petroleum product volumes shipped from Russian ports, for example, soared to 25 million metric tons in April, according to data from shipping tracker Refinitiv, from around 24 million metric tons in December, January, February and March, and mostly above the levels of the past two years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This includes using observational data and two sets of computer simulations, one that models the world as it is, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than it is. was before widespread emissions began in the late 19th century, and a hypothetical world in which global warming never occurred.
The conclusion that the likelihood of such an extreme rain event has increased with global warming is consistent with many other studies of individual events and larger trends.  One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.
The study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.
Among these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.
The researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durban’s population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.
“Once again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,” said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.

(CNN)US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his Russian counterpart for the first time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon announced on Friday. 
The call lasted approximately an hour and was at the request of Austin, who used the first call between the two in 84 days to urge Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to implement an "immediate ceasefire," according to a brief readout of the call. 
The two last spoke on February 18, a week before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.  It ends an extended period in which Russia's top military leaders repeatedly refused to speak with their American counterparts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lightning uptake of crypto assets like bitcoin had swelled a volatile sector to a valuation of roughly two trillion dollars recently.
A week-long rout has wiped away tens of billions of dollars from that value and spread panic throughout the market.
Bitcoin is the premier cryptocurrency and its value accounts for the lion's share of the whole sector.
This week, its price at one stage plummeted to $25,500 -- less than half of its record price in November last year and the lowest valuation since it exploded at the end of 2020.
"Fears about rampant inflation and the abrupt ending of the era of cheap money have sent cryptocurrencies careering down a cliff edge," said Susannah Streeter of Hargreaves Lansdown, referring to the new monetary tightening policies of the US Federal Reserve and ot…]]></summary>

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the two countries to reconsider NATO membership.
 Finland and Sweden are on the verge of seeking membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a historic shift for two traditionally non-aligned countries and a major expansion of the Western alliance as war wages in Europe.
On Thursday, Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin strongly backed Finland’s NATO membership. “NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security,” they said in a joint statement. “As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense al…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Already one of the most unusual corporate takeover attempts in modern business, Elon Musk’s $44 billion bid to buy Twitter got a little weirder on Friday.
First, in a pre-dawn tweet, Mr Musk said the deal was on hold.  He said he wanted more details about the volume of spam and fake accounts on the platform. 
Then, about two hours later, Mr. Musk tweeted again.  He was “still committed” to the acquisition, he said, without giving further details. 
The seemingly conflicting messages left many wondering if Mr. Musk had cold feet, was trying to drive down the acquisition price, or was looking for some attention.  Maybe it was a combination of all three.  Twitter shares yo-yoed in response to his posts.


As with many things involving Mr. Musk, it was difficult to know his thinking.  He did no…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dr Özel said the new image’s similarity to that of 2019 demonstrated that the previous image was no coincidence.  In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  “The similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,” said Dr Galison.
At Thursday’s press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, “This is an extraordinary verification of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. “
Einstein’s Bad Dream
Black holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.
Einstein’s insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.
Einstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.
But there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still don’t understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.
Paradoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials – gas, dust, jagged stars – falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.

Shoigu spoke with Austin at the Pentagon chief's request for about an hour, their first direct discussion since February 18, six days before Russia invaded Ukraine.
"Secretary Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication," the Pentagon said in a statement.
The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the call, saying the two sides discussed current international security issues, "including the situation in Ukraine."

ABC News Australia: Defence Minister Peter Dutton says a Chinese spy ship has been seen near secretive naval facility off Western Australia  
A high-tech Chinese surveillance ship has been tracked off the West Australian coast, close to a secretive naval communications base that supports American and other allied submarines. 
Defence Minister Peter Dutton has revealed the auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) vessel was closely monitored by the ADF as it sailed past the Harold E Holt naval station at Exmouth. 
Mr Dutton said Australia had been tracking the spy ship in the past "week or so" but didn't put an exact date on the surveillance. 
"Its intent, of course, is to collect intelligence right along the coastline," he said.

Unclear whether modifications reflect change in US stance on 'one China' policy, Taiwan sovereignty 
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. State Department last week changed the wording on its U.S.-Taiwan relations page to delete reference to Taiwan as being part of China and removed a statement disavowing Taiwan independence. 
According to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, as recently as May 3, the U.S. State Department fact sheet on bilateral relations with Taiwan stated that like the 1972 Shanghai Communique, the 1979 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communique severing ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, acknowledged the "Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China." 
The fact sheet was dated Aug. 31, 2018 during the Trump administration.

"We must find an agreement," Zelenskyy said in an interview with an Italian media outlet as deadly ground fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continues to intensify.
"Every day the war continues, the risk of its spreading grows."
Ukrainian and Western officials claimed Friday that Russian troops have begun pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as Moscow focuses its assault on the eastern part of the country.

Masked police officers faced scores of flag-waving and chanting Palestinians in the compound of St. Joseph's Hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, television footage showed.
Officers then charged the crowd and at one point the group carrying her coffin backed against a wall and almost dropped the casket, recovering it just before one end hit the ground.
The violent scenes underlined the growing anger over Abu Akleh's killing which has threatened to add further fuel to an already raging conflict.

* NATO ascension for a new member state requires consensus approval from all existing members. 
* Turkey joined NATO in 1952, and has the second-largest military in the 30-member alliance after the United States. 
* Finland's leaders on Thursday called for NATO membership "without delay" and neighboring Sweden is expected to follow suit. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has thrown Sweden and Finland's potential NATO membership into doubt, just as both countries are on the cusp of applying to join the alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
"We are following the developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don't hold positive views," Erdogan told press in Istanbul on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli forces stormed the grounds of a Jerusalem hospital Friday as the coffin containing the body of a slain journalist emerged ahead of burial, with police saying they acted against people "disrupting the public order".
TV images showed Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh's coffin nearly falling to the ground as police grabbed Palestinian flags from the crowd around the procession outside Saint Joseph's hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Israel forbids public displays of Palestinian flags and often storms individuals who hoist them at rallies or protests in the city.

A senior Palestinian figure, Hanan Ashrawi, tweeted that "savage #Israeli 'special forces' viciously attack the funeral procession bearing the coffin" of Abu Akleh as it left St. Joseph's. "The inhumanity (of) Israel is on full display", said the former top Palestine Liberation Organization official.

In a statement, police said they had held dialogue with Abu Akleh's family ahead of time in order to "enable a respectable funeral. "Unfortunately under the auspices of the funeral and taking cynical advantage of it, hundreds of people began disrupting the public order before it even began," police said.
"As the coffin was about to exit the hospital, stones began to be thrown at officers from the hospital's plaza, and the officers were forced to use riot dispersal means," the statement added. Police also released a video in which an officer, outside the hospital grounds, is addressing the crowd over a loudspeaker.
"If you don't stop these chants and (Palestinians) nationalistic songs we will have to disperse you using force and we won't let the funeral take place," the officer says in the video. Abu Akleh's coffin left the hospital grounds by vehicle and had arrived at a Jerusalem church for her funeral.
She was killed Wednesday while covering clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

As tourism in Thailand is starting up again after a long period of complicated Covid entry rules, a new water park is set to open on the popular holiday island of Phuket, in a bid to draw in much-needed visitors.
The 9-hectare Andamanda Phuket park, which has 36 slides and a 10,000-square-metre wave pool, is scheduled to open on May 22, one year later than originally planned due to the pandemic.
The name comes from the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean, where Phuket is located.
On the park's website, its operators promise visitors "a sea adventure that wanders into the tales of Thai mythology."
"I am confident that Andamanda Phuket will motivate tourists around the world to come to Thailand," said Thapanee Kiatphaibool from the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
Besides the large number of slides and other water-related attractions, there will also be daily shows, parades and performances which celebrate Thai culture as well as a 5,300-square-metre playground and a floating market.
According to estimates, the mega park cost about $127 million and operators are hoping to attract some 1 million guests over the next year.
Last year, Phuket became the first region in the country to offer quarantine-free holidays again. Since then, the number of visitors has steadily increased.
According to Phuket's tourism authority, some 3,000 to 5,000 tourists currently arrive on Thailand's largest island every day, with the industry hoping for 9,000 daily arrivals in the last quarter of 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs, took to Twitter to single out Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as the cause of delay for a $40 billion aid package to assist his country against the Russian invasion.
"We could have already started using the U.S. assistance package to more effectively save lives of Ukrainians who defend the democratic world," wrote Kuleba, noting that President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, and senators from both parties are all in favor of the assistance.
Paul alone, he wrote, has "delayed so much needed support."

We could have already started using the new U.S. assistance package to more effectively save lives of Ukrainians who defend the democratic world. @POTUS, @SecBlinken, @SenateGOP, @SenateDems and American people were in strong support, and @RandPaul delayed so much needed support.
 — Dmytro Kuleba (@Dmytro Kuleba)

The Ukrainian package, which provides both military and humanitarian aid along with $5 billion to address global food shortages caused by the disruption of Ukrainian agriculture, passed the House with broad bipartisan support, with only a handful of Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) opposing the deal.

In the Senate, however, a single senator can prevent unanimous consent to pass a bill, forcing it to go through a longer process to achieve passage.
Paul has been accused by experts of echoing Kremlin propaganda in his description of the invasion going on in Ukraine, including his suggestion that Russia is justified in acting to prevent the expansion of the NATO alliance and the territory Russia is invading is historically "part of Russia."]]></summary>

Russia’s war against Ukraine is now the hottest in the battle of Donbas. Ukraine is counterattacking in northern Kharkiv Oblast, Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces near Sievierodonetsk. And something unclear is happening near Izium. 
After a short lull in early May, the Ukrainian Army is expelling the Russians from northern Kharkiv Oblast, thus threatening the rear of the Izium Russian group of occupiers, which is attacking Sloviansk and Barvinkove ​​from the north. This can be seen on the general map of hostilities.

WNU Editor: I am not sure about the first two encirclement plans for the Donbas (see above map). I always felt the priority of the Russian and DPR military in April was to secure a land-bridge from the Donbas to Crimea.

The series is open to both members within the YCYW Education Network, as well as online participants across the globe, providing a platform for all parents and students to engage in cutting-edge issues of the modern age. By inviting outstanding leaders across diverse fields to share their insights and stories through presentations, interviews, and roundtable discussions, the programme aims to enlighten the community and illuminate the way to a brighter future.   YCYW has always been committed to aligning with science and technology, and is renowned for its progressive use of education technology to break down silos and foster effective learning. In keeping with YCYW’s dedication to science and technology, the second session of the ‘Planet Leadership Series’ is centred on the topic ‘The future is at your doorstep: Human vs Technology’. It examined the opportunities and challenges presented by technology, as well as how students can successfully navigate a future of accelerating technological change.    The event kickstarted with an address by Dr Betty Chan Po-king, CEO and School Supervisor of YCYW Education Network.

Kremlin press secretary says Helsinki’s move ‘threatens Russia’s security.’ 
Russia will respond to Finland joining NATO with “military-technical” retaliatory measures, Moscow warned Thursday. 
“Finland’s accession to NATO will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations,” the Russian foreign ministry wrote in a statement. The warning came in response to Finland’s leaders on Thursday officially endorsing the idea of their country joining NATO, a historic move that sets the stage for a membership application in the coming days. 
“Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security that arise in this regard,” the Russian foreign ministry said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -European Union leaders said on Thursday that the EU wants to become a bigger actor in Asia, which they termed a "theatre of tensions", warning of an increasingly assertive China even as they called on Beijing to defend the multilateral global order. 
The call came in a joint news conference in Tokyo after an EU-Japan summit featuring European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. 
It also came a day after Beijing warned the summit not to "speak ill" of China.   The trio said they would keep up talks on ways to maximise their partnership to tackle Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, in areas such as energy as well as aid, joining in a statement to call for the immediate cessation of hostilities.

ABC News Australia: Ukraine war boosts weapons makers' stock prices, but revenue to take years to flow through 
When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, the stock prices of many of the world's biggest arms manufacturers spiked.

However, the demand created by the war has yet to translate into big increases in revenue for the major defence contractors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: Gulf State OPEC Members Sound Alarm About Dwindling Global Energy Capacity 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates warned earlier this week that their spare energy capacity is decreasing in all energy sectors as key producers reduce investment in fossil fuels, pushing oil,  diesel, and natural gas to trade at near-record highs. 
Brent oil was trading at around $102 a barrel as they spoke.      
"I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,” said Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to Bloomberg on May 10, at an OPEC conference in Abu Dhabi. 
The prince was referring to the surge in prices for refined oil products, in particular in the United States, where gas and diesel prices are hitting a record high, causing problems for the Biden administration.       
"The world needs to wake up to an existing reality. The world is running out of energy capacity at all levels,” said the Saudi minister.

While wealthy, previously non-aligned nations could potentially join NATO in less than a year, Ukraine’s prospects of joining the alliance anytime soon — if ever — are highly unlikely.  On the one hand: NATO, an alliance based on the doctrine of mutual defense, would be highly unlikely to admit a country trapped in war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, TechCrunch reported that Congress is asking major social media platforms to archive content showing evidence of Russian war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.
Four representatives sent letters making the request to Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.
"As TikTok booms in popularity and surpasses 1 billion users, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too," reported Amanda Silberling. "These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable."

"In particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes," said the report.
The Russian army has been accused of repeated war crimes as part of the Ukraine invasion, from the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol to the butchering of unarmed civilians in Bucha.
Russia has denied all accusations, claiming that they are only going after military targets and sticking to their discredited story they are trying to "denazify" the country.]]></summary>

Finland joining NATO would pose a threat to Russia and will not help make the world any more secure, warns Moscow 
Moscow has warned that Finland joining NATO would pose a direct threat to Russia’s security and its acceptance to the military alliance would prompt Russia to develop measures to ensure its safety. 
That’s after Finnish officials confirmed on Thursday their commitment to join the US-led bloc and announced plans to pen a formal application later this week.   
"There is a current instruction from the president to develop a list of measures to strengthen our western flanks in connection with the strengthening of NATO’s eastern flanks,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov during a daily press briefing on Thursday, adding that the expansion of NATO towards Russia’s borders will not make the world or the Eurasian continent any more secure.

* Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Thursday that the country should apply to join NATO “without delay.”

Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Thursday that the country should apply to join NATO “without delay.” 
The announcement is the strongest sign yet that Finland will make a formal application to join NATO. 
Membership would be historic for the Nordic country, which has had a decadeslong policy of military neutrality.  “Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.” the leaders said in a joint statement, adding that they hoped that “the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.”

Daily Mail: Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev says the West is risking ‘fully fledged nuclear war’ between Moscow and NATO by ‘pumping weapons into Ukraine’ 
* Putin lackey Dmitry Medvedev: NATO help may spark 'full-fledged nuclear war' 
* Security Council vice-chair said 'direct and open conflict' with West remains risk 
* NATO must stop 'pumping weapons into Ukraine', he wrote in fiery Telegram 
* He also accused Western nations of 'sending in mercenaries' to fight for Ukraine 
* Ex-President and PM slammed European leaders 'squeaking their little voices' 
* 'The thesis that Russia frightens the world with nuclear conflict is being pushed' 
* Medvedev's statement follows news neutral neighbour Finland will join NATO 
* And Japan's PM said war 'shakes the core of international order, including Asia' 
NATO military support for Ukraine risks sparking nuclear war with Russia, Putin ally and ex-president Dmitry Medvedev warned. 
In a fiery post to nearly one million Telegram users this morning, Medvedev wrote:  'NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia. 
'Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war.'

OilPrice.com: The EU Has A Major Problem With Securing Non-Russian Gas 
* The EU is determined to wean itself off Russian gas, and its current replacement plan involves building new LNG terminals and importing gas from elsewhere. 
* This replacement plan has one major flaw, the LNG market is currently a seller's market and importers will have to commit to long-term contracts. 
* Germany’s struggle to negotiate deliveries of LNG with Qatar is just one example of this problem, and the EU will have to alter its priorities in order to secure the gas. 
Germany has been negotiating deliveries of liquefied natural gas with Qatar as part of plans to wean itself off Russian gas, on which it is heavily dependent. 
The negotiations, reportedly, ran into a wall this week. And this wall may be what’s standing in the way of other EU gas buyers as well. 
According to unnamed sources cited by Reuters, Germany and Qatar have serious differences on issues such as the length of the contract and whether or not Germany could re-sell the gas to other European countries once it had been received.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a segment on CNN this Thursday, the panel discussed the day's news regarding the Jan. 6 committee's subpoenas of five House Republicans. According to CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger, one of the lawmakers subpoenaed, Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, "might actually be willing to testify." 
According to Borger, Brooks spoke at the infamous "Stop the Steal" rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot, only to later be passed over by former President Donald Trump for an endorsement in his reelection race. 
Borger also pointed out that Brooks has already publicly revealed that Trump asked him to help "rescind" the 2020 election. 
"If he's already said it publicly, why not say it to the committee?" Borger said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first three months of 2022, his campaign reported no donations over $199 from people in the district and only six from the entire state of North Carolina.  Any individual donation under $200 can be made anonymously.
Luckily for Hines, the Club for Growth Action, the group’s super PAC arm, said it plans to spend $1.3 million support him in the primary.  That’s a huge sum for a house race.
Before settling in the 13th arrondissement, Hines had searched for a suitable perch.  He announced plans to challenge Rep. Virginia Foxx, a longtime Republican in the west of the state, before redistricting alters those plans.  In April, he and his wife moved to a house in Fuquay-Varinaa town in southern Wake County, the most densely populated part of the district.
Some Republicans in the dark red county of Johnston, a fast-growing rural community, criticized Hines for, in the words of the leader of a local group, “Coming in, just trying to pick a district he can win.” And Hines’ main adversary, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former State House majority leader, attacked him as a baggage handler.
The Hines campaign, which declined to make him available for an interview but answered a series of detailed questions about his candidacy, notes his upbringing in Charlotte and his time at NC State, which is in Raleigh, just north of the district line.
Daughtry has spent more than $2.5 million on the race so far, while contributing nearly $3 million of its own money.  She has also caught in heat for his past donations to Democratsincluding Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee, and Josh Stein, the state attorney general.
Several people with access to private polls said Hines appeared to be ahead of Daughtry by a few percentage points, with everyone else trailing far behind.  In North Carolina, if no candidate wins at least 30% of the vote, the first two qualify for a second round.

RFE: Moscow Puts Sanctions On European Gazprom Units In Countries That Have Imposed Sanctions On Russia 
Russia has imposed sanctions against units of Gazprom Germania and dozens of other companies based in countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. 
 Under the sanctions, the 31 companies listed on May 11 by the Russian government are banned from conducting transactions and entering Russian ports. 
But it notably includes local subsidiaries of Gazprom, which supplies more than a third of European gas.

WNU Editor: Why should Russia ship natural gas to European Gasprom companies/units that were seized last month by European governments who took these institutions without compensation? 
The shock from the Western media and governments over these reciprocal sanctions being imposed on them is a sight to see. My guess is that they never expected it, and they never made the calculation on what would be the consequences if they impose sanctions on a country like Russia. 
Bottom line. 
The sanctions that the West have imposed on the Kremlin is hurting the Russian economy, but it looks like these reciprocal sanctions are probably hurting the EU even more. 
Update: The impact has been immediate .... Europe gas spikes 22% as Germany quarrels with Russia over supply (Al Jazeera).

gCaptain/Blooomberg: Greek Shipowners Kill EU’s Russian Oil Tanker Ban 
(Bloomberg) The European Union is set to soften its sanctions package on Russian oil exports after a weekend of wrangling, though it aims to keep a key shipping provision that will hinder Moscow’s ability to export its crude. 
The bloc will drop a proposed ban on EU-owned vessels transporting Russian oil to third countries, according to documents seen by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. 
Critically, a prohibition on insurance is still in the works and would remain a significant impediment to exports.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: I am not surprised by this development. Europe needs Russian oil one way or another. 
A prediction. 
These oil tankers will still pick up Russian oil at Russian sea ports. Make a beeline to a European port with their cargo, and while in transit this oil will be sold and resold and resold (all at a premium) to mask where this oil is coming from and to satisfy insurance requirements. In the end this Russian oil will end up in Europe, albeit at a very high cost for the European consumers. 
The big winners will be Russian oil companies, the Kremlin, and the Greek/Maltese/etc. shipping oligarchs.

Her older sister, watching, cried out.  A few seconds later, the young man, Irvin Antonio Hernández, was gone, dragged into the prison opposite.
The two women collapsed on a nearby wooden bench next to strangers who understood better than anyone what had just happened.  Their sons had all disappeared behind those same walls.
After a record weekend of gang killings in March, the Salvadorian government declared a state of emergency and suspended constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties.  The ensuing campaign of mass arrests led to the imprisonment of more than 25,000 people in about a month and a half.

And it’s not just because of the light, airy, boldly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea and sky that characterized his last decade.  Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of any particular group or movement, meaning the general awareness of his work fluctuated greatly.  It is always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the opportunity to do so has been too rare.
Now one of those rare moments has arrived, with much of Avery’s work featured in exhibitions in New York and Hartford, Connecticut. Wadsworth Atheneum Art Museum in Hartford presents “Milton Avery”, a sumptuous study of almost 70 paintings (org…]]></summary>

Suddenly the child in front of you turns around and says, “One day you’re going to make children’s books.  You might think you’re too cool for such a job, but the prediction stays with you and somehow comes true.  You now have two picture books on the bestseller list.
Welcome to the career trajectory of Jessie Sima, a writer and illustrator who uses her pronouns and who, in a phone interview, seemed both thrilled and humbled by the success of “Perfectly Pegasus” and “Not Quite Narwhal. “.

He was due to hold his first-ever event in Ukraine in March.  Larissa Saveliev, co-founder of the organization and former Bolshoi dancer, said that when the war in Russia started, she sent an email to the 50 or so dancers who had signed up to say: “If you want help, let me know”.

There are practical reasons for the flurry of site-specific performances at the month-long event, called Kunstenfestivaldesarts, said Daniel Blanca Gubbay, one of its directors, during a break between performances.  After two years of pandemic upheaval, many performance venues in Brussels have been booked with shows rescheduled this year.
The constraints have led to creative programming, showcasing areas of the city that even frequent visitors may not necessarily know.  To see “The Weeping Woods and the Okapi Resistance”, a family puppet …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the cleverly reimagined “Montana Story” genre, the American flag doesn’t just wave and flutter, it also sends a warning.  He looks so modest.  Clean and neat, with no frayed edges or faded colors, it flies from a tall pole planted in front of a beautiful two-story house.  There, on 200 acres in southwestern Montana, in a glorious region surrounded by mountains known as Paradise Valley, nature invites and soothes.  It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.
Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel don’t dwell on the flag.  Instead, they gently immerse you in a classic Western setting while simultaneously drawing you into a simmering family melodrama about two grappling adult children and their terminally ill father.  He was the one who bought the family ranch years earlier a…]]></summary>

Russia has scaled down its objectives in Ukraine. It’s still struggling to achieve them.
 Over three weeks ago, Russia launched a new phase of its war in Ukraine: an effort aimed at seizing control of the Donbas region in the country’s east. This new objective was a significant climbdown from its initial goal of regime change in Kyiv, and one that seemed more achievable. Many observers thought the offensive might yield enough concrete gains for Putin to say “mission accomplished” on May 9, a Russian holiday called Victory Day commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Yet when the day itself came, Putin did not say much of anything along those lines. Perhaps this was because he had litt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As demonstrated in movies as diverse as “Monterey Pop,” “Woodstock” and “Summer of Soul,” music festivals can’t help but derive some of their vibe from their sets.  As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,” directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the city’s annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.
The film’s opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is – thankfully – a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.


Exploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you “like a freight train.”


Entrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianist’s work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.
The seething history – which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festival’s appeal – turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.
Jazz Fest: A History of New Orleans
Rated PG-13 for sassy little language.  Duration: 1h34.  In theaters.
