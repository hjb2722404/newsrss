        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UN General Assembly, shown here in October, voted overwhelmingly to condemn the US embargo of Cuba, with only the US and Israel voting against [File: David 'Dee' Delgado/Reuters]   
Axios: UN votes to condemn U.S. embargo of Cuba 
The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted 185-2 to condemn the U.S. embargo of Cuba for the 30th year in a row.   
Why it matters: Although UN resolutions are non-binding and aren't legally enforceable, they carry political weight by illustrating the isolation of the U.S. position and the heft of global opinion against it.   
State of play: Only the U.S. and Israel voted to oppose the resolution, while Brazil and Ukraine abstained, AP reported. 
* Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla addressed the UNGA ahead of the vote, calling the embargo a "deliberate act of economic warfare with the purpose of preventing financial income to the country, destroying the government's ability to meet the needs of the population, causing the economy to collapse and creating a situation of ungovernability."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Republicans take LEAD in deep-blue Miami in early-voting midterm stunner - as Latinos dump Democrats in droves and push DeSantis towards emphatic victory in another dire sign for Biden 
* Republicans voters in Florida are using early voting in larger numbers than Democrats, including in the deep blue city of Miami 
* It's a good sign for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term 
* Miami voting numbers also indicate Hispanics are coming out in droves for GOP 
* In Florida, 3.58 million registered voters have voted early overall, according to the United States Elections Project 
* And 44% of those have been Republican voters; 38% are  Democrats 
* In Miami-Dade, nearly 27% of GOP voters had voted by Wednesday, compared to 21% of Democrats 
Republicans voters in Florida are using early voting in larger numbers than Democrats, including in the deep blue city of Miami, a sign of high enthusiasm among the GOP and a troubling indicator for President Joe Biden's party. 
The number of registered Republicans voting early in Miami-Dade County surpassed Democrats on Wednesday – one day after Biden visited the area to campaign for his party's candidates amid concerns the GOP will win control of the House in next week's midterm election. 
It's a good sign for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term, and for GOP Senator Marco Rubio, who's also running for re-election.

WNU Editor: These early voting numbers are shocking. Miami-Dade county is a Democrat stronghold. This should not be happening. Is this poll correct? We will find out in five days.   
Update: It looks like this trip by President Biden to Florida two days has backfired .... Biden rallies Florida Democrats despite signs of red wave (Politico).]]></summary>

A surprise deal announced Wednesday promises peace but doesn’t offer much detail.
 One of the world’s current deadliest conflicts and worst humanitarian crises could be moving toward a close.
On Wednesday, the Ethiopian federal government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) came to an agreement to permanently halt hostilities in a civil war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions, pushed regions in the north to the brink of famine, and altered Ethiopia’s standing in the international community.

War On The Rocks: Don’t Expect Any More Russian Help on the Iran Nuclear Deal 
Russia’s position on Iran’s nuclear program has always lagged behind its confrontation with the West. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow actively supported diplomatic efforts to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. After the invasion, Russia initially disrupted these efforts, but soon reverted to a more neutral stance.

WNU Editor: Russia's focus is elsewhere. Helping put together an Iran nuclear deal is not one of them. But Russia is not alone. The U.S. is walking away from putting an Iran nuclear deal right now .... U.S. "not going to waste time" on Iran deal right now, official says (Axios). More here ....

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), prompting the United States and South Korea to extend air drills that have angered Pyongyang.

LAHORE (Reuters) -Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was shot in the shin on Thursday when his anti-government protest convoy came under attack in the east of the country in what his aides said was a clear assassination attempt by his rivals.
Khan, ousted as prime minister in a parliamentary confidence vote in April, was six days into a protest procession bound for Islamabad, standing and waving to thousands of cheering supporters from the roof of a container truck, when the shots rang out.
Several in his convoy were wounded in the attack in Wazirabad, nearly 200 km (120 miles) from the capital. Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said a suspect had been arrested.

TASS: Kiev preparing ‘dirty bomb’ with West’s participation, security chief warns 
"We express a very serious concern over this clearly dangerous situation that threatens to turn into a global disaster, if it is not stopped," Nikolay Patrushev warned 
MOSCOW, November 3. /TASS/. Kiev is putting together a ‘dirty bomb’ with the West’s participation and the situation will turn into a disaster if it is not stopped, Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Nikolay Patrushev said at a meeting of CIS security chiefs on Thursday. 
"According to the available data, Ukraine is carrying out work to create a ‘dirty’ nuclear charge. We believe that this process is taking place with the participation of Western patrons. In this regard, we express a very serious concern over this clearly dangerous situation that threatens to turn into a global catastrophe, if it is not stopped," the Russian security chief warned.

WNU Editor: Nikolay Patrushev is IMHO second to Putin on who is ruling Russia. I interpret his remarks as an indirect warning to the U.K., and to the U.S.. That if a dirty bomb is used, the Kremlin will be blaming London and Washington DC. 
He did not stop there.  Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev also made it very clear that the only country that benefited from the Nord Stream attacks was the U.S. .... Nord Stream terrorist attacks chiefly benefit US, says Russian security chief (Artsakh Press). He also gave his own reasons on why certain countries in the West are pursuing a policy of confrontation .... Global crisis sparked by West’s desire to impose its dominance, says top Russian official (TASS). More here ....

 Insider: Putin says he hasn't decided on a 2024 presidential run, a power move that a Russia expert says is how he keeps opposition 'off balance' 
* Putin still hasn't decided if he'll run for president in 2024, his spokesperson said.

* But keeping people guessing is standard practice for Putin, a Russia expert told Insider. 
President Vladimir Putin has not yet decided if he'll run in Russia's 2024 presidential election, his top spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Business Standard: As China-US ties worsen, Hong Kong bankers fear for their careers 
The defiant tone President Xi Jinping took toward the US got those hardworking financiers scared. 
It was supposed to be a big celebration for Hong Kong. This week’s Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, organized by the city’s central bank, was meant to showcase the revival of Hong Kong as Asia’s financial hub, after years of isolation that resulted from stringent Covid controls.

WNU Editor: Being one who has visited Hong Kong dozens of times since the 1980s, I know Hong Kong will always remain Hong Kong. But as a major financial hub for Asia .... under the rule of Xi I think those days are coming to an end.

What also does not help Hong Kong's future is that Beijing wants Shanghai to be the financial hub, and I think they are going to succeed at the expense of Hong Kong.]]></summary>

Gizmodo: After 3 Months in Space, China's Mysterious Spaceplane Ejects Unknown Object 
China's inaugural spaceplane mission in 2020 lasted for only two days, but this one just keeps on going. 
The saga of China’s spaceplane continues as the experimental vehicle just released a mystery object that’s now closely trailing behind in low Earth orbit. 
On Monday, the United States Space Force’s 18th Space Defense Squadron tracked an object in a similar orbit to the spaceplane, SpaceNews first reported. The object appeared to be very close to the spaceplane. So close, in fact, that the Space Force unit had to make sure it was a separate object before it was entered into the database as such. The object may have been ejected earlier from the spaceplane, perhaps between October 24 to 30, but it got added to the database on October 31, according to a tweet by Robert Christy from Orbital Focus.

National Interest: U.S. Forces Deployed to Ukraine to Fight Weapons Smuggling 

A “small number” of U.S. military forces are performing onsite inspections of weapons caches in Ukraine to ensure military aid to Kyiv is being properly accounted for, a senior U.S. defense official told journalists earlier this week. 
The defense official said there have been “several” such inspections, but they did not specify how many U.S. personnel there are in Ukraine and where the inspections were performed. Similar inspections were carried out prior to the war, but they were suspended after the Russian invasion commenced on February 24.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russian attacks were reported across large areas of Ukraine on Thursday, with heavy shelling in numerous regions damaging infrastructure, including electricity supplies to Europe's largest nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said.
The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days' worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said.

Remix: Some weapons destined for Ukraine ending up with Finnish criminals  
Weapons sent to Ukraine are finding their way across Europe 
Organized crime is on the rise in Finland, and there’s a high demand for weapons. Criminal networks have already established weapon smuggling routes between Finland and Poland. 
Europol, the European police cooperation organization, is reported to have warned in the summer that armed criminal groups could soon start smuggling weapons from Ukraine to EU member states. 
According to Christer Ahlgren, superintendent of the Organized Crime Intelligence Unit of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (Keskusrikospoliisi, KRP), Europol’s prediction has already become a reality in Finland: 
“We are seeing signs that these weapons are already in Finland, (…) and we have already seen signs that weapons delivered to Ukraine have been found in Finland,” Ahlgren says.

My personal concern is on shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles. Even before the war Ukraine was one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Coupled with the country also being one of the poorest in Europe, especially now, the temptation for someone to sell weapons like a shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile to a terror organization for a few tens of thousands of dollars is a temptation that I am sure some would take.]]></summary>

SEOUL (Reuters) - "Dad, I'm going out" were the last words Jung Hae-moon heard his daughter utter, at the end of a chat they had on the telephone on Saturday as she turned down an invitation to dinner.
Hours later, 30-year-old Jung Joo-hee was among 156 people, most of them in their teens and twenties, killed in the South Korean capital as they celebrated Halloween free of COVID restrictions for the first time in three years.
On Thursday, the young woman's family buried her ashes in a peaceful family plot outside Seoul, with a planted sapling and bouquets by her grave stone, in a sombre ceremony of prayers and tears.
"Rest well. Mum and dad will come see you," Jung Hae-moon said as the family stood by, together with his daughter's pet poodle.

The nation's overseas spy chief has warned that Australian intelligence agencies are likely to face heavier responsibilities as Western nations grapple with an increasingly assertive and powerful China. 
The director-general of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Paul Symon, who is due to retire shortly, gave a wide-ranging speech to the National Security College in Canberra earlier this week. 
Mr Symon said that during the Cold War the "batting order" among Western intelligence agencies was clear, with the United States taking the lead, followed next by the United Kingdom, and then Canada and Australia after that.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea unsuccessfully fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during a new salvo of launches Thursday, the South Korean military said, with Washington urging all nations to enforce sanctions on Pyongyang.
The launches prompted South Korea and the United States to extend their ongoing joint air drills, the largest-ever such exercises, citing North Korea's "provocations".
People in parts of northern Japan were ordered to seek shelter during the North's latest launches, which included two short-range missiles and followed a blitz of projectiles fired Wednesday.

Dan Sabbagh, The Guardian: Could Ukraine’s drone attack on Russian ships herald a new type of warfare? 
Use of boat drone appeared to demonstrate how effective these nimble and relatively cheap weapons can be  It had all the thrill of a daring commando raid, filmed live. 
But Saturday’s dawn raid on Russia’s Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol was not carried out by elite soldiers, but by 16 drones, nine in the air and seven at sea – prompting questions as to whether the attack represented a revolutionary moment in the history of warfare. 
Three years ago, it was Dominic Cummings, before his eventful tenure at Downing St, who wrote “A teenager will be able to deploy a drone from their smartphone to sink one of these multibillion-dollar platforms,” a reference to the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers, built at a total cost of £6.4bn.

WNU Editor: We have seen small speedboats heavily laden with explosives crash and explode ships before .... USS Cole bombing (Wikipedia). The difference now is that the attack at Sevastopol shows that it can be done remotely with unmanned speedboats, and in swarms. If Sevastopol was not at a war-time footing, the damage that these suicide speedboats could have done would have been incredible. 
The big fear that I have now is that terrorist organizations are taking note. The damage that such an attack can have on a major port in the world, especially if an LNG installation is targeted, would be enormous.]]></summary>

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that he had secured Moscow’s commitment to resurrect a deal safeguarding Ukrainian grain shipments, one that has been crucial to sustaining food supplies to developing nations amid the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. 
The deal, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July to guarantee the safe passage of cargo ships to and from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports after Russia’s invasion disrupted export operations, setting off widespread worries about global food security.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland will build a razor-wire fence on its border with Russia's Kaliningrad, its defence minister said on Wednesday, amid concerns that the enclave might become a conduit for illegal migration. 
Construction of the temporary 2.5-metre (8ft) high and 3-metre deep barrier will start immediately, Mariusz Blaszczak told a news conference. 
With tensions rising due to the war in Ukraine, he cited security concerns and referred to a crisis triggered last autumn when thousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants tried to cross the Belarus border into Poland, some of whom died.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Days before the polls close in the 2022 midterm elections, actions by Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are already being seen through the prism of the expected 2024 GOP presidential nomination contest.
DeSantis is starring in a new ad for GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who is facing an uncharacteristically tough re-election in deep-red Utah as he's being challenged by independent Evan McMullin, who won Lee's vote for president in 2016.
The ad, paid for by the far-right Club for Growth, is the first out-of-state ad featuring DeSantis backing a fellow Republican, according to Breitbart News.
Trump then re-endorsed Lee in a statement posted to his Truth Social website.

One person was found with gunshot wounds and was taken to the hospital and later died. Another teen boy was taken to the hospital but his condition is not known. 
Toronto Police Service (TPS) duty inspector Lori Kranenburg said that both victims are believed to be teenagers but she could not confirm if either victim was a student at the school. 
“It appears that there were several shots fired, but I don’t have an exact number. At this time we’re reviewing video and canvassing the area,” Kranenburg said.
Video circulating online apparently shows the events that led up to the shooting. The video shows one person backing away as three people walk towards him while words are exchanged. Shots then ring out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea's military said.
The launch comes after Pyongyang on Tuesday demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, calling them a provocation that may draw "more powerful follow-up measures."
Broadcaster YTN reported that an air raid warning was issued on the South Korean island of Ulleung around the time of the missile launch. A spokesman for South Korea's military said they were checking to see whether the air raid warning was related to the missile launch.
The United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day.
North Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills.

The Lions’ Den, a new Palestinian resistance group, has emerged. Here’s what that says about the state of the Israel-Palestine conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Harry Potter" star Daniel Radcliffe described why he spoke out author J.K. Rowling in a new interview.
Radcliffe was discussing the open letter he released in 2020, in which he criticized Rowling’s views on gender identity.
“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that," Radcliffe told IndieWire.
"And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important,” he explained.

In his June 2020 open letter posted at The Trevor Project, Radcliffe wrote, "Transgender women are women."
"Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I," Radcliffe explained.]]></summary>

FOX News: US, Saudi Arabia on high alert over intel of impending Iranian attack: report 
Planned strikes are believed to be targeting Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
The United States and Saudi Arabia are on high alert after Saudi intelligence shared with the U.S. indicated that Iran is expected to carry out an attack on targets in Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Officials from both countries reportedly told the Journal about the concern over coming attacks. Saudi officials said that in addition to Saudi Arabia, Iran is also looking to strike Erbil, Iraq, where U.S. troops are located. 
The planned attacks are said to be intended as a distraction from protests taking place in Iran against the Islamic nation's leadership.

WNU Editor: I follow Iran very closely. I have seen no uptick in military positioning or movement. I would be shocked if Iran does launch strikes against Saudi Arabia. 
All that I can say is let us pray that such a conflict does not happen. A major war in the Middle East will mean +$200 for a barrel of oil coupled with widespread shortages and rationing. A collapse in supply chains and the global economy. A severe recession, or more likely a severe depression with massive unemployment and social unrest.

        <updated>2022-11-01T18:05:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U2's Bono on Tuesday released his memoir "Surrender," detailing the journey from his youth in Dublin to fronting one of the world's most prominent rock bands.
The introspective book is organized across 40 different U2 songs, including 40 original drawings.
The 62-year-old artist born Paul David Hewson is a long-time humanitarian well-known for lending his voice to a variety of causes, including the fight against poverty and AIDS.
In his more than 500-page book, Bono delves in to those ambitions but also his growth as a teenager struck by tragedy -- his mother died suddenly when he was 14 -- and an account of his heart operation in 2016.
He also waxes on the perplexities and finer points of songwriting, and "the pseudo-religious part of being a rock star, how we put the messy in messianic."
"U2's music was never really rock 'n' roll," he writes in the book. "Under its contemporary skin it's opera -- a big music, big emotions unlocked in the pop music of the day."
The rocker is promoting the memoir with a 14-date book tour entitled "Stories of Surrender," which kicks off in New York this week and includes stops in Chicago, London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and, of course, Dublin.
"When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I'd previously only sketched in songs," Bono said in a statement when the book's publication was announced earlier this year.
"Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept," he continued. "I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist."
"Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way."

By arming the Russians, the Iranian regime "is involved in killing innocent Ukrainians," White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.
"At its core, this is a regime in Tehran that is openly and willingly making themselves an accomplice to the murder of innocent Ukrainian people on Ukrainian soil."
Kirby noted Iran's provision of attack drones to Russia, which have been deployed in recent weeks to damage Ukraine infrastructure.
But he would not confirm reports that Tehran could also send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
"We remain concerned about the potential of Iran to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles," Kirby told reporters.
"We haven't seen that bear out, but it's a concern that we have," he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day, research estimated Tuesday, suggesting that the omnipresent pollution poses a bigger danger to the world's largest animal than previously thought.
The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood.
Now a modeling study published in the journal Nature Communications has estimated how much is being ingested by whales.
A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements.
"It's basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale," said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study's first author.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October 2022 is set to be the hottest month of October in France since records started in 1945, national weather agency Meteo-France said in a statement. 
With an average temperature close to or even just above 17 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit) - three to four degrees above normal levels - last month was far warmer than the previous record in October 2001, when temperatures averaged 16.3C.
The second half of the month saw an exceptionally long and intense period of unseasonably high temperatures, with the southwestern city of Bordeaux registering on Oct. 16 the latest 30C since records started.
Meteo-France said that due to climate change, periods of unusual heat late or early in the year were set to become more frequent.
Beach resorts across Europe have extended their season as the unseasonable warmth kept tourists coming to the seaside.
