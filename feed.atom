Reports The War Zone obtained reveal new details about swarming incidents off Southern California in 2019 and many more across the Pacific. 
The U.S. Navy has released 35 brief reports regarding various incidents involving its ships and facilities and unidentified small uncrewed aircraft systems, or sUASs, across the entire span of the Pacific between 2016 and 2021. Not all of the reports appear to be notable, and some are clearly innocuous, but others absolutely provide additional evidence of concerning trends that The War Zone has been actively reporting on in recent years. Among the newly released reports, for instance, is one that covers a worrying encounter that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton had with four drones in the Pacific off the coast of southern California in 2019, which you can read more about in our past reporting here.

WNU Editor: There definitely is something out there .... EXCLUSIVE: Dramatic videos of UFOs over the Pacific are revealed, as expert pilots describe seeing bright lights moving in 'race track' circles over the summer - but say their employers told them to keep quiet (Daily Mail). 
The above Joe Rogan video is a must see. 
Former US F-18 Navy pilot Ryan Graves gives his account on UFO encounters. He gives a few details that are fascinating to listen to. That some of these UFOs are spherical in shape, translucent, and in the sphere is a grayish-black cube?!?!? They can travel at very high altitudes at mach .6 to .7.. They were spotted all the time. Had the capability to move in a "race track" circle (for 13 hours!!!!). But the big revelation (for me) is that they have the capability to stay stationary in one spot even at a high altitude where the winds are intense (130mph to 140mph).]]></summary>

Space News: Space Force briefing on military space race catches Jeff Bezos’ attention 
WASHINGTON — U.S. Space Systems Command officials earlier this month gave an unclassified briefing to Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos on the power competition taking place in the space domain. 
Executives from the space company Blue Origin heard the briefing in September at a Space Systems Command industry meeting in Los Angeles. “The Blue Origin team was so impressed that they requested that SSC brief Jeff Bezos,” Col. Joseph Roth, the command’s director of innovation and prototyping, said Oct. 19 at the Space Industry Days conference hosted by AFCEA Los Angeles. 
The briefing was conducted by SMSgt. Ron Lerch, senior enlisted leader of Space Systems Command’s intelligence directorate.

Would Russia launch a small nuke? Look to the US’s own troubled nuclear history. 
 Russia has about 2,000 small nuclear weapons, known as tactical nukes. But most of the world probably hadn’t been thinking about them until Vladimir Putin reached new desperate lows in the invasion of Ukraine. “This is not a bluff,” he said upon the mass mobilization of Russian troops last month. “And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.”

More than half of all registered voters see the mainstream media as a threat to American democracy, according to a new poll. 
A New York Times-Siena College poll published Tuesday found 59 percent of voters view the media as a “major threat to democracy,” while 25 percent said the press is a “minor threat” and only 15 percent said it poses no threat. 
The divide fell sharply along partisan lines, with 87 percent of voters who supported former President Trump in 2020 indicating they view the media is a major threat, while 33 percent of Biden voters during that election cycle said the same thing.

Exactly two years ago, on October 19, 2020, one of the dirtiest tricks in electoral history was played on the American people by 51 former intelligence officials, who used the false alarm of “Russian interference” to stop Donald Trump winning a second term as president. 
Using the institutional weight of their former esteemed roles, they signed a dishonest letter to mislead voters 15 days before the election, claiming that material from Hunter Biden’s laptop published by the New York Post “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”

Reuters: U.S. considering joint weapons production with Taiwan 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government is considering a plan to jointly produce weapons with Taiwan, a business lobby said on Wednesday, an initiative intended to speed up arms transfers to bolster Taipei's deterrence against China. 
U.S. presidents have approved more than $20 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan since 2017 as China has ramped up military pressure on the democratically-governed island Beijing claims as its own territory. 
But Taiwan and the U.S. Congress have warned of delivery delays because of supply chain difficulties and backlogs caused by increased demand for some systems due to the war in Ukraine. 
"It's right at the beginning of the process," Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which counts numerous U.S. defense contractors as members, said of the plan.

The Intercept: Saudis Sought Oil Production Cut So Deep It Surprised Even Russia  
OPEC+ slashed oil production following a Saudi pressure campaign that experts say aims to hurt Democrats in the midterms. 
The Saudi-led oil cartel OPEC+’s announcement earlier this month that it was cutting 2 million barrels of oil per day — a move that would drive up the price of oil just a month before midterm elections — rankled Democrats in Washington. They accused Riyadh of aligning itself with Russia, another powerful member of OPEC+, which would indeed profit off the move. “What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
But Saudi Arabia actually pushed to cut oil production twice as much as Russian President Vladimir Putin, surprising the Russians, two Saudi sources with knowledge of the negotiations told The Intercept, suggesting that Riyadh’s motives run deeper than what top Democrats want to admit. The sources requested anonymity, fearing reprisal by the Saudi government.

WNU Editor: I agree with the above analysis that the Saudis want to hurt the Democrats in the midterms, and it looks like they will succeed. 
Here is a prediction. If the US Democrats lose control of the Senate and House, they will blame the Saudis. 
On a side note. Expect even higher gas prices next month .... Oil Will Surge By More Than $30/bbl To "Well Over $100" After The Midterms (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

The Navy submarine visit in the Arabian Sea comes amid tensions with Pakistan 
The commander of the Defense Department's Central Command (CENTCOM) visited a nuclear submarine in international waters Wednesday in a possible move designed to send a message to adversaries in the region.

During the visit, he received a demonstration of the vessel's capabilities, which operates globally under the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).

Daily Mail: Mystery of Russia's 'missing' nuclear tests: No sign of long-awaited drills amid claims Putin's atomic plans are being 'disrupted' from within with top brass 'sabotaging plans to use nuclear weapons' 
* Russia was expected to carry out long-awaited 'Grom' nuclear drills this week 
* Air alerts were put out over swathes of Arctic suggesting long-range missiles and potentially nuclear bombs were going to be tested 
* But so far there is no sign of drills taking place and alert areas have been silent 
* Russian professor has claimed Putin's tests are being 'disrupted' from within 
Mystery surrounds Russian nuclear tests that were expected to take this week and never materialised, amid claims they are being 'disrupted' from within. 
Moscow typically carries out large-scale atomic drills dubbed 'Grom' at this time of year and in recent days had issued a number of airspace alerts over its usual testing grounds - heavily suggesting they would be going ahead. 
But the US says it has received no alert from Moscow about any upcoming tests and there has been no official word from the Kremlin explaining their absence, with the air alerts due to expire Saturday.

Wall Street Journal: China's Military Is Catching Up to the U.S. Is It Ready for Battle?  
China’s military is emerging as a true competitor to the U.S. under Xi Jinping. 
The People’s Liberation Army now has hypersonic missiles that evade most defenses, a technology the U.S. is still developing. Its attack drones can swarm to paralyze communications networks. China’s naval ships outnumber America’s, and it launched its third aircraft carrier this summer, the first to be designed and built in the country. Its defense budget is second only to the U.S.’s. China’s military has more serving members, at around 2 million, compared with just under 1.4 million in the U.S. 
The question for Mr. Xi, which he has raised in public, is whether those forces are ready for battle. 
China hasn’t fought a war since a brief border clash with Vietnam in 1979. Unlike American forces, who have fought for most of the past two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan, China’s service members have virtually no combat experience—which some Chinese leaders have referred to as a “peace disease.” Finding a solution short of actual war has been a priority for Mr. Xi, especially as he seeks to prepare the country for a potential showdown with the U.S.

 WNU Editor: I know my Chinese friends firmly believe that China's military capabilities now far exceed what the U.S. has in Asia. As to becoming a global military power equal to the U.S.. Quoting the above article .... 
.... Mr. Xi’s ambition, according to China’s most recent defense white paper, is to complete a modernization of the military by 2035 and turn it into a “world-class force” by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party’s founding.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-10-20T17:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[German fintech N26, valued at $9 billion, has launched crypto trading on its mobile app.  Starting in Austria and rolling out to other countries in the coming months, N26 Crypto will allow its customers to buy and sell 200 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
The Berlin-based fintech announcement the October 20 launch in Austria responds to “strong local demand,” with 40% of N26 users actively trading or having expressed an interest in investing in cryptocurrencies.  N26 plans to roll out its crypto trading service to other key markets over the next 6 months. 
N26 customers with a verified identity can access N26 Crypto from the “Trading” section of the new “Finances” tab of their N26 app.  Thus, they can buy crypto from their fiat bank account.  Transaction fees are set at 1.5% for BTC and 2.5% for other currencies for regular accounts, with some additional discounts for N26 metal card holders.

According to N26 co-founder and co-CEO Valentin Stalf, the company sees its new product as an entry point for a new generation of investors, who are interested in digital assets despite recent market turmoil: 

“While cryptocurrencies have seen a decline in value over the past year, they remain a demanded and attractive asset class for investors and a growing part of the financial system.”

The platform is run in partnership with Vienna-based Bitpanda GmbH, which handles trade execution and coin custody. 
In November 2021, N26 announced its release of the American market and intends to focus exclusively on the European market.  However, the company has also encountered problems in Europe, with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) imposing the new customer cap on the company in May 2021.

This philosophy was brought to life at a recent “Girls Go Tech” workshop co-hosted by The Women’s Foundation, an NGO dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls in Hong Kong, and Steelcase; an industry leader in creating great experiences in the Learning and Work Spaces through architecture, technology, furniture and design services.  Launched in 2015, the “Girls Go Tech” (GGT) programme was put together by The Women’s Foundation to encourage female secondary school students from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue traditionally male-dominated STEM-related subjects. By connecting the students to various opportunities and stakeholders in the community, students are exposed to STEM subject matters and are given a hands-on opportunity to develop their self-confidence, problem solving skills, creativity and collaboration in order to help maximise their career options while achieving their academic and career goals.   The most recent of these events was a visit hosted by Steelcase at their WorkLife space in Central, where students were invited to put their thinking caps on to conceptualize how to use technology and space to create a design learning space that offered better learning experiences.     “Many of these girls lack confidence because they don’t have a chance at these experiences, so for some of our participants, this could be the first time they have even been to Central to go to a corporate partner’s office,” explained Connie Cheung, Programme Director for The Women’s Foundation. “This is a real eye-opening opportunity for them to visualize how technology is used in different industries.”   Of course, when it comes to nurturing a design thinking approach amongst students, there is no better place to experience this than at Steelcase’s very own…]]></summary>

* U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, helped by higher sales in its aeronautics unit which makes the F-35 fighter jet.

WASHINGTON - U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, helped by higher sales in its aeronautics unit, which makes the F-35 fighter jet, as the company sees demand for arms increasing after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Shares were up as much as 3.8% to $412.56 during morning trading in New York  The maker of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers and their ammunition, which Ukraine is using to beat back Russia’s incursion, saw lower profit margins compared with the same quarter a year ago.

Euractiv: Washington rejects Putin’s call to make Turkey Europe’s gas hub 
The US has reacted negatively to a proposal made by Russian President Vladimir Putin to turn Turkey into a gas hub for the EU. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently backed the Kremlin’s idea of creating an international gas hub in Turkey and urged his government on 14 October to quickly present implementation plans. 
“We have continued to urge our allies to take steps to diversify their energy sources, to reduce energy reliance on Russia. And in the case of Turkey, we are working with them closely to assist in their own efforts to enhance energy security in the long term,” US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington Post: Norway on edge over drone sightings, arrest of son of Putin confidante 
BRUSSELS — Norwegian officials warned Thursday that there could be more arrests after at least seven Russians — including the son of a close associate of President Vladimir Putin — were detained in the span of weeks for flying drones or taking pictures near sensitive areas, prompting an investigation by the domestic intelligence service. 
The news comes as Norway and other countries move to secure critical infrastructure in the wake of the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. 
It follows weeks of reports of drone sightings in its vast offshore oil and gas fields, as well as recent sightings at Norwegian airports. 
On Wednesday, Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store, blamed foreign intelligence — and indirectly pointed a finger a Russia. 
“It is not acceptable that foreign intelligence is flying drones over Norwegian airports. Russians are not allowed to fly drones in Norway,” he said, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong authorities have no power to invalidate 20,000 Covid-19 vaccination exemption certificates allegedly issued without proper medical diagnosis but still retain “extremely broad” discretion in deciding who can enter certain premises, the High Court has heard. Senior Counsel Abraham Chan Lok-shung, representing the health secretary, on Thursday acknowledged the absence of laws allowing authorities to overrule jab exemptions granted by doctors, adding the language adopted in the initial government announcement on the issue was inaccurate. Hong Kong ex-civil servant wins legal aid for judicial review of jab exemptions But he stressed the government was entitled to direct premises to refuse recognition of the “obviously suspect and potentially compromised” documents in a manner conducive to effective pandemic control, which, if not, would undermine the foremost objective of legislation. The expedited hearing arose from a high-profile judicial challenge mounted earlier this month by a retired civil servant, who questioned the legal basis for authorities to declare more than 20,000 exemption certificates null on the grounds they might have been forged by seven doctors arrested or wanted by police. Kwok Cheuk-kin, a well-known serial litigant, successfully applied for a temporary court order stopping authorities from putting their decision into effect, before securing legal aid to continue his cause.  Hectar Pun Hei, a senior counsel representing Kwok, submitted on Thursday that the health secretary had no power to overturn the opinion of a registered medical practitioner in relation to a person’s suitability for receiving Covid-19 shots, even if it turned out to be unreliable. He argued such uncertainty was “inherent” in the design of the vaccine pass scheme, which regulates entry of premises based on the visitor’s inoculation status. The barrister also said a “blanket” decision to annul all 20,000 certificates, despite the possibility some were genuine, contravened proper procedure. “The secretary has made no…]]></summary>

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy has adopted a “fight tonight” mentality as both China and Russia grow more aggressive, the chief of naval operations said, meaning the service must become more ready and more lethal for a near-term conflict. 
Adm. Mike Gilday said he stands by prioritizing readiness, then lethality and then growing the size of the fleet, but said during remarks at the Atlantic Council Wednesday the potential for a conflict with China in the next couple years makes it important to do all three.

Her brother was taken captive by China. She’s now become a leading figure in the campaign against China’s genocide in Xinjiang.
 


Rayhan Asat was full of excitement and energy, on the cusp of graduating from Harvard Law School, when her brother Ekpar suddenly vanished. 
This was 2016, and he was in Xinjiang, a territory in northwestern China, where the brother and sister — both members of the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethic minority — had grown up.
When she learned that he’d been forcibly disappeared — like more than a million Uyghurs who have since been forced into Xinjiang’s internment camps over the past five years— Asat wanted to use her legal training to publicly advocate for him and the rest of the Uyghurs. She was a human rights lawyer. Who could be bet…]]></summary>

Fred Aboagye-Antwi, Mamadou Coulibaly, Abdoulaye Diabate, and Jonathan Kayondo are developing a groundbreaking “gene drive” approach to eradicating malaria.
 
This could very well be the last century in human history when people die from malaria. If and when we do eradicate the disease, the team at Target Malaria will probably deserve a big share of the credit. Their plan to use gene drive technology to wipe out species of mosquitoes carrying the parasitic illness represents the most promising path to eradicating a disease that killed on the order of 150 million to 300 million people over the 20th century, and still kills hundreds of thousands each year.

The future generations commissioner for Wales represents constituents who haven’t yet been born.
 

Politicians in a democracy are supposed to represent their constituents. Which is what makes Sophie Howe’s position so unusual. As the future generations commissioner for Wales, it’s her task to call out policymakers when they’re on the verge of making a decision that might harm people in the long run — including people of the future who haven’t yet been born.
It’s a job that exists because Wales in 2015 passed the Well-being of Future Generations Act, which sets out long-term goals — like addressing socioeconomic disadvantage or ecological resilience — and obligates public institutions to work toward them. Howe monitors and assesses whether they’re succeedin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rishi Sunak is among the favourites to take over as PMCredit: PA   
The SUN: 'GAME IS UP' Who could replace Liz Truss as UK Prime Minister now that she has stepped down? 
LIZ Truss has announced she will step down as Prime Minister after just 44 days in power. 
But who will replace Ms Truss now she has been forced out as Conservative Party leader? And who is the favourite for the job? 
The PM announced the news earlier today in a statement to the nation at Downing Street. 
It came after days of pressure, with MPs saying she had no choice but to go. 
A Tory leadership race will now begin and a new PM will be chosen in the next WEEK. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: This is my prediction from last week before Liz Truss resigned as PM (link here), and I am still holding to it ....
.... IMHO Liz Truss' days of being PM are numbered. I will not be surprised if she asked by senior Conservative members next week to resign. 
As to who will replace her? 
My money is on Rishi Sunak (link here). His image of being Britain's "Obama" will probably appeal to enough members in his party to support him as the next UK leader, as well as his globalist ties. 
As to the bigger question .... will Rishi Sunak be a good leader? 
I have my doubts. 
The decision to wage economic war against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine has devastated European economies, and in turn a number of EU governments have been defeated in recent elections. Rishi Sunak does not strike me as someone who has the understanding that the EU must reverse its Russia strategy, nor the leadership qualities to make the case on why this must be done. 
Another prediction. The Labor Party is well positioned to win the next election.]]></summary>

 Reuters: Putin boosts Russia's war footing with troops on back foot in Ukraine 
KYIV/MIKOLAIV — President Vladimir Putin ordered all of Russia to support the war effort in Ukraine on Wednesday, as the Russian-appointed administration of Kherson prepared to evacuate the only regional capital Moscow has captured during its invasion. 
Images of people using boats to flee the southern city were broadcast by Russian state TV, which portrayed the exodus – from the right to left bank of the River Dnipro – as an attempt to evacuate civilians before it became a combat zone. 
The Russian-installed chief of Kherson – one of four Ukrainian regions unilaterally claimed by Moscow where Putin declared martial law on Wednesday – said about 50,000-60,000 people would be moved out in the next six days.

The severing of trade links and access to multinational production may cut real income by almost 12% and result in a “permanent decline in real gross domestic product” for Russia, Xiayi Du and Zi Wang from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics said in the study published in the journal Economics Letters.
“This welfare loss is mainly due to losing access to foreign final goods and intermediates,” they said.

 Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russia has defied the odds, and it has sent Russian President Vladimir Putin to a new point of desperation. 
On October 10, Russia rained dozens of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and some nine other cities, many deep into the country and away from the battlefield. The strikes killed at least 14 people and injured more than 90 others, according to Ukrainian officials, and in the days since, Russia has continued to strike…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of Justice Department prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.
Bloomberg reports:
A group of Justice Department prosecutors believe there is enough evidence to charge Donald Trump with obstruction of justice, but the path to an actual prosecution is far from clear.
The team as part of the classified records investigation has yet to make a formal recommendation to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who would ultimately approve or reject the move, according to people familiar with the matter. In several of Trump’s other investigations into potential crimes, officials are also unlikely to bring only obstruction charges, the people said.
Some FBI agents opposed accusing Trump because the case would be “political.” Other FBI agents supported the charges against Trump, but as Bloomberg noted, the FBI deemed it irrelevant because they didn’t make a decision on the charges.
Attorney General Merrick Garland and his team will ultimately decide whether Donald Trump is charged. The Justice Department is unlikely to bring obstruction of justice charges against Trump alone. Trump is more likely to face charges of theft, mishandling and refusal to hand over government documents.
The Justice Department will not bring any charges against Trump, and they will seek to build the best and most likely winning case before charging the former president.
Donald Trump has Multiple violations of the law before, during and after the end of his presidency. It is up to the DOJ to decide which case is most likely to result in a conviction.

The causeway, the only road connecting islanders to the rest of the state, has been severely damaged by Hurricane Ian. Temporary repairs were completed early Wednesday and access to the bridge over the causeway was restored.
“Removing bureaucratic red tape and delivering on our promise to keep Sanibel Island operational has always been a priority. By restoring access on the causeway… residents will be better able to recover from this storm,” Republican Gov. Ron R. Ron DeSantis said.
The quick completion of the repairs required 100 FDOT workers and diving teams, who put in a combined 36,000 hours of work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s its own pocket of sunshine.
Singer/songwriter Natasha Bedingfield is the latest star to buy a house in Bedford, NY.
Bedingfield and her husband, businessman Matt Robinson, recently paid $1.44 million for a five-bedroom apartmentfive-bathroom home on Mianus Bluff Drive. 
The 5,618 square foot Colonial was built in 1994 and sits on 5.57 acres;  its offerings include a chef’s kitchen that opens to a large outdoor deck as well as a library and finished basement.
Bedingfield (who was replaced by Compass broker Melissa Marcogliese) joins A-listers Matt Damon, who bought an $8.5 million four-bedroom apartment Westchester estate with his wife Luciana Barroso in July, and Ryan Murphy (once dubbed TV’s most powerful man for creating shows like “Glee” and “American Horror Story”), who bought the nearby Pound Ridge estate from Richard Gere in May for $28 million through Coldwell Banker listing broker Diane Hackert.

During the height of the pandemic in 2020, Bedingfield and Robinson sold their house in Hollywood Hills for $2.53 million — $289,000 more than requested — in less than two weeks. 
The buyer was actress Sydney Tamiia Poitier, the daughter of actors Sidney Poitier and Joanna Shimkus.

Tuesday's strikes appeared to be aimed at Ukrainian power stations that Russian-guided suicide drones had failed to reach the previous day.
But the body of Tetyana's 44-year-old son Oleksiy had been missing since his capture in Russia's aborted assault on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war in March.
Tetyana never saw her son's corpse after its discovery in a random field last month.
Her granddaughter decided it would be too much.
"She wouldn't let me see his interrogation video either," the grieving mother said.
"She told me that I wouldn't recognize him after what they had done to him."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James Bond actor Daniel Craig on Tuesday received the same honor held by his fictional character, as he is set to retire from the role.
The 54-year-old British actor who played Bond for the fifth and final time in 2021 film "No Time To Die", was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, a rare honor that author Ian Fleming bestowed on his fictional agent.
Craig bowed his head and smirked as Princess Anne, wearing naval uniform, put the order on its ribbon around his neck during an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The actor received the honor for his outstanding contribution to film and theatre.
Craig was in the British capital for the European premiere of whodunnit drama "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery", which closed the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday.
"We've been expecting you", the royal family's official Twitter account captioned its photograph, quoting a line famously used by a Bond villain.
James Bond was said to have received the honor in his obituary in "You Only Live Twice," Ian Fleming Publications tweeted.
It was not the first time Craig reprised his Bond role with the royal family in on the joke.
He donned a tuxedo to film a spoof clip with Queen Elizabeth II and her corgis for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Games Olympics hosted by London. .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu released his memoir Tuesday, reaffirming an ambition to return to power in the coming elections and retracing his up-and-down relations with US presidents.
Netanyahu, also commonly known as Bibi, is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, with a first term from 1996 to 1999 and an unprecedented 12-year stretch until 2021.
In "Bibi: My Story", the 72-year-old politician said he will be "forever grateful" for the time in opposition that allowed him to complete his memoir, since a motley coalition of parties ousted him but failed to last its term.
Published just two weeks before Israelis go to the polls, the 650-page autobiography has not generated major headlines in Israel or abroad, lacking bombshell revelations offered in some politicians' memoirs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Jair Bolsonaro is prompting fears for Brazil’s democratic system by threatening to appoint new judges to the Supreme Court, the central institution to the country’s young democracy. Between the two presidential rounds, Bolsonaro is blowing hot and cold on the issue – making threats to galvanize his base, then backing down to reassure undecided voters. If re-elected, however, the far-right president could well find the numbers to make changes to the court.
The outcome of the bitter contest between Bolsonaro and social democratic ex-president Lula Inacio de Silva is hard to predict, ahead of the second round of Brazil’s presidential election on October 30.
After getting 48 percent of the vote in the first round on October 2, Lula started trying to reach out to evangelical Christian…]]></summary>

The main suspect, identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders, was questioned earlier Monday alongside an older man suspected of sheltering her.
The 24-year-old has been charged with the rape and murder of a minor aged under 15 along with torture and abuse, the source said.
A judge ordered that she be held in provisional custody.
Prosecutors said in a press release Monday that under questioning, the woman made "varying statements, switching between admitting and denying the facts of the case."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Russia's Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from "our enemy", a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament's lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.
"Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy," Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.
Russia uses the term "special military operation" to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.
The move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.
They were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.
Another deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the "special military operation". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.
"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies," Svintsov said.

Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said Australia "will always be a steadfast friend of Israel" and was committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestine coexist in peace within internationally recognized borders.
The government "recommits Australia to international efforts in the responsible pursuit of progress towards a just and enduring two-state solution", she said in a statement.

The protesters claimed that all the evicted students were women in a move that comes as the Taliban has increasingly restricted girls' access to education.
"Today's protest was for girls who have been expelled," organizer Zholia Parsi told AFP after Taliban forces dispersed the rally.
Organizers also called for the reopening of girls' secondary schools, which have been shut since the Taliban returned to power last year.
In several cities, women have staged sporadic protests against harsh restrictions imposed by the hardline Islamists.

PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, asking for higher salaries amid decades-high inflation and posing President Emmanuel Macron one of his stiffest challenges since his reelection in May.
The strike, which will primarily affect public sectors such as schools and transportation, is an extension of the weeks-long industrial action that has disrupted France's major refineries and put petrol stations' supply in disarray.
Trade union leaders are hoping workers will be energized by the government's decision to force some of them to go back to work at petrol depots to try and get the fuel flowing again, a move some say put in jeopardy the right to strike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAO PAULO (Reuters) -A man was killed near a campaign event in Sao Paulo for a close ally of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday, authorities said, after the sound of gunfire interrupted the event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. 
The Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. 
“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”
The official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”
The FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. 
"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”
“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States said Monday that it had confidence in Pakistan's ability to control its nuclear arsenal after President Joe Biden expressed alarm, leading Islamabad to summon the US ambassador.
"The United States is confident of Pakistan's commitment and its ability to secure its nuclear assets," State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
"The US has always viewed a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests and, more broadly, the US values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan," he said.
Biden made the off-the-cuff remarks on Pakistan's nuclear program Thursday while at a private Democratic Party fundraiser in California where he began to discuss challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China, a close ally of Pakistan.
"And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion," Biden said, according to a White House transcript.
Pakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a "responsible nuclear state" and that it takes safety measures "with the utmost seriousness."
US officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan's Taliban.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden's remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.
But Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.
Patel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.
"This is a relationship we view as important and it's something that we're going to continue to remain deeply engaged in," he said.]]></summary>

Exxon did not say if it received any compensation for the assets, which it had valued at more than $4 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix on Monday defended its latest series of "The Crown" after former British prime minister John Major lashed out at a story line showing King Charles plotting to oust the late queen.
Major's tenure as prime minister from 1990-1997 covered a turbulent period for the royals that included the divorce of Charles and his wife Princess Diana.
But reported scenes in the fifth series -- defended by streaming giant Netflix as a "fictionalized dramatization" -- have incensed the former premier.
In one scene, heir to the throne Charles attempts to draw Major into a conspiracy to force the abdication of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.
A statement issued by Major's office castigated Netflix for the scenes describing them as "damaging and malicious fiction".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.
In an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned "peace plan" between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine's continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.
"This is a classic Putin play," she said of Musk's recent attempts to interject himself as a "peacemaker" between Russia and Ukraine. "Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin."
Hill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.

"He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process," she explained. "He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia."

Possible charges include the rape and murder of a minor aged below 15 along with torture, abuse and concealing a body, a source in the French judiciary told AFP, adding that prosecutors had ordered two people held in provisional custody.
The main suspect has been identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders.
She was arrested on Saturday in Bois-Colombes in Paris' northwestern suburbs, after being spotted on CCTV images from the block of flats home to the young victim, identified only by her first name, Lola.

Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv shortly before the first explosion at around 6:35 am (0335), followed by sirens across most of the country.
"The capital was attacked by kamikaze drones," the president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.
"The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation," he added.
"We need more air defense systems and as soon as possible. More weapons to defend the sky and destroy the enemy."

But few were prepared for the scale of the sound and fury – least of all Truss herself.
In just six weeks, the prime minister’s libertarian economic policies have triggered a financial crisis, emergency central bank intervention, multiple U-turns and the firing of her Treasury chief.
Now Truss faces a mutiny inside the governing Conservative Party that leaves her leadership hanging by a thread.
Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon fumed on Sunday that the last few weeks had brought “one horror story after another.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia has rejected US accusations of aligning itself with Russia amid the Ukraine war by making oil production cuts to drive up crude prices, insisting it was purely a business decision.
"We are astonished by the accusations that the kingdom is standing with Russia in its war with Ukraine," the Saudi defense minister, Prince Khaled bin Salman, tweeted late Sunday.
The Saudi-led OPEC+ cartel -- which includes Russia -- has angered Washington by deciding to cut production by two million barrels per day from November, adding further pressure on soaring crude prices.
"It is telling that these false accusations did not come from the Ukrainian government," Prince Khaled wrote. "Although the OPEC+ decision, which was taken unanimously, was due to purely economic reasons, some accused the k…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ninety-two migrants were found almost naked and bruised after allegedly being forced across the Evros river from Turkey into Greece, Athens said Sunday, a charge fiercely denied by Ankara.
EU border agency Frontex confirmed to AFP the arrival of the group in circumstances which the Greek ministry for civil protection said sent out an "inhuman image."
"The Frontex officers reported that the migrants were found almost naked and some of them with visible injuries," said Paulina Bakula, spokeswoman for the organization.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet that it was "deeply distressed by the shocking reports and images of 92 people, who were reported to have been found at the Greek-Turkish land border, stripped of their clothes".
Bakula, speaking from Frontex's Warsaw HQ, said Front…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden has "no plans" to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at an upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday. 
Stormy US-Saudi relations have seen new strain over Riyadh's recent support for oil production cuts, with Biden warning of unspecified "consequences."
The move last week by OPEC+ -- composed of the Riyadh-led OPEC cartel and an additional group of 10 exporters headed by Russia -- would reduce global output by up to two million barrels per day from November.
It could send energy prices soaring amid an energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, and as inflation-weary American voters prepare to cast ballots in midterm elections.
The move was widely seen as a diplomatic slap in the face, since Biden traveled …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva traded jabs and insults as they squared off Sunday in their first-ever head-to-head debate, two weeks from Brazil's presidential runoff election.
Lula attacked Bolsonaro as the "king of fake news," drawing accusations of lying, corruption and a "disgraceful" record in return, as the rivals sparred in the first debate for their polarizing second-round showdown on October 30.
Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-president (2003-2010) who is seeking a comeback at 76, was particularly fiery criticizing Bolsonaro over his handling of Covid-19, which has killed 687,000 people in Brazil, second only to the United States.

Near the southern border with Equatorial Guinea, eight villages have registered complaints with the Campo Ma'an national park, a vast area of virgin forest from where the animals emerge.
An estimated 500 gorillas and more than 200 elephants -- both endangered species -- roam the reserve's 264,000 hectares (652,000 acres).
A week after elephants flattened his banana plantation close by the park, Simplice Yomen, 47, is struggling to cope.
"We are at the end of our tether," he sighs.
The elephants eat the new growth inside the banana tree trunks after splitting them open.
