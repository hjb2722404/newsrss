Newsweek: Russia Deploys Boom Defenses Around Crimea Bridge To Block Drone Strikes 
Moscow has laid out floating, spiked boom defenses in the hope of fending off Ukrainian drone attacks in Crimea, according to Mash, a Russian news outlet known for sharing exclusive content sourced from Moscow security agencies. 
Booms are long barriers deployed on water that aim to stop surface drones getting close to their targets. 
The booms are likely intended to make it more difficult for Ukrainian unmanned surface Surface Vehicles (USVs) to attack critical Russian infrastructure like bridges, according to Marina Miron, a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, U.K.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  NTK Academic Group’s Achievement on IBDP Tuition  As students approach the IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme) or other final school exams which pave the way to further education, most can benefit from extra tuition to help them navigate through the confusion of syllabus changes and stricter marking schemes.  Typically, these sessions cover all the key aspects of the relevant curriculum, elucidating and reinforcing as and where necessary. But ideally, they will also do more by providing insights and practical tips on everything from study techniques and essay writing to exam strategies, time management and independent learning skills in order for students to achieve the best possible results.     “Our courses give students a stronger academic foundation and help them develop the skills they need to succeed in higher education and beyond,” says Mr T. K. Eric Ng, Founder of NTK Academic Group, which has been operating in Hong Kong for almost 28 years. “We can create individualised learning plans based on each student’s academic needs and targets. These plans outline specific goals to work towards and progress is regularly assessed.”   NTK’s teachers, many of whom have advanced degrees from renowned universities like Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League, are among the best in their fields. This ensures that students receive high-quality instruction and support from a knowledgeable and experienced team.  A wide range of subjects is on offer, not just for the IBDP curriculum, but also for the IGCSE, GCE A-Levels and the standardised university admissions tests often required of candidates applying from international schools and boarding schools.   As a result, NTK has helped more than 80 students achieve full scores (a total of 45 marks) in the IBDP over the past three years, with a further 200 getting a 7 in various subjects.     “Whether for group courses using proprietary materials developed by IBDP…]]></summary>

Politics: U.S. expects to begin delivering Abrams tanks to Ukraine in September

 
The news, provided by six people familiar with discussions, marks the most specific information to date on Washington’s plans. 
U.S. Abrams tanks are likely to arrive on the Ukrainian battlefield in September, according to six people familiar with the planning, as Kyiv’s forces push to retake territory in a counteroffensive that is picking up steam. 
The plan is to send a handful of Abrams tanks to Germany in August, where they will undergo final refurbishments. 
Once that process is complete, the first batch of Abrams will be shipped to Ukraine the following month.

SCMP: China names General Wang Houbin as new PLA Rocket Force chief after former commanders snared in corruption scandal 
* An unusually sweeping shake-up will see the force responsible for the country's nuclear arsenal get a new commander and political commissar at the same time 
* The force's former head Li Yuchao and other senior commanders have been placed under investigation, according to military sources 
Beijing has appointed a new leadership for the force responsible for its nuclear arsenal after its former commanders were snared in an anti-corruption campaign. 
Wang Houbin, the navy's former deputy commander, will become the new head of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, while Xu Xisheng will move from Southern Theatre Command to become its new political commissar, state broadcaster CCTV reported. 
Their appointments were announced as both Wang and Xu were promoted from the rank of lieutenant general to full general at a ceremony on Monday. Neither general has served with the force before.

Reuters: China curbs exports of drone equipment amid U.S. tech tension 
BEIJING (Reuters) -China on Monday announced export controls on some drones and drone-related equipment, saying it wanted to safeguard "national security and interests" amid escalating tension with the United States over access to technology. 
The restrictions on equipment including some drone engines, lasers, communication equipment and anti-drone systems would take effect on Sept. 1, the commerce ministry said. 
The controls would also affect some consumer drones, and no civilian drones could be exported for military purposes, a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States will rely on allies rather than a major expansion of its own forces to counter any Chinese military risk in the Pacific, a US general has told AFP.
Beijing enjoys "very clear" advantages in the region, said Major General Joseph Ryan, commander of the 12,000-strong 25th Infantry Division on Oahu, Hawaii.
He cited China's expanding military defenses, its long-range rocket missile capability and the ease with which it can position forces and equipment in the Pacific.
By contrast, in the event of conflict, the United States and its allies would have to traverse international waters or the territories of multiple nations, requiring their permission as well as the mobilization of air, land and sea transport.

Many in the media and politics anticipated dramatic and rapid Ukrainian victories during the summer of 2023. Nevertheless, progress on the ground has been slow, raising the prospects of a protracted war. 
This begs the question: Just how much longer could the war last? 
The precedent of prior wars is one way of looking at the issue.  On the graph below, we consider the three wars perhaps most similar to the current war, each involving Russia.

WNU Editor: My Russian and Ukrainian contacts believe this war is going to last into 2024. 
As to what is my take. 
I originally thought that the war would end around 2023 - 2024. But with the Kremlin's announcement last week that the conscription age has been raised to 30, I am not sure. There is a very strong possibility that if the West continues to supply Ukraine the weapons and ammo that it needs, this war can easily go into 2025.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Towing began Sunday of a cargo ship packed with electric cars that went up in flames off the Dutch coast following delays due to weather conditions, authorities said, racing to prevent an ecological disaster.
Movement of the smoldering Fremantle Highway – with nearly 500 electric vehicles on board – began in the last afternoon, early five days after the blaze began, the national water management agency Rijkswaterstaat said.
The ship is slowly being towed some 16 kilometers north of the Dutch islands Schiermonnikoog and Ameland, a few dozen kilometers from its last official position.
Saturday's attempt to salvage the ship was postponed due to high winds that engulfed the rescuing tug in smoke, posing health and safety risks for the crew.
"There was considerably less smoke on the cargo ship this afternoon," the government agency said, adding the vessel's stability was constantly being monitored following concerns of it sinking.
The tow could take up to 14 hours depending on weather conditions, smoke and the tide.
The cause of the fire that broke out late Tuesday remains unclear, although the vessel's owner has said one of the electric vehicles on board may have been the source.
The Fremantle Highway was located in the Wadden Sea at the time of the blaze, raising concerns about the impact of pollutants on the waters and nearby archipelago of ecologically sensitive islands.
One sailor died after he and 22 others were rescued from the burning ship that had forced some crew members to jump overboard.

In the third coup in as many years to fell a leader in the Sahel, Niger's elected president and Western ally, Mohamed Bazoum, has been held by the military since Wednesday.
General Abdourahamane Tiani, the head of the powerful presidential guard, has declared himself leader and said the putsch was a response to "the degradation of the security situation" linked to jihadist bloodshed, as well as corruption and economic woes.
Bazoum is one of a dwindling group of elected presidents and pro-Western leaders in the Sahel, where since …]]></summary>

China’s expanding military power and a swelling fleet of naval vessels have triggered some anxieties in the West. The PLA Navy has deployed more ships in the region than ever in the last decade. However, the US Pacific fleet Commander is optimistic about the US Navy’s readiness.

Previously, with an increase in China’s fleet size, Pentagon officials warned that China is a “pacing threat” to the US military and indicated that the US military could not keep up with China’s rapid naval development.

Sweden’s accession probably won’t hit parliament’s floor for months in Ankara, but the announcement still triggered an all-too-familiar media frenzy. “Erdogan’s Flip On Sweden Signals Mending ties with the U.S.,” ran a New York Times news analysis. “Turkey’s Reversal on Sweden’s NATO bid boosts alliance unity,” said Bloomberg.

Virginia-Pilot: Navy, Marine Corps to conduct second ‘Large Scale Exercise’ — a warfighting simulation  
The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are gearing up for the second “Large Scale Exercise,” a global training exercise that uses virtual reality simulations to synchronize naval operations. 
The live, virtual, constructive exercise will use real-world intelligence as part of a simulated scenario, putting 25,000 sailors and marines on a “road to war” in which they interact with each other and adversaries in a cyber battlespace — no different than a multiplayer video game. 
“We want to stress the three- and four-star admirals and their staffs at that operational level with large fleet-centric maneuvers. But we also want to stress all the way down to the individual sailor manning a radar station or marine at a weapons system. This exercise looks to encompass all of that,” said Capt. Chris Narducci of the Fleet Forces Interoperability Division.

WNU Editor: This will be a live, virtual exercise that will use real-world intelligence as part of a simulated scenario. The exercise will run from Aug. 9-18. It occurs every two years and spans 50 commands, including six carrier strike groups, three amphibious readiness groups, and 25 submarines and ships.]]></summary>

I know among the hundreds of Ukrainian refugees that I have helped to settle in Canada in the past year, none of them want to go back to Ukraine when the war is over. What they see is a devastated country that will owe hundreds of billions to their Western backers. Basically .... they have no interest to work for the rest of their lives paying off this debt. 
And this demographic collapse does not stop there. 
I know that once this war is over, and the border opens up that will permit Ukraine's male population to leave, a huge portion of this population will immigrate out of the country to rendezvous with their loved ones who have made a new home in the West. In the end I see Ukraine as a rump state, with a population of about 20 million.]]></summary>

RT: Russia is ready for confrontation with NATO – Putin

 
Moscow does not want a conflict with the Western-led bloc but is ready for any outcome, Russian president says  
Russia is “always ready for any scenario,” President Vladimir Putin told journalists on Saturday, commenting on a potential direct confrontation between the Russian and NATO militaries. The president was responding to a question about recent near-collisions involving Russian and American aircraft in Syria. 
“No one wants that,” the president added, pointing to the existing conflict-prevention lines that allow Russian and US officers to talk directly about “any crisis situation.” That fact that these lines still work shows that no side is interested in a conflict, he added. “If someone wants it – and that’s not us – then we’re ready,” Putin added.

The 15-nation ECOWAS bloc's response to the Sahel region's seventh coup of recent years came as crowds in Niger's capital Niamey burned French flags and stoned the former colonial power's mission, drawing tear gas from police.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ABC News: US announces historic $345 million military aid package for Taiwan 
U.S. will provide weapons to Taiwan from existing military stockpiles. 

Brisbane, Australia -- The United States has announced a historic $345 million military aid package for Taiwan which for the first time will come from existing U.S. military stockpiles instead of purchases through the foreign military sales program, the White House announced Friday. 
The announcement is a lesson learned from the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine where U.S.-made weapons are quickly getting to the battleground, but it will also likely rile China -- which considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province. 
The Pentagon has signaled for much of the year that it intended to prepare such a passage after Congress authorized $1 billion for military aid to be provided to Taiwan under what is known as a Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA). 
The $345 million aid package was announced by the White House in a brief statement issued late Friday afternoon.

WNU Editor: What is the big surprise in this announcement is that the US will be providing weapons to Taiwan from existing military stockpiles.

 
Update: China has responded .... China says US military aid to Taiwan will not deter its will to unify the island (AP).

West African leaders have threatened military action against Niger's military junta after it took power in a coup last week 
The leaders gave the junta seven days to reinstate President Mohamed Bazoum, who is being held captive. 
Earlier, the junta warned it would resist any "plan of aggression against Niger" by regional or Western powers. 
Meanwhile hundreds of coup supporters protested outside the French embassy in the capital Niamey. 
Leaders from Ecowas, the bloc of West African nations, held crisis talks in Nigeria on Sunday to discuss the latest coup - which follows army takeovers in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso. 
A statement read out after the summit said that Ecowas had "zero tolerance" for coups.

The regional bloc would "take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order" if its demands were not met within a week.

Reuters: Ukraine Extends Martial Law, Ruling Out October Parliament Vote 
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's parliament voted on Thursday to extend martial law by another 90 days until Nov. 15, ruling out the possibility of parliamentary elections being held in October. 
Ukraine brought in martial law on Feb. 24, 2022, the day Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour. 
The law, which bars 18- to 60-year-old men from leaving the country, has since been extended several times.

Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a member of parliament, said on the Telegram messaging app that an overwhelming majority of lawmakers voted to extend martial law in a session of the Verkhovna Rada parliament.

The heavy armor has stopped an attack by two tanks and several military vehicles, Russian media has reported . 

A single Russian tank supported by artillery has stopped a Ukrainian attack that involved around a dozen armored equipment pieces, Russian media reported on Saturday. A video of the battle first appeared on Telegram channels and was then posted by RIA Novosti. 
The fighting took place in Zaporozhye Region, where the Ukrainian troops sought to assault Russian defensive positions, the news agency reported. Russia’s aerial reconnaissance detected a Ukrainian column moving towards the frontline. “We had an armor piece in this area,” a Russian unit commander told RIA Novosti, adding that the tank’s crew was ordered to intercept the enemy and “engaged in a battle.”

WNU Editor: I think what we are seeing here is what happens when everything goes right for one side, and everything goes wrong for the other. 
On the Russian side we see a tank supported by drone observers (two of them), knowing where the mine fields are, followed with artillery and missile support. On the Ukraine side we see no drone observers, restricted in movement because they did not know where the mines are, and no artillery support.
 Luck (and bad luck) also probably played a role.]]></summary>

Reuters: Russia Extends Conscription for Compulsory Military Service up to Age 30 
 (Reuters) -Russia's lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to raise the maximum age at which men can be conscripted to 30 years from 27, increasing the number of young men liable for a year of compulsory military service at any one time. 
Last year, Russia announced a plan to boost its professional and conscripted combat personnel by more than 30% to 1.5 million, an ambitious task made harder by its heavy but undisclosed casualties in Ukraine. 
The new legislation, which comes into effect on Jan. 1, means men will be required to carry out a year of military service, or equivalent training during higher education, between the ages of 18 and 30, rather than 18 and 27 as now.

WNU Editor: This tells me that the Kremlin is expecting the Russia - Ukraine war to continue for a long time. I originally thought that the war would end around 2023 - 2024. I am now not too sure about that.]]></summary>

Reuters: More Wagner fighters move closer to Polish border, Poland PM says

Poland, a former Warsaw Pact member which has been a full member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance since 1999, has been concerned about the possible spillover of war on to its territory ever since Russian invaded Ukraine in February 2022. 
Earlier this month, Poland began moving more than 1,000 troops to the east of the country amid rising concerns that the presence of Wagner fighters in Belarus could lead to increased tension on its border.

Warzone/The Drive: Northrop Grumman Bails On Next Generation Fighter Competition

 
Northrop Grumman has decided to focus on other opportunities, among them is the Navy’s own 6th generation fighter program.  
Northrop Grumman has removed itself from the running, at least as a prime contractor, to design and build a new sixth-generation stealthy crewed combat jet under the U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. This is in line with a report last month that the field of NGAD combat jet competitors had shrunk from three to two, with the remaining pair widely believed to be Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company has left open the possibility of joining another NGAD team led by a different prime contractor. 
Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman's CEO, spoke of her company's current strategy around the Air Force's multi-faceted NGAD program during an earning call earlier today. In May, the service announced it had formally released a classified contract solicitation for the engineering and manufacturing phase of the development of the NGAD combat jet. This aircraft is ostensibly intended to replace the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, but is expected to have significantly more expansive capabilities that go well beyond a traditional fighter concept.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
