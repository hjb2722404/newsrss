        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[China should “accept” the recommendations from the United Nation’s report on its treatment of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim groups, Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says.

“This long-awaited UN report for which China sought to hold it back and have it suppressed does demonstrate very deep concerning aspects,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“What China should do is accept the recommendations, they should open their doors to allow thorough, independent scrutiny of what is happening in the Xinjiang province. 

“But certainly, the Australian government, with the Magnitsky sanction regime that was legislated early this year by the previous Coalition government with bipartisan support, the Albanese government should be looking at whether it is appropriate to apply targeted sanctions.

"And we would certainly offer bipartisan support if they did so in relation to addressing these clear human rights concerns.”]]></summary>

(Reuters) -Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday Ukrainian forces tried to seize the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine and "measures had been taken" to destroy the opposing troops, including use of military aviation. 
In a statement, the ministry said that up to 60 Ukrainian troops had crossed the Dnipro river, which divides territory held by the two sides, in boats at 6 a.m. local time (0300 GMT).
It called the operation a "provocation" aimed at disrupting a planned visit by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to the nuclear plant.  It also accused Ukraine of shelling both the meeting point of the IAEA delegation, and the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant itself.

The visit by the team of 14 experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including its chief Rafael Grossi, came at a crucial moment for the plant, which has endured constant shelling and raised fears of a nuclear accident.

   WNU editor: Here is an easy prediction. It is going to get worse this winter. 
What will you be doing if your utility bills increased 10X?

This isn’t the first time Muqtada al-Sadr has said he’s leaving politics. Here’s what it means for Iraq.
 This week, Iraq’s capital city has been caught in lethal violence between political factions.

Action near islet comes after Taipei vowed to take tough measures to deal with increase in such intrusions

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell modestly this week, a poor sign for his Democratic Party's hopes in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday.
The two-day national poll found that 38% of Americans approve of Biden's job performance. 
While Biden's approval rating hit 41% last week, it has been mostly below 40% since mid-June despite a string of Democratic legislative victories that Biden's allies hope will help them defend their narrow congressional majorities in November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump's lawyers are set for a major showdown with the Department of Justice in court tomorrow.  

In a bombshell filing, the Justice Department has argued former US president Donald Trump deliberately obstructed FBI attempts to retrieve classified documents from Mar-a-Lago. 

The DOJ released a photo showing documents that FBI agents took, with some covered up and some baring the markings of highly classified, all laid out on a carpet. 

“Unfortunately, this is probably just going to add fuel to the fire for so many people who believe this was conducted improperly,” Fox News contributor Lara Trump said. 

“It should have never been done this way, it’s totally unnecessary and looks like a political attack on Donald Trump.”]]></summary>

The pipeline, operated by the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, cited the pipeline would be out of action for three days due to maintenance.

During the six-month pilot, more than 3,000 workers are working 80 per cent of their usual week in exchange for promising 100 per cent productivity. 

4 Day Week Global Program Manager Alex Soojung-Kim Pang says for the overwhelming majority of the companies that have reported, the news is positive.  

“More than half of them, I think about 55 per cent, say that productivity is at the same level it was when we were working five days or higher,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“Only five per cent say that it’s maybe dropped a little bit and across the board, people say that they are happier, they’re less stressed, they feel like they’ve got better work-life balance.”]]></summary>

Reuters: Russia's military suffering manpower shortages -U.S. intelligence 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Russian military is suffering manpower shortages as it battles Ukraine and is seeking to recruit contract service members and may even draw in convicted criminals, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, citing U.S. intelligence. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Thursday to increase the size of Russia's armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month. 
Moscow has not revealed any losses in the conflict since its first weeks, but Western officials and the Kyiv government say they number in the thousands. 
"The Russian military is suffering from severe manpower shortages in Ukraine," the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the downgraded intelligence.

Update #1: Pentagon: Russian military ‘unlikely to succeed’ at recruitment target (The Hill)  
Update #2: U.S. Defense Official: Russia Struggling To Recruit New Soldiers, Turning To Prisons, Older Recruits (RFE)   
WNU Editor: Russia suffering manpower and ammo shortages has been the Western narrative since March. But what we have seen on the ground since March has been the opposite. The fall of Mariupol and the capture of thousands of Ukraine's best fighters in May. The complete capture of Luhansk province in June, and steady progress in Donetz province. And now Russian and separatist military forces are blocking a major Ukraine counter-offensive in the southwest part of the country. If the Russian military was suffering the losses that U.S. intelligence was saying, the Russian offensive would have ended a long time ago and their defense lines would be in a state of collapse..]]></summary>

Reuters: U.S. will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, Biden tells Israel's Lapid 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Wednesday the United States will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, the White House said, as Tehran seeks stronger guarantees from Washington for the revival of a nuclear deal with world powers. 
Israel opposes a return to the 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear weapons program in exchange for the lifting of U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions on Tehran. 
To Israel's delight, former president Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions, prompting Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits. Biden has vowed to revive the agreement while ensuring the security of Israel, Iran's regional arch foe.

Europe’s largest nuclear power plant has been repeatedly threatened with a barrage of shelling that officials warn could result in a massive nuclear disaster if the plant is damaged. 
IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said before departing south from Kyiv that his team had finally been granted access to the plant after "six months of strenuous efforts."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Russia halts gas flows to Europe via Nord Stream 1 for maintenance works 
* It is expected that gas flows via Nord Stream 1, which runs from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, will be suspended from Aug. 31 through to Sept. 3.
* The temporary halt to supplies reflects a deepening gas dispute between Russia and the European Union and underscores both the risk of a recession and a winter shortage. 
* “Europe is in full bunkering mode and taking no chances with Russian supplies heading into the winter,” said Wei Xiong, senior analyst at energy consultancy Rystad Energy. 
Russia’s state-owned energy giant Gazprom on Wednesday halted gas flows to Europe via a major pipeline, citing maintenance works on its only remaining compressor. 
It is expected that gas flows via Nord Stream 1, which runs from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, will be suspended from Aug. 31 through to Sept. 3.

Reuters: Taiwan vows counter-attack if Chinese forces enter its territory 
TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan said on Wednesday it would exercise its right to self-defence and counter-attack if Chinese armed forces entered its territory, as Beijing increased military activities near the democratically governed island. 
Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own against the strong objections of the Taipei government, has held military exercises around the island this month in reaction to a visit to Taipei by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
Taiwanese defence officials said China's "high intensity" military patrols near Taiwan continued and Beijing's intention to make the Taiwan Strait separating the two sides its "inner sea" would become the main source of instability in the region.

The swarm incident involving USS Zumwalt was just one of many similar events involving Navy ships off California in 2019.  
The U.S. Navy has released a new video from an incident that involved six unidentified drones flying over its most advanced surface combatant, the USS Zumwalt. The incident occurred in the waters off the coast of Southern California in April 2019. 
The War Zone received the video via the Freedom of Information act as part of our ongoing investigation into reports of drone swarm incidents that occurred near Navy vessels intermittently throughout 2019 off Southern California. Our previous update in the investigation produced a number of briefing documents, including an unclassified video and photographs that provided a significant increase in detail about these strange incidents. While the bulk of the drone swarm events occurred in July of 2019, we learned of several new events that occurred earlier in the year. Among these was the incident involving the USS Zumwalt.

Daily Sabah: ‘Greek missiles locking on Turkish fighters over Med challenges NATO’  
Greece has challenged NATO and its allies, not Türkiye, by locking its air defense systems on Turkish jets carrying out a NATO reconnaissance mission, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said late Tuesday. 
Erdoğan lashed out against Greece over the harassment of Turkish jets carrying out reconnaissance missions over the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, calling it a "hostile act." 
"Greece has challenged NATO and its allies by increasing its hostile attitude, which started with harassing our airspace and aircraft and escalated to the level of S-300 radar lockdown," the president said, ahead of a celebration concert for the centenary of Türkiye's Victory Day at the presidential complex in the capital Ankara.

(CNN)The Army grounded its entire fleet of Chinook helicopters after a "small number" of engines fires were discovered, according to an Army spokeswoman. 
The Army identified the cause of the engine fires as a fuel leak among an "isolated number" of Boeing H-47 Chinook helicopters, Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said, adding that the service is taking steps to fix the issue. 
No injuries or deaths occurred as a result of the fuel leaks or engine fires, Smith said.  Even so, the Army temporarily grounded the fleet of approximately 400 Chinooks "out of an abundance of caution," Smith said. 
The Army's workhorse helicopter, which has been in service since the 1960s, will be grounded until the corrective steps are complete.

Politico: Biden administration to ask Congress to approve $1.1B arms sale to Taiwan  
Fears have grown in recent years that China is positioning itself to take Taiwan by military force. 
The Biden administration plans to formally ask Congress to approve an estimated $1.1 billion arms sale to Taiwan that includes 60 anti-ship missiles and 100 air-to-air missiles, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the package. 
The news comes as China continues to send warships and aircraft into the Taiwan Strait on a daily basis, just weeks after Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governing island and condemned Beijing’s attempts to isolate and intimidate Taiwan. In response to Pelosi’s visit, Beijing launched massive, unprecedented military drills around Taiwan that involved shooting missiles over the island for the first time.

Zero Hedge: China Is Aggressively Reselling Russian Gas To Europe 
One month ago, we were surprised to read how, despite a suppressed appetite for energy amid its housing crash and economic downturn (for which "zero covid" has emerged as a convenient scapegoat for emperor Xi), China has been soaking up more Russian natural gas so far this year, while imports from most other sources declined. 
 In July, the SCMP reported that according to Chinese customs data, in the first six months of the year, China bought a total of 2.35 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) – valued at US$2.16 billion. The import volume increased by 28.7% year on year, with the value surging by 182%. It meant Russia has surpassed Indonesia and the United States to become China’s fourth-largest supplier of LNG so far this year!

According to the business publication Bloomberg, Russia can easily afford to completely stop its gas supplies to the European Union. According to analysts, the rise in global energy prices is entirely in Moscow’s favour. 
Russia could completely halt natural gas exports to the EU for more than a year without causing significant damage to its own economy, Bloomberg reported, citing analysts at Capital Economics. 
Russia’s balance of payments is in such a strong position given the current price situation that if oil prices and oil exports stay the same, Russia could cut gas exports to Europe to 20 percent of normal levels for at least three years, the company said in a report available to Bloomberg.

Mr Gorbachev died at the age of 91 after a long illness, according to Russian media outlets. 

“There are a lot of people who obviously also like Mikhail Gorbachev or liked Mikhail Gorbachev a lot, but there are also people who are very critical of him,” Mr Pleitgen told Sky News Australia.

“Because they felt that, you know after Mikhail Gorbachev - after the Soviet Union fell apart - that the country lost some of its prestige, lost its place in the world where … before that it was on par with the US as a world superpower, a nuclear superpower. 

“And they felt almost a sense of humiliation.”]]></summary>

Mr Gorbachev died at the age of 91 after a long illness, according to Russian media outlets. 

“The curtain has come down on one of the world’s most significant leaders,” Mr Chalmers said during a media conference on Wednesday.  

“When the world saw conflict and stalemate, he saw peace and possibility. 

“He was the epitome of courage and vision, and he was a reminder that it takes more courage to end a war than to start one. 

“The world mourns his passing.”]]></summary>

The Albanese government has not indicated whether the naval ban also applies to Australian ships. 

However, the Deputy Prime Minister says the government doesn't take the relationship for granted. 

“Ultimately, those sorts of decisions are clearly decisions for the Solomon Islands government, and we understand and respect that,” Mr Marles said. 

“We really do feel confident that we will be able to build our relationship with Solomon Islands to a point where we are the natural partner of choice.”]]></summary>

 BBC: Climate change: Russia burns off gas as Europe's energy bills rocket 
As Europe's energy costs skyrocket, Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas, according to analysis shared with BBC News. 
They say the plant, near the border with Finland, is burning an estimated $10m (£8.4m) worth of gas every day. 
Experts say the gas would previously have been exported to Germany. 
Germany's ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Russia was burning the gas because "they couldn't sell it elsewhere". 
Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice.

Reuters: Russia can't stop war, even if Ukraine drops NATO hopes -Putin ally 
(Reuters) - A top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow would not stop its military campaign in Ukraine even if Kyiv formally renounced its aspirations to join NATO. 
Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, also said in a French television interview that Russia was prepared to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy subject to certain conditions. 
Even before the February invasion, Moscow made clear Ukrainian membership of NATO was unacceptable to it. 
"Renouncing its participation in the North Atlantic alliance is now vital, but it is already insufficient in order to establish peace," Medvedev told LCI television in quotes reported by Russian news agencies.

But he is right that the "goalposts" to end the war have moved since March. The goal of the Kremlin right now is for regime change in Kyiv, and to assert control over the Russian-Ukrainian dominated parts of Ukraine.

Less than 50 years ago John Boyle was the County Sheriff of Hampshire.  Sheriff Boyle lived at Union Street Jail in Northampton and ran the jail.  His deputies signed court summonses and found people on the streets to fill the jury pools.
The sheriff also performed ceremonial duties – carrying the mace at Smith College’s debut and leading parades, wearing his top hat, tailcoat and gold waistcoat.  He was the face of the county of Hampshire.
Since then, our county government has been abolished and the state government has taken control of the courts and correctional services.  The sheriff became just another, albeit important, state employee.  Managing the old county jail and reformatory, overseeing prisoner rehabilitation, serving court proceedings, executing evictions – these are all important jobs.
The sheriff is the only official elected by the citizens of the county of Hampshire, and only by the citizens of the county of Hampshire.  It is more important than ever that the Sheriff continues to represent the county of Hampshire at its public events. 
As far as I know, none of the current sheriff candidates have even mentioned this issue.

Pentagon — The U.S. Navy said its forces overnight prevented a support ship from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from capturing a U.S. unmanned surface vessel operating in the Arabian Gulf. 
The U.S. military released video Tuesday showing the IRGC support ship Shahid Baziar "unlawfully towing a Saildrone Explorer unmanned surface vessel in international waters" "in an attempt to detain it." 
U.S. Navy patrol coastal ship USS Thunderbolt immediately responded, along with a MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter based in Bahrain. 
Shahid Baziar disconnected its towing line to the drone and departed the area approximately four hours later, the Navy said.

June lows look increasingly attractive
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView captured the latest dive below the 2017 bull market peak for BTC/USD, with US stocks falling at the same time.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indices lost 1.1% and 1.25% respectively in the first hour, while BTC/USD lost 2.5% in a single hourly candle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Iran Is Ready To Release Millions Of Barrels Of Oil Into The Market 
Iran has considerable volumes of oil in floating storage that it could quickly release should a deal with the United States be finalized. 
In an update earlier this month, OilX claimed that Iran has some 40 million barrels, the bulk of which is probably condensate. 
Vortexa estimates Iranian crude in floating storage at 60 to 70 million barrels while Kpler has estimated them at 93 million barrels, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.   
Read more ....   
Update #1: Iran ready to send 93m barrels of oil into market post sanctions: report -- Tehran Times 
Update #2: Iran May Drain Offshore Oil Cache If Nuclear Deal Reached -- Bloomberg   
WNU Editor: A massive release of this oil onto world markets will result in a major decrease in oil prices for the short term. 
So why the offer now?
 I see this as an attempt by Iran to push the Biden administration to agree to Tehran's terms to reach a deal, and in return Iran will release this oil just weeks ahead of the US midterm elections.]]></summary>

Military ends nationwide curfew after influential cleric entreats supporters to retreat from Baghdad's Green Zone and apologises for violence 
Supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, carrying guns and driving tuk-tuk vehicles, have begun withdrawing from Baghdad's Green Zone after the influential Shia cleric called on Tuesday for them to end their actions. 
Following the move, the Iraqi military's Joint Operations Command said it had been decided to lift the nationwide curfew in the capital Baghdad and other provinces, following two days of violence. 
During a news conference in Najaf, Sadr ordered his followers to end their protests, sparked by his withdrawal from politics on Monday, and apologised to Iraqis after 28 people were killed in clashes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 and one of the goals of Artemis is to put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface.


		The name Artemis was chosen to echo that of the Apollo program.


		Here is an overview of the Artemis program:

Artemis 1: test flight


		Blastoff is scheduled for 8:33 am (1233 GMT) on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.


		Orion will orbit the Moon before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis 2: first crew


		The four members of the crew will be named before the end of the year. A Canadian is expected to be among them.

Artemis 3: Moon landing


		NASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.


		Artemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.


SpaceX Moon lander


		SpaceX's Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.

Gateway space station


		The launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.


		Astronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.

Destination Mars

		The ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the "next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars."


		The goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.


		While a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States plans to name an ambassador at large for the Arctic, reflecting the region's growing strategic and commercial importance as its shrinking opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the region, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, a day after visiting the Arctic, saying Russian capabilities there pose a strategic challenge to the 30-nation alliance.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a "special military operation," has heightened Western concerns about Russian ambitions around the world.
China, which describes itself as a "near-Arctic" state, also has ambitions in the region and has said it intended to build a "Polar Silk Road." China has its eye on mineral resources and new shipping routes as ice caps recede with rising temperatures.
In a statement on Friday, the U.S. State Department said President Joe Biden planned elevate the area's importance within the U.S. government by nominating an ambassador-at-large for the Arctic region, subject to the Senate's advise and consent.
It did not say who would be nominated.
"An Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative is of critical strategic importance to the United States," the Department said.
"As one of eight Arctic nations, the United States has long been committed to protecting our national security and economic interests in the region, combating climate change, fostering sustainable development and investment, and promoting cooperation with Arctic States, Allies, and partners," it said.
The eight Arctic nations are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.

Francis has raised the possibility of retiring due to his declining health, a path taken by his predecessor Benedict XVI. If he were to do so, a conclave involving all cardinals aged under 80 would be called to pick a successor.
Sixteen of the 20 cardinals created Saturday would be eligible for that conclave based on their ages.
The ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica is the 85-year-old pope's eighth since being elected in 2013 and includes clergy known for their pastoral work and, in some cases, progressive views.
All parts of the globe are represented, including new cardinals from Brazil and Nigeria, Singapore and East Timor, am…]]></summary>

Investment in nuclear power declined after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, as fears over its safety increased and governments ran scared.
But following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, the subsequent squeeze on energy supplies and Europe's push to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, the tide is now turning back in favour of nuclear.
Governments face difficult decisions with rising gas and electricity bills and scarce resources threatening to cause widespread suffering this winter.

But the 36-year-old's reputation as a firm crisis leader -- deftly navigating her small nation through the Covid pandemic and a historic NATO membership application -- has been challenged in the last few days.
Marin has become entangled in controversies over her partying, earning her the nickname "Party Sanna" in Finland's tabloid press.
A poll published by leading newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Friday showed that 42 percent of Finns had a worse opinion of their prime minister due to the scandals.
A video leaked last week -- which made headlines around the world -- showed Marin dancing and…]]></summary>

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Russia's capabilities in the North are a strategic challenge for NATO, its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, welcoming Canada's recently announced investments in North American defense systems after making his first visit to the Canadian arctic.
"The importance of the high North is increasing for NATO and for Canada because we see a significant Russian military buildup," Stoltenberg said, standing alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Cold Lake, Alberta.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the arctic, using the region to test new weapons systems, Stoltenberg said. He also warned that Russia and China were forming a strategic arctic partnership that challenged NATO's values and inter…]]></summary>

LIMA (Reuters) - LGBT activists in Peru held a protest on Friday questioning how their government handled the death of a Peruvian transgender man in Indonesia earlier this month who was detained at the airport upon arriving to celebrate his honeymoon.
Rodrigo Ventosilla, a Peruvian graduate student at Harvard University and transgender rights activist, died on the tourist island of Bali of "bodily failure" days after being detained for alleged cannabis possession.
Peru's foreign ministry issued a statement this week calling Ventosilla's alleged drug possession a serious crime in Indonesia and that transphobia had not been a factor in his arrest, but did not acknowledge he had later died while in custody.
"We reject and condemn the foreign ministry's statement," said LGBT activist Luz Manriquez at a small protest in Lima.
Manriquez said the government's statement was biased because it adopted Indonesia's position and did not demand an investigation.
"It lacks empathy because it does not recognize that a Peruvian has died in the hands of police from another country," Manriquez added.
Brenda Alvarez, a lawyer for Ventosilla's family, told reporters on Friday the foreign ministry had agreed to apologize over the statement and launch an investigation.
Peru's foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
Alvarez added there is no date for when Ventosilla's body will arrive in Lima.
The Indonesian police told Reuters this week the case is closed and that no violence was involved in Ventosilla's death.
"Even if you are detained in another country, it is unreal and painful that (the Peruvian government) can leave you like this," said Arturo Davila, a member of Diversidades Trans Masculinas, a trans rights organization that Ventosilla founded seven years ago in Peru.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argentine authorities seized 1.6 tons of cocaine hidden in animal feed destined for Dubai and detained 12 people, police said on Friday.
The seizure, which took place overnight from Thursday to Friday in the central city of Rosario, highlights the role played by Argentine ports in trafficking South American drugs internationally.
The cocaine "is worth approximately $60 million," said Mariano Giuffra, head of the dangerous drugs department in the federal police.
The arrests took place at various sites around the country.
"They are all Argentines and some of them are known drug traffickers," added Giuffra.
Several firearms, sports cars and a large amount of cash were also seized.
Rosario, located 310 kilometers (190 miles) from Buenos Aires, is Argentina's third-largest city and the main port for agricultural exports to the Atlantic.
It is also the most violent city in Argentina, with a murder rate three times the national average.
The cocaine had been hidden in bags of corn fodder that was about to be loaded onto a container destined for Dubai.
Police said the cocaine probably originated in Colombia, the world's largest producer of the drug.
While most cocaine is produced by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia -- where growing coca leaf, which is the main ingredient in the white powder, is legal -- experts say Argentina has increasingly taken on an important role in trafficking the drug.
Argentina has several major ports, has a large supply of quality chemicals needed to turn coca leaf into cocaine, and provides ample opportunities for money laundering.

The plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- was severed from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its history on Thursday due to "actions of the invaders", Energoatom said.
In an update, the operator said that as of 2:04 pm (1104 GMT) the plant "is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine" once again.
French President Emmanuel Macron warned "civil nuclear power must be fully protected".

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Actors in a heavily bombarded city in southern Ukraine have returned to the stage, putting on their first performance since Russia's invasion in an underground shelter converted into a tiny theatre.
A few dozen theatre-goers descended steep concrete steps into the subterranean venue on Thursday for the opening night of a show put on by the Mykolaiv Art Drama Theatre. Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.
"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller," said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.
Theatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as "art-therapy", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.
Ievhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.
"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun'," he said. "There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good."

As a Resistance fighter in Lyon, rescuing Jews was at the core of René Nodot’s mission. But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.
“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Family members of 10 miners who have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for three weeks said on Thursday they rejected a government plan to find the miners that they said officials described as lasting from six to 11 months.
Three miners had been rescued and hospitalized, the Security and Citizen Protection Ministry said in an update on the rescue efforts at the mine in the Sabinas municipality of the northern state of Coahuila.
Television footage showed family members outside the mine clamoring for information on the missing men.
"I hope we find them safe," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier on Twitter. Lopez Obrador had said nine miners were likely to be trapped, but authorities revised the number later.
Some 92 soldiers were working at the scene, as well as specialists and rescue dogs, the president said.
The Labor Ministry said it had not received any complaints about safety at the mine, which began operations in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia on Friday tapped a former high court judge to investigate ex-prime minister Scott Morrison's decision to secretly appoint himself to several key ministerial portfolios.
Incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the creation of the inquiry, saying the country's system of "parliamentary democracy" had been tested.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, conservative leader Morrison appointed himself to the ministries of health, treasury, finance, resources and home affairs without telling colleagues or the public.
Albanese said the inquiry was essential "to ensure that this can never happen again".
The probe will be led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and will report by November 25.
"We need to have a quick and appropriate inquiry," said Albanese, adding this is "not about the politics, but how this happened, why this happened and who knew about it."

He did not rule out Morrison or other former government ministers from being compelled to give evidence if necessary.
Morrison has insisted he was right to take "emergency powers" during the tumult of the pandemic.
"I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest," he said in a defiant first public appearance after the scandal broke, dismissing critics who were "standing on the shore after the fact".
Three of Morrison's fellow conservative prime ministers have also criticized the former premier's behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an opening night like no other at Mykolaiv's theatre, with the audience ushered down into an underground shelter this week for the first performance since war broke out.
"We need this place to fight on the cultural front too," says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.
The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides "a form of 'art therapy'" for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.
Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.

But this year's crop is devastated, another casualty of a blistering heatwave that has engulfed southern China in the country's hottest summer on record and subsumed half its land in drought.
"This is absolutely the first time in my life encountering such a disaster," he tells AFP.
"This year is a very miserable one.
"We should be harvesting fruits right now, but it's all gone, dead from the scorching sun."
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, forcing power cuts that have hit agricultural workers hard.

After 15 years, including four prior formal sessions, negotiators have yet to reach a legally binding agreement to address the growing environmental and economic challenges involving the high seas, also known as international waters -- a zone which encompasses almost half the planet.
Many had hoped that this fifth session, which began on August 15 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, would be the last and yield a final text on "the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction," or BBNJ for short.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a radiation disaster as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine's Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut.
Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia's military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe's largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and keep the plant safe.

Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said fires in the ash pits of a coal power station near the Zaporizhzhia reactor complex interfered with the power supply to the station's two last working reactors, disconnecting them from the network. That meant that all six of the plant's reactors are not supplying ene...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes slammed Republicans for a history of giving favorable treatment to CEOs and other wealthy people.
During an appearance on Real America's Voice, Cortes said that Democrats were "smart" to forgive student loans for many borrowers.
"Privileged people, many of whom chose to go and pursue worthless degrees are getting a handout from Joe Biden," he told podcast host Steve Bannon. "In terms of political payoffs, and that's what this is, a crass political payoff, at least the Democrats are smart enough to payoff American voters."
"Establishment Republicans, they pay off CEOs and defense contractors," Cortes continued. "This about that contrast. If you're going to do power politics and you're going to do crass payoffs, at least the Democrats know where their bread is buttered and they're going to pay off voters."
The ex-Trump adviser added: "What Mitch McConnell does and establishment Republicans do is they reward the CEOs of places like Northrop Grumman and therein lies one of the key reasons why in America, as you often talk about, the Republicans have won election after election for decades while we are losing our country."
As president, former President Donald Trump signed a tax cut law that reportedly helps billionaires pay less in taxes than the working class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.
Roizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.
The court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.
Roizman denies all the charges.
On Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words "war" and "invasion" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
State news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.
Roizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.
Russia's defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.
"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine," Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.
"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families."
Brown said the human toll of the attack was "just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine."
She cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.
"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain," she said.
