Seoul — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a nationwide lockdown Thursday to try to contain a highly transmissible variant of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which was confirmed in the country this week for the first time.

While calling the situation a “most critical emergency,” the report did not say how many infections had been confirmed nor how many people had been tested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: Gulf State OPEC Members Sound Alarm About Dwindling Global Energy Capacity 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates warned earlier this week that their spare energy capacity is decreasing in all energy sectors as key producers reduce investment in fossil fuels, pushing oil,  diesel, and natural gas to trade at near-record highs. 
Brent oil was trading at around $102 a barrel as they spoke.      
"I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,” said Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to Bloomberg on May 10, at an OPEC conference in Abu Dhabi. 
The prince was referring to the surge in prices for refined oil products, in particular in the United States, where gas and diesel prices are hitting a record high, causing problems for the Biden administration.       
"The world needs to wake up to an existing reality. The world is running out of energy capacity at all levels,” said the Saudi minister.

While wealthy, previously non-aligned nations could potentially join NATO in less than a year, Ukraine’s prospects of joining the alliance anytime soon — if ever — are highly unlikely.  On the one hand: NATO, an alliance based on the doctrine of mutual defense, would be highly unlikely to admit a country trapped in war.

        <updated>2022-05-12T23:15:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, TechCrunch reported that Congress is asking major social media platforms to archive content showing evidence of Russian war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.
Four representatives sent letters making the request to Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.
"As TikTok booms in popularity and surpasses 1 billion users, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too," reported Amanda Silberling. "These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable."

"In particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes," said the report.
The Russian army has been accused of repeated war crimes as part of the Ukraine invasion, from the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol to the butchering of unarmed civilians in Bucha.
Russia has denied all accusations, claiming that they are only going after military targets and sticking to their discredited story they are trying to "denazify" the country.]]></summary>

Finland joining NATO would pose a threat to Russia and will not help make the world any more secure, warns Moscow 
Moscow has warned that Finland joining NATO would pose a direct threat to Russia’s security and its acceptance to the military alliance would prompt Russia to develop measures to ensure its safety. 
That’s after Finnish officials confirmed on Thursday their commitment to join the US-led bloc and announced plans to pen a formal application later this week.   
"There is a current instruction from the president to develop a list of measures to strengthen our western flanks in connection with the strengthening of NATO’s eastern flanks,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov during a daily press briefing on Thursday, adding that the expansion of NATO towards Russia’s borders will not make the world or the Eurasian continent any more secure.

   CNBC: Finland’s leaders say country should apply for NATO membership ‘without delay’ 
* Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Thursday that the country should apply to join NATO “without delay.” 
* Membership would be historic for the Nordic country, which has had a decadeslong policy of military neutrality. 
Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Thursday that the country should apply to join NATO “without delay.” 
The announcement is the strongest sign yet that Finland will make a formal application to join NATO. 
Membership would be historic for the Nordic country, which has had a decadeslong policy of military neutrality.  “Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.” the leaders said in a joint statement, adding that they hoped that “the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.”

Daily Mail: Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev says the West is risking ‘fully fledged nuclear war’ between Moscow and NATO by ‘pumping weapons into Ukraine’ 
* Putin lackey Dmitry Medvedev: NATO help may spark 'full-fledged nuclear war' 
* Security Council vice-chair said 'direct and open conflict' with West remains risk 
* NATO must stop 'pumping weapons into Ukraine', he wrote in fiery Telegram 
* He also accused Western nations of 'sending in mercenaries' to fight for Ukraine 
* Ex-President and PM slammed European leaders 'squeaking their little voices' 
* 'The thesis that Russia frightens the world with nuclear conflict is being pushed' 
* Medvedev's statement follows news neutral neighbour Finland will join NATO 
* And Japan's PM said war 'shakes the core of international order, including Asia' 
NATO military support for Ukraine risks sparking nuclear war with Russia, Putin ally and ex-president Dmitry Medvedev warned. 
In a fiery post to nearly one million Telegram users this morning, Medvedev wrote:  'NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia. 
'Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war.'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lack of military funding in Russia is now apparently impacting soldiers who are being forced to buy their own body armor. There have been allegations of corruption by foes of President Vladimir Putin that cash was siphoned off, leaving the military unable to buy necessary equipment. 
The Daily Beast reported Thursday that one soldier's mother was on a tapped call that was shared by Ukraine's Security Service (SB). "How much do you need?" the mom asked. "And what kind of equipment?"
She later asked, "And you have to buy that with your own money?" 
The frustration isn't unheard of, when it was discovered that Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan were buying their own body armor in 2004. A March 7, 2005, story in the New York Times by reporter Michael Moss revealed that shortly after the Ira…]]></summary>

OilPrice.com: The EU Has A Major Problem With Securing Non-Russian Gas 
* The EU is determined to wean itself off Russian gas, and its current replacement plan involves building new LNG terminals and importing gas from elsewhere. 
* This replacement plan has one major flaw, the LNG market is currently a seller's market and importers will have to commit to long-term contracts. 
* Germany’s struggle to negotiate deliveries of LNG with Qatar is just one example of this problem, and the EU will have to alter its priorities in order to secure the gas. 
Germany has been negotiating deliveries of liquefied natural gas with Qatar as part of plans to wean itself off Russian gas, on which it is heavily dependent. 
The negotiations, reportedly, ran into a wall this week. And this wall may be what’s standing in the way of other EU gas buyers as well. 
According to unnamed sources cited by Reuters, Germany and Qatar have serious differences on issues such as the length of the contract and whether or not Germany could re-sell the gas to other European countries once it had been received.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a segment on CNN this Thursday, the panel discussed the day's news regarding the Jan. 6 committee's subpoenas of five House Republicans. According to CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger, one of the lawmakers subpoenaed, Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, "might actually be willing to testify." 
According to Borger, Brooks spoke at the infamous "Stop the Steal" rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot, only to later be passed over by former President Donald Trump for an endorsement in his reelection race. 
Borger also pointed out that Brooks has already publicly revealed that Trump asked him to help "rescind" the 2020 election. 
"If he's already said it publicly, why not say it to the committee?" Borger said.

SCMP/Bloomberg: Ukraine war: Germany accuses Russia of ‘weaponising’ energy in escalation of gas feud 
* Economy Minister Robert Habeck said ‘energy can be used powerfully in an economic conflict’ after Moscow sanctioned Gazprom Germania and reduced supplies to Berlin 
* He downplayed the impact, saying Germany, the largest buyer of Russian gas, can cope with the disruption
Russia reduced natural gas supplies to Germany in retaliation over Europe’s penalties over the war in Ukraine, prompting a government minister to accuse Moscow of using its energy exports as a “weapon.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first three months of 2022, his campaign reported no donations over $199 from people in the district and only six from the entire state of North Carolina.  Any individual donation under $200 can be made anonymously.
Luckily for Hines, the Club for Growth Action, the group’s super PAC arm, said it plans to spend $1.3 million support him in the primary.  That’s a huge sum for a house race.
Before settling in the 13th arrondissement, Hines had searched for a suitable perch.  He announced plans to challenge Rep. Virginia Foxx, a longtime Republican in the west of the state, before redistricting alters those plans.  In April, he and his wife moved to a house in Fuquay-Varinaa town in southern Wake County, the most densely populated part of the district.
Some Republicans in the dark red county of Johnston, a fast-growing rural community, criticized Hines for, in the words of the leader of a local group, “Coming in, just trying to pick a district he can win.” And Hines’ main adversary, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former State House majority leader, attacked him as a baggage handler.
The Hines campaign, which declined to make him available for an interview but answered a series of detailed questions about his candidacy, notes his upbringing in Charlotte and his time at NC State, which is in Raleigh, just north of the district line.
Daughtry has spent more than $2.5 million on the race so far, while contributing nearly $3 million of its own money.  She has also caught in heat for his past donations to Democratsincluding Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee, and Josh Stein, the state attorney general.
Several people with access to private polls said Hines appeared to be ahead of Daughtry by a few percentage points, with everyone else trailing far behind.  In North Carolina, if no candidate wins at least 30% of the vote, the first two qualify for a second round.

RFE: Moscow Puts Sanctions On European Gazprom Units In Countries That Have Imposed Sanctions On Russia 
Russia has imposed sanctions against units of Gazprom Germania and dozens of other companies based in countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. 
 Under the sanctions, the 31 companies listed on May 11 by the Russian government are banned from conducting transactions and entering Russian ports. 
But it notably includes local subsidiaries of Gazprom, which supplies more than a third of European gas.

WNU Editor: Why should Russia ship natural gas to European Gasprom companies/units that were seized last month by European governments who took these institutions without compensation? 
The shock from the Western media and governments over these reciprocal sanctions being imposed on them is a sight to see. My guess is that they never expected it, and they never made the calculation on what would be the consequences if they impose sanctions on a country like Russia. 
Bottom line. 
The sanctions that the West have imposed on the Kremlin is hurting the Russian economy, but it looks like these reciprocal sanctions are probably hurting the EU even more. 
Update: The impact has been immediate .... Europe gas spikes 22% as Germany quarrels with Russia over supply (Al Jazeera).

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government cited "the need to protect national security" for withholding the advice it received about granting a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev.
Opposition parties have demanded more transparency over the role Johnson played in appointing his friend Lebedev -- whose father was a KGB officer -- to the House of Lords.
MPs earlier this year approved a motion seeking to force ministers to release sensitive documents related to the nomination to the upper house of parliament.

Ukraine will only restart gas flows from Russia to Europe via the Sokhranivka point—which were stopped earlier this week—only when Kyiv regains full control over its gas pipelines, the head of the Ukrainian gas system operator told Reuters on Thursday. 
"We won't open. Until full control over the asset," Sergiy Makogon, head of the Ukrainian Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSOU), wrote to Reuters. 
On Tuesday, GTSOU said it would no longer be able to accept gas transit from Russia via the Sokhranivka entry point, through which nearly one-third of the Russian gas headed through Ukraine goes. 
The GTSOU said in a statement  that it could not operate at its Novopskov gas compressor station in the Russia-controlled Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine due to "the interference of the occupying forces in the technical processes."

 WION: Despite sanctions, Russian ruble is the world's top performing currency in 2022 
The ruble has recovered the majority of its losses, and Russia's capital controls have made it the best-performing currency in the world this year, while just a few people will benefit from the boom. 
The ruble rose against the dollar again on Wednesday, as the Moscow Exchange reopened after a two-day holiday.   It has gained more than 11% versus the US dollar since the beginning of the year, surpassing the real's 9% rise to become the biggest gainer among Bloomberg's 31 major currencies. The offshore rate has risen considerably more, by roughly 12%.

gCaptain/Blooomberg: Greek Shipowners Kill EU’s Russian Oil Tanker Ban 
(Bloomberg) The European Union is set to soften its sanctions package on Russian oil exports after a weekend of wrangling, though it aims to keep a key shipping provision that will hinder Moscow’s ability to export its crude. 
The bloc will drop a proposed ban on EU-owned vessels transporting Russian oil to third countries, according to documents seen by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. 
Critically, a prohibition on insurance is still in the works and would remain a significant impediment to exports.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: I am not surprised by this development. Europe needs Russian oil one way or another. 
A prediction. 
These oil tankers will still pick up Russian oil at Russian sea ports. Make a beeline to a European port with their cargo, and while in transit this oil will be sold and resold and resold (all at a premium) to mask where this oil is coming from and to satisfy insurance requirements. In the end this Russian oil will end up in Europe, albeit at a very high cost for the European consumers. 
The big winners will be Russian oil companies, the Kremlin, and the Greek/Maltese/etc. shipping oligarchs.

Her older sister, watching, cried out.  A few seconds later, the young man, Irvin Antonio Hernández, was gone, dragged into the prison opposite.
The two women collapsed on a nearby wooden bench next to strangers who understood better than anyone what had just happened.  Their sons had all disappeared behind those same walls.
After a record weekend of gang killings in March, the Salvadorian government declared a state of emergency and suspended constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties.  The ensuing campaign of mass arrests led to the imprisonment of more than 25,000 people in about a month and a half.

Mr Johnson was not among those affected by the latest announcement, his office said, although neither he nor police named those who were or provided further details.
London’s Metropolitan Police have now identified more than 100 cases of law breaking in government offices, including Downing Street – where Mr Johnson lives and works – underscoring the scale of the breach of the rules at the place where Britain’s tough coronavirus laws were written.
The new fines, known as fixed fines, are believed to relate in part to a pre-Christmas party in Downing Street in …]]></summary>

He was 65 years old.
His wife, Carol Ochs, confirmed the death, at a hospital, but said the cause had not been determined.
Mr. MacVittie excelled at playing badass with tormented souls, revealing a tenderness at the heart of his characterizations.  His type of casting was low-life and street-smart, but he himself ran into rarefied acting circles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HARTFORD, Conn.  — There has always been a certain fluidity in our appreciation of American modernist maverick Milton Avery (1885-1965).  And it’s not just because of the light, airy, boldly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea and sky that characterized his last decade.  Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of any particular group or movement, meaning the general awareness of his work fluctuated greatly.  It is always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the opportunity to do so has been too rare.
Now one of those rare moments has arrived, with much of Avery’s work featured in exhibitions in New York and Hartford, Connecticut. Wadsworth Atheneum Art Museum in Hartford presents “Milton Avery”, a sumptuous study of almost 70 paintings (org…]]></summary>

There are practical reasons for the flurry of site-specific performances at the month-long event, called Kunstenfestivaldesarts, said Daniel Blanca Gubbay, one of its directors, during a break between performances.  After two years of pandemic upheaval, many performance venues in Brussels have been booked with shows rescheduled this year.
The constraints have led to creative programming, showcasing areas of the city that even frequent visitors may not necessarily know.  To see “The Weeping Woods and the Okapi Resistance”, a family puppet …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the cleverly reimagined “Montana Story” genre, the American flag doesn’t just wave and flutter, it also sends a warning.  He looks so modest.  Clean and neat, with no frayed edges or faded colors, it flies from a tall pole planted in front of a beautiful two-story house.  There, on 200 acres in southwestern Montana, in a glorious region surrounded by mountains known as Paradise Valley, nature invites and soothes.  It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.
Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel don’t dwell on the flag.  Instead, they gently immerse you in a classic Western setting while simultaneously drawing you into a simmering family melodrama about two grappling adult children and their terminally ill father.

Russia has scaled down its objectives in Ukraine. It’s still struggling to achieve them.
 Over three weeks ago, Russia launched a new phase of its war in Ukraine: an effort aimed at seizing control of the Donbas region in the country’s east. This new objective was a significant climbdown from its initial goal of regime change in Kyiv, and one that seemed more achievable. Many observers thought the offensive might yield enough concrete gains for Putin to say “mission accomplished” on May 9, a Russian holiday called Victory Day commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Yet when the day itself came, Putin did not say much of anything along those lines. Perhaps this was because he had litt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As demonstrated in movies as diverse as “Monterey Pop,” “Woodstock” and “Summer of Soul,” music festivals can’t help but derive some of their vibe from their sets.  As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,” directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the city’s annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.
The film’s opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is – thankfully – a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.


Exploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you “like a freight train.”


Entrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianist’s work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.
The seething history – which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festival’s appeal – turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.
Jazz Fest: A History of New Orleans
Rated PG-13 for sassy little language.  Duration: 1h34.  In theaters.

Without doubt, one catastrophe after another still awaits. Much of Ukraine’s harvest, of paramount importance to global food supply, is at risk of being lost due to Vladimir Putin’s and the Russian army’s belligerent actions. Last year, Ukraine harvested a record of 106 million tonnes of grain – 25, or even 50 percent of this amount is currently feared to be lost during this year while most experts add that “this is an optimistic forecast.”</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2022/05/12/30827">Read the full story, “War and Famines  Warnings of Potential Outcomes of the War in Ukraine”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

USNI News: Great Wall of Naval Targets Discovered in Chinese Desert 
China has been honing its ship-killing skills for potential future conflicts on new targets in a remote desert, according to new satellite photos reviewed by USNI News. New analysis shows the People’s Liberation Army is testing the ability to hit ships in port with long-range ballistic missiles. 
Since USNI News reported China has been building aircraft carrier targets in the Takmalakan Desert, other target sites have emerged forming a string of large-scale target ranges running along the eastern edge of the desert, according to new satellite photos. Several of these are naval and two have layouts that appear to be modeled on ships in port.

Ignatova famously vanished in 2017 and has not been seen since.
"Five years after going on the run, police have appealed for the arrest of Dr Ruja Ignatova, founder of OneCoin, a cryptocurrency that sold itself as an alternative to Bitcoin but was instead a pyramid-style scam which relieved people from 175 countries of at least £4 billion," reported Max Daly. "The scam, one of the biggest frauds in history, which could have reaped as much as £12.7 billion from investors, was the subject of the BBC’s 'The Missing Cryptoqueen' podcast."

Washington Times: Rumors swirl that China’s Xi Jinping will step down amid harsh COVID lockdowns  
Experts doubt reports of coup, but also see signs of discontent 
Rumors circulating in China and among overseas Chinese social media are claiming Chinese President Xi Jinping, under fire for draconian COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere, will step down from power. 
The rumors followed a meeting last week of the Party Politburo Standing Committee, the collective leadership group that rules China. They were traced in part to a Chinese-language YouTube video May 4 by Canadian-based blogger appearing under the persona “Lao Deng.” Details of the video quickly spread to social media outlets in China but were quickly censored.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia is paying a heavy price for its invasion of Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson warned on CNN Thursday that the conflict is far from over.
While discussing Russia's stalled efforts to take over the eastern part of Ukraine, Anderson also touched on Finland's decision to apply for NATO membership, which he said showed that the military alliance of Western powers is growing stronger in the face of Russian aggression.
"I would submit to you, we're heading back to a Cold War, I think," he said. "I think there will be a stalemate in the Ukraine. Get ready for Cold War II."
Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, did not join NATO during the first Cold War, although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dramatically changed the calculus in Helsinki, as Finland's president and prime minister both came out in favor of joining on Thursday.
RELATED: More 'blowback' for Putin as Finland applies for NATO membership
Addressing the conflict in Ukraine, Anderson said that it appeared Russia's strategic options in eastern Ukraine appear limited even though they have a significantly larger military than the Ukrainians do.
"They're using artillery to blow the hell out of everything in their way, that's their only play," he said of the Russian military. "But they're really failing... their strategy is flawed in that they're devoting too many resources to smaller salients and they're not concentrated in one area. And we already have seen significant counterattacks up here by the Ukrainians."

The metaverse refers to virtual worlds in which internet users can interact through avatars to play, shop and work. The enforcement actions accuse Flamingo Casino Club of scamming people through fraudulently selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that purport to convey ownership of a virtual casino and give investors a right to share in the profits of the casino when other users play virtual games such as craps, blackjack or roulette. NFTs are digital items in which their ownership is permanently stored on the blockch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activists from the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) unfurled two large banners on the Acropolis in Athens on Thursday in protest at Greece's indirect participation in the war in Ukraine through its membership of NATO.
The banners in both Greek and English read: "No to War - No Involvement - No to the Bases of Death" in large letters visible from a considerable distance.
The protest came ahead of a vote in parliament on Thursday evening on extending for a further five years an agreement on military cooperation with the United States. At the end of the period, the agreement is set to become permanent, if neither party withdraws.
Ratification is seen as a formality, as Greece's conservative government has the necessary majority. The government sees the agreement as enhancing stability and Greece's role in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The US already has a large naval and air base at Souda on Crete, from where its planes can cover the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The US also operates two military bases in central Greece and a naval base in the port of Alexandroupolis in the north-east of the country.
The KKE, which holds 15 seats in the 300-seat parliament, has for decades demanded that Greece should withdraw from both NATO and the European Union.]]></summary>

Retired cardinal Joseph Zen, one of the most senior Catholic clerics in Asia, was among a group of veteran democracy advocates arrested Wednesday on a charge of "colluding with foreign forces".
Cantonese pop singer Denise Ho, veteran barrister Margaret Ng and prominent cultural studies scholar Hui Po-keung were also arrested, the latter at the airport as he attempted to travel to Europe to take up an academic post.
The four were detained for their involvement in a now-disbanded defense fund that helped pay legal and medical costs for those arrested in the huge and sometimes violent democracy …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rock, the biggest white diamond ever auctioned, sold for 21.7 million Swiss francs ($21.9 million) on Wednesday, far short of the record for such a jewel.
The 228.31-carat stone, larger than a golf ball, was sold in Geneva by Christie's auction house.
There had been high hopes that The Rock would smash the world record for a white diamond, which stands at $33.7 million, a sum fetched in Geneva in 2017 for a 163.41-carat gem.
But the bidding, which started at 14 million Swiss francs, ground to a halt after two minutes at 18.6 million, with the price rising to 21.7 million once the buyer's premium was added on.
The pre-sale estimate had been 19-30 million Swiss francs.
The Rock, a perfectly symmetrical pear-shaped diamond, was sold by an unnamed owner from North America. It was bought by…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With their infectious musical fusion of roots and rhythm, Ukrainian folk hiphop band Kalush Orchestra is riding a wave of goodwill at the Eurovision Song Contest this year -- while eyeing the contest's top prize.
Tapping traditional Ukrainian folk music but mashing up an invigorating hiphop beat with a haunting, lullaby refrain, "Stefania" was written last year by the band's frontman, 27-year-old rapper Oleh Psiuk, as a tribute to his mother.
But the song selected to represent Ukraine at Eurovision -- just days before Russia's invasion -- has taken on outsized meaning for a country nearing its third month of war. It contains nostalgic lyrics such as "I'll always find my way home even if all the roads are destroyed" and celebrates cultural identity and the motherland.

International tourist arrivals worldwide have more than doubled, up 130 percent in January 2022 on the same period last year, according to the latest UN World Tourism Organization figures.
Travelers are regaining confidence, and Europe and the Americas are leading the resurgence.
Worldwide, there have been 18 million additional visitors, the UNWTO said, "equivalent to the total increase recorded over the whole of 2021".
In 2019, global tourism revenues reached $1.48 trillion. That figure dropped by almost two thirds due to the pandemic the following year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a new online rumour about who could be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s successor.

The 69-year-old Russian president was seen deep in conversation during the country's Victory Parade for an extended period of time with Dmitry Kovalev, a 36-year-old member of the Presidential Administration.

While there is little factual evidence to back up the online rumours, it does indicate attention has turned to who will take over at the Kremlin once Putin is gone.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing Australia needs is for both government and opposition to be "closing down options" with China rather than keeping them open, says University of Melbourne’s Professor Michael Wesley.

"Both sides are now sort of burnishing their national security credentials, burnishing their toughness – and what that does is remove creative possibilities for taking the relationship forward pragmatically," Prof Wesley told Sky News Australia.

He said he was not optimistic about the trajectory of Australia's relationship with China.

"We've needlessly blown out of proportion the significance of the China-Solomon Islands agreement – it's very hard to walk back from that now.

"I do worry that if not locked into this level of antagonism, there will certainly be a sort of a cold relationship between Australia and its major trading partner for awhile yet."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In yet another major blow for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Finland's president and prime minister have now said that their country intends to apply for NATO membership.
In a joint statement released Thursday, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö and Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said that they believe NATO membership is essential to ensuring their nation's security in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance," they wrote. "Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days."
Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, has traditionally stayed away from NATO membership in the interest of maintaining a diplomatic balance between Russia and other Western European nations.

Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon comments that the decision by Finland to apply for NATO membership now can only be seen as "yet more blowback from Moscow’s war in Ukraine," which has also resulted in an unprecedented number of crippling sanctions that internal Kremlin forecasts show could led to a 12 percent contraction of gross domestic product this year alone.
Now that Finland is applying for NATO membership, the next question will be whether Sweden, which has also traditionally tried to remain militarily neutral between Russia and Western Europe, will follow suit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Central bankers are hoping their policies will temper economic growth without driving up unemployment or plunging America into a recession – creating what they often call a “soft landing”.
“I really want this to be the outcome, but I recognize that it won’t be easy to do,” Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview Monday.
Officials have clearly recognized that let the economy down gently will be difficult, and some have hinted that they would be willing to inflict economic pain if that was what it took to fight high inflation.
If the economy gets to a point where unemployment starts to climb but inflation remains “unacceptably high”, Mr Bostic said, price hikes will be “the threat we have to address”.
A challenge for policymakers – and even more so for families – is that price increases are surfacing in basic necessities. The cost of food has increased 0.9% in April from the previous month, the 17th consecutive monthly increase, according to Wednesday’s report.
The increase was led by dairy products, soft drinks and a 10.3% monthly rise in the cost of eggs as bird flu decimated poultry flocks.  Such inflation tends to particularly affect the poor, who spend more of their budget on necessities such as groceries and gasoline.
But while Americans are seeing strong job gains and strong wage growth — although not strong enough to fully counter inflation — many are managing to weather rising costs for now, keeping aggregate demand strong.
“Consumers seem willing to accept the higher menu prices, especially as inflation runs wide,” George Holm, chief executive of food retailer and restaurant supplier Performance Food Group, said on a call on Wednesday. to the results.  “Nevertheless, it’s something to watch closely over the coming months and quarters.”
Ana Swanson contributed report.

On Wednesday, it only said it was “increasing production and deliveries.”  On the call with analysts, Scaringe said he expected pickup trucks to make up about a third of the 25,000 vehicles in the 2022 production forecast.
In many ways, Rivian epitomizes the stock market’s sharp downward turn this year.
In November, investors crowded into its initial public offering, in which the company raised $13.5 billion, and its shares then soared, briefly giving Rivian a market value almost as large as Ford’s. Motor and General Motors combined.
But the stock plunged this year after the company slashed production targets.  The 80% drop in Rivian shares is much steeper than a 31% drop in Tesla shares over the sa…]]></summary>

   Antiwar.com: Sen. Tuberville Says US Risks War With Russia by ‘Poking the Bear’ in Ukraine 
Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) warned Tuesday that the US is risking war with Russia by “poking the bear” in Ukraine.  Tuberville made the comments during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier.
Tuberville told Haines and Berrier the US is risking escalating the war by bragging about intelligence sharing with Ukraine. 
In recent weeks, US officials claimed to the media that US intelligence has helped Ukrainian forces shoot down a plane carrying Russian troops, kill Russian generals, and sink a Russian warship.

WNU Editor: I hope Director of National Intelligence Avril Hainestell understands what the mood in Russia is right now. I know among my friends, contacts, and family members in Russia .... most of them believe Russia is now involved in a war against the U.S., and all of them there is a very good chance that with time this conflict spread outside of Ukraine.]]></summary>

* Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned Tuesday that the world is "running out of energy capacity at all levels." 
* "I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things," he said at a conference. 
* A UAE official also warned that more investment is needed in the energy sector for OPEC+ to deliver sufficient supplies. 
The amount of unused capacity that the world can tap to produce more energy products is running out, warned top oil ministers. 
Referring to recent price spikes for refined products, Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a Tuesday conference, "I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things," according to Bloomberg. 
"The world needs to wake up to an existing reality. The world is running out of energy capacity at all levels," he added.

WNU Editor: In today's Western political environment the focus is on developing alternative "clean" energy sources. Conventional energy production like oil and natural gas are to be phased out. But as the Saudi oil minister states rather bluntly, there is going to be a very high cost to this policy.]]></summary>

Lufthansa's boss apologized on Wednesday for an incident in which a group of Jews was removed from a plane because of a dispute with a few individuals who failed to follow rules about wearing masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.
The apology relates to a May 4 incident. After a flight from New York to Frankfurt, during which some individuals did not comply with rules regarding masks, the airline had all members of a tour group of Orthodox Jews removed from a continuing flight to Budapest.
The airline had already issued a statement of apology on Tuesday, noting it was unfortunate that the entire group was removed when the dispute had only been with certain individuals.
"We apologize to all guests, not just because they couldn't travel further, but because their personal feelings were hurt," read the Tuesday statement.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr on Wednesday apologized to a representative of the Jewish community in Berlin, according to Lufthansa. That followed a company meeting in which Spohr told employees that such incidents cannot happen.
"Anti-Semitism has no place at Lufthansa. The incidences of last Wednesday should never have happened and have to be cleared up comprehensively."]]></summary>

During a panel discussion on CNN, host Kate Bolduan asked Anderson what he made of reports that Russia is moving more troops toward the city of Kharkiv, where the Ukrainians have had success in pushing back Russian forces who previously believed they'd had the city secured.
"It suggests that to me, Kate, they're losing and they know it," he said. "They're having to reposition their forces. They've been trying for six weeks now to cross the rivers and to get down to Kramatorsk. They've been trying to get down there but unable to do it."

"They are destroying your future. They are doing it deliberately. They have been doing that for decades."
Research shared exclusively with The Guardian ahead of its formal publication identifies at least 195 "carbon bombs" that are either in the process of being built or already in place across the globe as scientists warn that fossil fuel use must be quickly phased out to prevent catastrophic climate outcomes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Newsweek reported that billionaire investor Bill Ackman is urging U.S. companies to hire Ukrainians to engineering jobs, because Americans lack the same level of "work ethic".
"In a Tuesday tweet, the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management said he had dinner with a number of startup CEOs who had complained about the work ethic of young American engineers," reported Khaleda Rahman. "He suggested that employers should instead look to hiring people from Ukraine as Russia's invasion of the country continues."
But — Ackman was careful to note — companies shouldn't go through all the trouble of bringing Ukrainians out of their war-torn country to come to the U.S. to take those jobs, but simply have them work remotely.

To be clear, I recommend hiring Ukrainian engineers virtually, not recruiting them to the US, which takes time and will drain talent from @Ukraine. We should find Ukrainians work and dignity now so they can provide for their families and country.https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1523852028241457152\u00a0\u2026

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has devastated huge sections of the country and created a massive refugee crisis, as Russian forces commit horrifying war crimes in occupied territory.
RELATED: Leaked Kremlin forecasts show Russia facing economic collapse from sanctions: report
The Biden administration has committed to admitting in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, with 6,000 already approved for entry into the U.S.
Ackman's comments also come as U.S. businesses are facing a sharp uptick in workers resigning to pursue other job opportunities, a trend known as the "Great Resignation" as a labor shortage causes workers to start questioning the value of working lower-pay, less-secure jobs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The unprecedented economic sanctions leveled against Russia haven't stopped the country from continuing its war in Ukraine -- but they have succeeded in crushing its economy.
Bloomberg reports that leaked economic forecasts from Russia's Finance Ministry project that the Russian economy will shrink by as much as 12 percent this year as crippling economic sanctions wipe out roughly an entire decade's worth of economic growth.
This would also mark the worst economic crisis for Russia since the 1990s when the collapse of the Soviet Union sent the country's economy spiraling downward.
Natalia Lavrova, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, tells Bloomberg that there is no easy fix for Russia going forward.

“The main negatives are the oil embargo, the EU giving up Russian gas, along with more departures among foreign companies,” she explained. “All that will probably expand gradually, with a lot of negative carrying over in to 2023.”
Major Western nations launched sanctions against Russia earlier this year after the country launched an unprovoked war against neighboring Ukraine.
Although many intelligence experts believed Russia would be able to quickly overrun Ukraine militarily, Russia has failed to achieve its objective of taking over the capital of Kyiv and has also faced significant setbacks in its efforts to take over the eastern region of the country.

The Qatar-based TV channel said Israeli forces shot Abu Akleh, 51, deliberately and "in cold blood" while she was covering unrest in the Jenin refugee camp. 
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett however said it was "likely" that Palestinian gunfire killed her. 
Another Al Jazeera journalist, producer Ali al-Samudi, was wounded in the incident, the broadcaster added.
An AFP photographer said Abu Akleh was wearing a press flak jacket when she was shot. The photographer reported that Israeli forces were firing in the area and then saw Abu Akleh's body lying on the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokyo will begin recognizing same-sex partnerships from November after revising current rules, officials said Wednesday, becoming the largest city in Japan to do so.
Japan is the only nation of the Group of Seven countries that does not recognize same-sex unions, and its constitution stipulates that "marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes".

But in recent years, local authorities across the country have made moves to recognize same-sex partnerships, although such recognition does not carry the same rights as marriage under the law.
"We collected opinions from the public for the past two months and we heard opinions (from same-sex couples) who said they want to be recognized as partners," a Tokyo government spokesman told AFP.
The metropolitan government plans to ask legislators to approve revising a local ordinance next month, and will then begin accepting applications for the certificates in October and issuing them in November.
The city is considering offering various services currently only available to married couples to those with the partnership certificate, including applying for city-administered apartments, the spokesman said.
Tokyo's Shibuya district in 2015 became the first place in Japan to begin issuing symbolic "partnership" certificates to same-sex couples.
Many areas have followed suit, with activists saying more than 200 municipalities now recognize same-sex partnerships, granting couples rights including the ability to visit a partner in hospital and rent property together.
In a landmark ruling last year, a court in northern Sapporo said Japan's failure to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a verdict hailed by campaigners as a major victory.
But Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been cautious on the possibility of any legislative changes at the national level to recognize same-sex unions.
Taiwan is currently the only place in Asia with marriage equality, having taken the unprecedented step of legalizing same-sex unions in 2019.

Paraguay's president denounced the crime as a "cowardly murder" and a fellow prosecutor said the modus operandi was reminiscent of "the mafia."
Pecci, 45, was felled by two shots while relaxing on a beach on the idyllic tourist island of Baru, according to his wife, Paraguayan journalist Claudia Aguilera.
The couple got married on April 30 in the nearby city of Cartagena.
"Two men attacked Marcelo. They came (by sea) in a small boat, or on a jet ski, the truth is I did not see well," Aguilera told the El Tiempo newspaper.

The decision was made on national security grounds but those being prosecuted argue that the precedent-setting ruling makes it harder to prepare their defense ahead of trial.
For three decades, the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance held vigils commemorating victims of China's deadly 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
Those commemorations have been driven underground since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong following democracy protests three years ago.

The massacre was swept under the rug for decades, preventing victims and their relatives from any form of closure or recognition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only two witnesses testified during the trial, both for the prosecution.  Ms Tene, 32, who works in the software industry, spent most of the first day at the bar, describing meeting Mr Batali late one night at Towne Stove and Spirits, a bar in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston which has since closed.
Mr. Batali saw her surreptitiously take a picture of him a few seats away from the bar, then invited her to take pictures with him, she said.  At the start of the photoshoot, she testified, as did the forced kisses and groping.
The only other witness called was a friend of Ms Tene, Rachel Buckley, 37.  She said Ms Tene sent her a picture of Mr Batali the night they met, along with texts that described him as looking extremely drunk but didn’t.  I don’t mention that he caught her.  Details of Mr Batali’s groping and kissing emerged in subsequent conversations, Ms Buckley said.
Much of the evidence at trial came from two years of text messages from Ms Tene, which sometimes showed she was flippant about selling the photos or getting money from Mr Batali.  They revealed incidents in which she lied to opt out of a gym membership and, in an attempt to avoid jury duty, told another court that she was clairvoyant.  Once she was seated on that jury, she broke court rules by researching the defendant’s background and texting a friend that she thought he was guilty.
The judge noted these incidents and her disdain for the courts, as well as photos from the night at the bar that showed her smiling after her first meeting with Mr. Batali.  Three minutes later, she took another round of selfies with the chef.
“His reaction or lack thereof to the alleged assault is telling,” the judge said.
Just before giving his decision, Judge Stanton also reprimanded Mr Batali.  “His conduct, appearance and demeanor were not befitting a public figure of his stature at the time,” he said.  “It’s a lesson for all those people in public or celebrity positions.”

Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian entry for this year's Eurovision Song Contest, has made it into Saturday's grand final in Turin.
Kalush Orchestra advanced in the first semi-final late Tuesday along with nine other countries.
The musicians from western Ukraine and their song "Stefania" are the favourites for overall victory at this year's Grand Prix in the northern Italian city.
Artists from a total of 17 countries took part in the first semi- final on Tuesday.
The band has been vocal in expressing its support for Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion on social media since the armed conflict began.
Russia has been excluded from this year's Eurovision, as has its neighbour and close ally Belarus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his new tell-all book, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper criticized Ric Grenell, who became Donald Trump's acting director of national intelligence (DNI) for a few months in 2020. 
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told members of the House Intelligence Committee Russia was already trying to interfere with the 2020 election. Trump swiftly fired Maguire and replaced him with Grenell. 
According to Esper, "there were a number of people in the administration who would willingly do Trump’s bidding, and probably even his more extreme dictates, and it deeply concerned me." Grenell, he explained, was one of them. 
Trump would brag about Grenell like it was a grand strategy to force the hand of the Senate Republicans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended his invasion of Ukraine, saying it was a necessary blow against NATO. His remarks came during Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9 marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, are increasingly describing the fighting in Ukraine as a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia. We speak with the Quincy Institute’s Anatol Lieven, who says the war can only end through negotiations, and aggressive U.S. rhetoric risks prolonging the fighting. “That is a recipe for this war going on essentially forever, with colossal suffering for Ukraine,” says Lieven.

According to the British Foreign Office, UK, US and EU cyber security experts have met to assess new intelligence linking the February attack directly to the Russian state.
"This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe," UK foreign minister Liz Truss said.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, confirming the US intelligence assessment of the attack, said that Russia aimed to disrupt Ukrainian command and control.

US intelligence says there are “indications” that Russia wants to build a land bridge through Ukraine to Transnistria, a strip of land in Moldova. 
 Over the weekend, pro-Russian separatists claimed that Ukrainian drones dropped explosives on an airfield in Transnistria, a pro-Russia breakaway region of Moldova bordering Ukraine. Western analysts have cast a lot of doubt on those drone claims, but they came two weeks after a series of explosions were reported in the region. No one was injured in either event, but they were a reminder of the risks if the Ukraine wa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to invade Ukraine more than two months ago, he no doubt expected an easy victory from a lightning-fast assault intended to crush the smaller opposing force. This spectacular victory was meant to advance the Russian president's vision of a new manifest destiny, bringing his country closer to re-establishing itself as an imperial power on the global stage. But Putin's gambit failed in grand fashion. Instead of celebrating a victory on May 9 — the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II — the Russian military is trying to reorganize itself after a series of stunning defeats and great losses in both materiel and personnel.

In an attack on Esper in a letter to CBS News, Trump said that Esper was so weak that he personally had to run the military to defeat ISIS. But the book describes the defense team being forced to create a chart to explain to Trump how an attack on Iran would work. 
Trump met with congressional leaders on the afternoon of June 20, telling them he was about to bomb Iran after they shot down a U.S. surveillance drone.
