The French car manufacturer Renault announcement Monday that he was leaving Russia as part of a deal negotiated with the Russian government that would give Renault the option of resuming operations in the country at a later date.
Under the deal, Renault will sell its 68% stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia’s largest automaker, to a Moscow-based automotive research institute known as NAMI.  Renault did not disclose the price, but a person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not made public, said the automaker had received the token sum of 1 ruble.
NAMI would continue to operate AvtoVAZ’s two sprawling automobile plants and pay its employees.  Renault could then buy out the stake within six years, Renault said when announcing the deal.

Reuters: Erdogan says Swedish, Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Turkey 
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Ankara to convince it to approve their NATO bid. 
In a news conference, Erdogan said Turkey would not approve their bids to join NATO, calling Sweden a "hatchery" for terrorist organisations, and adding they had terrorists in their parliament. 
Ankara says Sweden and Finland harbor people it says are linked to groups it deems terrorists, namely the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt.

Reuters: Ukrainian force begins evacuating from last Mariupol stronghold  
KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) -The force holed up in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol began evacuating on Monday, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after months of bombardment. 
Five buses carrying troops from the Azovstal steelworks arrived in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk late on Monday, some 32 kilometres (20 miles) to the east, a Reuters witness said. 
Some of the evacuated troops were wounded and carried out of the buses on stretchers. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said 53 were taken to a hospital. 
It was not immediately clear how many troops were aboard the buses. Malyar said 211 other troops were taken to another site. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant.

Update #3: Injured troops to be evacuated from Azovstal – Moscow (RT)   
WNU Editor: There was no military point to stay in the steel plant. These Ukrainian soldiers have been surrounded for weeks, and their supplies had run out. The only question that remains unanswered is .... are there any Ukrainian soldiers left in this steel plant.]]></summary>

					The UN migration agency, IOM, is running migrant centres across six provinces in Turkey as part of its refugee response, which provide migrants, refugees, and host community members, with education, social services, law, vocational guidance, and community support. One of those who has benefited from the centres is Leyla Al Darazi, originally from Lebanon, who although born male, has identified as female since a young age. To coincide with the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, marked on 17 May, Leyla told her story to Begum Basaran, a communications assistant with IOM Turkey.

OilPrice.com: The NOPEC Bill Could Send Oil Prices To $300 
* For decades, different forms of ‘NOPEC’ legislation designed to pave the way for lawsuits against OPEC have been considered by Congress. 
* Last week, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved the NOPEC bill, leading to pushback from both within and outside the U.S. 
* OPEC’s most influential energy ministers warned that the bill could send oil prices soaring by 200 or even 300 percent. 
If the U.S. passes the NOPEC bill, a bill designed to pave the way for lawsuits against OPEC members for market manipulation, the oil market could face even more chaos. OPEC’s most influential energy ministers warned against passing the legislation, suggesting it could send oil prices soaring by 200% or 300%.   “The last thing we want is someone trying to hinder that system,” the UAE’s Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said at a conference in Abu Dhabi, referring to the system OPEC has had in place for decades to ensure supply to the market is adequate (adequate according to OPEC’s view).

* Russia's oil export revenue has soared 50% this year, the International Energy Agency said. 
* The Kremlin is earning close to $20 billion per month in 2022. 
* Asia has boosted Russian crude purchases as global powers condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russian oil export revenue is up 50% since the start of 2022 with the Kremlin generating close to $20 billion per month in sales, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Export volume has rebounded to levels seen before Russia invaded Ukraine, which triggered a wave of international sanctions and a spike in crude prices that's helped oil revenue. 
In April, Russian oil exports climbed by 620,000 barrels per day from the prior month to 8.1 million, back to their January and February average, the IEA said. Increased demand from India and China offset declines from the US and Europe.

* Ukraine has been unable to export grains, fertilizers and vegetable oil, while the conflict is also destroying crop fields and preventing a normal planting season. 
* Some nations have imposed restrictions on exports. 
* This is the case in India, for example, which announced Saturday a ban on wheat sales “to manage the overall food security of the country.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fuel and medicine shortages, along with record inflation and lengthy blackouts, have brought severe hardships to Sri Lankans, in the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948    
Daily Mail: Sri Lanka is down to its last day of petrol and faces 'severe' shortage of medicine, new PM warns amid economic crisis that plunged country into turmoil sparking deadly riots 
* The nation has suspended repayment of $7 billion in foreign loans due this year 
* Sri Lanka's total foreign debt is $51 billion, about half of which is due in 2026 
* People face major shortages of petrol and essential medicine among other items 
* 'We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices,' PM Wickremesinghe said 
* The country has seen widespread protests in recent weeks amid the crisis 
* Nine people were killed and 300 injured in clashes with government supporters last week   Sri Lanka's new prime minister today declared the crisis-hit nation was down to its last day of petrol, as the country's power minister told citizens not to join the lengthy fuel queues that have galvanised weeks of anti-government protests. 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, appointed prime minister on Thursday, said in an address to the nation the country urgently needed $75 million in foreign exchange to pay for essential imports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remarkable new retail project is about to join the Downtown Brooklyn development boom.  The building at 555 Fulton St. by Steven Witkoff and Apollo – shown here for the first time – will occupy the wraparound corner where Fulton Street, DeKalb Avenue and Bond Street converge.
Designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, it will provide one lucky tenant with highly visible space with 7,902 square feet on the ground floor and an additional 6,459 square feet on the lower level.  The first pickaxe should take place soon.
GoodSpace brokers Chris DeCrosta and Hank O’Donnell said the image isn’t quite final.  “Because this is a customizable building, we’ll market to see if a tenant wants a say in the final design,” DeCrosta said.
They target sports brands such as Nike or Adidas, “which could make sales of $40 million to $50 million a year,” DeCrosta said.  O’Donnell added: “It’s a place to do crazy business.”  Brokers refused to quote an asking rent.
The area is seeing a meteoric rise in commercial and residential development, including City Point, a new Ace Hotel and giant apartment towers from Extell, JDS and others.

Reuters: IMF Lifts Weighting of Dollar, Chinese Yuan in SDR Basket 
BEIJING (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Saturday it has increased the weighting of the dollar and Chinese yuan in its review of the currencies that make up the valuation of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR), an international reserve asset. 
The review is the first since the yuan, also known as the renminbi, joined the basket of currencies in 2016 in what was a milestone in Beijing's efforts to internationalise its currency. 
The IMF raised the U.S. currency's weighting to 43.38% from 41.73% and the yuan to 12.28% from 10.92%. The euro's weighting declined to 29.31% from 30.93%, the yen's fell to 7.59% from 8.33% and the British pound fell to 7.44% from 8.09%. 
The IMF said in a statement its executive board had determined the weighting based on trade and financial market developments from 2017 to 2021.

Recommendations for Yoon-Biden Summit – Must Build on the Strong Alliance Foundation
19fortyfive.com · by David Maxwell · May 16, 2022
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol began his five-year term on May 10 with a midnight security briefing from the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff. This meeting, which precedes a May 21 summit between Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden, reflects Yoon’s view that North Korea is the South’s “main enemy.”
Yoon’s presidency comes at a tumultuous time in U.S. foreign policy. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine continues, and it enjoys Chinese support. Strategic competition is expanding with Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has conducted 16 missile tests in 2022 so far. Raising the possibility of internal instability in North Korea is the COVID-19 outbreak that Kim has finally admitted to, after more than two years of claiming zero cases in the country.
In this context, the South Korea-U.S. alliance remains as important as ever. The upcoming summit provides an opportunity not only to reaffirm the alliance at the start of the Yoon administration, but also to build on the ROK-U.S. vision laid out in the May 2021 summit.

There may be no easy answers.  Platforms like Facebook, Twitch and Twitter have made progress in recent years, experts said, in removing violent content and videos faster.  Following the shooting in New Zealand, social platforms and countries around the world joined an initiative called Christchurch Call to Action and agreed to work closely together to counter terrorism and violent extremism content.  One tool that social sites have used is a shared database of hashes, or digital fingerprints of images, which can flag inappropriate content and remove it quickly.

The central problem is that the coronavirus has become more adept at reinfecting people.  Already, people infected with the first variant of Omicron are reporting second infections with newer versions of the variant – BA.2 or BA2.12.1 in the United States, or BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa.
These people could have a third or fourth infection even within this year, researchers said in interviews.  And a small fraction may have symptoms that persist for months or years, a condition known as Long Covid.

May 16 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble firmed past 64 per dollar on Monday and climbed towards its highest in nearly five years against the euro, supported by continuing restrictions on currency trading. 
The rouble is the world's best-performing currency this year, although this is due to artificial support from capital controls that Russia imposed to shield its financial sector in late February after sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

Reuters: EU ministers urge Hungary to sign up to planned Russian oil embargo 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU foreign ministers sought to publicly pressure Hungary on Monday to lift its veto of a proposed oil embargo on Russia, with Lithuania saying the bloc was being "held hostage by one member state".
The ban on crude imports proposed by the European Commission in early May would be its harshest sanction yet in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and includes carve-outs for EU states most dependent on Russian oil.  Germany, the European Union's biggest economy and a major buyer of Russian energy, said it wanted a deal to authorize the oil embargo, which it suggested could last for years.

Lunar watchers across the United States can experience a celestial wonder as Earth’s shadow covers the moon during prime time on the night of May 15.  Those on the East Coast can watch our natural satellite begin to turn an eerie copper-red color around 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time during one of the longest lunar eclipses in recent memory.
“For most of North America, this is a tremendous viewing opportunity,” said Madhulika Guhathakurta, an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

* Rush to wean off Russian gas has made European consumers highly vulnerable to LNG price shocks. 
* Global LNG demand outstrips supply in 2022. 
* New LNG projects are unlikely to provide relief until 2024. 
A liquified natural gas (LNG) crisis is brewing for European countries dealing with energy insecurity in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as demand will outstrip supply by the end of this year, Rystad Energy research shows. Although soaring demand has spurred the greatest rush of new LNG projects worldwide in more than a decade, construction timelines mean material relief is unlikely only after 2024. Global LNG demand is expected to hit 436 million tonnes in 2022, outpacing the available supply of just 410 million tonnes. A perfect winter storm may be forming for Europe as the continent seeks to limit Russian gas flows. The supply imbalance and high prices will set the scene for the most bullish environment for LNG projects in more than a decade, although supply from these projects will only arrive and provide relief from after 2024

The first Adirondack chair was designed in 1903 by Thomas Lee, in Westport, NY, Ms. O’Leary said, to meet very specific requirements: “He was looking for a chair that was comfortable, didn’t need a lot of fluff, and could hold a drink.”
Mr. Lee’s chair used solid wood slabs, but countless manufacturers have since modified the design, including with wood slats that provide better drainage.  “We now have fan-bac…]]></summary>

At his local kosher butcher, prices rose even more: over $200 for a 5-pack of ribs.
“I told my husband, ‘We’ll never have short ribs again,'” she said.

“Pleasure in work puts perfection in work,” Mr. Ridge first said, quoting the Greek philosopher.
Then he took a recent note from BlackRock.  “Companies that have forged strong bonds with their employees have seen lower turnover levels and higher returns throughout the pandemic,” Mr. Ridge read aloud.
He punctuated it with his own comment: “Well, duh!”

It doesn’t always work out that way, but it’s rare for a team to fall apart as completely as the Phoenix Suns did on Sunday night.
At halftime, Suns fans were slumped in their seats, Phoenix players wore blank stares as they sat on the bench and the Mavericks’ Luka Doncic couldn’t help but laugh.
The Phoenix disaster was well underway.
The top-seeded Suns lost to the No. 4-seeded Dallas Mavericks, 123-90, in Game 7 of the teams’ Western Conference Semifinals series on Sunday in Phoenix.  Dallas, which led by 46 points in the second half and never trailed on Sunday, will face Golden State on Wednesday at San Francisco in Game 1 of the Conference Finals.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Djokovic, like his career-long benchmarks Nadal and Roger Federer, underscored his passion with longstanding excellence and constantly ignoring clues that his peak years might be behind him.
For Djokovic, it has been an unparalleled season and challenge: his decision not to be vaccinated against the coronavirus led to a standoff with Australian authorities that ended in his expulsion on the eve of the Open. Australia this year, and that kept him out.  the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, California, and Miami Gardens, Florida in March.
But with health protocols now relaxed in Europe, Djokovic returned to regular action on clay last month.  Although he struggled in his first matches with his timing and stamina, he slowly but convincingly started to achieve his goals again, and he gathered momentum just in time for Roland Garros.
“I always try to use those kinds of situations and adversity in my favor to motivate me for the next challenge,” he said of Australia.  “As much as I felt pressure in my life and my career, it was something really on a whole other level. But I feel that’s already behind me. I feel good on the court. Mentally also, I am cool.I am lively.
Against Tsitsipas, the hirsute Greek star who pushed Djokovic to five sets before losing the French Open final last year, Djokovic controlled most of the baseline exchanges with as much patience as panache.  When Tsitsipas failed to serve the second set, Djokovic proved the most reliable force in the tiebreaker, perfectly content, it seemed, waiting for Tsitsipas to crack.
“To a certain extent it’s a relief because after everything that happened at the start of the year, it was important for me to win a big title,” Djokovic said.

Hunter Greene, a rookie right-hander, had struck out nine through seven innings without allowing a hit.  His counterpart, Pirates veteran left-hander José Quintana, nearly matched him, allowing just three hits and one walk in seven innings before handing the game to the Pittsburgh bullpen.


Although Greene’s pitch count exceeded 100, Reds manager David Bell allowed him to start the bottom of the eighth inning in pursuit of a no-hitter in Pittsburgh.  Greene caused a groundout, but then gave Rodolfo Castro and Michael Perez walks.  After seven and a third innings, five walks and 118 pitches, Greene was finally retired.

Panarin took the puck from Adam Fox at the top of the right face-off circle, skated a few steps toward goal, then shot right-footed, beating Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry on the short side through a screen and sparking a wild celebration on the ice and in the stands.
“Honestly, they let me shoot since the first game,” Panarin said through an interpreter.  “My bad, I didn’t really do those shots. But maybe I should listen to everyone’s advice now and go out and take some shots.
The tying goal came with 5:45 left in the third period after a play that angered Penguins coach Mike Sullivan.  Pittsburgh’s Marcus Pettersson lost his helmet behind the Penguins goal after becoming tangled with Rangers forward Alexis Lafrenière.  According to the rule, Pettersson either had to find his helmet and put it back on or leave the ice for safety reasons.  Pettersson walked to the bench.
Kris Letang, Pittsburgh’s top defenseman, took Petterson’s place, but he skated to the net, past Jarry, and was unable to challenge Zibanejad’s shot.  And if Pettersson had been on the ice, he might have helped the Penguins clear the puck.  Sullivan, unsurprisingly, is not a fan of the rule.
“I think it stinks,” he said.  “He has to go out.  His helmet was intentionally ripped off, but that’s the rule.
For the Penguins, who were in the playoffs for the 16th straight year, the loss was particularly hard to bear because it could be the last season for their longtime core of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Letang playing together.  These last two can be free agents and sign with other teams.

        <updated>2022-05-16T08:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farming is a high-risk life.  Mr Woiwode was 63 when his jacket was caught in the draft shaft of a hay baler, breaking three ribs, compressing his spine and nearly severing his right arm.  As a teenager, her son, Joseph, was trampled by a horse and spent days in a coma;  when he recovered, his motor skills still fragile, he almost lost his fingers because of a mower. 
One day, setting fire to the weeds blocking a tractor, Mr Woiwode nearly set himself on fire and Joseph, then a toddler strapped to the seat with a cowboy belt.  During a cataclysmic blizzard one winter, it was so cold for so long that Mr Woiwode had to fuel his wood-burning furnace with the dead chickens that had frozen in their coop.
But the place also nurtured Mr. Woiwode’s family and work.
“There is a thump that the virgin ground has here on unshaded ground, so different from cultivated land,” he wrote, “and in the colors of the surrounding painter, in light undimmed by pollution, you can feel like you’re on a soundstage.For a second, you see the entire panorama as being constructed to contain you in its stage.
The Woiwodes practiced the Presbyterian faith to which they had turned when their marriage was difficult, and Mr. Woiwode, who had been raised Roman Catholic, often wrote about his chosen faith, about the land and about the biblical stories that supported and shaped it.  This makes him an anomaly in literary circles, as well as in the liberal arts institutions where he taught for decades.
“Most of life seems to me to be a religious experience,” Mr. Woiwode told the New York Times in 1988.  “I mean, I guess either it does or it doesn’t, and for me it does.”
Larry Alfred Woiwode was born October 30, 1941 in Carrington, ND His father, Everett, was a high school teacher and principal;  his mother, Audrey (Johnston) Woiwode, a housewife, died when Larry was 9 years old.  He grew up in Sykeston, ND, then in Mason County, Illinois.

View co-host Sunny Hostin blamed the national shortage of infant formula on the lack of federally paid maternity leave.
hostin said:

I think the fault lies in the fact that we have terrible maternity leave because a lot of women wish they could stay home and breastfeed their children and take care of their children, and the fact is that we can’t do that’s because we have very limited maternity leave and we have to immediately go back to work to take care of our families and feed our families, and the government is not supporting us in that, and I think that’s where lies the problem.
I worked for the government and right after I had my son, I had to borrow time off from other federal prosecutors so I could stay home a little longer, and I had just had a C-section.  It was absolutely…]]></summary>

* The Senate Minority Leader led a delegation of Republican colleagues to Kyiv 
* They met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reaffirmed support 
* It comes after a bipartisan push to fast track $40 billion in more Ukraine aid was stalled by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, delaying the vote to this week 
* Also last week, bipartisan senators introduced a resolution demanding that the State Department designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism 
* If designated it would join Cuba, Syria, Iran and North Korea on the list 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday demanded that President Joe Biden designate the Russian Federation as an official state sponsor of terrorism over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. 
The label places miscellaneous financial and foreign aid restrictions on a country and allows alleged victims of terrorism that its government is accused of sponsoring to sue for civil damages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Of Alabama: If Ukraine Is Winning Why Is The U.S. Requesting A Ceasefire? 
Yesterday the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu. 
Why? 
The U.S. readout of the call says:      
 On May 13, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu for the first time since February 18. Secretary Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication. 
Austin initiated the call and the U.S. is seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine!!! 
Are we not told that the Ukraine is winning the war? That it will soon push the Russian forces back over the border? The operation to 'weaken Russia', which Austin had publicly announced two weeks ago, does not seem to go that well.

(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is set to offer its gas importers a solution to avoid a breach of sanctions when buying fuel from Russia and still effectively satisfy President Vladimir Putin’s demands over payment in rubles.

        <id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-732247599994189300.post-1650636902222306133</id>
        <link href="https://www.newsrust.com/2022/05/book-review-familia-grande-by-camille.html"/>
        <updated>2022-05-15T15:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kouchner adds, “My grandmother killed herself soon after that.”
It’s the second funeral in the book — “a militant, heartbroken crowd who’d come to pay tribute to my grandmother’s freedom to kill herself.”  The suicide leaves Camille’s mother an alcoholic shell.  She drinks herself blind every night: “This is absolutely not up for discussion.  It’s my freedom.”
The book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: “He started stroking me, and then, you know …”
From this point, the narrator’s voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a “hydra” of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.
The book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  “Let’s be clear about this,” she writes:

Article 222—31—1 of the criminal code
Rape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:
1) ascending year;
2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;
3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.

Claire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.  She lives in Paris.

THE FAMILY GRANDE, by Camille Kouchner |  Translated by Adriana Hunter |  214 p.  Other Press.  |  $24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mr. Chayefsky “was very charming and he was very funny about some of the people he saw,” Mr. Wald told Dave Itzkoff for his book. “Crazy as hell: The creation of ‘Network’ and the fateful sight of the most angry man in cinema” (2014).  “Which led me to believe he wasn’t going to treat them kindly.”
Mr. Wald resigned from NBC News in 1977 after disputes with senior network management over issues such as signing exclusive and expensive contracts with former President Gerald R. Ford;  his wife, Betty;  and Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, to appear on NBC News specials.
Although he approved the signings at the time, he later felt that the fees paid resulted in cuts to his budget for special features and documentaries, The New York Times reported at the time.
After leaving NBC, Mr. Wald consulted with PBS on the future of public television newsgathering and served for three months as a special assistant to Otis Chandlereditor of the Los Angeles Times.
When Mr. Arledge recruited him to join ABC News in 1978, Mr. Wald had to adjust to the culture there, especially at the Washington bureau, which did not welcome him happily.
“If you think we need a guy from NBC to help us, you’re wrong,” Frank Reynoldsone of three anchors on ABC’s “World News Tonight,” said, according to Mr. Arledge’s memoir.
Mr. Wald adapted and stayed for 21 years.
In addition to his sons Matthew, a former New York Times reporter, and Jonathan, a former “Today” and “NBC Nightly News” executive producer, Mr. Wald, who lived in Larchmont, NY, is survived by one daughter, Elizabeth. Wald;  seven grandchildren;  and a great-grandson.  His wife, Edith (Leslie) Wald, died in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency prices also fell precipitously.  The price of bitcoin fell to $26,000 on Thursday, down 60% from its peak in November, before rising somewhat.  Since the start of the year, Bitcoin’s price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark heavily weighted towards tech stocks, suggesting that investors are treating it like any other risky asset.
Ether’s price has also fallen, losing over 30% of its value over the past week.  Other cryptocurrencies, like Solana and Cardano, are also down.
Any panic could be overdone, some analysts said.  A study by Mizuho showed that the average owner of Bitcoin on Coinbase would not lose money until the price of the digital currency fell below $21,000.  This, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a real death spiral could occur.
“Bitcoin worked as long as nobody lost money,” he said.  “Once it gets back to those levels, it’s kind of an ‘Oh, my God’ moment.”
Professional investors who weathered the volatility in crypto also remained calm.  Hunter Horsley, managing director of Bitwise Asset Management, which provides crypto investment services to 1,000 financial advisers, met with more than 70 of them this week to discuss the market.  Many weren’t selling, he said, because all other assets were down as well.  Some were even trying to capitalize on the decline.
“Their point of view is, ‘It’s not fun, but there’s nowhere to hide,'” he said.
Still, the price crash has rattled crypto traders.  Just a few months ago, blockchain proponents predicted that Bitcoin’s price could hit $100,000 this year.

The US Navy will scrap nine warships worth $3.2 billion - despite some being just three years old - because their technology is already obsolete. 
Anti-submarine systems on the Freedom-class combat warships, four of which were commissioned in 2019 and 2020, 'did not work out technically', the Navy's operations chief said. 
Admiral Michael Gilday asked Congress to sign off on the scrapping, which will save the Navy $391 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global warming can affect hurricanes, in part because a warmer ocean provides more energy to power them.  But that’s not the only factor at play: a study published Wednesday confirms that, for the frequency of hurricanes, the effects of particulate air pollution are even more important.
Over the past four decades, new research shows that the decline in pollution in the form of tiny aerosol particles from transportation, energy production and industry in North America and Europe was responsible for the increase in the number of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic.  .
During the same period, increased pollution from the growing economies of India and China had the opposite effect, reducing hurricane activity in the western North Pacific, according to the study.

19FortyFive: Forget Retirement: The A-10 Warthog Can Kill Tanks with ‘Reactive’ Armor 
The A-10C Thunderbolt II Just Became Even More Deadly – The Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt II was tailor-made for close-air support, and with its unique GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm (1.18-inch) cannon, it has proved to be among the most effective anti-tank aircraft ever devised. Earlier this year, the United States Air Force demonstrated how the aircraft, which has also earned the nickname “Warthog” among its pilots, is able to knock out modern tanks equipped with armor improvements. 
The first-ever tests were conducted at the Nevada Test and Training Range, February 14-25, 2022 – and the 422nd and 59th Test and Evaluation Squadrons successfully proved that modern-day armored vehicles equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor were still vulnerable to the A-10C Thunderbolt II’s GAU-8 Avenger.

A Navy vessel sank under unclear circumstances, at an undisclosed location, while testing out some secretive technology last December — and that’s about all the sea service will say on the subject. 
The vessel’s name and the nature of the technology tests were not disclosed, though officials did say it took on water and sank while moored. 
That’s the extent of information made public by the Navy regarding the Dec. 7 Class A mishap, the highest mishap category, denoting damages of at least $2.5 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“With privacy, it’s like once it’s out, it’s out,” Professor Meiklejohn said.
Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, a physician and director of Women on Waves, a nonprofit that provides resources for abortion seekers, found this to be the case when she tried to create her own crypto wallet.  “It had the exact same due diligence demands as a normal bank account, where you have to provide ID and other information,” she said.
She could see how anonymous transactions could attract abortion providers, whose work could soon turn them into legal targets.  But, she says, “I haven’t found any cryptocurrency where you can do that.”
Lawyers are not convinced that cryptocurrencies would protect patients in most cases.  Abortion bans “will cover everything whether you pay in cash or crypto,” said Rachel Rebouché, acting dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law and author of a forthcoming paper titled “The New Abortion Battleground.”
“If abortion is illegal in your state — it doesn’t matter if you have a surgical abortion, a medical abortion, whether you self-manage your abortion — if it’s illegal, it’s illegal,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School which focused on reproductive rights.  (In the first three months of this year, 22 states introduced more than 100 restrictions on abortion pills approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.)
Still, organizations like Planned Parenthood are keeping an open mind about how they might raise and distribute funds.
Alexis McGill Johnson, the organization’s president and CEO, said Planned Parenthood was “looking into a number of things” in the cryptocurrency space, but would not divulge specifics.
“At the end of the day, all options are on the table,” she said.

After that, Wednesdays became their regular fixture at the Mean Eyed Cat.  They also started taking the kids on regular outings — to the park’s wading pool, picnics or the pool at Ms. Thompson’s apartment complex just outside Austin.
In mid-July 2019, “we made the relationship official,” Ms Thompson said.
In December, they broke up for about a month, the first of three breakups.  “Jeni needed some space, but we were still in touch,” Ms. Thompson said.
Ms Pandolfi said: ‘I’m a typical non-committal person.
“But I didn’t want to lose her,” she added.
The following year, after a week-long breakup in June 2020, the two received another set of tattoos in October featuring their and their children’s birth month flowers: Ms. Pandolfi included roses, for her and Beau, and Mrs. Thompson included thrush.  , for Juniper, and concern for herself.
She proposed to Ms. Pandolfi weeks later, on November 11, 2020, at a local Airbnb – a converted garage where Ms. Thompson set up battery-powered candles, red wine and charcuterie.
In 2021, after a breakup from February to June, Ms Pandolfi proposed on November 11, a year to the day after Ms Thompson had proposed to her.  At the Sekrit Theater, an Austin event space, Ms. Pandolfi had arranged a marquee inside a greenhouse to read, “Marry me.”

He was 92 years old.
His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his son Dennis, the president of Cakebread Cellars.
Mr. Cakebread, an auto mechanic with a sideline in photography, was returning from filming in northern Napa County when in 1972 he visited a couple of family friends at their farm in Rutherford.  He was 42 and only vaguely curious about what a life beyond car repair might be like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time when the Boston Celtics’ season seemed in danger of crumbling into a pile of fine dust.  They had a losing record at the end of January.  They were battling a series of injuries.  There were questions about whether Jayson Tatum could co-exist with Jaylen Brown – was it time for the team to consider trading Brown?  — as well as the inevitable criticisms of Ime Udoka in his first season as a coach.
It’s a familiar story at this late stage of the season, but one worth repeating, especially now.  Why?  Because Friday night, following a late-game meltdown earlier in the week, the Celtics faced elimination in Milwaukee.  Outside their cocoon, as they prepared for Game 6, the questions swirled: Did they miss their chance?  Could they somehow find the resolve to extend their Easte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I think the playoffs can sometimes reveal who you are, what kind of character you have,” Kreider said.  “For him to stay with his game and keep working, he’s been a huge, huge leader for us all year.  He was an absolute horse.
The Rangers trailed 2-0 after one period and the Penguins, playing without Sidney Crosby, their star center and captain, were 40 minutes away from qualifying for the second round.  But Zibanejad scored two one-time slapshots in 76 seconds to tie the game.
“There is no giving up,” Zibanejad said of the comeback.  “That’s what I love about this team.”
A few minutes later, there was another crazy breakaway.  The game started when Rangers keeper Igor Shesterkin took advantage of a poor Penguins line change and delivered a perfect 100-foot pass on Zibanejad’s stick.  Zibanejad was alone again.
“His passing is better than all of us sometimes,” Zibanejad said of Shesterkin’s stickwork.
penguin keeper Louis Domingue made the initial save on Zibanejad, but Kreider was there with his teammate, and he slammed the rebound to put Rangers ahead, 3-2.  If that sounds like the Game 5 scoring pattern at Madison Square Garden, it was, and would continue, until the last goal in an empty New York net at the end.
Evgeni Malkin scored for the Penguins to even things up, 3-3, on a breakaway late in the second period.  The game remained tied until just 1:28 remained.  Kreider then fired a high slap shot which Domingue saved in front of his chest, but the puck spun over his head and landed behind him and into the net.
“Nobody said it was going to be easy,” Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said.  “They are a very good team. They have a lot of talented players who can score goals.

Given Manny Machado’s torrid start for the San Diego Padres this season, it would be predictable to joke that the five-time All-Star plays chess while his peers play checkers.  But in Machado’s case, it’s also true: when he’s not beating opposing pitchers and stealing hits with acrobatic defensive plays, Machado can be found keeping his mind sharp with contemplation. calm on a chessboard.
“Chess is interesting,” said Machado, who learned the game from former Orioles player and manager Brady Anderson in Baltimore in 2017. “It’s something you can’t just play. anticipate what …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With 20 national championships in six disciplines and nine international gold medals, Joseph Gray is by far the most decorated American mountain runner.
In the broader discipline of trail running – which includes everything from 100-mile ultramarathons to ultra-steep kilometer races – he is also part of the pantheon of all-time greats, as a four-time world champion and four-time winner at Pikes Peak Ascent, one of the toughest races in the country.
Gray’s specialty, mountain running – a type of running at higher altitudes, with difficult, technical surfaces, and considerable elevation gain and loss – is still a niche sport.  But trail running as a whole is booming.


Running as an organized sport took off in the mid-1990s and today has around 20 million participants, who compete in 25,000 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delaware State University is a historically black university, and about 70% of the team members are black, according to its coach, Pamella Jenkins.
The team bus was returning to Delaware from a game in Florida on the morning of April 20 when Georgia police arrested the bus driver, Ms Jenkins said in an interview.  The driver stopped on a freeway off-ramp, she said, and an officer boarded, saying the bus was mistakenly driving in the left lane.
Within five minutes, she said, one of the student-athletes drew attention to officers pulling backpacks, team duffel bags and other belongings from under the bus. – for inspection by a drug-sniffing dog.  Then two officers boarded the bus announcing a drug search in an interaction that Ms Jenkins, who is black, described as “racially motivated”.
“When he raised narcotic dogs, the first thing he went to was marijuana, which is stereotypically associated with African Americans,” Ms Jenkins said.  She added that the officer had an “accusatory tone: he was not asking”.
When a student asked how the routine traffic stop turned into a drug search, she said, an officer replied that charter buses on this section of the highway were known to drug and human trafficking.  Although nervous and scared, Ms Jenkins said she tried to stay calm, as students gathered by the window to look outside and others sat in shock.  She said she feared a single bad word could inflame the situation.
The university’s student newspaper, the hornet, published an article on traffic control by Sydney Anderson, a member of the team.  Ms Anderson and the other team members did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Ms Anderson wrote in the article that the police tried to get the players to admit they had drugs, and she accused them of carrying out an unlawful search without probable cause.  She said “the majority of the team members had never encountered the police, which made this a traumatic incident for them”.

The main goal of the Ethereum 2.0 update is to improve scalability so that the network can handle more transactions without delays or high fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judge Thomas said the left had tactics adopted that the Conservatives would not use.
“You would never visit Supreme Court justices’ homes when things weren’t going our way,” he said.  “We didn’t throw tantrums.  It is our responsibility to always act appropriately and not give up.
He added that conservatives had “never trashed a Supreme Court nominee”.  He acknowledged that Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, “didn’t get a hearing, but he didn’t get trashed.”
“You won’t see the total destruction of just one candidate,” Judge Thomas said.  “You also won’t see people going to other people’s houses, attacking them while dining out, throwing things at them.”
He said Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh had been the victim of particular abuse, but he only made a cursory reference to his own brutal confirmation hearings, during which he angrily denied the accusations of sexual harassment.
Taking sides on a disputed point, Judge Thomas said the Senate Republicans who blocked Mr. Garland’s nomination were following a rule that then-Senator President Biden proposed, “which is to say you get no audience in the last year of an administration.”
Judge Thomas, the most senior member of the current court, was a fierce opponent of Roe.
On Friday, he said opposition to his nomination in 1991 was “by these people who were trying to get me out of court because of an abortion.”
During his confirmation hearings, however, he said, to the astonishment of many, that he never discussed Roe, even though it was published while a student at law school in Yale.

But that does not mean that the blockades and occupations of Ottawa and various border crossings with the United States in February have completely disappeared.  An independent inquiry is being set up to look into the government’s use of the Emergencies Act to suppress protests, and a joint Senate-House of Commons committee has held its own hearings.  Ottawa has yet to permanently replace its police chief after the force was overwhelmed by truckers, and Peter Sloly, who had been brought in from Toronto to lead the force, has resigned.

Now, Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine appears to bring the Russian leader’s nightmare to life as NATO is about to begin its biggest potential expansion in nearly two decades.
Having weathered the post-war period in non-alignment and neutrality, Sweden and Finland are actively exploring ascension to the military alliance forged during the Cold War, with officials from both countries set to meet their counterparts in the NATO on Saturday.
Russia immediately castigated, stopping electricity exports to Finland and promising an unspecified “military-technical” response after warning that the move would pose a clear threat to its own national sec…]]></summary>

Rescue teams worked overnight to clear the burnt out four-storey building near a railway station in the western suburbs.
More than 75 people were in the building when the fire broke out on Friday evening. Some jumped from windows to save themselves, according to eyewitnesses, and firefighters broke the glass and rescued people with ropes.
Authorities said fire started in an office on the first floor and spread rapidly. Two owners of the company were arrested as part of probe to identify suspected safety violations.
Offering condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 200,000 rupees ($2,580) in compensation for the victims' next-of-kin.

Ukrainian hopes of being able to repurpose frozen Russian assets to pay for war damage were dashed on Saturday as Germany's foreign minister highlighted the hurdles to such an approach.
Ukrainian officials have pushed for weeks for frozen Russian assets to be transferred to Kiev, to cover the costs of repairing destruction caused by Russia's invasion or even to pay for Ukraine's defence efforts.
But German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at the end of a G7 foreign ministers' conference she hosted, said there were multiple problems with such an approach.
"Gaining access to frozen money is legally ... anything but easy," she said. She noted that there could be sound reasons to attempt such an act, but noted that they had to be aligned with the law.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had again proposed the idea at the session held on the Baltic coast.
"We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe," he said, arguing that Russia should be forced to pay for the war, not only in political or economic terms, but also financially.
Beyond legal issues, many European leaders fear attempts to liquidate and transfer Russian funds will lead to countries like Russia and China seeking to set up an alternative international financial system, which would make sanctions a weaker tool in the future.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Saturday the spread of COVID-19 had thrust his country into "great turmoil" and called for an all-out battle to overcome the outbreak, as 21 daily deaths were reported among people with fever.
North Korea this week acknowledged for the first time a COVID outbreak, imposing a nationwide lockdown. But there was no sign of a rigorous testing or treatment campaign in the isolated country's rudimentary healthcare system.
"The spread of the malignant epidemic is a great turmoil to fall on our country since the founding," Kim told an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, according to state news agency KCNA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to the Ukraine War, no one has a crystal ball. With Putin rattling his rockets and the world worried about his next step, the most important take-home message from this disastrous affair — however it ends — should be that nuclear weapons must go.
And yet, beyond death and destruction, another outcome is very likely and potentially tragic; namely, a renewed call for more and “better” nuclear weapons.
The claim is already being made that if Ukraine hadn’t given up its nuclear weapons in the mid-1990s, Putin would not have attacked that country. Nukes, we are told, would have deterred him, and so, we should cast our lot — even more than at present — with nuclear weapons so as to deter would-be aggressors.
History argues otherwise, namely, that nuclear weapons do not prevent wars…]]></summary>

Russian President Vladimir Putin told Finnish President Sauli Niinistö that Helsinki's moves towards joining NATO are a mistake and that Russia does not pose a threat to Finland, according to a Kremlin statement.
Finland's departure from its traditional neutrality would cause the two countries' good neighbourly relations to deteriorate, Putin said.
The Finnish president organized the call to explain why his country plans to join NATO, according to a statement from Helsinki.
"President Niinistö told President Putin how fundamentally the Russian demands in late 2021 aiming at preventing countries from joining NATO and Russia’s massive invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have altered the security environment of Finland," the statement read.
"The conversation was open and direct, but was conducted without escalation. It was considered important to avoid tensions," Niinistö said, according to the Finnish presidential office website.]]></summary>

Or maybe a Greek with a death wish, a slinky Lithuanian chanteuse with a jet-black bowl cut or a Serbian germaphobe?
The line-up for Saturday's grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest is typically outlandish, but with the roars of war on the continent's eastern front, a hiphop lullaby from Ukraine is the song to beat.
Riding a wave of public support following Russia's invasion, Kalush Orchestra's tribute to the motherland is the bookmakers' favorite to triumph at the world's biggest live music event, watched by tens of millions of people.
Kitschy and quirky, Eurovision embraces the eccentric and the contest's 66th edition held in Italy's northwestern city of Turin is no exception, with its natio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates' de facto leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan was elected president of the Gulf Arab state by a federal supreme council on Saturday, solidifying his rule over the OPEC oil producer and key regional player.
The council, which groups the rulers of the seven emirates of the UAE federation, elected Sheikh Mohammed, known as MbZ, a day after the death of his half-brother, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, who was also ruler of Abu Dhabi.
"We congratulate him and pledge allegiance to him as do our people...and the entire country will follow his leadership to glory," Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also UAE vice-president and premier, said in a Twitter post.
MbZ, 61, had already been wielding power for years in a period when Sheikh Khalifa suffered bouts of illness, including a stroke in 2014.
He becomes president at a time when the UAE's long-standing ties with the United States have been visibly strained over perceived U.S. disengagement from its Gulf allies' security concerns.
MbZ led a realignment of the Middle East that created a new anti-Iran axis with Israel. He also bolstered the military might of the UAE which, coupled with its oil wealth and business hub status, extended Emirati influence in the region and beyond.

The death of veteran reporter Shireen Abu Akleh has sparked an outpouring of grief and Israel police charged at a crowd of Palestinian mourners carrying her coffin through Jerusalem's Old City on Friday, drawing international condemnation.
The violence, which lasted only minutes, added to Palestinian outrage over Abu Akleh's killing, which has threatened to fuel tensions that have escalated since March.

Niko Omilana, who received 49,628 votes and finished in fifth place in London's 2021 mayoral race, traveled to Harrison, Arkansas — which he described as "America's most racist town."
In a local Walmart, Omilana was told that Thomas Robb was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Police then asked him to leave the store.
Omilana set up an interview with the man by saying it was for "BBC" and asked him to give a shout-out to supporters of the KKK in the United Kingdom who voiced excitement for the interview on social media.

A court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow extended Griner's arrest until June 18, state news agency TASS reported, citing a court representative.
Griner's detention came days before Russia defied US warnings and sent troops into Ukraine, prompting Western powers to impose sweeping sanctions and send military aid to Kyiv.

"We must find an agreement," Zelenskyy said in an interview with an Italian media outlet as deadly ground fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continues to intensify.
"Every day the war continues, the risk of its spreading grows."
Ukrainian and Western officials claimed Friday that Russian troops have begun pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as Moscow focuses its assault on the eastern part of the country.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe finally returned home in March along with a fellow dual national, after Britain agreed to pay a longstanding debt to Iran.
Johnson was accused of lengthening her ordeal when, as foreign secretary in 2017, he wrongly claimed that she had been training journalists at the time of her arrest in 2016.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked as a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the news agency, and was arrested on a visit to see family, accused of plotting to overthrow the regime.
Johnson later withdrew the comment and apologized, but it had a "las…]]></summary>

Masked police officers faced scores of flag-waving and chanting Palestinians in the compound of St. Joseph's Hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, television footage showed.
Officers then charged the crowd and at one point the group carrying her coffin backed against a wall and almost dropped the casket, recovering it just before one end hit the ground.
The violent scenes underlined the growing anger over Abu Akleh's killing which has threatened to add further fuel to an already raging conflict.

But just to Ukraine's southwest, the relatively small country of Moldova has taken in more war refugees per capita than any other European country. Moldova is a former Soviet bloc country and is not a member of the European Union. 
In an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s minister of foreign affairs and European integration, "called on the United States and the EU to pay more attention to Moldova’s struggle, in order to maintain the economy and security of the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli forces stormed the grounds of a Jerusalem hospital Friday as the coffin containing the body of a slain journalist emerged ahead of burial, with police saying they acted against people "disrupting the public order".
TV images showed Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh's coffin nearly falling to the ground as police grabbed Palestinian flags from the crowd around the procession outside Saint Joseph's hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Israel forbids public displays of Palestinian flags and often storms individuals who hoist them at rallies or protests in the city.

A senior Palestinian figure, Hanan Ashrawi, tweeted that "savage #Israeli 'special forces' viciously attack the funeral procession bearing the coffin" of Abu Akleh as it left St. Joseph's. "The inhumanity (of) Israel is on full display", said the former top Palestine Liberation Organization official.

In a statement, police said they had held dialogue with Abu Akleh's family ahead of time in order to "enable a respectable funeral. "Unfortunately under the auspices of the funeral and taking cynical advantage of it, hundreds of people began disrupting the public order before it even began," police said.
"As the coffin was about to exit the hospital, stones began to be thrown at officers from the hospital's plaza, and the officers were forced to use riot dispersal means," the statement added. Police also released a video in which an officer, outside the hospital grounds, is addressing the crowd over a loudspeaker.
"If you don't stop these chants and (Palestinians) nationalistic songs we will have to disperse you using force and we won't let the funeral take place," the officer says in the video. Abu Akleh's coffin left the hospital grounds by vehicle and had arrived at a Jerusalem church for her funeral.
She was killed Wednesday while covering clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

As tourism in Thailand is starting up again after a long period of complicated Covid entry rules, a new water park is set to open on the popular holiday island of Phuket, in a bid to draw in much-needed visitors.
The 9-hectare Andamanda Phuket park, which has 36 slides and a 10,000-square-metre wave pool, is scheduled to open on May 22, one year later than originally planned due to the pandemic.
The name comes from the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean, where Phuket is located.
On the park's website, its operators promise visitors "a sea adventure that wanders into the tales of Thai mythology."
"I am confident that Andamanda Phuket will motivate tourists around the world to come to Thailand," said Thapanee Kiatphaibool from the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
Besides the large number of slides and other water-related attractions, there will also be daily shows, parades and performances which celebrate Thai culture as well as a 5,300-square-metre playground and a floating market.
According to estimates, the mega park cost about $127 million and operators are hoping to attract some 1 million guests over the next year.
Last year, Phuket became the first region in the country to offer quarantine-free holidays again. Since then, the number of visitors has steadily increased.
According to Phuket's tourism authority, some 3,000 to 5,000 tourists currently arrive on Thailand's largest island every day, with the industry hoping for 9,000 daily arrivals in the last quarter of 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs, took to Twitter to single out Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as the cause of delay for a $40 billion aid package to assist his country against the Russian invasion.
"We could have already started using the U.S. assistance package to more effectively save lives of Ukrainians who defend the democratic world," wrote Kuleba, noting that President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, and senators from both parties are all in favor of the assistance.
Paul alone, he wrote, has "delayed so much needed support."

We could have already started using the new U.S. assistance package to more effectively save lives of Ukrainians who defend the democratic world. @POTUS, @SecBlinken, @SenateGOP, @SenateDems and American people were in strong support, and @RandPaul delayed so much needed support.

The Ukrainian package, which provides both military and humanitarian aid along with $5 billion to address global food shortages caused by the disruption of Ukrainian agriculture, passed the House with broad bipartisan support, with only a handful of Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) opposing the deal.

In the Senate, however, a single senator can prevent unanimous consent to pass a bill, forcing it to go through a longer process to achieve passage.
Paul has been accused by experts of echoing Kremlin propaganda in his description of the invasion going on in Ukraine, including his suggestion that Russia is justified in acting to prevent the expansion of the NATO alliance and the territory Russia is invading is historically "part of Russia."]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-12T23:15:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, TechCrunch reported that Congress is asking major social media platforms to archive content showing evidence of Russian war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.
Four representatives sent letters making the request to Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.
"As TikTok booms in popularity and surpasses 1 billion users, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too," reported Amanda Silberling. "These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable."

"In particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes," said the report.
The Russian army has been accused of repeated war crimes as part of the Ukraine invasion, from the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol to the butchering of unarmed civilians in Bucha.
Russia has denied all accusations, claiming that they are only going after military targets and sticking to their discredited story they are trying to "denazify" the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a segment on CNN this Thursday, the panel discussed the day's news regarding the Jan. 6 committee's subpoenas of five House Republicans. According to CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger, one of the lawmakers subpoenaed, Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, "might actually be willing to testify." 
According to Borger, Brooks spoke at the infamous "Stop the Steal" rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot, only to later be passed over by former President Donald Trump for an endorsement in his reelection race. 
Borger also pointed out that Brooks has already publicly revealed that Trump asked him to help "rescind" the 2020 election. 
"If he's already said it publicly, why not say it to the committee?" Borger said.

Opposition parties have demanded more transparency over the role Johnson played in appointing his friend Lebedev -- whose father was a KGB officer -- to the House of Lords.
MPs earlier this year approved a motion seeking to force ministers to release sensitive documents related to the nomination to the upper house of parliament.
