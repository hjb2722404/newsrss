        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia and India have a rich and shared history, underpinned by strong higher education and research links – opening an opportunity to grow trade relationships through education, particularly post-pandemic. 

Universities Australia CEO Catriona Jackson says it's a time of “real opportunity” to boost the “already really strong and deep ties” between the countries. 

“At the moment, there are an enormous number of Australians travelling to India and same the way back,” she told Sky News Australia. 

“We had the Indian Education Minister in Australia very recently.

“Many very senior Indians are coming to Australia to have increasing conversations about really rocket-fuelling the relationship, and we can see all sorts of benefits.”]]></summary>

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's profile pages were relegated to the bottom of the Royal Family's list.

The website ranks the senior working family first, such as King Charles III, Queen Consort Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales.

Next are the other minor working members of the Royal Family, such as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.

Beneath all of them are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who only sit above the embattled Duke of York – Prince Andrew.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Voting has ended in so-called referendums on whether or not to join Russia in four occupied regions of Ukraine. 

Preliminary results have already been released by Russian state media, which report around 90 per cent of votes counted so far are in favour of joining. 

The referendums have been widely dismissed as a “sham”. 

The Governor of one of the regions said the referendums could raise the risk of Moscow using nuclear weapons against Ukrainian forces. 

“We need to be ready. And Russia needs to understand such a step would plunge them into an abyss before they even acted,” Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. 

“Russians have a choice: either come here to the territory of Ukraine and not return alive, come back with bits of your body missing or be imprisoned or rise up against the regime on the ground in Russia.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was mocked for her "word salad" answer to a question from Fox News' Peter Doocy on rising crime in the country.

Reporter Peter Doocy questioned the press secretary on what President Biden thinks of rising crime statistics impacting major cities in the last year.

"Does President Biden think America's big cities are safe?" Mr Doocy asked.

"It is not a yes or no question. It is very much a question of what has he done…to make sure that cities…have the funding and have what they need to protect their community, and that is what the president has done," Ms Jean-Pierre responded.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Jean-Pierre for avoiding the question, and claimed she portrays Biden’s America as a “Mythical Place.”]]></summary>

Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, condemned Iran’s disproportionate use of force and said all options would be on the table at the next meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers. 
The main options are helping to prevent the internet being shut by Iran, and further economic sanctions. 
Demonstrators at the street protests – now in their 10th day – have also called for greater support from the west, as well as help in communicating with the outside world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: For the first time in 30 years, Asia’s developing economies are set to grow faster than China’s, ADB says 
* The Asian Development Bank now sees growth among emerging Asian economies of 4.3% in 2022 and 4.9% in 2023. 
* The ADB expects the rest of developing Asia excluding China to grow by 5.3% in both 2022 and 2023, while it now expects China to grow by 3.3% in 2022, lower than revised forecasts released in July. 
* This will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the report said. 
Asia’s developing economies may be showing signs of recovery, but the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cut its growth forecasts for them yet again — thanks to China’s prolonged zero-Covid policy. 
But this will be the first time in more than three decades that the rest of developing Asia will grow faster than China, the Manila-based lender said in its latest outlook report released Wednesday. 
“The last time was in 1990, when (China’s) growth slowed to 3.9% while GDP in the rest of the region expanded by 6.9%,” it said. 
The ADB now expects developing Asia — excluding China — to grow by 5.3% in 2022, and China by 3.3% in the same year.

Politico:  ECB’s Lagarde expects technical recession this winter 
Central Bank estimates currently predict euro area growth to remain positive in 2023, albeit low at 0.9 percent.  The European Central Bank expects the euro area economy to contract in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter next year, its president said Monday. 
That fits the definition of a technical recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. 
"It is difficult to predict what the real outcome will be in 2023 but it will certainly be a difficult year of which the first quarter will most likely be negative, as we believe the last quarter of 2022 will likely be negative as well," ECB President Christine Lagarde told the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

Update #1: Europe's outlook 'darkening,' ECB head hedges on recession (AP) 
Update #2: EU central bank warns ‘outlook is darkening’ (RT)   
WNU Editor: ECB President Christine Lagarde blames Russia for this economic crisis, even though it is the EU that imposed sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine thereby precipitating the current economic crisis not the otherway around. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde is also predicting a short technical recession. 
I disagree. 
Europe's access to cheap and reliable energy from Russia has now come to an end. What this means is that Europe's business model, based on cheap energy, is now broken.
For the people in Europe this means expensive energy alternatives and supplies, the closure of businesses that are dependent on reliable and affordable energy, and the departure of businesses to other more affordable energy producing countries. 
Europe is not facing a short recession this winter. Europe is already in a recession, and it is going to get worse.]]></summary>

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz secured just one shipment of liquefied natural gas from the United Arab Emirates, with a non-binding agreement for more, as Europe’s biggest economy struggles to replace Russian supplies. 
The cargo -- 137,000 cubic meters -- will be delivered by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to German utility RWE AG by early 2023. ADNOC also signed a memorandum of understanding to make more deliveries next year. An ensuing trip to Qatar didn’t immediately yield any more deals. 
Securing additional supplies is crucial for Germany after the Kremlin shut down a key pipeline. Officials have grown increasingly concerned about blackouts and rationing this winter, and the economy is hurtling toward a recession. The deal announced Sunday shows how difficult it will be for the country to get more gas in the near-term.

By all indications, the barge's main purpose is to support countermeasure and electronic warfare and related test and training activities, which could also support the development of new and improved weapons, sensors, and countermeasures. In some ways, it looks similar to decoy target barges that were used by Russia in efforts to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge in Crimea earlier this year.

WNU Editor: It looks like the Chinese are conducting exercises in countermeasures and electronic warfare. And this barge does have similarities to a barge that the Russian navy has deployed around the Kerch Strait Bridge to protect it from Ukrainian missile attacks (see image below).

Xi Jinping must make his move within a generation, before a growing India, climate change-induced ecological costs, demographic weakness, or even further political liberalization in China put Taiwan beyond reach. 
The policy of strategic ambiguity maintained by the United States vis-à-vis the status of Taiwan is an absurdity that has lost its initially intended purpose of drawing Communist China away from the Soviet Union. It is not a subtle declaration, as its proponents in the U.S. government claim, intended to preserve peace because it appeals to some imagined political equilibrium. Taiwan has all of the desirable properties of a country that deserves the close protection of allies: it is a very liberal democracy, a key component of the world’s economic system, and a geostrategic cork against Communist China’s easy access to the Pacific Ocean.

WNU Editor: I know among my friends in China they have a different point of view. That time is on China's side when it comes to Taiwan. And I can understand this logic. 
Public opinion polls in Taiwan have always shown a certain level of support for closer ties, even reunification, with China .... Taiwan Opinion Polling on Unification with China (Jamestown /Foundation). As China continues to grow in influence and power, coupled with a more stable geopolitical environment, I can see a scenario where both countries will develop closer ties without Chinese military threats and coercion. It will take, but the Chinese are always looking at the long game.]]></summary>

CNN: US Navy sends its most advanced surface warship to east Asia  
Seoul, South Korea CNN  — The US Navy’s most advanced surface warship is showing its stealthy profile in the western Pacific on a mission that may set the stage for the eventual deployment of US hypersonic missiles to the region. 
The USS Zumwalt is the first in a class of three multimission guided missile destroyers the Navy says will “create a new level of battlespace complexity for potential adversaries.” 
In the Pacific, one of those potential adversaries is obviously China, and the Zumwalt will certainly get Beijing’s attention. 
“The presence of a stealth warship will draw a great deal of (Chinese) interest,” especially if the Zumwalt is outfitted with hypersonic weapons, said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.

WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. Once it arrives in East Asia the Chinese are going to be watching this warship very closely.

As for the U.S.. While imports are now cheaper, their exports are being priced out of the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mermaid Inn, a perennially popular restaurant at 570 Amsterdam Ave.  for 15 years, will close on October 16.  Owners Danny Abrams and Cindy Smith said they had mutually agreed with the building’s new owners, a local partnership, to terminate their lease on the soon-to-expire New England-style seafood spot.
“We’re both very sad,” Smith said of her and Abrams after breaking the news to 90 employees.
Their new owner has unknown plans for the building and, “We didn’t want to have a restaurant surrounded by scaffolding,” Smith said.
But mermaid lovers can also expect a new location nearby, Abrams said. 
“We’re looking at two or three places to move to on the Upper West Side, and hope to be one by late spring or early summer,” he said.
Meanwhile, the duo are set to open a mammoth new Mermaid Inn at 127 W. 43rd Street near Times Square, the former site of HB Burger, where they partnered with Alicart Restaurant Group CEO Jeffrey Bank.
Abrams and Smith said Amsterdam Avenue employees would be offered jobs at the Times Square site.  Only about half of the planned 550 seats will open this fall, with the rest to follow early next year. 
The New England-style seafood spot will seek a new home on the Upper West Side, the owners said.James Keivom
“We haven’t built it yet,” Abrams explained.
This will be their fifth and biggest mermaid.  The oldest, at 96 Second Ave.  city ​​center, only reopened after two-year pandemic.  The others are in Greenwich Village (where it’s called the Mermaid Oyster Bar) and Chelsea.

Unfortunately, the departmental assessment failed to embody more substance than a simple mission statement.
While the Biden administration appears to be taking a “whole-of-government approach” to overseeing the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and its ripple effects on the mainstream economy, they focus primarily on defending against negative events – such as financial crime – and do not facilitate positive events, such as wealth-building opportunities like crypto offers Americans excluded from the mainstream banking system.

In 2013, Kanye defiantly objected to Sway’s insistence that he was distributing his own line rather than working with a conglomerate, shouting, “You don’t have the answers, Sway!”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hilaria Baldwin has given birth to her seventh child with husband Alec Baldwin, she shared a post on instagram Saturday afternoon.  The girl, named Ilaria Catalina Irena, was born on Thursday.
“She’s here! We’re so excited to introduce you to our little dream come true,” she wrote.
Hilaria added that both she and the baby are healthy and happy.

“Her Baldwinito brothers are spending the day bonding and welcoming her into our home,” she wrote.  “Much love to you all. We are so happy to celebrate this wonderful news with you.”


The yoga instructor and actress announced    that she was pregnant in March, calling it a “big surprise”.
“After many ups and downs over the past few years, we have an exciting one and a big surprise: another Baldwinito is coming this fall,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.  “We were sure that our family was complete and we are very happy with this surprise.”


In 2020, the couple welcome  a boy named Edward.  Then, six months later, they announced  the birth of their sixth child via surrogacy, a daughter named Lucia.  Hilaria had already opened up on social media about suffering two miscarriages.
Alec also has a 26-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger.
Hilaria was on a social media break for several weeks before announcing her pregnancy.  She had already moved away from social media last fall, when Alec was holding a gun that dispensed  on the set of the movie “Rust”, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.

There is also a slide with the QAnon slogan “WWG1WGA”, an acronym for “where let’s go one, let’s all go” and a man wearing Trump’s red tie with a “Q” pin in his lapel.

"The largest anti-government protests in Iran since 2009 gathered strength on Saturday, spreading to as many as 80 cities, even as the authorities escalated a crackdown that has reportedly killed dozens of people and brought the arrests of prominent activists and journalists, according to rights groups and news media reports," The New York Times reported. "In many cities, including Tehran, the capital, security forces responded by opening fire on the crowds."
State media is reporting 35 fatalities.

		It is also attracting criticism from the Kremlin's own official supporters, something almost unheard of in Russia since the invasion began.
	

		"It has been announced that privates can be recruited up to the age of 35. Summonses are going to 40-year-olds," the RT editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, railed on her Telegram channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Saturday criticised a U.S. move to make exceptions to sanctions in order to help provide internet to Iranians during nationwide protests, state media reported.
It said this was in line with Washington's hostile stance towards Tehran.
"By reducing the severity of a number of communications sanctions - while maintaining maximum pressure - the U.S. is seeking to advance its goals against Iran," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying.

		The brass lettering on the stone reads "George VI 1895-1952 / Elizabeth 1900-2002" on the top two lines, followed by a garter star and then "Elizabeth II 1926-2022 / Philip 1921-2021" on the bottom two lines.
	

		Queen Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, is also interred at the chapel, at Windsor Castle west of London.
	

		Elizabeth died on Sept. 8 at Balmoral Castle, her summer home in the Scottish highlands, after 70 years on the throne. Her son Charles has become king.

It's also a story that gets pretty deep in the weeds and one that bumps up against a basic reality: Although many millions of viewers watch the Summer and Winter Olympics and debate the internal or international drama hyped up by multibillion-dollar broadcast rights holder NBC, very few of them know or care anything about USOC's lords of the rings or their apparatchiks' day-to-day operations, far from the flag-waving captured on TV.

Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), called it a "heart-wrenching tragedy".
At least 14 people rescued were recovering in hospitals in Syria while six others were discharged, as search efforts continued, with several people still missing since the boat sank on Thursday.
"There are 89 victims, while 14 people are receiving treatment at Al-Basel Hospital, two of whom are in intensive care," Syria's official news agency SANA reported, quoting Iskandar Ammar, a hospital official.

A dozen teenagers and young adults gather around instructor Alex Flaherty. They don't want to miss any of the traditional hunter's precise gestures as he carves a fish or lights a fire.
"Our culture has changed so much in the last 50 years when people used to live in igloos... the change is happening so fast, (and) we are losing our culture," he tells AFP.
Flaherty blames the societal shifts for a series of social ills such as violent crime, substance abuse and a high rate of suicide.

Angry demonstrators have taken to the streets of major cities across Iran, including the capital Tehran, for eight straight nights since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.
The Kurdish woman was pronounced dead after spending three days in a coma following her arrest by Iran's feared morality police for wearing the hijab headscarf in an "improper" way.
"The number of people who died in recent riots in the country has risen to 35," state media said, raising the official toll from at least 17 dead, including five security personnel.

"Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction," Putin said, adding: "This is not a bluff."
However analysts aren't convinced the Russian president is willing to be the first to unleash nuclear weapons since the US bombed Japan in 1945.
AFP spoke with several experts and officials about the possible scenarios that could arise should Russia carry out a nuclear attack.

		China's foreign ministry, in a statement on the meeting, said the United States was sending "very wrong, dangerous signals" on Taiwan, and the more rampant Taiwan's independence activity, the less likely there would be a peaceful settlement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had downed four Iranian-made "kamikaze" unmanned aerial vehicles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain Tehran was harming Ukrainian sovereignty and its citizens.
	

		Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied.
	

		"Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran," said a statement on the foreign ministry's website.
	

		"In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv."
	

		The message was handed to the acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
	

		Military authorities in southern Ukraine said in a statement they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the port of Odesa.
	

		Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who has fled his home country of Russia this week delivered a scathing portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership in an interview with The Atlantic.
The man in question, a 38-year-old IT manager named Anton Shalaev, escaped from Russia this week to the Armenian capitol of Yerevan, which is one of the few places that will still allow Russians into the country.
When asked specifically about Putin's decision making during the war, Shalaev did not hesitate to slam the man who has led his homeland for more than two decades.
"A few old men and an army of zombies are leading us to hell," he said. "I say that because people around me in Russia behaved as if they had been bitten by a zombie, dragging my entire country into a dreadful war. All I saw was Russian loser husbands beating their wives, while the entire rotting house of the state system has turned my people into an army of the dead."
IN OTHER NEWS: Insiders fear Letitia James is set to inflict 'the biggest political damage' to Trump with GOP voters: report
To put a fine point on it, Shalaev added, "They are my enemies."
Shalaev also had some unkind words for Russian state media operations.
"Russian propaganda is a weapon, and the bastards working there are war criminals," he said. "The greatest guilt in this entire tragedy belongs to a small bunch of old men at the top: KGB officers."
Various media outlets have reported that many Russian men of military age have been trying to escape the country even since Putin called for a mobilization earlier this week to rescue his war in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One viral video on Twitter says it all about Iranian protesters’ defiance of the “morality police”: a young woman throws her veil into a bonfire and dances.


	The official death toll from popular unrest in Iran shot up to 17 on Thursday as Raisi vowed that Amini’s death would be investigated. She died in a Tehran hospital on September 16 after falling into a coma following her arrest by the “morality police” which enforces the wearing of the veil.


Women are compelled to cover their hair in public in Iran, which as a Shiite theocratic state follows a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The morality police – officially known as the Gasht-e Ershad; or “guidance patrol” – are responsible for enforcing this dress code.
But the law does not precisely define the “correct” way to wear the veil…]]></summary>

The demonstrations followed the strongest warning from the authorities yet when the army told Iranians it would confront "the enemies" behind the unrest - a move that could signal the kind of crackdown that has crushed protests in the past.
Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as "Israel's soldiers", live state television coverage showed. They also shouted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel", common slogans the country's clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hilary Mantel, the first British novelist to win the Booker Prize twice and who sold millions of books around the world, has died aged 70, her publishers announced on Friday.
"We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel, and our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald," 4th Estate Books said.
"This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work," it added, providing no other details.
Mantel won the Booker Prize for "Wolf Hall" (2009) and "Bring Up the Bodies" (2012) and had been tipped to win again in 2020 with "The Mirror & The Light," the third in the trilogy.
The Wolf Hall Trilogy has so far been translated into 41 languages with worldwide sales of more than five million.

Fewer than 10 of the shiny black mammals are still alive on Ocean Beach, in remote western Tasmania, state wildlife services said.
About 30 of the animals were released into the ocean on Thursday, but some had beached themselves again, said Brendon Clark, incident controller with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.
Under cool drizzle, marine wildlife experts began to wrap up a complex days-long rescue operation that started with a large pod of the animals, which are part of the dolphin family, stranding on the beach mid-week.

The official death toll rose to at least 17 on Thursday, including five security personnel, but the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said its sources put the figure much higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pfizer said it agreed to reduce the number of doses it will deliver by year end to 600 million, down from the billion-dose commitment the U.S. government made a year ago.
	

		The United States will have an option to buy up to an additional 400 million shots for the program after this year.
	

		The drugmaker said it would have sufficient supply to deliver the full billion doses under the U.S. commitment, but "we are seeing reduced demand in some low- and lower-middle-income countries due to barriers in administration and vaccine hesitancy."
	

		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.
	

		Pfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.
	

		The vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world's poorer countries.
	

		The program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.
	

		COVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.

Nuclear threat

		The integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.
	

		After the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use "all means" to protect its territory.
	

		Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included "strategic nuclear weapons". He predicted the voting regions "will integrate into Russia".
	

		For most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.
	

		The referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.
	

		Election officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.]]></summary>
