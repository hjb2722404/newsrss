“The jury has to at trial believe what Michael Cohen has to say beyond reasonable doubt,” she told Sky News Australia.

“This is an individual that has been convicted of a crime – not just any crime, but one crime that involved lying.

“That’s going to be a big issue when it comes to cross-examination which I can only imagine how vigorous it would be.”]]></summary>

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is poised to meet with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday – a historic event that comes amid warnings from China. The California Republican’s office shared details of the meeting in a release Monday morning. 
The release states that McCarthy will host a bipartisan meeting with Tsai at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. 
The meeting has been long anticipated and is all-but-guaranteed to rattle the tense relationship between the US and China, which became even more fraught after a Chinese spy balloon floated over North America and was then shot down by US fighter jets in February.

And it will inform her decisions as she guides the school, which was founded in 2019, into a post-pandemic era which promises new opportunities for sports, drama, volunteering, group projects, team competitions and international exchanges.  “We aim to lay a very strong foundation, and that starts in the kindergarten and primary years,” says Woo, noting that Invictus offers a “through-train” system taking children all the way up to Year 13 in secondary. “We follow a spiral curriculum which progressively adds breadth and depth and is also in line with the school’s objective of providing a quality, affordable education which sets high standards and lets students explore their potential.”    There are two main campuses, with kindergarten and primary classes in Tseung Kwan O and secondary in Chai Wan, where pupils do IGCSEs and A-Levels, using the Cambridge programme.

Itamar Ben-Gvir says force will focus on Arab unrest as police chief voices concerns and opposition figures denounce it as ‘militia’ 
Israel’s government has authorised the establishment of a national guard proposed by the far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who said it would focus on Arab unrest, as political rivals accused him of setting up a sectarian “militia”. 
The previous government had begun moves to set up an auxiliary police force to tackle internal political violence after pro-Palestinian protests in mixed Jewish-Arab areas during the Israel-Gaza conflict in May 2021. However, that government ended before the force was finalised.

Thaci and three other top members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) rebel group all denied 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity as they appeared at a special tribunal in The Hague.

Montenegro's long-standing leader Milo Djukanovic has suffered a resounding presidential election defeat. 
The 36-year-old centrist former economy minister, Jakov Milatovic, declared victory on Sunday evening after the presidential run-off. 
He will take over from Mr Djukanovic, who has held power as president or prime minister in Montenegro for over three decades. 
Snap parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in the summer.

"Tonight is the night we have been awaiting for over 30 years.

He promised to lead his small Balkan nation into the European Union within the next five years.

WNU Editor: I have lost count in the past year on the number of European governments that have been defeated in elections. Milo Djukanovic has been President/Prime Minister of Montenegro for the past 30+ years, and his defeat is just another sign that Europeans want new leadership and a new direction for Europe.

        <updated>2023-04-03T12:37:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of top-secret government documents is heating up, as Fox News' Bret Baier is reporting that special counsel Jack Smith has now subpoenaed members of Trump's Secret Service entourage.
"FOX News is told multiple U.S. Secret Service agents connected to Former President Donald Trump have been subpoenaed & are expected to testify before the D.C. grand jury likely on Friday," Baier reports. "The grand jury appearances are related to the Special Counsel Jack Smith probe into the handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago."
It is not known what the Secret Service members will be asked, although they may have been direct witnesses in seeing how Trump decided to respond to a government subpoena requesting he return all documents with classified markings in his possession to the government.
Investigators on Smith's team have reportedly amassed evidence that Trump deliberately tried to hang onto certain classified documents requested by the government after receiving a formal subpoena, as they believe that he ordered some boxes of documents to be removed from a secure storage area to other locations once he learned the government wanted them back.

In fact, prosecutors' evidence appears to be so strong that it convinced a judge last month to pierce attorney-client privilege after determining it was more likely than not that the former president had used conversations with attorney Evan Corcoran in the furtherance of a crime.]]></summary>

DW: Japan and China's foreign ministers discuss disputes 
Japan's foreign minister met his Chinese counterpart in Beijing and openly talked about disputes between their countries. The two Asian powers are seeking common ground amid rising tensions in the region. 
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi had a frank meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang in Beijing on Sunday. 
It is the first visit by a Japanese foreign minister to China in more than three years, and comes just days after Tokyo announced plans to restrict some computer chip-making exports. 
"The United States used bullying tactics to brutally suppress the Japanese semiconductor industry, and now it is repeating its old tricks against China," Qin told his counterpart, according to a readout of the meeting. 
He also accused Japan of being Washington's "minion."

Now these ancient tales are being reinvigorated through online platforms like YouTube, TikTok, WhatsApp and even delivery app Grab.

Russian authorities have claimed that Ukraine was behind the St. Petersburg café bombing 
The explosion that killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a St. Petersburg café was a terrorist attack, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. 
His statement came after Russian authorities accused Ukraine of orchestrating the blast.

Update #2: Kiev Regime Has Been Targeting People Since 2014, May Very Well Be Behind Tatarsky's Murder: Kremlin (Sputnik)

 
WNU Editor: By classifying this attack as a terrorist attack I expect in the coming days new laws that will permit Russia's security forces to now specifically target certain Ukrainian government officials and organizations/its special forces/as well as its intelligence services.

 
Update #3: Russian authorities are also blaming some members of opposition leader Navalny's organization for being involved in this attack .... Tatarsky’s murder plotted by Ukrainian intel services, involved Navalny’s firm — officials (TASS).]]></summary>

New York Times: Inside Saudi Arabia’s Global Push for Nuclear Power 
For years, Saudi Arabia has pressed the United States to help it develop a nuclear energy program, as Saudi leaders look beyond oil to power their country. 
But talks about a nuclear partnership have dragged on, largely because the Saudi government refuses to agree to conditions that are intended to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons or helping other nations do so, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions. 
Frustrated Saudi officials are now exploring options to work with other countries, including China, Russia or a U.S. ally.

A pro-Western coalition and Boyko Borissov’s GERB were neck and neck. 
No clear winner emerged in Bulgaria’s election on Sunday night, much to the dismay of voters who have been to the polls five times in the last two years. 
In the first release of results, it seemed that the pro-Western coalition, Continuing the Change and Democratic Bulgaria, had won a narrow majority with 26.4 percent, beating the center-right establishment party, GERB, which scored 25.5 percent. But in a recount, the former scored 24.8 percent while the latter secured the lead with 25.9 percent. 
Observers expect a clear winner to emerge by Monday after all international voters’ ballots are counted.

RT:  Russia makes payment on sovereign debt

 
According to the country’s settlement depository, Moscow fulfilled its obligations on Friday  
Russia’s Finance Ministry announced on Friday it has settled two issues of dollar-denominated Eurobonds “in full” by sending 17 billion rubles ($221.1 million) in coupon payments to the National Settlement Depository (NSD). 
According to the ministry, the payments were on Eurobonds maturing in 2030. 
“Thus, obligations on servicing the state securities of the Russian Federation were fulfilled by the Finance Ministry in full,” the statement said.

WNU Editor: Russia's current foreign currency reserves are around $580 billion (link here). That is more than enough to cover debt payments for the foreseeable future. 

  
  In the meantime, the current media narrative is that Russia's economy is on the verge of collapse .... Putin’s Russia Is Going Broke Fast. Here’s Why. (New Republic). 
On a side note. I asked one of my closest contacts (she is a senior executive at UBS and a good friend) on what would be the consequences to the Western banking system in its current fragile state if Russia defaults on its debt obligations. 
Her answer was .... we would immediately find ourselves in a financial/banking crisis. 
Wow!
I guess that explains why all the talk in 2022 from Western governments and its leaders to force Russia into default has all but disappeared since the start of the current banking crisis with the collapse of Credit Suisse and a number of major US banks.]]></summary>

FOX News: Japan buys Russian oil above $60-a-barrel cap, breaking with US allies: report 
Japan has almost no fossil fuels of its own, relies heavily on imports for much of its energy needs

I personally thought just a few hours ago that it would take a few months before the Western cap on Russian oil prices would collapse. I was wrong. It just took one day.]]></summary>

Finland's 'Party Prime Minister' Sanna Marin has lost lost her bid for a second term - as a right-wing coalition claims victory over her Social Democrats in an extremely tight general election. 
Marin, who made global headlines after she was seen dancing wildly in leaked videos, became the world's youngest prime minister in 2019 at age 34 and had been fighting for a second term just days before Finland's historic accession to the NATO defence alliance. 
But her party has lost out to two conservative parties in an extremely tight three-way race for control of parliament.

WNU Editor: Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin 's party was re-soundly defeated in this election, and only days before Finland is to be formally accepted by NATO. Her defeat also continues the Zelensky curse. The EU political leaders who support Ukraine President Zelensky seem to have a history of getting defeated in the next election.

EurAsian Times: 50,000 North Korean Commandos Prepare To Join Russia’s Special Military Ops In Ukraine – Military Correspondent 
North Korea is preparing to send 500,000 soldiers from its armed forces on combat missions in support of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, a Russian state TV war correspondent has claimed. 
In his youtube video, Aleksander Sladkov, a seasoned Russian journalist specializing in military affairs, claimed that North Korea is firmly aligned with Russia in the ongoing conflict. 
He further added that Pyongyang is willing to contribute to the effort by dispatching its troops to take part in the special military operation – a term commonly used by Moscow instead of referring to the conflict as a war with Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Maytaal Angel
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul showed no sign of abating on Saturday, despite its suspension by the embattled premier this week, as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand it be scrapped entirely.
Beset by the domestic upheaval and expressions of concern and disapproval in Washington, Netanyahu on Monday paused the overhaul to allow negotiations on a compromise between his religious-nationalist coalition and opposition parties.
"We don’t believe anything that comes out of Bibi's (Netanyahu) mouth. We believe it’s just a political stunt aimed at stopping the protest," said Emanuel Keller, 30, at a protest outside the Israeli presidential residence hosting the talks.
One of the main points of contention is the ruling coalition's push for more power in appointing judges, including to the Supreme Court.
Critics see the government's drive as a threat to the court's independence and an attempt at a legal coup. Proponents say it is seeking a less elitist, interventionist bench.
Netanyahu, on trial on corruption charges he denies, says reforms are needed to balance the branches of government. His Likud party and political allies in the far-right have been calling on their political base to stage counter demonstrations.
Israeli media estimated more than 150,000 people attended anti-government protests nationwide on Saturday, the largest in commercial hub Tel Aviv.
"We're going to win because this is not something that we can live with. We cannot live in a state that is not democratic," said Limor Moyal, at the Tel Aviv demonstration.

The Cradle: BRICS nations working on ‘fundamentally new currency’: Russian official 
The US dollar's hegemony in international markets continues to deteriorate partly due to the Global South's refusal to enforce western sanctions against Russia 
The Deputy Chairman of Russia’s State Duma, Alexander Babakov, said on 30 March that the BRICS bloc of emerging economies – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – is working on developing a “new currency” that will be presented at the organization’s upcoming summit in Durban. 
“The transition to settlements in national currencies is the first step. The next one is to provide the circulation of digital or any other form of a fundamentally new currency in the nearest future. I think that at the BRICS [leaders’ summit], the readiness to realize this project will be announced, such works are underway,” Babakov said on the sidelines of the Russian-Indian Strategic Partnership for Development and Growth Business Forum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Almost a third of Brazilians disapprove of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, putting the leftist leader at about the same level of unpopularity as his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro during the first three months of his presidency, a poll cited by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo showed on Saturday.
Lula, who took office in January after narrowly defeating Bolsonaro in an election last October, has the approval of 38% of Brazilians, with 29% disapproving of his performance, according to a Datafolha survey.
Bolsonaro, who served as president from 2019 to the end of 2022, never formally conceded defeat to Lula. On Jan. 8, barely a week after Lula began his third term as president, Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the federal capital Brasilia to protest the election result.
After about three months in self-imposed exile in the United States, Bolsonaro returned to Brazil this week.
Datafolha interviewed 2,028 people on Wednesday and Thursday in 126 cities. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus two percentage points.

Schwarzman, whose company manages $975 billion worth of assets, added that the current banking turmoil was unlike a “conventional crisis.” In SVB’s case, rather than holding risky assets, they had an imbalance of otherwise very secure bond assets that matured on a longer timeline.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
