Modified: 09/09/2022 11:05:16 AM



There is ongoing discussion and analysis of the ex-president’s removal of classified White House documents from the media.  Although the actions of the ex-president are problematic, they are not surprising.  However, shouldn’t the bigger story, and the outrage, be how these documents were able to leave the White House in the first place?
In most workplaces, when a disgruntled employee is fired, they are told to collect their belongings under the supervision of a security guard and then escort them out of the building.  The ex-president was ousted by the American people in November 2020, and he was clearly unhappy, denying the election results and promoting plans to prevent the peaceful transition of power.  So how is it that as a private citizen, the ex-president left the White House with boxes of documents belonging to the American people?  What systems or people did we have in place to prevent this from happening?  How have these systems/people let us down?
Investigations are underway to assess the impact of the actions of the former president on national security.  However, some impacts are already known.  Our allies will think twice about sharing information with us now that they know we cannot keep confidential documents secure.  Significant damage has been done regardless of what the recently recovered boxes contain.
I’m not a fan of the former president and I understand the political motivation of the left wing media to focus on the culpability of the former president, but we can’t ignore the national security failure that has happened. product.  This should be the main story.

Ukraine’s quick action to reclaim Russian-occupied areas in the northeastern Kharkiv region forced Moscow to withdraw its troops to avoid being surrounded and leave behind significant numbers of weapons and ammunition in a hasty retreat as the war marked 200 days in Sunday. 
Overjoyed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mocked the Russians in a video speech on Saturday, saying that “the Russian army these days is demonstrating the best it can do – showing its back.”

The Guardian: The super-rich ‘preppers’ planning to save themselves from the apocalypse  
Tech billionaires are buying up luxurious bunkers and hiring military security to survive a societal collapse they helped create, but like everything they do, it has unintended consequences

* The day after the attacks, newspapers around the world reacted by capturing the sadness, shock, and horror people felt.
* We compiled front pages from American and international newspapers to show what people woke up to on September 12, 2001.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks happened exactly 17 years ago Tuesday.
For many people, the attacks were the biggest news story of their lifetime. Almost all who experienced it can remember where they were when they heard of the attacks.
Many people who remember that day also recall the following morning, when newspapers around the world captured the horror, shock, and sadness people felt.
The Newseum, a museum in Washington, DC, that chronicles the history of media, archived more than 100 newspapers from September 12, 2001, the day after the attacks. The front pages of these newspapers, bearing headlines like "ACT OF WAR" and "AMERICA'S DARKEST DAY," underscore the impact the attacks had on the American psyche.
Here is what newspapers looked like the day after September 11, 2001.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JAKARTA (Reuters) -About 200 people evacuated to higher ground after an earthquake of magnitude 6.1 struck islands in western Indonesia on Sunday, causing some property damage, the country's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said.
The quake in the Mentawai Islands west of Sumatra struck at a depth of 27 km (17 miles) and was followed by one of magnitude 5.3 in the same area, authorities said. There was no danger of tsunami.
One person was injured in the head by falling wood, and a school and health centre were among properties slightly damaged, the disaster agency said.
Mentawai resident Nurjuli Hasanah told Reuters the quake felt strong and shook her wooden house. "Some of (the residents) are still in an evacuation shelter and some have gone back home,” she said.
Also on Sunday, east of the vast Indonesian archipelago, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the Eastern New Guinea region in Papua New Guinea, reportedly damaging property and spreading panic among residents.
Indonesia straddles the "Pacific Ring of Fire", where different tectonic plates of the Earth's crust meet and create frequent seismic activity.

		Poilievre defeated his main competitor Jean Charest, a former Quebec premier, and three others in a campaign that blasted Trudeau and the central bank governor for failing to rein in spiking inflation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge: On September 11, the war between Ukraine and Russia will have been going on for 200 days. 
The latter launched its offensive on February 24 after months of amassing troops at the Ukrainian border, attacking the former on several fronts from the North, East and Southeast. 
While it looked like Russia would emerge as a winner in the conflict initially, Ukraine managed to defend several strategic locations. 
As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below, based on monthly polls by YouGov and The Economist, Americans even thought Ukraine had better chances to win the war than Russia in April and May.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised that the consensus is growing in the U.S. that this is going to be a long war. I know among all of my friends and family members in both Ukraine and Russia there is a resignation that this war is going to go into 2023 and maybe even into 2024. 
As to what is my take. I can now easily see this war going into 2024. 
As to how will it end? 
As I have mentioned before, I believe it will end when European governments, tired of the enormous cost in supporting Kyiv in this conflict, will say "enough is enough" and tell Zelensky to make a deal with Putin or they will cut off aid. We are already seeing EU states slow walking aid to Ukraine, aid that was promised months ago .... EU finance ministers back next $5 billion loan to Ukraine (Reuters). More here ....

The Guardian: Ukraine’s southern offensive ‘was designed to trick Russia’ 
Exclusive: Russian forces wrong-footed by attack in Kharkiv region after preparing for offensive in the south 
The much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces have said. 
Ukrainian forces are continuing to make unexpected, rapid advances in the north-east of the country, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region in three days. Much of Ukraine’s territorial gains were confirmed by Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday. 
“[It] was a big special disinformation operation,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: This is what happens when a front line collapses. And while I am sure that Ukraine has lost a lot of soldiers in their Kharkiv counter-attack, they have gained significant territory and they now have the military momentum in this part of the war. 
Reaction to this defeat on Russian social media has been predictable and quite a sight to see today. Criticism of President Putin and the Generals who are responsible for the war have been widespread and brutal. I am sure Putin is now feeling the pressure to change his military strategy from a "special operation" to something that is more significant. 

The next few days are going to be critical. The Russian Ministry of Defense clearly underestimated this Ukraine counter-offensive, and they are now deploying heavy reinforcements to blunt it. But this takes time, and for now Ukraine will take advantage of their momentum. 
The big surprise (for me) in this counter-offensive are the actual low number of soldiers that are involved (for now). At the beginning of the Kharkiv counter-offensive Ukraine deployed anywhere from 9,000 - 15,000 soldiers. And on the Russian side it was mostly Donbas militia numbering only a few thousand mixed with a few thousand regular Russian forces to face the Ukrainians. 
On a thousand mile long front there are always going to be gaps and weaknesses, and in this case the Ukraine military saw an opportunity and they took it.  The big question that needs to be answered is .... can Ukraine keep this territory that they have recaptured? 
I say this because a few months ago Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to the north of Kharkiv and they were very successful. Even reaching the border of Russia, albeit briefly. But within a few weeks they were driven back to their original positions, experiencing heavy casualties. 
Will history repeat itself? We shall see.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) -Prince Harry and his wife Meghan joined Prince William and wife Kate to look at the tributes and flowers left outside Windsor Castle on Saturday following the death of Queen Elizabeth.
Relations have been strained between the two sons of Britain's new king after Harry and Meghan moved to the United States and the four had not been seen so closely together since.
William's spokesman said he had invited Harry and Meghan, officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to join him and Kate as they examined the flowers and spoke to crowds lining the entrance to Windsor Castle.
The sight of the two couples together will raise hopes that there has been a rapprochement following the death of Britain's longest-reigning monarch.
William was heard telling one well-wisher that the days following the queen's death had been "so surreal".
"We all thought she was invincible," he said.

"How about we talk a little bit more about colonialism," he began. "The first Elizabethan era ended when Queen Elizabeth the First died in 1603. Her 45 year reign was, quote, 'a golden age,' though I guess that depends on your perspective which marked England's emergence as an ambitious and ruthless global power."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tower House on the Upper East Side is listed for $2.3 million, The Post has learned. 
Formerly owned by Barbara Corcoran, judge of Shark Tank and founder of the Corcoran Group, the residence worthy of a “superhero lair” is located at 205 East 69th Street. 
Laurin Sydney, former CNN host of “Showbiz Today,” and her husband, Mark Burk, are the current owners of the one-bedroom, one-bathroom duplex.
Designed as ‘a cottage in the sky’, the couple have lived in the house for 25 years, since buying it from Ms Corcoran herself in 1997. 
Billed as a “one-of-a-kind” penthouse, the co-op residence includes a wraparound 1,200 square foot rooftop terrace. 
The Tower House was once owned by Barbara Corcoran.Lifestyle Production Group for CorcoranA view of the vast terrace.

Interior features include pre-war details, a wood burning fireplace, 10 foot ceilings and original cast iron windows.  A custom steel spiral staircase leads up to the bedroom with a 360 degree view of the city.
“Perched atop the Penthouse, this two-story cottage in the sky offers four magical light displays that make you feel like you’ve left New York and stepped into a Parisian dream,” said the list of states. 
The bathroom includes an Amerec cedar sauna, a separate glass tub with a Jacuzzi and a soaking tub.  Meanwhile, bedroom features include custom closets and a hidden TV cabinet.
Building amenities include a 24-hour doorman, supermarket, fitness center, laundry room, and private storage. 
Corcoran agent Steve Gold and his colleague Scott Hernandez of the Corcoran group hold the list.

The testnet allowed Ethereum developers to practice running nodes, deploying contracts, and testing infrastructure, among other features.  Therefore, phantom forks allow developers to assess the implications of network upgrades before they occur.
As part of the upgrade, the community needs to update their Ethereum clients and run the combination of an execution layer and a consensus layer.

CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, Alexander Höptner, emphasized the need to pay special attention when upgrading Ethereum to avoid service interruptions. 
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Höptner explained:

“You just have to, say, be awake and see what’s going on.  There is a chance for high volatility.  And so you need to make sure your services are up and running. […] We don’t expect any major disruptions outside of volatility.  »

The CEO further stated that the success of The Merge will depend on community support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major League Baseball adopted its first field clock, limits on defensive changes and bigger bases for the upcoming season in an effort to shorten games and increase offense in a traditional sport.
The decision on time and shift restrictions by the sport’s 11-man competition committee was made on Friday due to unanimous opposition from the panel’s players, who approved the larger bases.  The changes had long been pushed by baseball commissioner Rob Manfred in an effort to combat the increase in dead time over four decades and the suffocation of offense in the age of analysis.
“Over the past few years’ extensive testing, minor league folks and a wide range of fans – from the most loyal to casual observers – have recognized the collective impact of these changes in making the game even better…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[School districts across the country are struggling with a shortage of teachers – and communities with inaccessible housing are often the hardest hit. 
“There were times when we didn’t have a math teacher or we didn’t have a language teacher,” Megan Carey, principal at Terra Nova High School, located south of San Francisco, told CBS News. 
The reason?  “High cost of living — 100%!”  she said.

Now your school district is trying something new: affordable housing on school property.  It is a 122-unit apartment complex that was approved by local voters and built for faculty and staff on property in the Jefferson Union High School District. 
“It’s very spacious,” said Michaela Ott, who teaches biology at Jefferson High School, which is also in the district.  “Extremely spacious!”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[throughout your life,  Queen Elizabeth II  has always shown his deep involvement in maintaining close relations between the United Kingdom and the United States.
Jane Hartley, the US ambassador to the UK, told CBS Mornings that there was no closer ally to the United States than the Queen herself. 
“I think she loved America, and we loved her. When I arrived, it was just before the platinum jubilee, and I was amazed at the number of people on the street who simply adored her.  And there was a lot of respect.  But there were many, many Americans there,” Hartley said. 

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Queen ordered the Star Spangled Banner to be thrown outside Buckingham Palace as a way of showing solidarity with Americans.
Queen Elizabeth II brought together 13 US presidents in office.  She met a US president in 1951 when she traveled to the US and met then-President Harry Truman. 
Since then, she has ridden horses with then-President Ronald Reagan, watched a Baltimore baseball game with former President George HW Bush and danced with former President Gerald Ford.  
The first time President Biden met the Queen was as a US Senator in 1982.  
The last time I saw her was in Windsor Castle    last year, after the Queen welcomed him and First Lady Jill Biden for tea.
Biden and the First Lady visited the British Embassy in Washington to sign a book of condolences to the Queen.  He commented on her death at a fundraiser. 
“I had the opportunity to get to know her before she passed away and she was an incredibly decent and gracious woman, and the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in their grief,” Biden said.  
The president said he is likely to attend his next funeral.  All flags at US federal and military installations were ordered to fly with half staff in honor of the Queen.

The Republican governor, who is widely believed to be considering a 2024 White House bid, argued in an April motion that the state’s attorney general, another Republican who filed the complaint, had left for political reprisals and should be removed from the complaint.  Noema had pushed former attorney general Jason Ravnsborg    to resign and later for his impeachment for his involvement in a fatal car accident.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, harrowing photographs of Queen Elizabeth II dominated the front pages of grieving British newspapers, charting her journey from coronation to the nation’s matriarch. 
A photo of 27-year-old Elizabeth taken at her coronation in 1953, full of regal splendor clutching the Sovereign’s Orb and Scepter within the vaulted walls of Westminster Abbey, made headlines in The Times, Guardian, Daily Star and Independent. 
The Sun, Daily Telegraph, Daily Express and Daily Mirror instead chose images of the white-haired monarch as she neared the end of her record-breaking 70-year reign. 
The Telegraph published a citation made by the Queen for the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. “Grief is the price we pay for love,” he said. 
Most tabloids marked the occasion with dim black-and-white front pages, although The Sun splashed its header in royal purple, above the headline “We Loved You Lady”.
“Rest in peace, Madame. The Sun and our readers loved you. We are proud that you were our queen,” he added. 
The Daily Express carried the headline ‘Our beloved Queen is dead’, while the Daily Mirror simply wrote ‘Thank you’.
“Our hearts are broken,” said the Daily Mail headline.  “How do we find the words? Our grief is a hundred different emotions, all difficult to grasp,” her homepage said. 
“As God Save the Queen played on radio and television, as we learned that our beloved monarch had died, a nation’s heart broke,” he added.
Unsurprisingly, the story filled the inside pages of souvenir edition newspapers, most devoting at least 20 pages to seismic events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Italy’s Right Set for Crushing Win in Last Polls Before Vote 
(Bloomberg) -- Italy’s right-wing coalition, led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, is poised for a landslide win on Sept. 25, according to the last available polls before a blackout period. 
The bloc has an advantage of almost 20 percentage points on the center-left coalition led by Enrico Letta’s Democratic Party, according to Bloomberg’s latest polling average. 
Such an advantage, thanks to Italy’s complex electoral system, might grant it a two-thirds majority of seats in both houses of parliament, enough to change Italy’s constitution on its own. 
Support for Meloni’s Brothers of Italy has been growing steadily since she took center stage in the campaign. At 45, Meloni, who started her political career in Italy’s post-fascist party, is a political veteran but has almost no government experience. 
As the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, she has vowed to maintain the course set by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi on support for Ukraine and fiscal discipline.

(Bloomberg) -- Sweden is heading for a tight general election on Sunday, with polls showing Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson neck-and-neck with the opposition that’s looking to unseat her Social Democrats. 
The vote comes after a campaign dominated by skyrocketing electricity prices and soaring gun violence that are shaking Swedish society to the core. 
The country, long a bastion of social democracy, has seen its political landscape upended by the nationalist Sweden Democrats over the past years.  The anti-immigration party is a part of the center-right opposition bloc that is seeking four years at the helm of the biggest Nordic country, proposing to reverse a policy of gradually exiting nuclear energy and warning Andersson’s victory could result in higher taxes. 
Still, Andersson could benefit from being seen as a responsible leader in time of crisis.  The results will trickle in on Sunday night and by Monday morning it should be clear whether opposition parties will get a shot at forming a new government.

The Navy says it has more UFO videos. It doesn’t want to share them. 
The U.S. Navy says that releasing any additional UFO videos would “harm national security” and told a government transparency website that all of the government’s UFO videos are classified information. 
In a Freedom of Information Act request response, the Navy told government transparency site The Black Vault that any public dissemination of new UFO videos “will harm national security as it may provide adversaries valuable information regarding Department of Defense/Navy operations, vulnerabilities, and/or capabilities. 
No portions of the videos can be segregated for release.”

A US Air Force Osprey aircraft has been stuck at a remote nature preserve in northern Norway for almost a month, a Norwegian military official said on Thursday. 
The military tiltrotor aircraft, which has the ability to fly like a prop plane or hover like a helicopter, made a "controlled emergency landing" on August 12 at the Stongodden nature preserve on the island of Senja and has been stuck ever since, Lt. Col. Eivind Byre, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Air Force, told Insider. 
Norway's military is working with the US Air Force and local environmental protection officials to craft a plan to rescue the aircraft, Byre said.

President Biden said Friday that he plans to attend the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London later this month — after the White House initially declined to confirm any travel plans. 
“Yes. I don’t know what the details are yet, but I’ll be going,” Biden said in Ohio when asked if he would join the service for the 96-year-old monarch, who died Thursday at her Balmoral estate in Scotland. 
Biden also told reporters that he had not yet spoken to King Charles III, who gained the throne upon the death of his mother.

Insider: Greece warns another European war could be on the horizon as Turkey hints at the possibility of an invasion 
* Greece is calling on the EU, NATO, and the UN to condemn Turkey over recent threats. 
* Turkey's Erdogan has made veiled threats of an attack against Greece. 
* "When the time comes, we can come suddenly one night," Erdogan said on Tuesday. 
Greece is calling on its allies to condemn Turkey over recent aggressive rhetoric from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has hinted at the possibility of open conflict as tensions rise between the two countries. 
In letters dated Monday and Tuesday to NATO, the EU, and the UN that were reported on by the Associated Press, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias called for all three institutions to rebuke Ankara over Erdogan's comments. 
Dendias said that allowing Turkey to continue threatening Greece would run the risk of yet another conflict in Europe, in an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's King Charles paid a heartfelt tribute on Friday to his late "darling mama" Queen Elizabeth, and vowed to serve as monarch with "loyalty, respect and love" as she had done for more than seven decades.

Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/life-queen-elizabeth-2022-09-08 and a towering presence on the world stage for 70 years, died on Thursday at her home in Scotland aged 96, drawing an outpouring of tributes https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/death-queen-elizabeth-marked-around-world…]]></summary>

DW: Ukraine reconstruction may cost $349 billion 
As the war in Ukraine goes on, the cost of rebuilding the country and its economy mounts up dramatically. A detailed new report puts a figure on the damage: more than one-third of a trillion US dollars. 
The cost of rebuilding Ukraine and its economy has already reached at least $349 billion (€346 billion), according to a new report jointly compiled by the World Bank, the European Commission and the Ukrainian government. 
In the more than six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the country has suffered widespread destruction. 
"The impact of the invasion will be felt for generations, with families displaced and separated, disruptions to human development, destruction of intrinsic cultural heritage and reversal of a positive economic and poverty trajectory," the report states.

Newsweek: U.S. Preparing for Russia to Bring War to NATO Countries 
The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that it wants the U.S. lawmakers to approve funds for countries that neighbor Ukraine and "are potentially at risk of future Russian aggression." 
The funds would be part of a new $2 billion-plus aid package to Ukraine and its allies that has been proposed by U.S. officials. 
In a statement on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the funds would be provided to 18 nations that neighbor Ukraine. 
The $2.2 billion package, which would need to be approved by Congress, would provide roughly $1 billion to Ukraine, and the rest would be split among countries including the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia and Lithuania, the Associated Press reported, while Slovakia, Poland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Moldova and Slovenia would also receive funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hill: Milley: Russian strategic objectives in Ukraine ‘have been defeated’  
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday said Russia’s strategic objectives in its attack on Ukraine have “been defeated.” 
“The war is not over, but so far the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated,” Milley said at a news conference alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

Update #1: Milley’s assessment: Russia’s war in Ukraine ‘minor tactical success,’ but ‘strategic defeat’ (Washington Examiner) 
Update #2: Gen. Milley Says Russia Has Failed To Meet Strategic Objectives But War Isn't Over (Huffington Post)   
WNU editor: The video where General Milley made these remarks is above, and the transcript is here .... Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark A. Milley Hold a Press Conference Following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Meeting, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. 
As to what is my take. I do not share General Milley's assessment. 
At the start of the war President Putin stated what was Russia's goals (link here). I see no evidence that these goals have changed, but I do see evidence that Russia has expanded its strategic objectives to include Ukrainian territories that have large Russian-Ukrainian populations. 
The narrative from the Kremlin and Russian media have also been very clear this summer. This is going to be a long war, lasting into 2023 and maybe into 2024. 
Will Russia succeed? I do not know. 
But I think it is too early for General Milley to claim Russia's strategic objectives have been defeated in Ukraine.]]></summary>

KYIV, Ukraine — Russian state television broadcast an interview Friday acknowledging that Kyiv had achieved a “substantial victory” after Ukrainian forces burst through the front line in a lightning advance. 
The Ukrainian breakthrough near Kharkiv was the fastest advance reported by either side for months, and one of the biggest shifts in the war’s momentum since Russian forces abandoned a disastrous assault on Kyiv, the capital, in March.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had “liberated dozens of settlements” and reclaimed more than 1,000 square km (385 square miles) of territory in the Kharkiv region in the east as well as Kherson in the south in the past week.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's right-wing bloc is on track to win a clear majority in both houses of parliament at this month's election, according to studies based on the final opinion polls before a ban on their publication kicks in on Saturday.
The far-right Brothers of Italy which dominates the conservative alliance is set to be the largest single party at the Sept. 25 vote, according to the latest surveys which show it widening its lead over the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).
A study by the Cattaneo Institute think tank, based on polls conducted up to Aug. 31, suggests the conservative bloc could elect at least 258 lawmakers out of 400 in the Chamber of Deputies, and 131 out of 200 in the Senate.
It estimated a 91.5% probability that the alliance, in which Giorgia Meloni'…]]></summary>
