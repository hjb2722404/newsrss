* Shoigu was pictured in Ukraine with 'General Armageddon' Sergei Surovikin 
* The pair met at an undisclosed military base in territory occupied by Russia 
* Comes as Russian marines said catastrophic planning by led to unit's massacre 
* They wrote in a letter that their generals had treated them as 'cannon fodder'

Images released by the defence ministry showed Shoigu studying a series of documents alongside 'General Armageddon' Sergei Surovikin at an undisclosed location in occupied Ukraine. 
Surovikin was appointed overall commander of Russia's armed forces by Putin exactly one month ago, having earned his ominous title overseeing the brutal destruction of Aleppo amid the Russian intervention in Syria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NBC News 
WNU Editor: I can say with confidence that if there was any hope in some foreign capitals that the US midterm elections would signal a change in US foreign policy .... sighhhh .... those hopes were all but extinguished this morning. 
Bottom line.
The US midterm elections results were not a repudiation of President Biden's foreign policies or decisions. I would even say that for a majority of Americans it was not even on their top 10 issues of concern. 
The debacle and surrender in Afghanistan. The war in Ukraine. Growing tensions with China. Worsening tensions with North Korea. The fracturing of the global order into multi-polar blocs that are hostile to US interests. The weaponization of the US dollar's status as the world's global reserve currency. All of these issues were not raised, debated, or discussed. 
What this means is that there will be no personnel changes or changes in policies when it comes to the Pentagon and national security issues, imposing financial and economic sanctions as a tool of US foreign policy, the war in Ukraine, and raising tensions against China.
My biggest worry is that there are probably some in the White House who will see the elections results as a green-light to double down on their policies. 
What this means is even more support and involvement, maybe even direct involvement, in the war in Ukraine. The weaponization of the dollar. A more aggressive posture against China. And an even more aggressive approach towards countries like Saudi Arabia to not divert away from the American sphere of influence as they try their best to distance themselves away from Washington DC (i.e. Saudi Crown Prince Salman meeting Chinese President Xi next month to foster closer ties).
I do not see any lessening of tensions in 2023. In fact. I see it becoming far worse as the US does what it feels it must do to maintain its status as the world's global super-power.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama attend a campaign for Democratic senatorial candidate John Fetterman and Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Picture: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
WNU editor: President Biden and the White House should be happy. Correction. They should be overjoyed!
All the expectations of a red wave fell flat.

Keeping control of the US Senate will mean his court and executive office appointees will still be approved.
There is an outside chance that the Democrats may still keep control of the House of Representatives. But even if they do lose the House, the Republican majority will be so small, maybe by a seat or two, that blocking the President's agenda will be challenge for the Republican leadership. 
Within the Democrat party itself, the push to convince President Biden to not run in the 2024 Presidential race is going to fall silent. 
President Biden, at least publicly, has stated that he will run in 2024. Unless there is a change in his physical health by then, he and Kamala Harris will be on the ticket for 2024. 
And as to questions on President Biden's mental capacity to run in 2024. As John Fetterman's Senate victory in Pennsylvania has shown. Being mentally impaired after suffering a stroke and facing years of rehabilitation was not an obstacle for him to run for office and to win convincingly. 
So what do I expect from the White House in the next two years?
I expect the White House, with help from the media, to say that this election cycle validated President Biden's policies, and he has mandate to continue on. 
Policy wise the White House and the Democrats in Congress are going to double down on their domestic agenda and policies. Ditto on foreign policy.]]></summary>

The Cradle:  US to establish new military base in northeastern Syria 
US troops recently set up another military base in Naqara village, just three kilometers from the northeastern province of Hasakah 
The US-led international coalition forces operating in northeastern Syria intend to establish a new military base in their controlled areas in the countryside of Raqqa. 
Local sources said that a convoy of US forces, including several armored military vehicles, arrived in Raqqa city as part of preparations to install a new base in the area. 
On the field, the illegal troops began transferring the logistical equipment and necessary gear to the specified location, coinciding with heavy surveillance drone activity.

 Defense One: More Than 100 C-130s Are Down, Likely Because Mechanics Scratched Their Propellers, Air Force Says 
The standard practice of inscribing serial numbers during inspections turns out to be counterproductive. 
A maintenance procedure used by Air Force mechanics to document inspections likely damaged hundreds of C-130 propeller blades over a decade, according to service officials. 
Maintenance technicians examining the propeller blades for cracks or other damage scratched permanent marks on each blade to document the inspection had taken place. 
 “The process used to engrave serial numbers on the propellers likely contributed to cracks that are being found on the C-130Hs,” Maj. Beau Downey, an Air Force spokesperson, said in an email. “That process, which involved an electric arc pen to incise digits into the surface of the metal, was stopped about six months ago and will not be used going forward.

* For this winter, Europe’s gas storage is more than 90% full, according to the International Energy Agency, providing some assurance against a major shortage. 
* But a large proportion of that is made up of Russian gas imported in previous months, which likely won’t be available at all by winter of 2023. 
* This could lead to significant social unrest — already, small to medium-sized protests have cropped up around Europe. 
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Politicians and governments around the world are bracing for potential civil unrest as many countries grapple with mounting energy costs and rising inflation. 
The global economy is facing an onslaught from multiple sides — a war in Europe, and shortages of oil, gas and food, and high inflation, each of which has worsened the next.
Concerns are centered on the coming winter, especially for Europe. Cold weather, combined with an oil and gas shortage stemming from Western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, threatens to upend lives and businesses.

WNU Editor: The above Bloomberg video summarizes what I have been saying for the past 3 months. Europe's decision to cut-off Russian natural gas after filling its reserves means higher energy prices this winter. 
But next year, with no access to Russian gas, will mean a rush to obtain energy supplies on the global market. This means only one thing. Even higher prices next winter, and the very real possibility of shortages.]]></summary>

To replace Russian gas, Europe is buying up fuel that used to go to developing countries. 
(Bloomberg) — Bills will be high, but Europe will survive the winter: It’s bought enough oil and gas to get through the heating seasons. 
Much deeper costs will be borne by the world’s poorest countries, which have been shut out of the natural gas market by Europe’s suddenly ravenous demand. 
It’s left emerging market countries unable to meet today’s needs or tomorrow’s, and the most likely consequences — factory shutdowns, more frequent and longer-lasting power shortages, the foment of social unrest — could stretch into the next decade.

In regards to the US Senate. Georgia is headed to a run-off election. Pennsylvania is trending towards Democrat John Fetterman, but there are still a lot of votes to count outside the big cities. If all other trends continue, Georgia may decide who will be the majority party in the US Senate. 
I am also looking at the Senate race in Alaska. Because of how the vote is decided, the Democrats may actually win the state. 
The Republicans will win the House of Representatives. They have already flipped 5 seats, and leading in a number of others. This is the big story of the day.

Bottom line. I expect gridlock in Washington. The key is the US Senate. If Republicans win 51 seats, President Biden's appointees are not going to be easily approved.]]></summary>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Monday that Ukraine is prepared to negotiate with Russia if certain conditions are met, including the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, punishment of war criminals and compensation for Kyiv for the invasion. 
Between the lines: U.S. officials have reportedly been privately urging Zelensky — who said in September that he'd only negotiate with Russia's next president, not Vladimir Putin — to signal openness to talks. 
Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's several conditions for any such talks and one of his top aides denied Tuesday that Kyiv felt any pressure to negotiate.

Chrystia Freeland, the deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Canada could replace Jens Stoltenberg as a NATO secretary general unless his term is extended, an American newspaper reported on Friday, citing a US official familiar with the debate. With the tenure of NATO’s current chief, Jens Stoltenberg, scheduled to end next fall, who among the allies should replace him? Besides Chrystia Freeland, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova, and ex-Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, who also was Croatia's ambassador to the US and an assistant secretary general for public diplomacy at NATO, are named as strong contenders from the European Union, according to the report. UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace is another contender for the post, the newspaper cited UK officials as saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: US Quietly Asks Banks to Keep Some Ties With Russia, Even as Congress Balks 
Deep into a seven-hour congressional hearing on Sept. 21, Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, pressed Dimon on whether his bank would sever ties with Russian companies including energy giant Gazprom PJSC. 
Banks like Dimon’s, Sherman argued, were exploiting a sanctions loophole to keep doing business in Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine.  “We are following the instructions of the American government as they asked us to do it,” Dimon responded before Sherman cut him off, setting his sights on Citigroup Inc.’s Jane Fraser with a similar inquiry.
The exchange put on display how the country’s largest banks are caught in the push-pull between the Biden administration and Congress on sanctions. Behind the scenes, the Treasury and State Departments have urged banking giants including JPMorgan and Citigroup to keep doing business with certain strategic Russian firms, according to people familiar with the situation.

WNU Editor: Even if the report from Bloomberg is true, there is no way Russian companies and institutions are going to do business with US banks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump is continuing to feel the competition with Ron DeSantis by declaring it would be a “mistake” for the Florida governor to run for president in 2024 and threatened to expose “unflattering” things about him.

"I would tell you things about him that won't be very flattering — I know more about him than anybody — other than, perhaps, his wife,” the former president told Fox News Digital.

The comments come after Donald Trump last week referred to the Florida governor as "Ron DeSanctimonious" when reacting to his re-election campaign advertisement.

Both Ron DeSantis and the former president continue to be seen as the two most favoured candidates for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2024.

While neither Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis have declared a run for the White House, the former president told his supporters he has a “big announcement” coming on November 15.]]></summary>

The US House Speaker will be leaving the United States to attend the COP27 in Egypt on Thursday.
 
“That’s really, really strange and probably an indicator that she knows she’s not going to be Speaker of the House come January,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“Whether or not it is an omen of her impending retirement remains to be seen. 

“It’s going to raise more questions, I think, than answers.”]]></summary>

The world’s largest nuclear submarine has been spotted leaving Gibraltar under intense protection from the Royal Marines as it reportedly heads towards the Black Sea.

Update: U.S. nuclear submarine dubbed ‘rider of the apocalypse’ enters the Mediterranean -- Asia Markets   
WNU Editor: I am skeptical that Turkey will permit the USS Rhode Island to cross the Bosporus Strait to Enter the black Sea. Turkey has made it very clear that they will permit no warships to cross the strait with the current war now underway.

   EurAsian Times: HIMARS Pounding Brings Russia On Edge Of Major Military Defeat; Moscow Admits Losing Ground In Kherson 
For a few weeks now, Russia has de facto admitted that its hold on the right bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region is tenuous. 
Russia’s new commander in Ukraine, General Sergei Surovikin, in his first interview after taking over command, admitted that the Ukrainian counter-offensive in the southern region of Kherson had made the situation for the Russian army “tense.” 
Russia subsequently ordered the evacuation of its citizens from the right bank of the Dnieper river, offering them refuge on the left bank and elsewhere in Russia.

WNU Editor: I am skeptical of the above report. There are a number of bridges that are still operational across the Dnieper river. They would have long been knocked out by Ukraine if the HIMARs were that effective. My guess is that Russia's anti-missile systems are very effective, and if true I am willing to bet that this is just one more worry for the Pentagon. 
As to the claim that Ukraine has not lost a single HIMARS. It is true that the only video images that I have seen of HIMARs being destroyed by Russian forces are few and very blurry. But it is also true that Russia is censoring a lot of their battlefield successes in Ukraine, reason being that they do not want the other side to know how they are conducting their military operations.]]></summary>

   Naval News:  Loitering Munition Strikes Ukrainian gunboat, a first in Naval Warfare  
The Russian-Ukrainian war is increasingly becoming a proving ground for the use of different types of drones in various domains. While the world has witnessed the efficiency of unmanned systems since the beginning of the war, the recent attack shows for the first time that loitering munitions can be effective in naval warfare too.  
On November 04, 2022, Russian news agency Ria Novosty shared a video on its Telegram channel showing Russian forces striking a Ukrainian Gyruza-M-class patrol boat with a Lancet loitering munition. 
According to the footage, the gunboat was stationary, and its engines appeared to be at stop status, and the Lancet drone struck the ship from the port side. 
While the location of the attack has not been officially confirmed by either side, respected Twitter user “Capt_Navy,” who is a former officer in the Russian Navy, claimed that the incident occurred in the waters of the Kakhovsky Reservoir (on the Dnieper River).

SCMP: US says it wants to get defence talks with China ‘back on track’ 

* White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan urges renewed military-to-military communication, which Beijing cut off after Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan 
* Such talks 'can help create more stability and reduce the risk of misunderstanding', he says 
Washington's top national security official urged Beijing on Monday to resume defence talks with the United States, which China cut off after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan over the summer. 
"Since the elevated and aggressive actions of the Chinese military around Taiwan started in August, we have not had the military-to-military communication that we believe can help create more stability and reduce the risk of misunderstanding," National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. 
"We hope to get that back on track."

WNU Editor: Not going to happen. Everyone I know in China has been telling me the same thing this year. Beijing does not trust the Biden administration anymore, and they especially do not trust National Security advisor Jake Sullivan. But China has responded to Jake Sullivan albeit through their equivalent of a think tank .... US needs to ‘act with sincerity’ on Taiwan to restart China defence talks, analysts say (SCMP).]]></summary>

WNU Editor: 42% diagnosed with a mental health condition. 57% are on some form of medication. These numbers make my mouth drop. And when these young adults get older, you know that the problems are going to get worse. 
Bottom line. If your country's young are this sick, you just know that the economic and national security implications are going to be huge in the future.]]></summary>

Reuters: Analysis-North Korea's missile launches show no scarcity of weapons funding, materials despite sanctions 
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's record year of missile launches has shown its willingness to pour resources into producing and deploying more weapons than ever - and sanctions have done little to hinder their development, analysts say. 
Last week the country fired more than 80 missiles, including its latest short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and a new variant of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), by far the North's most launches in such a short period. 
Although North Korean weapon costs are not known, ICBMs in other countries can cost tens of millions of dollars, and SRBMs such as Russia's Iskander up to $3 million.

The energy crisis continues to worsen. Government policies have made this into a disaster, and I do not see the people who put us into this disaster approving policies that will go against their green agenda.

Wall Street Journal: China's Xi Jinping to Visit Saudi Arabia Amid Global Reshuffling 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is planning to visit Saudi Arabia before the end of the year, according to people familiar with preparations for the trip, as Beijing and Riyadh seek to deepen ties and advance a vision of a multipolar world where the U.S. no longer dominates the global order.
Officials are completing the details for a summit between Mr. Xi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that would underline Beijing’s growing influence in the Middle East, where the U.S. long reigned supreme, and growing links between the oil-rich Saudis and Washington’s top global rivals. 
 In the works for months, the trip is tentatively scheduled for the second week of December, these people said.

WNU Editor: This is big news. The Crown Prince invited Chinese President Xi earlier this year (link here), and this acceptance by the Chinese President to travel to Saudi Arabia sends a signal not only to everyone in the Middle East, but to the West, and specifically to the United States. 
As to what will be discussed at this summit. I expect a number of major business deals will be announced. Laying the groundwork for Saudi Arabia to join BRICs. Exploring a financial mechanism whereby China can buy Saudi oil without using the US dollar. And .... I am putting myself out on the limb with this one. A future joint military exercise between the two nations.]]></summary>

The Beaver Blood Moon lunar eclipse, as it's called (it happens during the Full Beaver Moon of November) will begin at 3:02 a.m. EST (0802 GMT) and reaches totality at 5:16 a.m. EST (1016 GMT) before ending at 8:56 a.m. EST (1356 GMT).

(MENAFN) Serbian Leader Aleksandar Vucic has compared the expected fight for Kherson between Russian and Ukrainian troops to the Battle of Stalingrad throughout World War II, cautioning that aftershocks from the war would be felt far outside the war zone. 
“Challenging times are ahead of us. Next winter will be even harsher than this one because we’re facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the conflict in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson,” Vucic announced in an interview with Pink TV on Sunday. 
Both sides might use thousands of tanks, aircraft and artillery pieces in the attack for the main city, he expected.

A girl, a refugee from Syria, reads the Rome’s "Appeal for peace": "With firm conviction, we say: no more war! Let's stop all conflicts […] Let dialogue be resumed to nullify the threat of nuclear weapons.” Pope Francis singed it in front of the people gathered at the Colosseum, holding the word “peace” in their hands, as representatives of the world’s religions did as well. Shortly before, members of those different religions gathered for prayer to invoke peace in their different traditions—a prayer that is “a cry” inside the ancient amphitheater.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2022/11/07/32342">Read the full story, “Lessons from Rome.

The SUN: SUB BLAZE Nuclear-armed Navy submarine aborted top secret mission due to life-or-death fire beneath the waves 
A NUCLEAR-armed Navy submarine had to abort a top secret mission because of a life-or-death fire beneath the waves. 
HMS Victorious was carrying Trident 2 missiles when the electrical blaze broke out. 
The £3billion Vanguard-class nuclear submarine shot to the surface as the captain declared “emergency stations”. 
Every member of the 130-plus crew, including those off-duty, was ordered into action. 
Naval sources insisted the fire was swiftly contained.

Update #1: Royal Navy nuclear-armed submarine forced to abort mission after catching fire (The Daily Telegraph)  
Update #2: British nuclear submarine caught fire – The Sun (RT)   
WNU Editor: What would have happened if this electrical fire got out of control and it destroyed the sub before word got out that there was a fire. Would the UK blame Russia? 
The Kremlin has already pointed the finger at the UK for the Nord stream pipeline attacks, and attacks on Russian targets in Crimea. I can understand why the UK government would interpret the disappearance of a UK nuclear submarine as Russian retaliation? With tensions currently this high anything is possible right now.]]></summary>

What can COP27 accomplish as inflation and energy prices soar?
 President Joe Biden and other world leaders are gathering this week in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for negotiations on mitigating climate change. The two-week meeting, known as COP27, follows yet another year of devastating floods, storms, heat waves, and droughts around the world, worsened by rising average temperatures. 
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere this year reached 421 parts per million, the highest in human history, and the planet just experienced one of its hottest summers on record.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), prompting the United States and South Korea to extend air drills that have angered Pyongyang.
Despite an initial government warning that the apparent ICBM had flown over Japan, triggering warning alarms for some residents, Tokyo later said this was incorrect.

Several in his convoy were wounded in the attack in Wazirabad, nearly 200 km (120 miles) from the capital. Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said a suspect had been arrested.

SEOUL (Reuters) - "Dad, I'm going out" were the last words Jung Hae-moon heard his daughter utter, at the end of a chat they had on the telephone on Saturday as she turned down an invitation to dinner.
Hours later, 30-year-old Jung Joo-hee was among 156 people, most of them in their teens and twenties, killed in the South Korean capital as they celebrated Halloween free of COVID restrictions for the first time in three years.
On Thursday, the young woman's family buried her ashes in a peaceful family plot outside Seoul, with a planted sapling and bouquets by her grave stone, in a sombre ceremony of prayers and tears.
"Rest well. Mum and dad will come see you," Jung Hae-moon said as the family stood by, together with his daughter's pet poodle.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea unsuccessfully fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during a new salvo of launches Thursday, the South Korean military said, with Washington urging all nations to enforce sanctions on Pyongyang.
The launches prompted South Korea and the United States to extend their ongoing joint air drills, the largest-ever such exercises, citing North Korea's "provocations".
People in parts of northern Japan were ordered to seek shelter during the North's latest launches, which included two short-range missiles and followed a blitz of projectiles fired Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Days before the polls close in the 2022 midterm elections, actions by Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are already being seen through the prism of the expected 2024 GOP presidential nomination contest.
DeSantis is starring in a new ad for GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who is facing an uncharacteristically tough re-election in deep-red Utah as he's being challenged by independent Evan McMullin, who won Lee's vote for president in 2016.
The ad, paid for by the far-right Club for Growth, is the first out-of-state ad featuring DeSantis backing a fellow Republican, according to Breitbart News.
Trump then re-endorsed Lee in a statement posted to his Truth Social website.

After days of silence, Bolsonaro on Tuesday gave a short speech in which he neither accepted defeat nor congratulated Lula on his win, though his chief of staff took the podium afterward to say the president had "authorized" the transition to a new government.
Since then, his supporters have rallied in front of military installations in Brazil's major cities to call for action.
"Federal intervention now!" chanted some of the thousands who gathered in front of the Southeastern Military Command in the Latin American country's biggest city, Sao Paulo, on Wednesday.

Kirby did not confirm a New York Times report that said high-level Russian military officials recently discussed when and how they might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.
The report, which cited unnamed US officials, said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not take part in the discussions, and there was no indication that the Russian military had decided to deploy the weapons.

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a hurricane warning for Honduras' Bay Islands, the coast of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan area stretching from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya.
Lisa was moving westward in the Caribbean Sea at a speed of 24 kilometers (15 miles) per hour with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and even higher gusts, said the NHC.
"Additional strengthening is forecast as Lisa approaches Belize. Weakening is expected after the center makes landfall," it added.

Russia has started a draft of men in the country. Many of them have fled and those who couldn't were sent to fight with sparse and “barely usable” equipment and little food. It has resulted in soldiers looking for creative ways to get out. 
In a report by the independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe, covered by the Daily Beast, reporters spoke to the wives of three men sent to Ukraine last month into a "living nightmare."  
First, training has been little more than "dig a trench in the forest." They were then sent to the Luhansk region of Ukraine. According to one spouse, her husband is being "commanded by two other mob…]]></summary>

One person was found with gunshot wounds and was taken to the hospital and later died. Another teen boy was taken to the hospital but his condition is not known. 
Toronto Police Service (TPS) duty inspector Lori Kranenburg said that both victims are believed to be teenagers but she could not confirm if either victim was a student at the school. 
“It appears that there were several shots fired, but I don’t have an exact number. At this time we’re reviewing video and canvassing the area,” Kranenburg said.
Video circulating online apparently shows the events that led up to the shooting. The video shows one person backing away as three people walk towards him while words are exchanged. Shots then ring out.

Sunak had argued that "pressing domestic commitments" would keep him away from COP27 in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh -- after inheriting an economic crisis from predecessor Liz Truss.
But that fuelled doubts about Sunak's interest in the planetary emergency, and critics said the inexperienced leader was passing up an opportunity to rub shoulders with the likes of US President Joe Biden and European peers.
"There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy without investing in renewables," Sunak wrote on Twitter.

With around 84 percent of the vote counted at 0755 GMT, according to the Central Elections Committee, Netanyahu could be set for a dramatic comeback.
"We are close to a big victory," he told supporters of his right-wing Likud party at a rally early Wednesday.
But his main rival, caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, told his own supporters in Tel Aviv that "nothing is decided", and that his centrist Yesh Atid party "will wait patiently... for the final results".

The Russians have been firing salvos from the south end of the road ever since being routed and retreating from the village in the first month of war in March.

Victory it was not. Death came in the form of an end to his presidency, which he grudgingly accepted Tuesday -- two days after the election was declared for his opponent.
And prison?
"You can be sure that option... does not exist," the far-right leader told members of his crucial evangelical support base in August 2021.
Analysts, however, believe a future behind bars may be a very real prospect for the bellicose Bolsonaro, even if it may take years.
Almost from the start of his controversial mandate in 2019, Bolsonaro racked up accusations and investigations for everything from spreading disinformation to crimes against humanity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea's military said.
The launch comes after Pyongyang on Tuesday demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, calling them a provocation that may draw "more powerful follow-up measures."
Broadcaster YTN reported that an air raid warning was issued on the South Korean island of Ulleung around the time of the missile launch. A spokesman for South Korea's military said they were checking to see whether the air raid warning was related to the missile launch.
The United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day.
North Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills.

Radcliffe was discussing the open letter he released in 2020, in which he criticized Rowling’s views on gender identity.
“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that," Radcliffe told IndieWire.
"And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important,” he explained.

In his June 2020 open letter posted at The Trevor Project, Radcliffe wrote, "Transgender women are women."

        <updated>2022-11-01T18:05:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U2's Bono on Tuesday released his memoir "Surrender," detailing the journey from his youth in Dublin to fronting one of the world's most prominent rock bands.
The introspective book is organized across 40 different U2 songs, including 40 original drawings.
The 62-year-old artist born Paul David Hewson is a long-time humanitarian well-known for lending his voice to a variety of causes, including the fight against poverty and AIDS.
In his more than 500-page book, Bono delves in to those ambitions but also his growth as a teenager struck by tragedy -- his mother died suddenly when he was 14 -- and an account of his heart operation in 2016.
He also waxes on the perplexities and finer points of songwriting, and "the pseudo-religious part of being a rock star, how we put the messy in messianic."
"U2's music was never really rock 'n' roll," he writes in the book. "Under its contemporary skin it's opera -- a big music, big emotions unlocked in the pop music of the day."
The rocker is promoting the memoir with a 14-date book tour entitled "Stories of Surrender," which kicks off in New York this week and includes stops in Chicago, London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and, of course, Dublin.
"When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I'd previously only sketched in songs," Bono said in a statement when the book's publication was announced earlier this year.
"Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept," he continued. "I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist."
"Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way."

At the new cabinet's first meeting on Monday the draft legislation was approved, raising concern it could be used arbitrarily to shut down any type of public demonstration.
"It's a major error. Raves have no place in such a document. This calls into question public freedoms," Democratic Party secretary and former prime minister Enrico Letta posted on Twitter.
Writer Erri di Luca saw a "serious danger for open and free musical shows".
On Monday, police confiscated audio equipment worth 150,000 euros (dollars) when they intervened at a rave in the northern city of Modena.

By arming the Russians, the Iranian regime "is involved in killing innocent Ukrainians," White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.
"At its core, this is a regime in Tehran that is openly and willingly making themselves an accomplice to the murder of innocent Ukrainian people on Ukrainian soil."
Kirby noted Iran's provision of attack drones to Russia, which have been deployed in recent weeks to damage Ukraine infrastructure.
But he would not confirm reports that Tehran could also send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
"We remain concerned about the potential of Iran to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles," Kirby told reporters.
"We haven't seen that bear out, but it's a concern that we have," he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day, research estimated Tuesday, suggesting that the omnipresent pollution poses a bigger danger to the world's largest animal than previously thought.
The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood.
Now a modeling study published in the journal Nature Communications has estimated how much is being ingested by whales.
A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements.
"It's basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale," said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study's first author.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October 2022 is set to be the hottest month of October in France since records started in 1945, national weather agency Meteo-France said in a statement. 
With an average temperature close to or even just above 17 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit) - three to four degrees above normal levels - last month was far warmer than the previous record in October 2001, when temperatures averaged 16.3C.
The second half of the month saw an exceptionally long and intense period of unseasonably high temperatures, with the southwestern city of Bordeaux registering on Oct. 16 the latest 30C since records started.
Meteo-France said that due to climate change, periods of unusual heat late or early in the year were set to become more frequent.
Beach resorts across Europe have extended their season as the unseasonable warmth kept tourists coming to the seaside.
