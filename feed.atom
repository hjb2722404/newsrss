The Independent: North Korea’s Kim Jong-un orders increase in arms factory capacity for ‘war readiness’, state media reports

 
Kim Jong-un calls for rapid expansion in ‘production’ during a visit to a factory producing engines for cruise missiles and drones. 
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has asked his country’s key weapons factories to boost their arsenal capacity and perfect the “war readiness” as he toured the facilities producing artillery systems and launchpads for nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, state media reported on Sunday. 
The reclusive leader called for “rapidly expanding production” during his visit to a factory that produces engines for cruise missiles and drones. 
The 39-year-old supreme leader complimented workers of an unspecified factory manufacturing launcher trucks for establishing a “solid foundation” for production but asked for the supply of the vehicles to be ramped up as a top priority for the military, reported North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.

The destroyers were the USS John McCain, USS Benfold, USS John Finn and USS Chung-Hoon. 
U.S. aircraft were also in the area throughout the combined exercise, which the U.S. had been tracking since it began in July, according to U.S. officials.

* Chonhar bridge was damaged and small bridge across Tonky Strait was shelled 
Ukrainian troops damaged two key bridges leading into Russian-occupied Crimea with 'Storm Shadow missiles supplied by the UK' today. 
The Chonhar bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Crimea was damaged and a small bridge across the Tonky Strait was also shelled. 
Continuing attacks by Zelensky's forces are making it increasingly hard for Putin's invading army to get on and off the peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.

WNU Editor: The Military Summary Channel (video below) wonders if the SU-24s that Ukraine used to launch these missiles flew in from Poland. This is not the first time that I am hearing such speculation. For the past few months there is a lot of talk on Russian social media sites that monitor and report on the war that Poland has provided an airbase or two  for Ukraine to launch airstrikes from.

Threat of military intervention made by ECOWAS ‘must be taken very seriously,’ French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna says. 
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Saturday backed efforts to reverse a military coup in Niger, following a meeting in Paris with the African country’s Prime Minister Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou and Niger’s Ambassador to France, Aïchatou Boulama Kané. 
France “firmly and resolutely supports the efforts of ECOWAS to thwart this attempted putsch,” the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement, referring to a group of 15 West African countries that has given the putschists in Niger until Sunday to step down or face a possible military intervention. 
“The future of Niger and the stability of the entire region are at stake,” the ministry said.

Update #2: France backs ECOWAS push to reverse Niger military coup (Al Jazeera) 
WNU Editor: France and the US are hoping that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will cobble together a military force to reverse the military coup in Niger. Easier said than done. Some member states are against any form of military intervention against Niger .... Burkina Faso, Mali warn against military intervention in Niger (Al Jazeera), and two, the member states of ECOWAS have limited military capabilities to launch such an operation against Niger's new leaders. 
Bottom line. 
The West will need to get directly involved in launching such an operation to quash this coup, and they already have the means to do it.  There are currently about 3,000 Western troops in Mali .... Which Western countries have foreign forces in Niger? (Al Jazeera).]]></summary>

 Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Says Intercepted U.S. Drone Over Black Sea 
Russia said Saturday it scrambled an Su-30 fighter jet to "prevent a violation of the Russian state border" by a U.S. Reaper MQ-9 military drone over the Black Sea. 
"As the Russian fighter approached, the foreign reconnaissance drone performed a U-turn away from the border," the Russian Defense Ministry said. 
The ministry said the drone belonged to the U.S. Air Force.

"The Russian aircraft returned safely to its airbase, there was no violation of the border," it added. 
Incidents involving Russian and Western aircraft have multiplied over the Black Sea and Baltic Sea in recent months, as Moscow pursues its offensive in Ukraine.

Moscow may cancel its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to be on par with the US, Kommersant has reported  
Elements within the Russian government are reportedly advocating a withdrawal of Moscow’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), an international agreement to suspend all nuclear-weapons tests. The 1996 document has never come into force because some nations, including the US, have not ratified it. 
The proposed move to withdraw its ratification would be symbolic rather than practical, rendering Russia’s stance regarding CTBT as the same as the US’ stance, according to the business daily Kommersant, which reported the deliberations on Thursday. The discussion is at an early stage, news outlet also said.

Update: Press review: Moscow may pull test-ban treaty ratification and intervention risk for Niger (TASS)

 
WNU Editor: I believe there is a very real chance that the Kremlin may withdraw from the treaty. 
Russia has called upon the US to finally ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), a treaty that Washington has never ratified. There has been no response from the White House.

According to the Russian business daily Kommersant, Russian government officials have already suggested withdrawing Moscow’s ratification of the treaty to ensure that Russia is on par with Washington and to send a message to the West on their involvement in the Ukraine war. 
The eight countries that have not ratified the treaty are .... China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified the Treaty; India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it. (Wikipedia).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC News: Imran Khan: Pakistan ex-PM given three-year jail sentence 
Ex-Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for nationwide protests after he was handed a three-year jail sentence over corruption allegations. 
Mr Khan was found guilty of not declaring money earned from selling gifts he received in office. 
He denies the charges and says he will appeal. 
After the verdict, Mr Khan was taken into custody from his home in Lahore.

In a pre-recorded statement posted after the verdict, he urged supporters to fight against the ruling. 
 "I have only one appeal, don't sit at home silently," he said in a video address posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. 
"I am struggling for you and the country and your children's future," he added. 
The former cricketer-turned-politician, 70, was elected in 2018, but was ousted in a no-confidence vote last year after falling out with Pakistan's powerful military.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
