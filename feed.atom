Snipers from Russia and other countries hostile to the United States are competing in war games being held this week in Venezuela in events described as Olympic games for soldiers that were organized not only to show that Moscow still has friends but also that some of them are in Latin America. 
The international war games have been held yearly since 2015, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and Venezuela has participated from its beginning, but this year’s games are the first held in Latin America, and include participants from Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua. 
Forces from Burma, Belarus, Abkhazia, Uzbekistan, China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia, among others, also participate in the competitions. These are nations that “daily condemn imperialist aggression against the peoples,” Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López declared as he inaugurated the games on Monday.

Florida’s 1st congressional district is one of the reddest in the state, voting in 2020 for Trump 65.7% at that of Joe Biden 32.3%, and Bake the political report gave him a Partisan Voter Index score of R+20 this year.

* A siege which saw at least 20 people gunned down in Somalia ended at midnight after a 30-hours siege 
* Islamist militants attacked a hotel in Mogadishu led by al Qaeda allies Al Shabaab on Friday, killing residents 
* Gunmen barricaded themselves inside the Hayat Hotel in Mogadishu, fighting off armed security cops 
* Dozens of victims' relatives at scene as bullets and flames ripped through the popular hotel 
Somali authorities have rescued 106 hostages and ended a deadly attack on a hotel in the capital in which at least 20 people were gunned down by Islamic militants. 
It took Somali forces more than 30 hours to contain the gunmen who stormed Mogadishu's Hayat Hotel on Friday evening in an assault that started with loud explosions. 
On Sunday morning, the area surrounding the hotel was quiet and the roads blocked by a heavy security presence as emergency workers and bomb disposal experts sought to clear the premises of any explosives and remove rubble.

Reuters: Japan considers deploying long-range missiles to counter China - Yomiuri 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering the deployment of 1,000 long-range cruise missiles to boost its counterattack capability against China, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Sunday. 
The missiles would be existing arms modified to extend their range from 100 km (62 miles) to 1,000 km, the daily said, citing government sources. 
The arms, launched by ships or aircraft, would be stationed mainly around the southern Nansei islands and capable of reaching the coastal areas of North Korea and China, the Yomiuri said.

The Brookings Institution is causing a stir in the media with its estimate that it now costs more than $300,000 to raise a child through high school, an estimate shared for the first time with our Journal colleagues.  Others take the figure as a shock.  We don’t dispute the number, but that’s not the way to look at it.
There’s no doubt that it takes money to feed, clothe and educate a family these days, and inflation doesn’t help.  But children are not just cost centers.  Even ignoring human affection and thinking in the most utilitarian terms, children are assets to the families that raise them, to the nation they were born into, and to the world to which they will contribute throughout their lives. .

A bizarre idea we sometimes hear is that young people don’t want to have children for fear of climate change.  To have children or not, it’s your choice.  But bringing another person into the world won’t matter for global temperatures.  That is, unless your child becomes the adult who finds a solution to battery storage, or some other technological or commercial breakthrough that improves the human condition. 
A real cause for concern is the declining birth rate in the United States that falls below the replacement rate.  Without immigration, the American population would begin to decline.  It’s nothing to cheer about.  Whatever the cost of raising children, they are an invaluable vote of confidence in the future.


          Not a single Republican senator voted for the so-called “Cut Inflation Act,” but Democrats are ignoring the warning signs and pushing ahead with their tax-and-spend agenda.  Images: Reuters/Shutterstock/Bloomberg News Composite: Mark Kelly

At some point in the life of a business, if you’re lucky, the business becomes so embedded in the fabric of the community that it doesn’t really belong to you anymore.  Your “ownership” becomes “stewardship” and your decision-making reflects this perspective. 
I remember many decisions made over the past few decades with the health and well-being of the community in mind: passing the Bottle Bill in its earliest days, giving teenagers a first job, ditching the lottery and selling cigarettes, working with small farmers and emerging businesses, supporting community organizations through donations or ticket sales, working with the city and youth and environmental groups to limit the use of plastic in stores .  These moves may not …]]></summary>

Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which was captured by Russia in March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. Only two of the facility's six reactors are working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump donor Elizabeth Fago, who infamously hosted a Trump 2020 fundraiser where Ashley Biden’s stolen diary was allegedly distributed, a sold his Florida waterfront estate to Jupiter for $12.5 million. 
The six-bedroom mansion sits at Tony Admiral’s Cove, the glitzy marina, golf and country club just 20 miles from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. 
Residents of Admiral’s Cove include Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who bought their mansion for $9.7 million, apparently with the help of Fago’s son, Joey Fago, who was their broker. 
The 10,000 square foot stone and timber home is at 372 Regatta Drive.  It comprises a master bedroom with a double bathroom and fitted wardrobes, including a “shoe wall”.  There’s also a morning bar with a library area, a theater, a gym, a chef’s kitchen, lots of marble, and even space for a gift-wrapping room. 
Fago, who made his fortune in the nursing home sector, also seems to have a particular preference for the color pink.  The house includes a pink home office and a pink stone shower.

The outdoor space includes a patio, outdoor kitchen, swimming pool and dock – as well as a guest house.  The house also has a six-car garage.
Fago bought the land for $5.7 million in 2006 and then built the villa-like estate in 2012. It was first marketed for $12.75 million last year.  The price was raised last May to $17.49 million following a broker swap. 
The listing brokers are Chad Carroll and Matthew Dugow of Compass.  The buyer was replaced by Vince Marotta at Illustrated Properties, Marotta Group.

Alvarez, along with several priests and lay people, had been holed up at his residence in Matagalpa in central Nicaragua since August 4, alleged by authorities of inciting violence to destabilize the Central American country.
The incident is the latest in a worsening standoff between civil society and a government accused of growing authoritarianism.
The Catholic Church in Nicaragua has been under increasing government pressure since opposition protests in 2018 were met with repression that resulted in hundreds of deaths.

The Federalist: As Questions Mount About Corruption In Ukraine, The Neocon Narrative Is Unraveling  
The Washington establishment would rather cast aspersions on those asking questions about corruption in Ukraine than recognize the problem. 
Americans who even casually followed the news in the fall of 2020 probably know that Ukraine was infamously corrupt long before the United States sent the country $54 billion in aid after the Russian invasion in February. They might not know much else about Ukraine, but they know it’s the kind of place where just being the son of the vice president of the United States can get you an $83,000 monthly paycheck for sitting on the board of an energy company. 
No one knows this better than Ukrainians themselves, who have to put up with a level of official corruption on par with countries like Mexico and Gabon.

I would not be surprised if a third of it is being skimmed off for bribes and pay-offs. And as for the tens of billions that are being loaned to Kyiv and even more promised for the future. Here is an easy prediction. That money is never going to be paid back.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, during the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, numerous atrocities were committed in small towns north of Kyiv – horrors that are still being documented today. In Bucha, an estimated 458 prisoners of war and civilians were slaughtered under Russian occupation, at least fifty of whom are yet to be identified. 
The victims are now being buried in the local cemetery while the investigation into their identities continues. A truck arrives from the Bucha town morgue — inside, the remains of 20 unidentified bodies. It's the third such burial at the town cemetery in the last week. Father Andriy stands alone among the dead — there are no relatives here to mourn their passing. As they are lowered into the ground, he is here to ensure they will not be forgotten.
"It is very important for us to bury them with dignity, not just to bury them as bodies, but to bury them as people with the hope of resurrection from the dead," says the Orthodox priest. 
Six months after the massacre in Bucha, the scene at the cemetery is the beginning of a process of closure. However, it won't be complete until every last body has been identified and the relatives informed]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Thursday said she was upset that videos of her dancing at private parties were published online as they were meant to be seen only by friends.
Marin, 36, spoke after a two-minute video of her singing and dancing with well-known local influencers and artists spread on social media and in Finnish media on Wednesday.
The clips were originally posted to a private Instagram account. Marin, who became the world's youngest serving government leader in December 2019, said she knew she was being filmed but never thought the videos would become publicly available.
"These videos are private and filmed in a private space. I resent that these became known to the public," Marin told reporters. She said she did not know who leaked them.
Many Finns have voiced support for the young leader for combining a private life with her high-profile career. But newspaper Helsingin Sanomat said the episode raised questions about her judgement.
"Marin may have acted in good faith, but this gullible she should not be," the paper wrote in an editorial.
"The prime minister can, in a sensitive situation, put the weapons of information warfare in the hands of those who would like to hurt Finland," the newspaper said.
Marin said the video was a compilation of clips from two separate occasions a few weeks ago. She said people at the events consumed alcohol but no one took drugs to her knowledge.
"We just partied, also in a boisterous way. I danced and sang," Marin said, denying a claim that the videos had been a publicity stunt less than a year until the next general election.
Marin in January told Reuters she and her fellow young female ministers have been targeted with extensive hate speech for their gender and appearance while in office.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Africa's largest ethnic group, the Zulus, will on Saturday crown a new king following a year of feuding over who should ascend to the throne of the country's most influential traditional monarchy.
Misuzulu Zulu, 47, is set to succeed his father, Goodwill Zwelithini, who died in March last year after 50 years in charge.
Although the title of king does not bestow executive power, Zulu monarchs wield great moral influence over more than 11 million Zulus, who make up nearly a fifth of South Africa's population.
On Saturday, Misuzulu will enter the "cattle kraal" at the Zulu royal residence or KwaKhethomthandayo in Nongoma, a small town in the ethnic group's southeastern heartland province of KwaZulu-Natal.
There, he will take part in a secret rite designed to present the new monarch to h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Patricia Zengerle, Idrees Ali and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration is readying about $800 million of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Biden would authorize the assistance using his Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks, the sources told Reuters.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that an announcement could slip into next week, cautioning that weapons packages can change in value before they are announced.
The White House declined to comment.
Since Russian troops poured over the Ukrainian border in February in what Russian President Vladimir Putin termed a "special military operation," the conflict has settled into a war of attrition fought primarily in the east and south of Ukraine.
Washington has sent billions of dollars in security assistance to the Kyiv government.

Heavy storms in Europe's hot summer led to at least nine deaths on Thursday, with the only positive being the rain's affect on previously raging wildfires.
Two children were killed in southern Austria after several trees fell at a lake in the province of Carinthia. About 10 other people were injured, some seriously.
In the states of Styria, Carinthia and East Tyrol, trains were at a standstill after the rail power supply failed due to the storms, the Austrian Federal Railways said, with some roads also blocked by t…]]></summary>

The stones were discovered on a plot of land in Huelva, a province which flanks the southernmost part of Spain's border with Portugal, near the Guadiana River.
Spanning some 600 hectares (1,500 acres), the land had been earmarked for an avocado planation.
But before granting the permit, the regional authorities requested a survey in light of the site's possible archaeological significance -- and revealed the presence of the stones.
"This is the biggest and most diverse collection of standing stones grouped together in the Iberian peninsula," said Jose Antonio Linares, a researcher at Huelva University and one of the …]]></summary>

A 500 kilogram World War II bomb was discovered during building work in Berlin on Thursday, forcing evacuations.
The bomb in the Friedrichshain district will have to be defused.
"There could be up to 12,000 people in the area of the exclusion zone, and it will take time," a police spokeswoman said.
An emergency shelter has been set up at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, which is normally used for concerts and sports events.
The 500-metre exclusion zone includes the busy Ostkreuz train station in the east of the German capital.

The Piedmontese cattle on the farm in Sommariva del Bosco, near Turin in northwest Italy, died suddenly due to acute prussic acid poisoning on August 6, according to the local IZS animal welfare body.
This acid comes from dhurrin, which is naturally present in young sorghum plants, although not in the same high concentrations as those found in samples taken at the site.
"We suspect that the drought caused this very large quantity of dhurrin within the sorghum plants," said Stefano Giantin, a vet at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale for northwest Italy, who is on the case.
With normal growing plants, the amount of dhurrin woul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has ruled out a formal church investigation into a sexual assault claim against Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet after preliminary inquiries found no basis for one, the Vatican said Thursday.
Ouellet, once considered a strong candidate to be pope, was named in court documents this week relating to a class action suit targeting more than 80 members of the clergy in the archdiocese of Quebec.
The 78-year-old is accused of abusing a female intern identified only as "F" from 2008 to 2010, when he was archbishop of Quebec.
In its first response to the case, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that a "preliminary investigation" already ordered by Pope Francis had found there were "no elements to initiate a trial".
The pontiff went back to the author of that probe, a Father Jacques Servais, and was told again that there were no grounds for opening a formal investigation.
"Following further relevant consultations, Pope Francis declares that there are insufficient elements to open a canonical investigation for sexual assault by Cardinal Ouellet against person F," the statement said.
Ouellet is a prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, one of the most important functions within the Curia, the government of the Vatican.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday there was a risk of a man-made disaster at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and accused Kyiv and the West of planning "provocation" there on Friday during a visit to Ukraine by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
A senior Ukrainian official dismissed what he depicted as a cynical assertion by Moscow, and said the simplest solution to the situation would be for Russian forces to withdraw from the plant, remove any munitions stored there and demine it.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine almost six months ago and has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame.
Russia says Ukrainian forces are recklessly firing at the plant, but…]]></summary>

Far from the Seine river where a beluga strayed in early August north of Paris, the estuaries that flow into the bay in northern Canada offer a sanctuary for the small white whales to give birth in relative warm and shelter.
In the murky bay, the belugas, with small dark eyes and what look like wide smiles, seem to enjoy the presence of a cluster of tourists who travelled to the remote town of Churchill -- home to some 800 people and only accessible by train or plane -- to observe the cetaceans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guatemala said Wednesday it had recovered 33 pre-Columbian artifacts that were voluntarily returned from a private collection in Germany.
Through its embassy, Guatemala "recovered 15 pieces and 18 archaeological fragments that were identified as part of the cultural heritage of our country," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
"Guatemala is grateful for the voluntary return of the objects that form an important part of the country's history, and it gives hope that other holders of similar pieces in private collections may take this same step," the ministry added.
The objects included bowls, other vessels and ceramic figurines dating from the periods between 1,000 BC and 250 AD, and 250-900 AD.
The Maya civilization reached its height in what is present-day southern Mexico and Guatemala, as well as parts of Belize, El Salvador and Honduras, between 250 and 900 AD.

The industry is trying to adapt to this onerous new reality through a variety of techniques, from bringing back forgotten grape varieties to moving their vineyards to new locations.
Winegrowers have had to start their harvests early in several French regions because of the summer’s searing heatwaves. In the southwestern Languedoc-Roussillon, they kicked off the harvest period at the end of July. In Haute-Corse, the northern part of Corsica, they began harvesting at the beginning of August. Both regions carried out their harvests one to three weeks earlier than usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dressed in jeans, sweatpants and abayas, dozens of Ethiopian schoolgirls practice the art of nailing a landing and finding their balance -- and their confidence -- as they zip across a skatepark in Addis Ababa.
Some gingerly slide forward a few meters, holding a friend's hand for support, while others zoom across ramps and concrete bumps at full speed.
Members of Ethiopian Girl Skaters, an all-female group set up by skateboarders Sosina Challa and Micky Asfaw, the girls -- some as young as six -- are pushing back against gender stereotypes and having fun doing it.
Challa, 24, told AFP she set up the organization to empower young women, who often struggle to take up extreme sports because of a commonly-held belief in Ethiopia that "girls should stay home and help their parents".
Since she co-founded the group in December 2020, she and the other mentors in the organization have taught more than 150 girls how to skate.
Hanna Bless, a 22-year-old stylist who started skateboarding two years ago, told AFP: "It's not really common for a girl to start skating because people don't support you.
"But somebody had to be the first, some group had to start and we were the first one and I feel honored to be part of that," she added.
Although Ethiopia is home to many skateboarding groups, they are largely dominated by male skaters.
With time, the women skateboarders have learned to cope not just with the inevitable bruises the sport brings but also the criticism from naysayers.
Iman Mahamud, 17, told AFP that after 18 months of lessons, she no longer cared about "what people say about me being a girl and doing such stuff".
"It helped me defeat my fears," she said.
"I just enjoy it. It makes me happy."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of QAnon believers over the weekend tried to conduct citizens arrests of police officers in the city of Peterborough, Ontario -- and then promptly got thrown into the slammer themselves.
As Vice News reports, the QAnon faithful were in the city at the behest of Romana Didulo, the so-called "QAnon Queen" who earlier this year declared herself to be the "Leader of the World" during an event at a campground parking lot.
Didulo instructed her supporters to arrest the Peterborough officers for enforcing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as mask requirements.
As Vice News recounts, Didulo's plan resulted in one follower being "charged with two counts of assaulting police" another follower being slapped with "charges of mischief and resisting arrest" and a third being "arrested and charged with a myriad of charges, including assaulting a peace officer with a weapon."

Peterborough Mayor Diane Therrien took to Twitter on Tuesday to profanely mock the QAnon believers who thought they could get away with arresting her city's police officers.
"People have been asking me to comment on the events of the past weekend," she wrote. "I hate giving airtime/spotlight to these imbeciles. Here is my comment: f*ck off, you f*ckwads."

Researchers say that the lava flow at a volcano in Iceland that started erupting earlier this month has slowed down in the past few days.
According to measurements by researchers at the University of Reykjavik, the lava flow was only moving at two metres per second on Tuesday. This number is subject to change, however.
The researchers said it is not possible to say whether the slowing lava flow is that the eruption is coming to an end or whether it is just a temporary slowdown.
The eruption started in a valley near Fagradalsfjall mountain on the Reykjanes peninsula south-west of Reykjavik, on August 3.
Thousands of tourists have visited the site of the eruption, a chasm which is hundreds of metres long.
To the annoyance of the Icelandic authorities, onlookers have repeatedly strayed into the lava field.
The path to the eruption site is to remain closed on Wednesday due to a storm warning.

The group's former leader, Mike Dunn, has been fighting in Ukraine already, but he says at least ten new members are headed to the front to "help." Ukrainians on the ground have seen American "soldiers" waving tropical-looking flags, assuming they're coming as far away as Hawaii, but that isn't the case. 
"The movement made its way offline and onto American streets in early 2020, when groups of young men in Hawaiian shirts carrying AR-style rifles started showing up to anti-lockdown protests," explained Vice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has suggested that racism is behind a lack of international attention being paid to the plight of civilians in Ethiopia's war-shattered Tigray region.
Calling it the "worst humanitarian crisis in the world", with 6 million people unable to access basic services, Tedros questioned in an emotional appeal why the situation is not getting the same attention as the Ukraine conflict.
"Maybe the reason is the colour of the skin of the people," Tedros, who is from Tigray, told a virtual media briefing on Wednesday. In April this year at a briefing, he questioned whether "black and white lives" in emergencies worldwide are given equal attention.
WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan also hit out at an apparent shortage of concern about the drought and famine unfolding in the Horn of Africa, and the ensuing health crisis.
"No one seems to give a damn about what's happening in the Horn of Africa," said Ryan, speaking at a virtual media briefing on Wednesday.
The WHO called for $123.7 million to tackle the health problems resulting from growing malnutrition in the region, where around 200 million people live and millions are going hungry.

LOIREAUXENCE, France (Reuters) - France's river Loire, famous for the hundreds of castles gracing its shores, is a shallow river at the best of times, but this year even its flat-bottom tourist barges can barely navigate waters greatly reduced by a record drought.
Even some 100 kilometers from where the Loire empties into the Atlantic Ocean, sand banks now stretch as far as the eye can see, large islands connect to the shore and in places people can practically walk from one side of the river to the other.
The Loire valley - a UNESCO World Heritage site famed for majestic chateaux such as Chambord, Chenonceau and Azay-le-Rideau - has suffered historically low water levels before, but this year's drought should be a wake-up call, said Eric Sauquet.
