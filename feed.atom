BEIRUT — In an anxiously anticipated speech Wednesday, Hasan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party, promised there would be a “response and punishment” to the assassination of a senior Hamas official in Beirut on Tuesday that was ascribed to Israel and raised fears of a wider regional war. 
The official, Saleh Arouri, was the highest-ranking Hamas leader killed since the start of the conflict in October, when Hamas militants flooded into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostages. 
The location of the strike Tuesday — in Dahieh, a densely populated residential neighborhood on the edge of Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway — was seen as especially provocative.
It compounded concerns that the Lebanese militants, who have traded fire with Israel along their shared border but avoided all-out war, might feel compelled to ratchet up their response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Jeffrey Epstein list WILL be released with first names dropping today: 'Jane Doe' 107 and three others to remain secret for 30 days 
* The names will be released on a rolling basis by Southern District of New York 
* Jane Doe 107 and three others will retain anonymity for another 30 days 
* Bill Clinton is among those expected to be named in the documents 
* Alan Dershowitz says being named doesn't equate committing a crime 
A long-awaited list of 187 of Jeffrey Epstein's friends and associates will be released with the first names dropping today, the court which holds the papers has confirmed. 
The list of names is part of a settled lawsuit filed by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell. 
The case was settled in 2017, but Giuffre - and many others - have long called for the names to become public. 
The process was thrown into chaos by a request by Jane Doe 107, one of the women involved, who has been given a 30 day extension to prove that she will be in danger if she is publicly unmasked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The case of actor Gerard Depardieu, charged with rape and facing other accusations of sexual assault, has exposed a major split in French cinema, extending into politics and wider society.
A petition to support the actor has been challenged by a wave of open letters denouncing years of reprehensible behaviour, while the case has caused an apparent rift between French President Emmanuel Macron and his culture minister.
An icon of French cinema for half a century after rocketing to fame in the mid 1970s, Depardieu was charged in 2020 with rape and has been targeted by two other complaints alleging sexual assault, as well as other accusations published in media.
He denies any wrongdoing.

Junior doctors -- those below consultant level -- started a six-day walkout, in a major escalation of their long-running pay dispute with the UK government.
The industrial action comes at one of the busiest times of the year for the state-funded NHS, when it faces increased pressure from winter respiratory illnesses.
It also quickly follows a three-day strike held by doctors just before Christmas.
The NHS said the latest stoppage, which could see up to half of the medical workforce on picket lines, would have "a significant impact on almost all routine care".

The 7.5-magnitude quake on January 1 that rattled Ishikawa prefecture on the main island of Honshu triggered tsunami waves more than a meter high, sparked a major fire and tore apart roads.
The Noto Peninsula on the Sea of Japan coast was most severely hit, with buildings ravaged by fire and houses flattened in several towns, including Wajima and Suzu, as shown by before-and-after satellite images.
The regional government announced Wednesday that 62 people had been confirmed dead and more than 300 injured, 20 of them seriously.
The toll was expected to climb as rescuers battle aftershocks and poor weather to comb throu…]]></summary>

At least 103 people have been killed and 170 wounded after two explosions rocked a ceremony that was being held to mark the 2020 assassination of Iran's top commander Qassem Soleimani in a US drone attack. 
The first explosion was quickly followed by a second close to a cemetery in the southeastern city of Kerman where thousands had gathered to mark the four-year anniversary of Soleimani's killing. 
Harrowing video showed scores of bloodied victims lying on the floor as others stumbled away from the blast scene close to the Saheb al-Zaman Mosque where Soleimani is buried in what Iran has described as a 'terrorist attack'.

More leaders are pursuing their ends militarily. More believe they can get away with it. 
Can we stop things falling apart? 
2024 begins with wars burning in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine and peacemaking in crisis. Worldwide, diplomatic efforts to end fighting are failing. More leaders are pursuing their ends militarily. More believe they can get away with it.

War has been on the rise since about 2012, after a decline in the 1990s and early 2000s. First came conflicts in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, triggered by the 2011 Arab uprisings. Libya’s instability spilled south, helping set off a protracted crisis in the Sahel region. A fresh wave of major combat followed: the 2020 Azerbaijani-Armenian war over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, horrific fighting in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region that began weeks later, the conflict prompted by the Myanmar army’s 2021 power grab, and Russia’s 2022 assault on Ukraine. Add to those 2023’s devastation in Sudan and Gaza. Around the globe, more people are dying in fighting, being forced from their homes, or in need of life-saving aid than in decades.

RT: Putin names Russia’s real enemies

 
Ukraine itself is not a foe, but Western elites backing it are, the Russian president has said  
Ukraine is a mere tool in the hands of the collective West which is using it to fight Russia, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. 
He was speaking at a military hospital in Moscow where he met servicemen wounded during the ongoing conflict. 
Asked about the enduring Western support for Kiev, the president said the elites of the collective West were actually the true enemy of Russia, rather than Ukraine itself.

The Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024. 
In a new year's message, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said troop deployments were being adjusted to prepare for "prolonged fighting". 
Daniel Hagari said some troops - especially reservists - would be withdrawn to allow them to regroup. 
"These adaptations are intended to ensure the planning and preparation for continuing the war in 2024," he said. 
"The IDF must plan ahead out of an understanding that there will be additional missions and the fighting will continue the rest of the year."

Update #1: IDF says it expects war to last all of 2024 (GMA/ABC News)
 
Update #2: Israeli military expects Hamas war to last all of 2024 (The Hill) 
WNU Editor: Israel is sending the message that this conflict is now going to be a war of attrition. For the population of Gaza they are now going to be faced with two options. Storm the border with Egypt to flee this carnage, or stay and die slowly. 
 Update #3: There are some reports in Israel making the prediction that this war may last well into 2025. Sighhh .... can anyone say "quagmire".]]></summary>

Israel withdrew tanks from parts of Gaza City on Monday, part of a previously announced plan to respond to changing military needs in Gaza, and to safeguard the Israeli economy. 
 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are expected to continue operations in Gaza for months, focusing on “mopping up” Hamas militants, rather than a full-scale invasion, reported Reuters. 
 
The Hamas attack on Oct. 7 detonated the months-long war between Israel and the terrorist group, resulting in an Israeli invasion, a 20,000-plus death toll and a humanitarian crisis for the rest of the territory’s population.

CAIRO (Reuters) - British maritime security firm Ambrey said on Tuesday that a Malta-flagged container ship reported seeing three explosions towards its port quarter, 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Yemen's Mocha. 
The vessel master was heard over VHF, calling a coalition warship, the firm added.

Ambrey said it understood that three missiles had been fired from the direction of Yemen's Taiz Governorate. 
A nearby vessel reported seeing a small boat, about 50 metres (160 feet) in length, and with two lights, within 1 mile (1.6 km) of the incident location soon afterwards, the firm added.

Turkey says it has seized 34 people who are alleged to have been involved in spying and planning abductions for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. 
Officials said 57 addresses were raided in Istanbul and elsewhere and they were still searching for 12 more suspects. 
There was no immediate comment from Israel, but relations between the two countries have declined dramatically during Israel's war with Hamas. 
 Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya shared video of Operation Mole taking place. 
He said authorities had moved in after they had decided that Israeli intelligence was seeking to carry out "tactical tasks such as reconnaissance, pursuit, assault, and kidnapping against foreign nationals residing in our country".

"In cases where it makes most sense for our customers, vessels will be rerouted and continue their journey around the Cape of Good Hope."

* The Navy's new aircraft carrier is returning to the US after being sent into waters near Israel. 
* The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group was sent to stop the Israel-Hamas war from expanding. 
* The CSG's deployment was repeatedly extended. 
The US Navy is finally bringing the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group home after it was abruptly tasked to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the Israel-Hamas war and kept at sea longer than planned. 
The Ford carrier strike group was sent to the eastern Mediterranean in October during its first full deployment in an effort to "contribute to our regional deterrence and defense posture," the Navy said in a statement.

The Alvand class destroyer had been a part of the Iranian navy's 34th fleet 
Iran's Alborz warship has reportedly entered the Red Sea, emerging at a time of heightened tensions in the key shipping route amid ongoing attacks on vessels in response to the Israel-Hamas war. 
Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported Monday that the vessel had entered the Red Sea through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, though it was unclear precisely when. 
Tasnim did not give details of the Alborz's mission but said Iranian warships had been operating in open waters to secure shipping routes, combat piracy, and carry out other tasks since 2009.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russia pounded Ukraine's two biggest cities in a new wave of heavy air strikes on Tuesday, killing at least five civilians and prompting calls for the West to quickly provide more military assistance. 
The missile and drone attacks on the capital Kyiv and the northeastern city of Kharkiv also wounded dozens of people, caused widespread damage and hit power supplies, officials said. 
Russia has intensified its attacks over the New Year period, with President Vladimir Putin warning on Monday that a Ukrainian air strike on the Russian city of Belgorod, which Moscow said killed 25 civilians, would "not go unpunished".

IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi is among those who have been warned that South Africa's petition could be successful, the outlet reported, and a hearing on how the government should deal with the matter was held Monday at the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Record numbers of migrants crossing the hostile Darien gap jungle in 2023 included 120,000 minors, the Panama government said Monday.
The year ended with 520,085 people recorded as traversing the lawless, thick rainforest that straddles Panama and Colombia, Panama's public security ministry wrote on Twitter.
Most of those braving the crossing, which can take up to six days, were fleeing economic misery in Venezuela, with more than 320,000 risking it all in the jungle this year.
Ecuadorans and Haitians were the next biggest groups, while over 25,000 Chinese citizens also took on the trek.
Vietnamese, Afghans and citizens of Cameroon or Burkina Faso were also recorded.
The number of migrants crossing the Darien Gap has more than doubled since 2022, when 248,000 passed through.
Panama authorities in September announced a series of measures to try and contain the surge in migration, such as an increase in deportations of people who enter the country illegally.
Migrants face rivers, wild animals, and violent criminal gangs in the jungle.
Upon arrival in Panama, they head to Costa Rica, and then Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, before making their way to the United States border.]]></summary>

Kai Zhuang, age 17, was reported missing on Thursday after his parents in China told officials at his host high school in Riverdale, Utah that he appeared to have been kidnapped and a ransom had been requested.
The case followed a typical pattern for cyber kidnapping, in which "kidnappers" tell a victim to isolate and provide pictures of oneself as if being held captive -- photos that are then sent to the victim's family to extort a payment.
The victims comply under the belief their family will otherwise be harmed.

His detention was the latest in a wave of arrests under iron-fisted leftist President Daniel Ortega, which began on December 20 with the detention of Bishop Isidoro Mora.

El Pais: Two million Ukrainian civil servants face salary cut-off if Western aid dries up 
Ukraine needs the economic lifeline of its Western allies. Without a fresh injection of funds to keep the machinery of state running, Kyiv — which has been at war with Russia for almost 700 days and which devotes a large part of its budget to defense — will be forced to leave up to two million public employees with unpaid salaries and a further million without social benefits in the first quarter of 2024. These are the conclusions of an analysis of the country’s financial situation sent by the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy to the United States, the European Union and other Western allies, and to which EL PAÍS has had access. Ukraine has urged Washington and Brussels to move forward with aid packages totaling some €100 billion ($110 billion), which remain frozen and pending approval due to political friction in the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament.

If Western aid is not supplied, expect a complete collapse of services by summer, and a new migration of Ukrainians fleeing the country for a better life in the West. The only thing that will be left behind are the soldiers fighting the war, and the old who not able to leave.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Week: Ukraine faces soldier shortage as war with Russia drags on 
It's been nearly two years since Russia's still-ongoing invasion of Ukraine shocked the world and galvanized Western nations to a degree unseen since the Cold War. In that time, tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have been estimated killed in battle, alongside hundreds of thousands of their Russian counterparts, according to the Kyiv Post. All told, recent U.S. intelligence estimates that Russia has lost "nearly 90% of the personnel it had when the conflict began," Reuters reported — a staggering figure that brings into focus the sheer size and scale of the past two years of warfare. 
Still, in spite of what is allegedly a nearly 1-1 turnover in the Russian military since the start of the war, it's Ukraine which now finds itself at a loss for manpower — even as the conflict between both countries seems to have stagnated into a protracted stalemate. Under siege by a vastly larger global superpower, the Ukrainian armed forces have spent months struggling to replenish their ranks and regain momentum against a foe with a seemingly bottomless reserve of potential new recruits. With lagging enlistment an existential concern for Ukraine, the country has embarked on a major effort to expand its ranks, all while continuing to make the case for foreign aid to help support the ongoing war effort.

Politico:  The global elections Washington should be watching in 2024 
Countries representing half the world population will head to the polls in what’s been dubbed the biggest election year in history. 
2024 is set to put democracy through its most sweeping test yet.

Dubbed the biggest election year in history, more than 60 countries representing half the world population — some 4 billion people — will hold regional, legislative and presidential elections that look set to shake up political institutions and ramp up geopolitical tensions. 
As the United States looks inward, bracing for a likely showdown between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, other countries are also preparing for possible incumbent oustings, raucous public protests and populist movements with the potential to destabilize larger regions.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
