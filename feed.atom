US President Joe Biden appeared confused as to who was responsible to open up proceedings during a virtual meeting with governors on reproductive rights on Saturday.

"They forgot to give him his notes," Mr Dean said.

"The bumbling covers an awful lot of sinister stuff that's going on in the background."]]></summary>

“Australia is all in on the NATO project,” he told Sky News Australia.

“The significance there is NATO is expanding its focus to our part of the world, (and) extremely concerned about the new relationship with no limits that’s been formed between Russia and China.”

Mr Lloyd said Australia is “fully engaged” and recognises the impact of the Ukraine conflict on Europe and Africa.

“We’ve agreed to do what we can to help supply agricultural products and energy into markets that desperately need it,” he said.]]></summary>

The bank stated if people disagree with the company’s values they are “welcome” to close their accounts.

Ms Panahi said the United States has "completely lost control" of its southern border under Biden's administration while "border czar" Kamala Harris has done nothing to stem the tide.

"Record numbers are crossing illegally and tragically many people are being brutalised, raped and even killed due to the evil people smuggling trade," Ms Panahi said.

"The cost of gross incompetence, the cost of losing control of your borders and allowing the most evil trade to prosper. That is the legacy that Kamala Harris shares with Joe Biden."]]></summary>

“Obama and then Biden had both talked a very big game on climate action, but neither had the support of Congress to actually get meaningful reforms through,” he told Sky News Australia.

“These sort of things with such sweeping impacts need to be decided by Congress and Biden is just unable to deliver that.

The panel’s vote clears the way for the FDA to push manufacturers to make reformulated boosters in time for the Biden administration to offer them later this year, ahead of an expected winter surge of the virus.
The decision came after a day of thinking about where the virus is heading and how best to tackle it.  A senior FDA official called it “science at its toughest.”  One committee member described the data as “uncomfortably sparse”.

I have to believe that mine is not an uncommon situation.  What other ways can I prove to a future landlord that I can pay the rent?

Tesla sells more electric cars than any other company and until recently was growing rapidly in China, Europe and the United States as rising gas prices increased battery appeal.  The company continues to weather supply chain turmoil better than competitors like General Motors and Toyotaboth of which reported a sharp drop in sales on Friday.
Demand for cars, especially electric cars, is plentiful, but shortages of semiconductors and other key components are forcing buyers to wait several months for deliveries.

Military says one UAV downed by F16 fighter jet, the other two by missiles launched from ship; terror group has warned it will attack site; Lebanon claims field is disputed  The Israel Defenses Forces said Saturday it successfully intercepted three drones flown by the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group that were heading for the Karish gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast.  Tensions have risen over the site in recent weeks, after a gas production vessel arrived in Israel to launch extraction operations in the offshore field, drawing condemnation from Lebanon, which had laid claim to parts of it. Israel says Karish is in part of its UN-recognized exclusive economic zone.

He was scratching a frozen wall of earth.  Suddenly a big chunk came out.  With him was the body of a baby woolly mammoth, frozen and preserved with its hair and skin.
“I thought it was a baby buffalo at first,” said Mudry, 31, from Alberta.  “And then I came out, and I was inspecting it, and there was a trunk, so I had no words.”


The mammoth was dark and shiny, Mr. Mudry said, with short legs and deep, pronounced eye sockets.  It had a lean, wrinkled trunk and a stub of tail.  He quickly waved to a colleague and called his boss, Brian McCaughan, the co-founder of a family-owned gold mining business called T…]]></summary>

Astronomers hope the James Webb Space Telescope will reveal whether any of these planets harbor atmospheres that could support life.
Identifying an atmosphere in another solar system would be quite remarkable.  But there’s even a chance, albeit a tiny one, that one of these atmospheres offers what’s called a biosignature: a signal from life itself.

With his one-year-old daughter on his shoulders and his pregnant wife beside him, he crossed the Rio Grande from the Mexican city of Piedras Negras into Eagle Pass, Texas -- a dangerous journey that thousands of migrants undertake every year seeking a better future.
"I was afraid for my daughter in the river. I feel tired, defeated, but with the dream of working if the immigration services listen to us with their hearts," says the 30-year-old Guatemalan.
The family left their home in Honduras because of crime and a lack of work, and made the long trip by train and on foot to get here.

"Greater ambition is required at all levels to address the dire state of the ocean," the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon said in its final declaration.
The meeting in the Portuguese capital -- attended by government officials, experts and advocates from 140 countries -- is not a negotiating forum.
But it sets the agenda for final international negotiations in August on a treaty to protect the high seas -- those international waters beyond national jurisdiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A series of strong earthquakes rocked southern Iran on Saturday, killing at least five people and causing damage to dozens of buildings, state media reported.
The quakes, including two of magnitude 6.0, struck west of the major port city of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan province, the US Geological Survey said.
The first rattled an area north of the town of Dezhgan shortly after 2:00 am (2130 GMT), before a 5.7 tremor hit two hours later followed quickly by the second 6.0 magnitude quake, said the USGS.
Hormozgan governor Mehdi Dousti said five people were killed, as cited by the official news agency IRNA.
Dousti said most of the damage occurred in the village of Sayeh Khosh, close to the epicenter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon reached a record level during the first half of 2022, the INPE national space agency said Friday.
The world's largest tropical rainforest lost 3,750 square kilometers (1,450 square miles) of jungle since the beginning of the year, the worst numbers for that period since record-keeping began in 2016.
The previous worst figure of 3,605 square kilometers was set last year.
The new figure does not even include the final six days of June.
This year has seen the worst June in 15 years for forest fires.
Monthly records were also beaten in January and February, when deforestation is usually lower, and in April.
INPE satellites identified more than 2,500 fires in the Amazon last month, the largest number since more than 3,500 were recorded in June 2007, and an 11 percent increase over June 2021.
More than 7,500 fires have been recorded since the start of the year, another 17 percent increase on 2021 and the worst numbers since 2010.
"The dry season has barely begun in the Amazon and already we're beating environmental destruction records," said Cristiane Mazzetti, from Greenpeace Brazil.
Environmentalists and opposition figures accuse the government of President Jair Bolsonaro of implementing policies that encourage big businesses to damage the environment.
"The impact of this negligence will be the increasing loss of the resilience of these surroundings, not to mention the damage done to local communities and health," said Mariana Napolitano, of the Brazilian World Wildlife Fund.
Bolsonaro has encouraged mining and farming activity in protected areas.
Critics also accuse him of supporting impunity for gold prospectors, farmers and logging traffickers involved in illegal deforestation.
Last year, the main government environmental protection body spent only 41 percent of its surveillance budget, according to the Climate Observatory NGO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — At least three people were killed by an earthquake in southern Iran early Saturday morning, state television reported.
“Unfortunately, so far we have had three fatalities and eight injuries,” Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of emergency management for Hormozgan province on Iran’s Persian Gulf coast, said in the report.
Iranian media said the quake had a magnitude of 6.1, while the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Center put it at 6.0.  The quake struck at a depth of 10 kilometers, or just over six miles, the European monitoring group said.  Tremors were felt in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.


Major geological faults crisscross Iran, which has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Tropical storm Bonnie made landfall near the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border on Friday evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Heavy rainfall is expected across Nicaragua and Costa Rica
through Saturday, along with life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, the center added.
The storm is likely to weaken as it crosses land, only to re-intensify over the eastern Pacific on Saturday night and Sunday, the center added.
The storm packed maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts before it made landfall, the NHC said.

Breaking Defense:  DoD agency wants to put weapons monitors on the ground in Ukraine 
“Once we have more people in country, we should be in a position to actually go do more physical validation [and] verification, going forward,” said Jed Royal, deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. 
WASHINGTON:  The Defense Department agency responsible for overseeing foreign arms sales would like to have a presence on the ground to monitor the use of US weapons in Ukraine, but when that will happen is still unclear, its deputy director said Thursday. 
“We do think that over time, we would like to be able to extend our insights with a greater presence on the ground going forward,” Jed Royal, deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, told reporters during a roundtable. 
During peacetime, DSCA sends personnel to a foreign nation to open warehouses and arms bunkers to examine equipment and check the serial numbers of high-value weapon systems, Royal said. “Right now, in Ukraine, that’s just not available to us as a tool.”

At a nighttime happening, young women danced in tunics made of polyurethane birch logs and ponchos studded with foam rocks resembling riverbeds.  Like elves of nature, the dancers frolicked on “nature carpets”, foam carpets made by the Turin artist Piero Gilardi.  Guests sipped their Camparis lying on mock cabbage patches.
In the radical sass of a forest glade-like nightclub, Gilardi delivered a serious message, embodying the ecological lesson of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.”” wrote a few years ago: Chemicals were poisoning the earth.  Nature begins at home.  Live with it, respect it, protect it.

* The survey, which polled a pool of 1,000 US voters, was conducted by the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics in May 
* Thirty-seven percent who supported armed insurrection against the government currently own guns, the poll found 
* The survey found that overall, 49 per cent of Americans agreed that they 'more and more feel like a stranger in my own country' 
More than quarter of Americans - 28 per cent - said that it might 'soon be necessary to take up arms' against the US government, according to a new poll released Thursday. 
Of those who felt that way, 37 per cent currently own guns, the poll found. 
The poll also showed that a majority of Americans - liberal and conservative both - felt that their government was 'corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me.'

        <updated>2022-07-01T23:10:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuesday's breathtaking testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson before the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol is a turning point in how Donald Trump is viewed by Republicans, a former GOP governor explained on CNN.
Wolf Blitzer interviewed former two-term Ohio Gov. John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Kasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.
"Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?" Blitzer asked.
 "Oh yeah. he's taking on water," Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.
"And he's shrinking," he continued. "You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting."
"And I feel that he's melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, 'You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.' The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman's testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath," he said. "If they don't agree with her story, with what she's been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath."
"The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It's hard for me to believe in our country we would've had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much. I never felt he was fit for the office and it's all proven out to be true, unfortunately," he said.
Watch:

Oil shippers are using several tactics to conceal that their crude cargoes are from Russia, sources told the Guardian, as Europe and the US try to stem imports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States, as supporters denounced the British government.
Assange, who turns 51 on Sunday, has been held in a high-security prison since 2019.
On Friday his wife Stella was among dozens of people who demonstrated outside Britain's interior ministry to demand his release.
Home Secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition last month, but court officials confirmed to AFP an application to appeal had been received on Friday.
"We're not at the end of the road here," Stella Assange, who married the Australian publisher earlier this year, told reporters when Patel announced her decision.
"We're going to fight this. We're going to use every appeal avenue." 
Assange is wanted to face trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010, related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
He could face decades in jail if found guilty, but supporters portray him as a martyr to press freedom after he was taken into UK custody following a years-long stay in Ecuador's embassy.
"He's been in prison for telling the truth," supporter Gloria Wildman, 79, told AFP at Friday's protest.
"If Julian Assange is not free, neither are we, none of us is free," she said.]]></summary>

Bachman, who wrote the original "American Woman" with his band The Guess Who, was in Tokyo for the emotional handover on Friday -- 46 years after his cherished orange Gretsch was snatched from a Toronto hotel.
"Wow," a stunned Bachman said, holding the guitar lovingly and tuning it up on stage before playing in a special concert at the Canadian Embassy.

Haines told a Washington conference June 29, 2022, that the Russia-Ukraine war “remains a grinding struggle" in which the Russians are making "no breakthrough.”   
Reuters: Putin still wants most of Ukraine, war outlook grim -U.S. intelligence chief 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to seize most of Ukraine, but his forces are so degraded by combat that they likely can only achieve incremental gains in the near term, the top U.S. intelligence officer said Wednesday.
Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, outlining the current U.S. intelligence assessment of the more than four-month war, said that the consensus of U.S. spy agencies is that it will grind on "for an extended period of time." 
"In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia's attitude toward the West is hardening," Haines told a Commerce Department conference. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinskiy this week told U.S. President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders that he wants the war over by the end of the year.

WNU Editor: Nothing official from the Kremlin yet.

If this happens it will be a major escalation, and one that is not surprising. IMHO the Russia - Ukraine conflict is going to be a long war, and considering the amount of ordinances that are being used and the loss of military personnel, concerns that Russia will soon be shifting to a war economy are justified.]]></summary>

But new this year is a return to the great interior.

When Alex Lawther’s frail Danish prince drags himself onto the stage in Robert Icke’s modern production of “Hamlet,” which kicked off Tuesday night at the Park Avenue Armory, he is reminded of 19th-century poets Arthur Rimbaud and Percy Shelley, a bright but discouraged young man.  who seems intent on his grief – and a tragic end.

Newsweek: Russia, Ukraine Pull Off Humongous Prisoner Swap as Fierce Battles Continue 
The Ukrainian military remained locked in fierce battles with invading forces while the countries exchanged a total of over 280 soldiers in the war's largest prisoner swap. 
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, also known as HUR, announced that 144 Ukrainian soldiers had been released as part of the exchange on Wednesday. The same number of Russian soldiers were released by Ukraine, according to a post to the Telegram account of Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russian separatist government in Ukraine's Donetsk region.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: According to Russian sources Ukraine gave a list of 15,000 names that they believe are being held as prisoners of war by Russia and the two Donetsk republics. Apparently the real number is higher!!!!! Last month the Russian-backed separatists alone were saying that they had 8,000 prisoners .... Russia-Backed Separatists Claim to Hold 8,000 Ukrainian POWs (Moscow Times). 
No official numbers of Russian prisoners held by Ukraine have been released. According to Ukrainian sources that I trust the number is a few hundred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: Fresh round of Iran nuclear talks ends with no progress 
A new round of indirect nuclear talks aimed at reviving the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal ended Wednesday without any progress, a senior U.S. official said.   
Why it matters: These talks might be the last chance for the parties to reach an agreement before the nuclear deal becomes irrelevant, as Iran has taken steps to advance its nuclear program and limit the work of UN inspectors.   
What they're saying: "The Iranians have not demonstrated any sense of urgency, raised old issues that have been settled for months, and even raised new issues that are unrelated to the 2015 nuclear agreement. A deal has been available for some time," the senior U.S. official said. 
* "If there is a side that needs to take a decision, it’s them — and it’s been them for months," the official added.

The notice, published on Monday afternoon, was attributed to Cai Qi, the Beijing secretary of the Chinese Communist party. 
The original text said: “In the next five years, Beijing will unremittingly grasp the normalisation of epidemic prevention and control.”

        <id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-732247599994189300.post-1225478213508574501</id>
        <link href="https://www.newsrust.com/2022/07/accepted-review-reaching-for-stars.html"/>
        <updated>2022-06-30T22:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In “Accepted,” director Dan Chen takes us into the world of TM Landry, a private school in Louisiana whose videos of African-American students garnering Ivy League college acceptances have gone viral.  But nine months after the filmmakers’ first visit to the school, the New York Times published reports of physical abuse, tampered transcripts and “bigoted” behavior from its founders, Mike and Tracey Landry.  “Accepted” viewers get a front-row seat to experience the shattering impact of the school’s collapse through the stories of four promising high school students: Adia, Alicia, Cathy and Issac.
As we watch both the documentary’s subjects — and its director — navigate shocking real-time development, a quiet probing film emerges that pierces the mythos of America’s meritocracy.


Chen makes the choice to walk at the same measured pace throughout — even after the TM Landry scandal came to light — and forgo the cryptic notation we’re used to hearing when the jig is up.  Likewise, Chen and Daphne Qin Wu’s cinematography seamlessly oscillates between intimate handheld shots and aerial views of western Louisiana landscapes that reflect the eventual loss of access to the Landrys and the ‘school.


Ultimately, it’s the resilience of the film’s teenage subjects that elevates “Accepted” to new heights.  As they sit for close-ups in front of a swirling blue backdrop, the Georgetown and Stanford sweatshirts are gone, and the hopes they once held.  But in their place is a clear understanding of the misguided pressures on individual minority students to succeed in a society that systematically disadvantages them, and a surprisingly powerful story about peace with imperfection.
