Exit polls show ex-premier Benjamin Netanyahu's party securing the most seats in parliament. 
It's Israel's fifth national election since 2019.  Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing allies secured an early lead in Israel's latest national election, according to exit polls released on Tuesday night after voting closed. 
Exit polls published by Israeli broadcasters showed former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and allied parties close to securing a majority in the 120-seat Knesset.

WNU Editor: Netanyahu is no friend of the Biden White House. He has also vowed to undo the US brokered maritime deal with Lebanon. It looks like there is going to be a lot of friction between the U.S. and Israel.

FOX News: US, Saudi Arabia on high alert over intel of impending Iranian attack: report 
Planned strikes are believed to be targeting Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
The United States and Saudi Arabia are on high alert after Saudi intelligence shared with the U.S. indicated that Iran is expected to carry out an attack on targets in Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Officials from both countries reportedly told the Journal about the concern over coming attacks. Saudi officials said that in addition to Saudi Arabia, Iran is also looking to strike Erbil, Iraq, where U.S. troops are located. 
The planned attacks are said to be intended as a distraction from protests taking place in Iran against the Islamic nation's leadership.

WNU Editor: I follow Iran very closely. I have seen no uptick in military positioning or movement. I would be shocked if Iran does launch strikes against Saudi Arabia. 
All that I can say is let us pray that such a conflict does not happen. A major war in the Middle East will mean +$200 for a barrel of oil coupled with widespread shortages and rationing. A collapse in supply chains and the global economy. A severe recession, or more likely a severe depression with massive unemployment and social unrest.

Leaked Documents Outline DHS’s Plans to Police Disinformation 
The Department of Homeland Security is quietly broadening its efforts to curb speech it considers dangerous, an investigation by The Intercept has found. 
Years of internal DHS memos, emails, and documents — obtained via leaks and an ongoing lawsuit, as well as public documents — illustrate an expansive effort by the agency to influence tech platforms. 
The work, much of which remains unknown to the American public, came into clearer view earlier this year when DHS announced a new “Disinformation Governance Board”: a panel designed to police misinformation (false information spread unintentionally), disinformation (false information spread intentionally), and malinformation (factual information shared, typically out of context, with harmful intent) that allegedly threatens U.S. interests. 
While the board was widely ridiculed, immediately scaled back, and then shut down within a few months, other initiatives are underway as DHS pivots to monitoring social media now that its original mandate — the war on terror — has been wound down.

Tina Brown, author of 'The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor - the Truth and the Turmoil', told The Telegraph ahead of the release of her new book earlier this year that the Duke of Sussex's "whole personality has changed".

"He’s so emotionally needy that he’s been completely and utterly taken over by Meghan and his whole personality has changed. It’s a really sad thing to a great many people," she told the publication.

"Meghan seems to answer some huge need in Harry and it seems like they are in a powerful co-dependency. And I do question how it will end."]]></summary>

Blinken (left) meets with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the margins of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly High Level Week, in New York City. Credit: U.S. State Department photo   
The Diplomat: Blinken, Wang Have First China-US Talks Since 20th Party Congress 
Chinese foreign minister stressed to his U.S. counterpart that Washington should not expect Beijing to change course. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked on the phone on Monday. It was their first conversation — and the first high-level China-U.S. exchange — since the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) concluded on October 22. 
At the party meeting, Wang was elevated to the party’s Politburo. That indicates he is to replace outgoing Yang Jiechi as China’s top diplomat – formally, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, the CCP’s foreign policy body. Wang will move out of his foreign minister post along with the promotion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Russia 'suffers deadliest day of invasion yet with nearly a THOUSAND troops killed' as video shows panic-stricken soldiers fleeing on armoured vehicle which flips as it speeds away from Ukrainian attack 
* Ukraine has claimed that 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday as its forces continue to make gains 
* It marks the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin's troops since Russia's the invasion began in back in February 
* Footage has emerged showing panicked soldiers fleeing attack on armoured vehicle - only for it to flip over 
* Comes as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and push them to the front lines, regardless of skill 
Nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in one day in Ukraine, Kyiv has claimed, marking the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin since his troops invaded eight months ago.
Ukrainian forces have been making gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the country's east and in the southern city of Kherson. 
 In a blow to Putin's invasion, 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday, pushing the Russian death toll up to at least 71,200, Kyiv has claimed.

WNU editor: If you want to follow war reports from the Ukraine Ministry of Defense, the link is here (link here) 

I personally follow their reports everyday. But needless to say I am skeptical. And in the past few weeks I have found their reports very hard to believe like the claim that 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday. But they are a reference tool that all those who are following the war should check out each day. 
As for those who want to follow the Russian Ministry of Defense website. It is unfortunately blocked for outsiders. This may change in the future, so the link is here https://eng.mil.ru/]]></summary>

   DW: Norway raises army alert level in response to Ukraine war

Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Monday that his country's military would be put on a raised level of alert as part of increased security measures in response to the war in Ukraine. 
"This is the most severe security situation in several decades," Stoere told a press conference  "

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  A compelling tale of palace intrigues and a love triangle, Maria Stuarda is a masterpiece of Italian romanticised poetic vision of the English imperial court in the Tudor era, loosely based on the historical figures Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587) and her cousin Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland (1533-1603).    Professor Lo Kingman will produce and direct this upcoming production with four live performances. Maestro Wilson Ng will return and join Musica Viva for his second project with the company. The six main roles will be performed by two casts of international and local artists in this operatic gem produced by an all-native creative team, including set designer Isaac Wong, costume designer Andrew Cheung, and lighting designer Zoe Cheung. The opera was last staged in Hong Kong in 1986.      As part of his Tudor trilogy, Donizetti wrote Maria Stuarda with the libretto by Giuseppe Bardari (1817-1861), based on Andrea Maffei’s translation of Friedrich Schiller’s 1800 play Maria Stuart. Fascinated by England in the Tudor period (1485-1603), Donizetti wrote three operas around three queens, namely Anna Bolena (1830), Maria Stuarda (1835) and Roberto Devereux (1837).  Donizetti’s Maria Stuarda is a tragedia lirica (tragic opera) with a troubled performance history even before its premiere. It was so fraught with misfortune that diverted audiences’ attention from the opera’s musical richness. Many think Maria Stuarda includes some of the composer’s best works.  Maria Stuarda premiered at La Scala in Milan in 1835 amid a climate of political censorship and suffered neglect shortly after. This operatic gem was revived in Bergamo, Italy in the mid-20th century and many performances were staged around the world subsequently.  In this operatic interpretation of a royal conflict, where 16th-century England meets 19th-century Europe, Donizetti sheathed the themes of honour, virtue, piety, pride and purity in…]]></summary>

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Russia's weekend backtrack from a U.N.-brokered deal to export Black Sea grains is likely to hit shipments to import-dependent countries, deepening a global food crisis and sparking gains in prices. 
Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat booked for delivery to Africa and the Middle East are at risk following Russia's withdrawal, while Ukrainian corn exports to Europe will get knocked lower, two Singapore-based traders said.

Al Jazeera: Lavrov draws parallels between Ukraine war, Cuban missile crisis  
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says there are ‘similarities’ to the Cuban crisis, mainly because Russia is now threatened by Western weapons in Ukraine. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he hopes US President Joe Biden has the wisdom to deal with a global confrontation similar to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, referencing the war on Ukraine. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the biggest hostilities between Moscow and the West since the Cuban crisis, when the Soviet Union and United States came close to a nuclear war.

WNU Editor: I remember my father telling me that during the Cuban missile crisis he was certain that there would be a nuclear war between the USSR and the United States.

The United States is preparing to deploy up to six nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to northern Australia, a provocative move experts say is aimed squarely at China. 
An investigation by Four Corners can reveal Washington is planning to build dedicated facilities for the giant aircraft at Tindal air base, south of Darwin. 
The US has drawn up detailed plans for what it calls a "squadron operations facility" for use during the Northern Territory dry season, an adjoining maintenance centre and a parking area for "six B-52s".

* Truss was told Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea 
* Radiation could pose threat to Europe if weapon blew in the direction 
* Ms Truss became fixated with the weather after hearing about possibility 
When Liz Truss was told, during the dying days of her mayfly Premiership, that the security services were picking up intelligence that Vladimir Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine it sent a chill down her spine. 
The Prime Minister was still adjusting to getting used to a new mobile phone number, for the first time in over a decade, as a result of a hack suspected to have been backed or orchestrated by the Kremlin, potentially giving Putin access to information about Western support for President Volodymyr Zelensky's regime. 
 In particular, Ms Truss was told that Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea, which would show the West what he was capable of without triggering a full-scale nuclear war.

“If investigations ramp up and Hunter Biden comes to the forefront , and we there’s so much there and we’ve only scratched the surface, the interest of his family is the only thing that can get him to step aside – I think,” Ms McEnany told Jesse Watters.

“But then he loses the pardon power doesn’t he? To pardon his son Hunter Biden if he’s no longer president.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tweet by US President Joe Biden has been fact-checked on Twitter barely two days after Elon Musk finalised his $US44 billion takeover deal of the popular social networking service.

On Friday, the president was called out by Twitter readers for inflating the number of corporations that were making billions, according to Fox News.

In a tweet said to be giving "the facts", Mr Biden claimed that 55 corporations made $US40 billion in 2020 and "paid zero in federal taxes".

The tweet had an "added context" stamp applied to it by readers indicating the Inflation Reduction Act imposed a minimum tax on corporations with average pre-tax earnings greater than $US1 billion.

It also noted "of the 55 corporations mentioned by President Biden, only 14 had earnings greater than $1 billion and would be eligible under Biden’s tax law".]]></summary>

DNYUZ/Newsweek: Putin Should Be Overthrown, Majority of Americans Say: Poll 
A majority of American voters believe seeking to remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power is a “reasonable objective,” according to a new survey conducted exclusively for Newsweek. 
On February 24 Putin ordered his army into Ukraine, triggering one of the biggest wars in Europe since the end of World War II. 
After the Russians initially made significant gains, Ukraine has recaptured some territory over the past couple of months, particularly around the northern city of Kharkiv and Kherson in the south. 
According to the Redfield and Wilton poll, conducted for Newsweek, 60 percent of U.S. voters think seeking to “remove Vladimir Putin from power would be a reasonable objective.”

   CBS News: Republicans head into final week with lead in seats, voters feel things are "out of control" — CBS News Battleground Tracker poll 
The election is already underway; millions have voted, and tens of millions more will before Nov. 8. Amid that, eight in 10 likely voters describe things in the country today as "out of control," as opposed to "under control." 
That doesn't bode well for the party in power: Republicans are winning those who say "out of control" right now by more than 20 points, though they're often the ones feeling that way to begin with.   So where do things stand?

Update #1: The US Senate races appear to be close .... Its a dead heat for the US Senate (FiveThirtyEight).  
Update #2: It looks like some Governor-ships are flipping Republican .... Governor’s Races Enter Final Sprint on a Scrambled, Surprising Map (New York Times).   
WNU Editor: The CBS/YouGov poll does not say how much of their sample size is Democrat/Republican/Independent. 
FiveThirtyEight says it is a dead heat, but when you look at their map projections it looks like the Republicans are going to pick up a minimum of two seats. 
The New York Times assessment on the governor-ships is blunt. A number of Republican pick-ups.
Bottom line. It is going to be a good night if you are a Republican.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen watches soldiers operate equipment during a visit to a naval station on Penghu, an archipelago of several dozen islands off Taiwan's western coast on Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2022. (Taiwan Ministry of National Defense via AP)   
StraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons 
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. 
Defending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. 
Preventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.

WNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.

The same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.]]></summary>
