The vessel passed over sensitive military sites before being downed in February. 
The Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean in early February was built, at least partly, using American off-the-shelf parts, a U.S. official has confirmed to ABC News. 
The official could not say whether any of the American gear was sold illicitly to China but said determining whether any of it came from illegal trade was a topic of serious concern among officials since some items -- like chips -- are forbidden to sell to certain markets.
Later Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said that the balloon not only did not transmit data back to China -- it never collected any.

Paris CNN — Parisian suburbs imposed curfews on Thursday as France saw a third night of protests across the country following the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy that was captured on video. 
France’s elite police force, the RAID, were deployed to the cities of Bordeaux, Lyon, Roubaix and Lille, to help contain the protests.
 Confrontations flared up between protesters and police in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre – where the 17-year-old named Nahel was killed days before – and in the southern port city of Marseille, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. 
Amid burning debris, “vengeance pour Nael” appeared to be spray painted on a wall in Nanterre, which translates to “revenge for Nael” in reference to the slain teenager, according to footage from the suburb.

Daily Wire: Biden Denies Taking Part In Son’s Alleged Shakedown Of Chinese Businessman 
 President Joe Biden denied taking part in his son’s alleged shakedown of a Chinese businessman recently revealed in a 2017 WhatsApp message.

Reporters questioned Biden over the WhatsApp message, revealed last week by IRS whistleblowers who investigated the president’s son’s tax affairs, at the White House on Wednesday. 
The president has so far refused to comment at length about the message that allegedly ties him with his son’s dealings with foreign agents.

“How involved were you in your son’s Chinese shake-down text message? Were you sitting there? Were you involved?” a reporter asked the president.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kremlin said Thursday that footage, which could not be verified, apparently showing President Vladimir Putin greeting adoring supporters proved that he has "astounding" support after quelling an armed insurrection.
Moscow has insisted that Putin's long rule has not been weakened after Wagner mercenaries marched hundreds of kilometers -- almost reaching Moscow -- and captured military facilities in southern Russia, appearing to gain some support.
Putin is rarely seen meeting ordinary Russians, especially since the Covid pandemic, which saw him observe strict isolation rules, with some of those restrictions still in place.
Moscow late on Wednesday released footage of Putin walking up to a cheering group of mostly women in Derbent, an ancient city in the Dagestan region of southern Russia.
"In Derbent, there was an astounding demonstration of support and happiness of the local population," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.
He said Putin "could not refuse" greeting the crowd.
Surrounded by men in suits and a cameraman, the 70-year-old leader reached out over a barrier to shake people's hands.
Then, with his jacket off, he waved goodbye and blew a kiss to the crowd, before getting in a car.
The Kremlin, which has not mentioned Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin by name since his mutiny, has insisted that Putin has not been weakened by the rebellion.
"The data we have show the prevailing and dominating support of the president and the special military operation," Peskov said Thursday using Moscow's official term for the conflict in Ukraine.
Putin has insisted that the mutineers did not galvanize support during their rebellion.
He initially condemned the rebelling Wagner fighters as traitors and vowed tough punishment but after the mutiny was halted, Putin allowed the fighters to go back to their homes, join the regular army or go into exile in Belarus.

FOX News: Biden tells reporters Putin is 'clearly losing the war in Iraq' in latest gaffe: 'Totally lost the plot' 
President Biden made a similar comment the night before at a fundraiser

President Biden faced criticism on social media Wednesday over an apparent gaffe when he claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is currently "losing the war in Iraq." 
"It’s hard to tell, but he’s clearly losing the war in Iraq," Biden told a reporter outside the White House on Wednesday when asked "to what extent" Putin has been weakened by recent events in Russia, including a reported attempt at a mercenary coup. 
"He's losing the war at home, and he has become a bit of a pariah around the world," Biden added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are considered lucky in Japan, and owners of the popular pets spend big on their care. But how do you know when they're feline down?
A tech firm and university in Tokyo have teamed up to produce an app trained on thousands of cat photos that they say can tell you when puss is in pain.
Since its release last month, "Cat Pain Detector" has racked up 43,000 users, mostly in Japan but also in Europe and South America, said Go Sakioka, head of developer Carelogy.
The app is part of a growing array of tech for pet owners concerned for their furry friends' wellbeing, including similar mood and pain trackers made in Canada and Israel.
Carelogy teamed up with Nihon University's College of Bioresource Sciences to gather 6,000 cat photos, in which they carefully studied the positions of the animals' ears, noses, whiskers and eyelids.
They then used a scoring system designed by the University of Montreal to measure minute differences between healthy cats and those suffering pain due to hard-to-spot illnesses.
Next, the app developers fed the information into an AI detection system, which has further refined its skills thanks to around 600,000 photos uploaded by users, Sakioka said.
Now the app "has an accuracy level of more than 90 percent", he told AFP.
According to the Japan Pet Food Association, 60 percent of owners take their cat to a veterinarian at most once a year.
"We want to help cat owners judge more easily at home whether to see a vet or not," Sakioka said.
"Cat Pain Detector" is already being used by some vets in Japan, the land of Hello Kitty, where tourists flock to cat cafes and some small islands are overrun by stray felines.
But "the AI system still needs to be more precise before it's used as a standardIzed tool", he cautioned.]]></summary>

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed "no impunity" for the perpetrators, who intercepted a bus transporting 33 workers on a highway in the southern state of Chiapas.
An order had been issued "to rescue those kidnapped, alive of course," he said at his daily news conference.
The abductees worked at a nearby prison and the incident appeared to be connected to a dispute between criminal groups, Lopez Obrador added.
The state security agency updated the number of employees kidnapped to 16, from 14 previously.

The gunman and a Nepalese security guard both died after the exchange of fire outside the consulate on Wednesday evening, officials said, giving no possible motive for the incident.
"At 6:45 pm (1545 GMT), a man stopped in a car in front of the consulate building and got out with a weapon in his hand," the official Saudi Press Agency quoted a police spokesman as saying.
"Security forces reacted... resulting in an exchange of fire that killed the assailant," it said, adding that the Nepalese guard later died of his wounds.

Washington Post: Twice-indicted Trump dominates GOP race, as support for DeSantis stalls 
CONCORD, N.H. — The primary was effectively over for many voters who came out to hear Donald Trump’s speech at a GOP women’s luncheon this week. “It’s Trump all the way — don’t even ask me about anyone else,” said Suzanne Pesaresi, a 62-year-old office manager. 
Forty miles south, at a town hall with Ron DeSantis, plenty of others were convinced the party should move on from the former president. “I have a non-top choice, and that’s Donald Trump,” declared former Republican state lawmaker Bill Ohm. But like many around him, Ohm wasn’t yet sold on the Florida governor — or anyone else, for that matter. 
“I could vote for DeSantis if nobody else got traction,” said Don Hallenbeck, a business owner who identifies as an independent and plans to vote in the Republican primary. He worries the governor would “have a tough time finding his way back to the middle” in a general election.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After recovering pieces of debris from the downed submarine that sought to view Titanic wreckage and instead came to a fatal end, reports now suggest "human remains" have also been found among the ocean wreckage. 
ABC News reports:
"Debris recovered from the submersible that catastrophically imploded while on a voyage to see the Titanic wreckage last week contained 'presumed human remains,' the U.S. Coast Guard said," the outlet reported. "Salvaged pieces of the Titan vessel were unloaded from the Canadian ship Horizon Arctic at the Canadian Coast Guard pier in St. John's, Newfoundland, Wednesday morning."
Investigators are still reportedly looking into what was found to determine the truth:
"The U.S. Coast Guard said later Wednesday it has received the debris and evidence, including 'presumed human remains,' that had been recovered from the ocean floor in the incident, in which five people died," ABC reported. "The evidence will be transported to a port in the U.S. for 'further analysis and testing' by the Marine Board of Investigation, the Coast Guard said."
The news was also picked up by CNN, which cited a news release from the U.S. Coast Guard.]]></summary>

Moscow Times: Russian General Arrested Following Wagner Mutiny – MT Russian 
Russian General Sergei Surovikin has been arrested, The Moscow Times' Russian service reported Wednesday, citing two sources close to the Defense Ministry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

 "The situation with him was not 'OK.' For the authorities. I can't say anything more," one of the sources said. 
According to the second source, the arrest was carried out "in the context of Prigozhin."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  The Hong Kong Jockey Club (“the Club”) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the Hangzhou Municipal People’s Government to further strengthen Hangzhou-Hong Kong cooperation and exchange with the aim of promoting and driving the development of the equine sports industry in the country. The MOU was signed at the opening ceremony of Hong Kong & Macao - Zhejiang Week & Zhejiang and Hong Kong Cooperation Theme Forum 2023 on 26 June.  The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region John Lee, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Secretary Yi Lianhong and other guests witnessed the signing of the MOU by the Executive Deputy Mayor, Hangzhou Municipal Government, Chen Jin and the Club’s Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.  The National Equine Industry Development Plan 2020-2025 promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the General Administration of Sport in September 2020 provides a framework for the development of the equine sports industry in the country. In line with this, Hangzhou is capitalising on its hosting of the Asian Games by exploring the equine leisure and sports markets. In particular it is seeking to become a national major sports industry demonstration base and a sports consumption demonstration city, thus contributing to economic development in the Yangtze River Delta.  The Club has long contributed to the development of equine sports and related industries in the Mainland, assisting the country in promoting and implementing the goals of the National Equine Industry Development Plan. In May 2023, the Club signed an MOU with the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022 Organising Committee (“HAGOC”) under which the Club will provide technical support for the equestrian events of the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games.

Reuters: US to give Ukraine $500 million in additional military aid -Pentagon 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will provide Kyiv with a new military package worth up to $500 million, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, in a show of support for Ukraine's fight against Russia as Moscow deals with the aftermath of a mutiny by mercenary fighters. 
The package will include ground vehicles including Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armored personnel carriers, and munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, according to a statement from the Pentagon. 
The package "includes key capabilities to support Ukraine's counteroffensive operations, strengthen its air defenses ... and other equipment to help Ukraine push back on Russia's war of aggression," the Pentagon said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An earthquake in the Italian region of Tuscany sparked the brief evacuation of the cathedral and closure of museums Wednesday in the tourist hotspot of Siena.
The 3.7 magnitude quake, with an epicenter in Poggibonsi near Siena, was also felt in Florence and Empoli -- and hit shortly after the region tested an emergency alert system.
The tremor sent people rushing out of buildings and into the streets in Siena, famous for its artistic heritage and for the Palio, a spectacular horse race that pits neighborhoods against each other twice a year.
The cathedral was evacuated for about an hour, its press office told AFP.
The quake caused bits of plaster to fall off the famous monument, according to Italian media reports, but the cathedral's press office would not confirm.
The council ordered all museums closed for the remainder of Wednesday and Thursday, though it said there was no apparent damage to buildings.
Siena's historic centre is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Italy is prone to earthquakes. Deadly quakes in 2009 and 2016 killed approximately 300 people each.]]></summary>

New York Times: Russian General Knew About Mercenary Chief’s Rebellion Plans, U.S. Officials Say 
WASHINGTON — A senior Russian general had advance knowledge of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s plans to rebel against Russia’s military leadership, according to U.S. officials briefed on American intelligence on the matter, which has prompted questions about what support the mercenary leader had inside the top ranks.
The officials said they are trying to learn if Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the former top Russian commander in Ukraine, helped plan Prigozhin’s actions last weekend, which posed the most dramatic threat to President Vladimir Putin in his 23 years in power. 
Surovikin is a respected military leader who helped shore up defenses across the battle lines after Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year, analysts say. He was replaced as the top commander in January but retained influence in running war operations and remains popular among the troops.

Update: Senior Russian General Knew About Wagner Leader’s Mutiny Plans – NYT (Moscow Times)

 
WNU editor: If Gen. Sergei Surovikin knew about Prigozhin’s plans to launch a mutiny, and did nothing about it, he would not be in the position that he is in today. He would have been fired/demoted on the spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Greatness: Kamala Harris Has the Worst Net Negative Rating of Any Vice President in NBC Poll’s History 
While voters continue to have serious concerns about Joe Biden’s mental health, they are even less impressed with his vice president, according to the latest national NBC News poll. 
Kamala Harris has a historically low approval rating of 32 percent in survey, compared with 49 percent who have a negative view of her. Thirty-nine percent of respondents said they had a “very negative” view of Harris. Her net negative rating of -17 is reportedly the worst for any vice president in the NBC poll’s history.

     
In Oct. 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence had a 34% positive, 38% negative rating (-4). 
In Dec. 2010, Joe Biden’s rating was 34% positive, 33% negative (+1). 
 In May 2003, Dick Cheney was at 47% positive, 24% negative (+23).

    And in March of 1995, Al Gore’s rating in the poll was 42% positive, 27% negative (+15).

Washington Post: Ukraine faces mines and manpower challenges in offensive’s early weeks 
Ukrainian forces are navigating giant minefields and mounting initial attacks on Russian positions along a sprawling front line, U.S. and Ukrainian officials said, as Kyiv takes the first, halting steps of what is expected to be a prolonged and punishing counteroffensive campaign. 
Ukrainian officials say they have thus far reclaimed at least 130 square kilometers, or about 50 square miles, in the country’s south from Russian forces, which have spent months hardening fortifications and positioning reinforcements in their bid to protect territory seized since President Vladimir Putin’s 2022 invasion. 
President Volodymyr Zelensky last week said that the offensive was moving “slower than desired” since it began this month, but that an operation against an adversary with a deeper arsenal and a far larger force shouldn’t be expected to unfold at an action-movie pace.

WNU Editor: Even the Washington Post is admitting that after weeks of heavy fighting and heavy casualties only 130 square kilometers, or about 50 square miles, has been reclaimed. No mention from the Washington Post that the Ukraine army has not even reached the first line of three of fortification lines that the Russian military has set-up. 
My contacts in Ukraine tell me that Ukraine has started a rush mobilization campaign to replace soldiers that have been killed or wounded in this counteroffensive. I shudder to think what the real casualty numbers must be for the Ukraine government to be forced to do this.]]></summary>

Agatha's mother, Thamirys Nunes, says she vividly remembers the day her daughter, then almost four, asked the question that has changed both of their lives.
"Mommy, can I die today and come back tomorrow as a girl?"
Nunes, 33, who lives in Sao Paulo, says she knew then they both had a hard road ahead, in a country where the discrimination and dangers facing trans people run deep.
Gender dysphoria among children, a sensitive subject in many places, is especially fraught in Brazil, the deadliest country in the world for trans people.

Two years later in London the couple still feel threatened by the long arm of Beijing, like many other Hong Kongers exiled in the UK.
Following Beijing's crackdown on huge pro-democracy protests in 2019 and a sweeping security law imposed the following year, London has granted 166,000 visas to people from its former colony.
Holders of a British National Overseas passport -- issued to Hong Kongers born before the handover to China 26 years ago on July 1, 1997 -- can apply for a visa.

More than 1.8 million people are taking part in the first unrestricted hajj since Covid struck in 2020. About 2.5 million, the most on record, joined the pilgrimage in pre-pandemic 2019.

As Japan moves to stand up its first Permanent Joint Operational Headquarters, the United States should act quickly to update its own command structure in Japan. Rather than wait for Japan to decide the details of the future headquarters — including its rank structure, role, and location — the United States should move now to establish a joint operational command element, based in Japan, to serve as its primary day-to-day U.S. interface.

Small Wars Journal−El Centro Fellow Pablo A. Baisotti has published a research paper on Chinese influence operations in Latin America. The paper, "China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]" was published by the Florida International University's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy,
Abstract: This paper analyzes the expansion of Chinese media and public diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Through its “discourse of power” and an attempt to extend its soft power across the continent, Chinese and some LAC media (print, audiovisual, and digital) sustained, amplified, and exalted the “achievements” of the Communist regime and the possibility of sharing them as a “community of common destiny” for all the world’s peoples. China strives to promote a positive image through communication and propaganda campaigns, incorporating LAC journalists, academics, politicians, and others who can improve its image as a reliable and supportive partner of the “Global South.”

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
