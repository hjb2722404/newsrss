Contact was continuing at all levels, Peskov said but did not provide details. Under a bilateral agreement, Russian troops have been deployed to Zvartnots International Airport to the west of Yerevan since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday the situation for his troops was improving having "halted" Russian advances on the front, as Kyiv rejected Pope Francis's suggestion to negotiate with Moscow.
More than two years since Russia launched its invasion, Kyiv has faced mounting pressure on the front line in recent months, losing ground to Moscow amid hold-ups to Western aid from its biggest ally Washington.
But on Monday, Zelensky told French broadcaster BFM TV, "The Russian advance has been halted."
"Our command, our military has stopped the Russian advance in eastern Ukraine," he said.
His comments followed anger over a suggestion by Pope Francis at the weekend that "the strongest are those who see the situation, think about the people and have the courage to raise the white f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Airbnb on Monday said it is banning security cameras inside guest homes so as to prioritize privacy.
The home rental platform previously allowed indoor security cameras in common areas such as hallways and living rooms if they were clearly visible and disclosed in listings before people booked such properties.
However, people have complained on social media about finding seemingly hidden cameras in Airbnb lodgings, some of them in areas where privacy is expected.
"Airbnb is banning the use of indoor security cameras in listings globally as part of efforts to simplify our policy on security cameras and other devices and to continue to prioritize the privacy of our community," the San Francisco-based company said in a blog post.
The new policy, along with a tightening of rules on outdoor security cameras at Airbnb properties, will go into effect on April 30.
"Our goal was to create new, clear rules that provide our community with greater clarity about what to expect on Airbnb," head of community policy and partnerships Juniper Downs said in an online post.
Doorbell cameras and noise decibel monitors will still be permitted by Airbnb for home security and to detect unauthorized parties, according to the company.
Hosts will be required to disclose the locations of any outdoor security cameras, which can't monitor areas such as outdoor showers or saunas, Airbnb said in the post.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[much maligned position on Russia's war with Ukraine during an interview with former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

"Apparently I'm stupid," Trump Jr. declared. "I'm a Putin apologist and a Russia lover. Basically I work for them according to the mainstream press."

Trump Jr. was defending his position against sending aid to Ukraine more than two years after Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. 

	"I'm a Russia lover because I don't feel we should spend a trillion dollars in a war in Ukraine that we haven't articulated what victory looks like," Trump Jr. said. 
Trump Jr. made this comment on an 
	episode of his Rumble show "Triggered." 
"You're a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves and yet I see TV pundits who've never served, who probably hate America, attack you as some sort of Russia lover," he said. "Where, what does that come from? What do you make of those attacks?"
Gabbard responded with a chuckle.


	Don Jr. was 
	cited in special counsel Robert Mueller's report for a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-tied attorney to secure damaging intel on then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.


	"This is, this is the same tired line they throw out," she said of the critics. "Anytime they see someone who is speaking a truth that are afraid of, who threatens their power, and exposes them for who they really are."

Two of the 49 surviving copies of the Gutenberg Bible worldwide are located in Mainz. They have been on permanent display since they were added to the collection in 1925 and 1978. 
Until now, the two Bibles could only be viewed in the museum's treasure chamber, housed in a walk-in safe.]]></summary>

“The Russian, brutal, full-scale invasion against Ukraine united Sweden behind the conclusion that a full-fledged NATO membership is the only reasonable choice,” Kristersson said. Swedish government ministers and party leaders from across the polit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A German court handed an American man a life sentence Monday for raping and killing a fellow US tourist near Bavaria's famed Neuschwanstein castle last year.
The district tribunal in the southern town of Kempten convicted the defendant, identified only as Troy Philipp B., 31, after he made a wide-ranging confession on the first day of his trial last month.
The judges also noted the "particular severity of guilt", meaning he is unlikely to be released after 15 years as is customary with life sentences in Germany.
Troy Philipp B. was convicted of raping and murdering the 21-year-old U.S. woman as well as the attempted murder of her friend, 22, also a U.S. citizen.
The two women were hiking in the Neuschwanstein area in June last year at the end of a European trip that had taken them to Italy…]]></summary>

Armed groups, which already control much of Port-au-Prince as well as roads leading to the rest of the country, have unleashed havoc in recent days as they try to oust Prime Minister Ariel Henry.
In power since the 2021 assassination of president Jovenel Moise, Henry was abroad seeking to shore up support for a UN-backed security support mission when the latest burst of violence broke out. He has been unable to return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Biden said Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the war in Gaza was "hurting Israel more than helping Israel" in an interview aired Saturday, as the US leader's impatience with his Israeli counterpart grows increasingly visible.
With Gaza's humanitarian crisis growing more dire and Biden's left flank in uproar, the US president made contradictory remarks as to the question of a "red line" over Israel's threatened offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza.
Netanyahu "has a right to defend Israel, a right to continue to pursue Hamas," Biden said, but added that "he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken."
"In my view he is hurting Israel more than helping Israel," he said.

Putin has publicly said he prefers US President Joe Biden to his predecessor and aspiring successor Donald Trump, a remark widely interpreted to mean exactly the opposite, as the former KGB man hopes his notoriety will boost the Republican mogul.
Trump has voiced admiration for Putin, raged against NATO, the alliance founded to defend against Moscow, and boasted that he within one day would end the war in Ukraine, which Russia invaded two years ago.

"Is this really a movie that people in Hiroshima can bear to watch?" said Kyoko Heya, president of the Japanese city's international film festival, on Monday after the blockbuster won seven Academy Awards including best picture.
Christopher Nolan also picked up best director for the biopic, which was a huge hit worldwide last summer -- except in Japan, where it was absent from cinemas.
There was no official statement at the time, fueling speculation that sensitivities around the subject matter had kept the film off Japanese screens.

Real-life geisha, or "geiko" ("women of art") as they are known locally, work for a living -- as they have for centuries -- in teahouses in Kyoto's picturesque Gion district where they perform traditional Japanese dance, music and games.
However, like other major tourist attractions around the world such as Bruges in Belgium, Venice in Italy, or Rio de Janeiro's Sugarloaf Mountain, locals are fuming.
Residents are fed up with visitors sometimes rudely demanding selfies with or otherwise bothering the geiko, who wear smart kimonos and white make-up, with their hair styled in an elaborate bun.

The news did little to put to bed speculation surrounding Kate’s condition, about which the palace has shared few details aside from saying it is not cancer-related.
The 42-year-old princess, whose husband Prince William is heir to the British throne, has been recovering mainly at their home in Windsor, west of London, since leaving hospital on January 29.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
