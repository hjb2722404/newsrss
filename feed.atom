The case about his loss of UK taxpayer-funded protection is the latest in a string of court proceedings initiated by Harry, whose father is King Charles III.
Harry is taking legal action against the UK interior ministry over a February 2020 decision by a committee that deals with the security of members of the royal family. 
The Duke of Sussex, as he is formally known, had been told he would no longer be given the "same degree" of personal protective security that he previously enjoyed.

A U.S. Navy warship scrambled to respond to multiple distress calls on Sunday, as Houthi rebels in Yemen launched missiles and drones against three separate commercial vessels. The USS Carney fired back, taking down three unmanned aerial systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thomas Peter / Reuters   
Michael Schuman, The Atlantic: Why Xi Wants Trump to Win 
After four years of Joe Biden, China’s leaders would likely be relieved to have Donald Trump back in the White House. 
Compared with his predecessor, Biden has operated quietly. Trump launched a trade war; slapped tariffs on Chinese imports; and infuriated Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as “the Chinese Virus,” blaming the Chinese Communist Party for its spread, and even at times humoring theories that the party may have played a role in its creation. 
But Biden has hit China harder than Trump ever did. Armed with a more determined foreign policy, he has inflicted acute damage on the country’s economy and geopolitical ambitions, from which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has struggled to recover. “A Biden-led U.S., probably from the Chinese perspective, looks like a more formidable challenge,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., told me.

WNU Editor: Both Michael Schuman and The Atlantic are long time opponents of former President Trump while also being vocal supporters of President Biden. They do not disappoint in the above post. 
As to what is my take. 
One of the major cornerstones of U.S. foreign policy since Nixon's trip to China in 1973 was to go to great lengths to make sure that the Soviet Union (Russia) and China never formed a political/economic/military alliance. To do so would present a clear geopolitical threat to long term US strategic national interests. 
Sighhhh ....
For the past 50 years this has been the policy. No more now. I can now say with confidence that the Biden administration has successfully blown-up this U.S. foreign policy priority. 
Bottom line. 
A President Trump is not going to change this new political/international reality. And if Biden is re-elected, it will probably accelerate it even further. In both situations President Xi is the winner, and  Xi knows that.]]></summary>

Politico: Israel needs to protect civilians or risk ‘strategic failure’ in Gaza

 
The warning comes as the Biden administration increases pressure on Israel to keep Palestinians safe. 
SIMI VALLEY, California — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered a stark public warning to Israel on Saturday, saying the government there risks “strategic defeat” in Gaza if it doesn’t do more to protect civilians.
The comments came a day after the breakdown in negotiations over hostage and prisoner releases led to the resumption of the Israel-Hamas war. Austin told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum that if Israel doesn’t do everything possible to protect civilians, it might help “drive [Palestinians] into the arms of the enemy,” and would “replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korean "smuggling networks" are registering ships in Pacific nations to disguise themselves while trafficking oil, according to former United Nations sanctions experts and documents obtained by AFP.
With strict sanctions limiting Pyongyang's ability to import fuel, North Korean smugglers have adopted increasingly creative methods to deceive authorities and dodge scrutiny.
These efforts, security analysts said, could be directly linked to the North's military ambitions.
"Almost none of the Pacific Islands have escaped North Korean attempts to hide their vessels," said Neil Watts, a former member of the UN Security Council's expert panel on North Korea.

They are diving for a reason: to remove the massive fishing nets damaging an unusually resilient coral reef system that is seen as more likely than most to survive rising sea temperatures.
The clean-up is one example of how divers and Omani authorities are joining forces to protect the reefs -- which are critical for marine wildlife -- from man-made damage.
"Coral reefs are a refuge for marine habitat and wildlife," said Hammoud al-Nayri of Oman's environmental authority, as he watched the divers.

Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran.
The attacks marked an escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war, as multiple vessels found themselves in the crosshairs of a single Houthi assault for the first time in the conflict.
In a statement, U.S. Central Command said the attacks “represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. They have jeopardised the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world.” It said the three c…]]></summary>

Contrary to what is sometimes heard among U.S. security practitioners in classrooms, conferences, and conversations, this is not a social justice program. It is not a diversity, equity, and inclusion mandate, or a call for the government to “do the right thing.” And regardless of what the name might make you think, it is not just about women.  Rather, the

CARACAS (Reuters) - Voters in Venezuela rejected in a Sunday referendum the International Court of Justice's jurisdiction over the country's long-running territorial dispute with neighboring Guyana and backed the creation of a new state in the Esequibo region. 
The court has barred Venezuela from taking any action that would change the status quo in the area, but President Nicolas Maduro's government went ahead with a five-question "consultative" referendum.

All questions passed with more than 95% approval, according the electoral authority.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Philadelphia software engineer posted a video of protesters circling a falafel restaurant run by a James Beard Award winner who is Jewish. The protesters associated the chef and owner with Israel's bombing of Gaza. 
Taking to social media on Sunday, a man identifying himself as Jordan, who works for Bloomberg, posted the video and some details about what he observed. 
"Goldie, Goldie you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide," the protesters chanted.

"They continued their march down the street, but not before vandalizing the front windows," he wrote. "To clarify, I witnessed them placing stickers on the front door and windows of the restaurant. I just walked by," and the stickers read "Free Palestine" and "This is Genocide." 
"Serving falafel" is genocide? Questioned Jordan. 
Former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum explained that the restaurant Goldie is run by Michael Solomonov, who has a number of establishments in the area bringing culinary creations from Israel to the United States. 
Calling the protesters an "antisemitic mob," Frum said, "They demand a boycott of Jewish goods. Michael Solomonov is a James Beard Award-winning chef. He makes some of the best hummus outside Israel, as well as outstanding lamb and other dishes. It all ships via Goldbelly. If you want to send a message of your own to the boycotters, you can do so here." 
Middle East expert Eli Kowaz, a policy adviser to the Israel Policy Forum, explained that Solomonov has long been an "outspoken advocate of Israeli-Palestinian peace."
Alex Zeldin, columnist at "The Forward" on U.S. Foreign Policy and Jewish communal concerns, reposted the video as well, noting that the owner of a falafel shop has no power to "anything about Israel's military campaign against Hamas. What you're looking at is people normalizing antisemitic incitement against their Jewish neighbors."

“It's not able to get the Israelis to do anything,” Mr Siracusa said. 

He said reports have shown Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a plan to reduce the population of Gaza Palestinians to the lowest possible level. 

Mr Siracusa says the United States’ push for a two-state solution is as “dead as the dodo”. 

“We’re in a terrible place here because this can only get worse before it gets better.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Ambassador and diplomat Manuel Rocha was arrested in Miami after a long-running counterintelligence investigation. 
According to the Associated Press, Rocha is being accused of working as an agent of Cuba’s government.
While more details are expected in court on Monday, those who spoke to reporters said that Rocha was working with the Cuban government to promote its interests within the United States. 
Over the past several years, the Justice Department has cracked down on individuals who have neglected to register as a foreign agent, as required by law.  
As the Washington Post explained, Rocha worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations for about 25 years. He mostly focused on Latin America during the Cold War and was posted, at one point, in Cuba when there wasn't a full diplomatic relationship with Fidel Castro.
Rocha also served as the director for Inter-American Affairs at the National Security Council in Washington under former President George H. W. Bush.
Former FBI agent Peter Strzok said of the report: "From Rocha to the Cuban 5 to Kendall and Gwendolyn Myers to Ana Montes (read about her in a new book from her FBI case agent Pete Lapp) to a remarkable run of success in running double agents, the Cuban Intelligence services are very, very good."

President Joe Biden’s administration is publicly attempting to avoid a war with Iran, but American officials continue to fan the flames of war with incendiary rhetoric as the war in Gaza risks expanding into a broader regional conflict.

Military stockpiles and other resources are low due to the U.S. commitment to support Ukraine in its war against Russia, and Iran has spent years preparing itself in the event of an Israeli and/or U.S. attack. 
One should also not ignore the massive blow-back from U.S. allies who will be adversely affected by such a conflict. This is an easy prediction. A U.S. - Iran war will not receive the support from the West that the U.S. would want, unlike Iran who will be receiving enormous support from countries like China and Russia.]]></summary>

Politico:  US intelligence community was not aware of Hamas’ plan to attack Israel, Kirby confirms

 
His comments come after the New York Times reported that Israeli officials obtained the plans more than a year before the Oct. 7 attack occurred. 
The U.S. intelligence community was not aware of Hamas’ plan to attack Israel, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday, after the New York Times reported last week that Israeli officials obtained the plans more than a year before the Oct. 7 attack occurred.
“The intelligence community has indicated that they did not have access to this document,” Kirby told NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press.” POLITICO reported Friday that there was no indication Israel had shared the blueprint for the attack with the United States.

New York Times: Israel Knew Hamas’ Attack Plan More Than a Year Ago 
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli officials obtained Hamas’ battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. 
The approximately 40-page document, which Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” outlined, point by point, exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths of about 1,200 people. 
The translated document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
