Olmert said Israel should offer to start negotiations on a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority immediately after conclusion of the war. He also claimed that no Arab country would agree to replace the Israeli army in Gaza after the war, which is why he advocates a NATO-led military presence that would usher in a transitional civilian administration before final talks over a Palestinian state. Olmert slammed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, saying he had failed his citizens and boosted Hamas while weakening the Palestinian Authority: "He is in a nervous breakdown."]]></summary>

Air and Space Forces Magazine: New B-21 Bomber Takes First Flight 
The first B-21 Raider bomber took off from Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Calif., just after dawn on Nov. 10, in a flight that concluded at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif, after 90 minutes, according to local observers. 
“The B-21 safely landed,” said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. “This was a test flight.” 
The aircraft was filmed from outside Plant 42, heading eastbound with an F-16 chase plane after climbing to about 500 feet. The landing gear had yet to be retracted in video and photos that appeared on social media.

TASS: Russia may downgrade diplomatic relations with US, senior diplomat says 
Still, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stressed that Moscow did not plan to initiate the severance of diplomatic ties with Washington 
MOSCOW, November 9. /TASS/. Washington’s behavior may compel Moscow to downgrade diplomatic relations or even cut ties, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said. 
"We are indeed going through an acute crisis in relations, the likes of which we have never seen before.

"That is why, if we look at Washington’s current behavior model from this perspective, I don’t rule out anything at all. The level [of diplomatic ties] may be lowered; and the severance of diplomatic relations is also possible," he added.

Thousands of people have been forced to flee the Sudanese region of West Dafur amid fears of ethnic cleansing, a medical charity says. 
Witnesses have accused the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of targeting and killing non-Arabs, with reports of hundreds of deaths. 
This comes after the RSF captured the Sudanese army headquarters in West Darfur capital of El Geneina.

It has been battling the army for control of the country since April.

US and coalition forces have come under attack at least four more times since the US struck a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria on Wednesday evening, according to a US official.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: US government debt is on track to surpass $50 trillion by 2033. That means $5.2 billion is piling up every day. 

 
The US government's debt is on track to surpass $50 trillion by 2033, Bank of America said in a Tuesday note, citing data from the Congressional Budget Office. 
* The US government's public outstanding debt is on track to surpass $50 trillion by 2033. 
* The increase comes out to roughly $5.2 billion every day or $218 million every hour, Bank of America estimated. 
* "Central banks may simply bail out governments in coming years via QE," BofA said. 
US public debt outstanding currently sits at $33.6 trillion and is expected to surge by $20 trillion to $54 trillion within the next decade amid "fiscal excess in the 2020s," Bank of America investment strategist Michael Hartnett said.
"US public debt is... more than the combined GDPs of China, Japan, Germany, and India," he wrote, adding that the outstanding debt is set to surge by $5.2 billion every single day, or $218 million every hour, for the next 10 years.

White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Wednesday told reporters that the United States has gone through 96 percent of its funds allocated for Ukraine. 
"Of the total funds that have been provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, which is an excess of $60 billion—and that's not just security assistance; that's economic, financial and humanitarian assistance—we've gone through about 96 percent of what's left," Kirby said during a press conference.

Newsweek reached out to the White House via email for comment Wednesday night.

TASS: Lavrov blames Anglo-Saxons for pushing Middle East towards big war

 
According to the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, this line of the West traditionally leads to surges in terrorism and multi-million flows of refugees 
MOSCOW, November 6. /TASS/. The Anglo-Saxon forces are pushing the Middle East towards a big war, which is leading to a surge in terrorism and millions-strong refugee flows, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.
"We can see the Anglo-Saxons literally pushing the Middle East to the brink of a big war," he pointed out, addressing the Znanie (Knowledge) marathon at the International RUSSIA EXPO. 
According to Lavrov, the West’s policy is on full display in Ukraine, Iraq, Libya and Syria. "The outcome of this policy also includes a surge in terrorism and extremism, broken lives, shattered families and millions-strong refugee flows," the top Russian diplomat added.

Aviation Week: U.S. Navy Considers Extending All Its Nimitz-Class Carriers 
The U.S. Navy’s Nimitz-class carriers are about to turn 50. But given the demand for the carrier air wing and delays to the Nimitz-class replacement—the Ford-class—the USS Nimitz (CVN 68) itself is unlikely to retire as soon as expected. 
The Navy’s fiscal 2023 budget has already called to extend the first-in-class CVN 68, commissioned in 1975, for another deployment cycle instead of decommissioning it in 2025 as previously planned. Service officials say the upcoming budget request could include a final decision on extending the next in the class, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, beyond its 2027 projected end-of-service date—though extending just that ship likely will not be enough.

Reuters: Hezbollah's anti-ship missiles bolster its threat to US navy 
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Powerful Russian anti-ship missiles acquired by Hezbollah give it the means to deliver on its leader's veiled threat against U.S. warships and underline the grave risks of any regional war, sources familiar with the group's arsenal say. 
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned Washington last week his group had something in store for the U.S. vessels deployed to the region since war erupted last month between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel, shaking the wider Middle East. 
Two sources in Lebanon familiar with the Iran-backed group's arsenal say he was referring to Hezbollah's greatly enhanced anti-ship missile capabilities, including the Russian-made Yakhont missile with a range of 300 km (186 miles).

WNU Editor: Apparently the video that has been making the rounds on social media that shows Hezbollah's anti-ship missiles is an old one (see video below). But the question still remains. Are Hezbollah's anti-ship missiles a threat to the US Navy? My gut says yes.]]></summary>

The US military conducted an airstrike on a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday. 
“This precision self-defense strike is a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by IRGC-Quds Force affiliates,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. “The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests.” 
The strike was conducted by two F-15s, Austin said.

Halyna Vynokur, a clerk in a hardware store in Kyiv, was shouldering a firearm for the first time. Iryna Sychova, a purchasing manager at a department store, disassembled and reassembled the jumble of rods and springs in a Kalashnikov rifle. 
They were among two dozen women who turned out in a forest near Kyiv one recent weekend for a course in firearms and urban combat, training that included shooting rifles, finding booby traps and throwing hand grenades. They were spurred by a sense of duty, they said, realizing they might some day end up on the front lines.

WNU Editor: Not surprised that Ukraine is going to recruit women to fight in the war. The average age for a soldier in the Ukraine army is 43 years old, and getting older. The Ukraine army is running out of male bodies to fight in this war, and they need new recruits. Since there are a lot of widows and mothers who have lost their sons and loved ones in this war, the Ukraine Army will (I predict) have no trouble tapping into this grief and anger for them to join.]]></summary>

Washington Post: As war frustrations rise, stalemate tests Zelensky and top general Zaluzhny 
KYIV — After months of heavy losses in a largely stalled counteroffensive against Russia, tension among Ukraine’s senior leaders has spilled awkwardly into the open in recent days — prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for a halt to political infighting. 
“Everyone should be concentrating their efforts right now on defending the country,” Zelensky said Monday in his nightly address. “Put themselves together and do not rest; do not drown in infighting or other issues.” 
He warned that shattered unity could have drastic consequences: “The situation is now the same as it was before — if there is no victory, there will be no country.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[She tried to censure and it came up short. 
Now she's shaming the names who didn't vote in favor. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib," Greene said on Wednesday. "This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC."

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.
"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger," she said. "And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate."
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.
"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib," tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: "motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans."

And CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: "House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.]]></summary>

That line is budging. 
Officials are fuming at  Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) after it was discovered over the weekend that Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith, who had been doubling as both the top No. 1 and No. 2 Marine Corps leader since July, suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized on Sunday — leaving a three-star general to hold the prestigious post, according to a report published by Politico.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
The potential overextension of Smith and the stalling of more than 300 critical leadership roles was iced out by Tuberville's blockade installed as a protest against the Pentagon's policy to permit time off and reimbursement for abortions.

The fact that Republicans are demanding an increase in tax evasion as their condition of supporting a key U.S. ally's military is not an accident, argued Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall on MSNBC Tuesday, but a sign of how low the GOP has sunk.
"I have to say, Josh, like, Mike Johnson rolling out, going after the IRS on a must-pass is past even a caricature, I can imagine, of a priority from the Republican House speaker," said anchor Chr…]]></summary>

Politico notes the Alabama senator "has maintained the blockade over the Pentagon's abortion travel policy, ensnaring more than 300 generals and admirals at the upper rungs of the armed forces."
Reed told the news outlet, "One of the reasons, I think contributed to his condition was he was doing two jobs at once. I've read where he was working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. As a result, if he had, as is normal, an assistant, he could switch off."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.
