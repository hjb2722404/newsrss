The UN says Al Qaeda is using the takeover to increase their numbers and funding, as well as to "inspire Al Qaeda affiliates globally."

Crazy, exuberant and rightly angry, Vélez Meléndez’s play borrows from European absurd theatre, like the plays of Jarry and Genet, as well as from a tradition of Latin American surrealism.  Under the direction of David Mendizábal, who also designed the irrepressible costumes, the show takes place less in an office and more in a shimmering theater of the mind.  Is all of this real?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]     The big day is fast approaching for a 16-strong team of students taking the MBA programme at City University of Hong Kong’s College of Business.   On May 30 from 7-9pm, after close to eight months planning and preparation, they will be hosting a high-profile online event featuring senior figures connected to the world of fashion.   Fellow CityU students, along with design professionals, environmentalists and interested members of the public will be able to sign in free on various social media channels to hear invited speakers discuss the topic “From Fashion Conscious to Fashion Conscience”, focusing on what the industry must do to build a more sustainable future.   Pulling everything together has been a major organisational challenge, which was exactly the intention.     That’s because this SHARP Forum, as it’s billed, is one of a series of four, with each overseen by a different group within the MBA class. The other three are focusing on sustainable finance, green building and artificial meats. And, as the key element in a compulsory credit-bearing course, each event is specifically intended to provide practical, experiential learning by exposing the students to wide range of issues - some foreseeable, others unexpected - for which solutions must be found.       The two MCs on Monday night will be Mirjam Wong, otherwise a regional IT project manager with a leading global cosmetics company, and Adrian Chong, who since last September has been policy manager for an international accountancy association.     Understandably at this stage, both are feeling a few butterflies. But those should be calmed after the last few rehearsals and technical run-throughs and by knowing they have a strong line-up of speakers, a topical subject, and back-ups just in case of the odd glitch.   “Even when you plan as well as possible, something will go wrong on the day, especially when technology is involved,” says Wong, who also served as the research coordinator. “But you have to be ready…]]></summary>

Reuters: EU fails to agree Russian oil ban despite onslaught on outskirts of Sievierodonetsk 
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian and Russian forces battled on Monday on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, the last city still held by Kyiv in Ukraine's Luhansk province and the focus of Moscow's offensive in the country's east. 
But even as the Russian onslaught raged, EU leaders made clear they would fail to agree on a Russian oil import ban at a summit in Brussels, prompting swift criticism from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said they were too soft on Moscow. 
Russian shelling has reduced much of Sievierodonetsk to ruins, but the Ukrainian defence has slowed the wider Russian campaign across the Donbas region.

   Zero Hedge: Greece Alerts Its Tankers In Gulf After Iran Threatens More 'Retaliation' Seizures 
The government of Greece has issued an alert warning all Greek ships currently sailing in Persian Gulf waters to adapt and remain aware of heightened threats against them following last week's seizure of two Greek oil tankers by Iran's military. Maritime tanker monitors suggest at least a dozen Greek tankers are currently in waters near Iran. 
The alert told vessels to immediately "adapt to the unacceptable situation and reality created by the Iranian government’s tactic," according government spokesman Ioannis Oikonomou at a Monday press briefing in Athens, per Bloomberg reporting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ron Rice, a high school chemistry teacher who had been trained to explore petroleum but instead made a fortune concocting a coconut-based sunscreen lotion in a 20-gallon trash can in his garage and calling it a seductive Hawaiian Tropic, died on the 19th in Daytona Beach, Florida.  He was 81 years old.
His death, in a hospital, was announced by his family on Facebook.  No cause was specified.

TAIPEI, May 30 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Monday reported the largest incursion since January by China's air force in its air defence zone, with the island's defence ministry saying Taiwanese fighters scrambled to warn away 30 aircraft in the latest uptick in tensions. 
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for the past two years or so of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratically governed island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone, or ADIZ, close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. 
Taiwan calls China's repeated nearby military activities "grey zone" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan's forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwan's responses. 
The latest Chinese mission included 22 fighters, as well as electronic warfare, early warning and antisubmarine aircraft, the Taiwan ministry said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What seemed like an easy and sure win turned into one of the most spectacular finishes in recent memory, as Marcus Ericsson held on after a late restart to win the 106th Indianapolis 500.
With five laps to go, Ericsson, a 31-year-old Swedish driver, held a nearly three-second lead over Pato O’Ward, the 23-year-old Mexican driver for Arrow McLaren SP.  But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion competing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps remaining.
In a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson veered left and right to disrupt the slipstream and repel an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.
“I knew the car was pretty fast, but it was still tough,” Ericsson told NBC after the race…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple (XRP) has announced a $100 million investment in the carbon trading segment, CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Cointelegraph’s Joseph Hall in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting, which ended Thursday. 
Garlinghouse noted the growing profile of the cryptocurrency at the international summit, comparing his experiences over the past few years.  “As leaders around the world learn how these technologies can really benefit their constituents, benefit their economies, they are going to use them. […] I think we see that happening every day,” Garlinghouse said.
He went on to say that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are “underappreciated, despite the fact that there is obviously a lot of hype in some parts of the NFT market.”  Specifically:

“The tokenization of various assets is underestimated.” 

Garlinghouse cited the trade in carbon credits, which is often “challenged” by fraudulent activities, such as a use case for tokenization thanks to its transparency and traceability.  “It could really revolutionize carbon credit markets, the efficiency of carbon credit markets,” Garlinghouse said.  Ripple is investing $100 million in the segment, he added.

Cryptocurrency will have real-world use cases in 2022, Garlinghouse continued.  Cross-border transactions are an example that Ripple is working on.  Currently, cross-border transactions are “generally quite slow, quite expensive, and frankly very error-prone,” while the XRP blockchain has been “a very efficient and inexpensive bridge,” he said.
“I don’t think we live in a one-channel world,” Garlinghouse said.  “It’s a multi-channel world, there will be a lot of different utility use cases.”  Ripple will continue to focus on businesses, but other cryptocurrency foundations are also looking at consumer use cases, he explained.

That’s what the FDA did this month when it rejected a Covid Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) request by physicians for the antidepressant fluvoxamine.

Modified: 05/27/2022 11:56:58 AM



I am appalled at MaskChoice Northampton’s continued disrespect for the health and safety of our community.  The recent guest column in the Gazette (“A Call for Optional Masking in Schools,” May 21) is another ill-informed screed against masking that could have kept our students safe had the mask mandate remained in place. square.
Scores of Northampton students, staff and families have fallen ill after the mask mandate was removed.  That’s why the warrant was returned.  You had your say and the masks were removed to the detriment of more than a hundred high school students alone.
MaskChoice Northampton is not a choice.  This reflects a common care deficit for your wider community, those who are vulnerable and those who are not.  A speech-language pathologist is not a pediatric care provider or medical professional.  Few of our city’s pediatricians or public health providers agree with your short-sighted desire to rekindle the outbreak of disease that always follows mandatory mask removal. 
I can only hope you don’t succeed in your quest to put children and families at risk, including my own student who ultimately experienced a case of COVID after being exposed by an official count more than 20 times at the high school despite wearing his mask.
I wish you and your families good health and safety at school.  The safety that is in place for the rest of us finally due to the renewal of the mask mandate in place at Northampton Public Schools.

Viewers may wonder why their favorite young characters age like the cast of “Grease,” but when you spend your childhood running from predatory humanoid creatures rampaging through an alternate dimension, you tend to grow up in a hurry.
The break between hauntings might not give our heroes much time to catch their collective breath, but three years is a generally long interval between seasons, especially for a serialized show as dense with supernatural mythology, set relationships, and open-ended questions as “Stranger Things.”  If you don’t have 449 minutes to sp…]]></summary>

Dr. Subhash Kapila, Eurasian Review: Pakistan On Brink Of Civil War As Ousted PM Khan Weaponizes ‘Street Power’ – OpEd 
 Pakistan today in May 2022 tethers on the brink of a Civil War being generated by Constitutionally ousted former PM Iman Khan whose megalomaniacal impulses prompt him to challenge both the Constitution of Pakistan and the Pakistan Army by weaponizing “Street Power” in a bid to return to power in Islamabad – and raising grave implications for Pakistan and South Asia. 
Pakistan today is witnessing a clash of narratives wherein saner voices within Pakistan are voicing alarm on the irreparable damage that can be inflicted by ousted PM Imran Khan with his ‘Disruptive Strategy’ of weaponising ‘street power’ and Pakistan’s politically immature younger generation mesmerised by Imran Khan’s flamboyance providing the huge turnouts at Imran Khan’s ‘Jalsas’ and now the Long March already in Islamabad precincts.

US blocks Russian bond payments
At midnight on Wednesday, the Biden administration dropped an exemption in sweeping sanctions against Russia that had allowed the country to continue paying off foreign debts during its war with Ukraine.  The Treasury Department posted the ad a few hours before the deadline.  Russia is now racing toward a landmark it intends to avoid: a default on its foreign debt for the first time in more than a century.  Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said Tuesday the exemption was still intended to be temporary.  Still, the decision represents an escalation of US sanctions against Russia as Western countries try to increase pressure on its economy.

58.7K Ether transferred to FTX in May
On May 30, the Ether address allegedly associated with Three Arrow Capital – a Singapore-based crypto hedge fund, sent 32,000 ETH worth $60 million to the FTX crypto exchange in the space of a hour, string the data show. 
The bulk transfer, which follows the fund’s 26,700 ETH deposit on the same exchange earlier in May, raised suspicions that it would empty the Ether reserve.  This is mainly because, in theory, investors transfer crypto to their exchange wallets only when they want to sell it for other assets.

Denmark is the latest country to refuse the Kremlin’s demands for opening Western currency accounts alongside a ruble account to allow for payments for gas that are essentially made in rubles.

Bogota (CNN)Colombia's presidential election appears destined for a runoff, after preliminary results on Sunday showed no candidate had garnered over 50% of the votes. 
With 98% of the votes counted, early results showed left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro with just over 40% of the votes, the populist former mayor of Bucaramanga Rodolfo Hernandez with 28%, and right-wing candidate Federico "Fico" Gutierrez with 23%. 
Petro and Hernandez are now expected to face each other during a second round of voting on June 19th.

WNU editor: My friend who follows Colombian politics very closely tells me that the second round of voting is going to be close, but the odds favour left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro to win with about 51% - 52% of the vote. My gut tells me that it is 50 - 50 right now.

Politico: Time is ticking to replace the Pentagon’s 1970s-era Doomsday planes  
Built to survive a nuclear attack, these Air Force aircraft are expected to fly well past their 50th birthday. 
ABOARD AN E-4B DOOMSDAY PLANE — Inside a military aircraft designed to survive a nuclear war, an area once used as a first class lounge now contains six blue passenger seats next to two sleeping bunks. 
Maj. Ted DeBonis, maintenance squadron commander, says it’s a break area for the 12 aircraft mechanics who accompany the plane on every hop, waiting to fix it anywhere in the world. 
It’s an unusual setup for a military aircraft. But a flying maintenance hangar is the kind of thing you need when you’re operating a plane that’s been around since the Carter administration.

Simon Tisdall, The Guardian: The Donald and the Kremlin Don: how Trump’s toxic legacy helps Putin 
From Afghanistan to North Korea, Joe Biden is running short of time to repair the damage done by his predecessor in the White House 
Even by Donald Trump’s chaotic standards, the “comprehensive peace agreement” for Afghanistan signed by the US in Doha in February 2020 was a huge own goal. 
The pact posited no binding ceasefire, no power-sharing requirements, and no political roadmap. In return for some mumbo-jumbo about al-Qaida, Trump pledged total, unconditional US and Nato withdrawal within 14 months. 
This was not peacemaking. This was capitulation. The Taliban could hardly believe their luck.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: This is what "Trump derangement syndrome looks like in the UK". 
It is amazing to me on how utterly detached from any true sense of reality some people in the West have become even as disaster looms. That it is not President Biden's fault, but the fault of Trump and Putin who are working together to discredit Biden's global leadership and policies.
And while I find this type of analysis paranoid and bizarre, I am willing to bet that this Guardian opinion post written by one of its chief correspondents is shared by many in London and in Washington DC. That the disaster that we are seeing is not the fault at all of our current leaders, but the fault of others.]]></summary>
