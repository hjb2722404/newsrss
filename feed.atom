“Then our give up on energy independence and even energy dominant –our raging crime statistics if you look in Democrat-run cities, numbers the likes of which we’ve never seen before, the open threats by various countries of the use of nuclear weapons.”]]></summary>

According to Front Line Defenders' annual global analysis, at least 401 human rights defenders (HRDs) in 26 countries were victims of targeted killings in 2022, up from 358 people murdered in 35 countries the previous year.

The report notes that five countries—Colombia, Ukraine, Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras—accounted for over 80% of HRD murders in 2022, with Colombia alone accounting for 46% of the total with at least 186 killings documented and verified. Indigenous and environmental defenders made up 48% of last year's victims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pablo Picasso, who died 50 years ago this week, remains the star of art auctions, with several of his works commanding record sums.
Five works by the Spanish artist have been sold for more than $100 million (93 million euros), 16 for more than $50 million, and 39 for more than $30 million, according to AFP's count.
Most expensive: $179.4 million
"The Women of Algiers (Version O)", painted in 1955, is the most expensive work by Picasso ever sold at auction, going for $179.4 million on May 11, 2015, fivefold what the seller had paid 18 years earlier.
At the time it was the biggest art auction sale in history.
It was dethroned in November 2017 by the sale of "Salvator Mundi" attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, which went under the hammer for $450 million and holds the record to this day.
Previous record-holders
In the last 20 years, two other Picasso works have held the record for the biggest art auction sale: "Boy with a Pipe", from May 2004 to February 2010, and "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust" from May 2010 to May 2012, according to an AFP database.
$4.7 billion in a decade
With sales of Picasso works adding up to $4.7 billion over the past 10 years, according to Artprice's annual reports, no other artist can touch his totals.
Andy Warhol ($3.4 billion) and Claude Monet ($2.6 billion) lag well behind the King of Cubism.
3,000 pieces sold annually
Picasso was not only a painter, his oeuvre also includes sculptures, drawings, ceramics, engravings, lithographs, illustrated books and ballet costumes.
These have appeared in 31,745 auctions in 10 years -- an average of more than 3,000 objects up for sale every year.

Washington Post: Investigators skeptical of yacht’s role in Nord Stream bombing 
After saboteurs severely damaged the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines last September, German officials zeroed in on a rented sailboat that appeared to have taken part in planting explosive devices deep below the surface of the Baltic Sea. 
But after months of investigation, law enforcement officials now suspect that the 50-foot yacht, the Andromeda, was probably not the only vessel used in the audacious attack. They also say the boat may have been a decoy, put to sea to distract from the true perpetrators, who remain at large, according to officials with knowledge of an investigation led by Germany’s attorney general. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details about the active inquiry, including doubts about the Andromeda’s role that haven’t been previously reported.

And yes .... no one in the West wants to know who was really responsible for the Nord Stream attacks .... West ‘not so eager to find out’ who bombed Nord Stream – WaPo (RT).]]></summary>

Did the U.S. Air Force suffer a nuclear weapons accident at an airbase in Europe a few years back?  [Update: After USAFE and LANL initially declined to comment on the picture, a Pentagon spokesperson later clarified that the image is not of an actual nuclear weapons accident but of a training exercise, as cautioned in the second paragraph below. The spokesperson declined to comment on the main conclusion of this article, however, that the image appears to be from inside an aircraft shelter at Volkel Air Base.]

A top Ukrainian official on Sunday outlined a series of steps the government in Kyiv would take after the country reclaims control of Crimea, including dismantling the strategic bridge that links the seized Black Sea peninsula to Russia. 
Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, published the plan as Ukraine’s military prepares for a spring counteroffensive in hopes of making new, decisive gains after more than 13 months of war to end Russia’s full-scale invasion.

Mekdad's visit to Cairo is the "first in more than 10 years" for a Syrian top diplomat and saw a closed door meeting between the two ministers followed by discussions between the two countries' delegations, the Egyptian foreign ministry said.

That means giving them not only the knowledge they need, but also the soft skills and social and emotional competencies.”    This approach reflects Woo’s firm belief in the importance of nurturing well-rounded individuals with the personal qualities and self-confidence to make the right choices. And it will inform her decisions as she guides the school, which was founded in 2019, into a post-pandemic era which promises new opportunities for sports, drama, volunteering, group projects, team competitions and international exchanges.  “We aim to lay a very strong foundation, and that starts in the kindergarten and primary years,” says Woo, noting that Invictus offers a “through-train” system taking children all the way up to Year 13 in secondary. “We follow a spiral curriculum which progressively adds breadth and depth and is also in line with the school’s objective of providing a quality, affordable education which sets high standards and lets students explore their potential.”    There are two main campuses, with kindergarten and primary classes in Tseung Kwan O and secondary in Chai Wan, where pupils do IGCSEs and A-Levels, using the Cambridge programme.

Itamar Ben-Gvir says force will focus on Arab unrest as police chief voices concerns and opposition figures denounce it as ‘militia’ 
Israel’s government has authorised the establishment of a national guard proposed by the far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who said it would focus on Arab unrest, as political rivals accused him of setting up a sectarian “militia”. 
The previous government had begun moves to set up an auxiliary police force to tackle internal political violence after pro-Palestinian protests in mixed Jewish-Arab areas during the Israel-Gaza conflict in May 2021. However, that government ended before the force was finalised.

Thaci and three other top members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) rebel group all denied 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity as they appeared at a special tribunal in The Hague.

Montenegro's long-standing leader Milo Djukanovic has suffered a resounding presidential election defeat. 
The 36-year-old centrist former economy minister, Jakov Milatovic, declared victory on Sunday evening after the presidential run-off. 
He will take over from Mr Djukanovic, who has held power as president or prime minister in Montenegro for over three decades. 
Snap parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in the summer.

"Tonight is the night we have been awaiting for over 30 years. 
I wish you a happy victory," Mr Milatovic told cheering supporters of his Europe Now Movement in the capital, Podgorica. 
He promised to lead his small Balkan nation into the European Union within the next five years.

WNU Editor: I have lost count in the past year on the number of European governments that have been defeated in elections. Milo Djukanovic has been President/Prime Minister of Montenegro for the past 30+ years, and his defeat is just another sign that Europeans want new leadership and a new direction for Europe.

        <updated>2023-04-03T12:37:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of top-secret government documents is heating up, as Fox News' Bret Baier is reporting that special counsel Jack Smith has now subpoenaed members of Trump's Secret Service entourage.
"FOX News is told multiple U.S. Secret Service agents connected to Former President Donald Trump have been subpoenaed & are expected to testify before the D.C. grand jury likely on Friday," Baier reports. "The grand jury appearances are related to the Special Counsel Jack Smith probe into the handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago."
It is not known what the Secret Service members will be asked, although they may have been direct witnesses in seeing how Trump decided to respond to a government subpoena requesting he return all documents with classified markings in his possession to the government.
Investigators on Smith's team have reportedly amassed evidence that Trump deliberately tried to hang onto certain classified documents requested by the government after receiving a formal subpoena, as they believe that he ordered some boxes of documents to be removed from a secure storage area to other locations once he learned the government wanted them back.

In fact, prosecutors' evidence appears to be so strong that it convinced a judge last month to pierce attorney-client privilege after determining it was more likely than not that the former president had used conversations with attorney Evan Corcoran in the furtherance of a crime.]]></summary>

DW: Japan and China's foreign ministers discuss disputes 
Japan's foreign minister met his Chinese counterpart in Beijing and openly talked about disputes between their countries. The two Asian powers are seeking common ground amid rising tensions in the region. 
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi had a frank meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang in Beijing on Sunday. 
It is the first visit by a Japanese foreign minister to China in more than three years, and comes just days after Tokyo announced plans to restrict some computer chip-making exports. 
"The United States used bullying tactics to brutally suppress the Japanese semiconductor industry, and now it is repeating its old tricks against China," Qin told his counterpart, according to a readout of the meeting. 
He also accused Japan of being Washington's "minion."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are vanishingly few great collaborations in the annals of fine art. For a brief moment in the 1980s, Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat showed the world how it was done.
It started with a bang. Warhol, 54, met Basquiat, 22, for lunch in October 1982 and took a polaroid of them together.
Basquiat took it to his studio and returned just two hours later with a portrait. Warhol was stunned by its brilliance.
Soon they were working together on portraits that combined their favored tropes: Basquiat's masks, skulls, graffiti and obscure symbols; Warhol's pop-art imagery, logos and newspaper headlines.
The brief, intense collaboration lasted from 1983 to 1985 and produced some 160 works.
An unprecedented number of them -- 70 -- have been brought together for a show at the Louis Vuitton Fou…]]></summary>

Belief in spirits runs deep in the kingdom, which has a celebrated canon of ghosts from individuals like Mae Nak, a woman who haunted her village after dying in childbirth, to more sinister creatures like krasue -- bodyless women who float through the night looking to devour flesh.
Now these ancient tales are being reinvigorated through online platforms like YouTube, TikTok, WhatsApp and even delivery app Grab.

Malka Leifer was guilty on 18 charges, the jury said, including raping a student during a sleep-over and sexually assaulting another teenage pupil during a school camp.
She was cleared of a further nine charges.
Leifer was the principal of the Adass Israel School in Melbourne when she was first accused of sexual assault in 2008.
A dual Israeli-Australian citizen, Leifer fled to Israel before she could be arrested, sparking a drawn-out court battle spanning more than 70 extradition hearings.
The fugitive mother-of-eight was finally flown back to Australia in 2021 and was put on trial in February this year…]]></summary>

Russian authorities have claimed that Ukraine was behind the St. Petersburg café bombing 
The explosion that killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a St. Petersburg café was a terrorist attack, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. 
His statement came after Russian authorities accused Ukraine of orchestrating the blast.

WNU Editor: By classifying this attack as a terrorist attack I expect in the coming days new laws that will permit Russia's security forces to now specifically target certain Ukrainian government officials and organizations/its special forces/as well as its intelligence services.

 
Update #3: Russian authorities are also blaming some members of opposition leader Navalny's organization for being involved in this attack .... Tatarsky’s murder plotted by Ukrainian intel services, involved Navalny’s firm — officials (TASS).]]></summary>

A pro-Western coalition and Boyko Borissov’s GERB were neck and neck. 
No clear winner emerged in Bulgaria’s election on Sunday night, much to the dismay of voters who have been to the polls five times in the last two years. 
In the first release of results, it seemed that the pro-Western coalition, Continuing the Change and Democratic Bulgaria, had won a narrow majority with 26.4 percent, beating the center-right establishment party, GERB, which scored 25.5 percent. But in a recount, the former scored 24.8 percent while the latter secured the lead with 25.9 percent. 
Observers expect a clear winner to emerge by Monday after all international voters’ ballots are counted.

RT:  Russia makes payment on sovereign debt

 
According to the country’s settlement depository, Moscow fulfilled its obligations on Friday  
Russia’s Finance Ministry announced on Friday it has settled two issues of dollar-denominated Eurobonds “in full” by sending 17 billion rubles ($221.1 million) in coupon payments to the National Settlement Depository (NSD). 
According to the ministry, the payments were on Eurobonds maturing in 2030. 
“Thus, obligations on servicing the state securities of the Russian Federation were fulfilled by the Finance Ministry in full,” the statement said.

WNU Editor: Russia's current foreign currency reserves are around $580 billion (link here). That is more than enough to cover debt payments for the foreseeable future. 

  
  In the meantime, the current media narrative is that Russia's economy is on the verge of collapse .... Putin’s Russia Is Going Broke Fast. Here’s Why. (New Republic). 
On a side note. I asked one of my closest contacts (she is a senior executive at UBS and a good friend) on what would be the consequences to the Western banking system in its current fragile state if Russia defaults on its debt obligations. 
Her answer was .... we would immediately find ourselves in a financial/banking crisis. 
Wow!
I guess that explains why all the talk in 2022 from Western governments and its leaders to force Russia into default has all but disappeared since the start of the current banking crisis with the collapse of Credit Suisse and a number of major US banks.]]></summary>

FOX News: Japan buys Russian oil above $60-a-barrel cap, breaking with US allies: report 
Japan has almost no fossil fuels of its own, relies heavily on imports for much of its energy needs

Japan has begun purchasing Russian crude oil above the $60-a-barrel cap, breaking with Western allies thanks to an exception authorized by the United States.

Update: Japan Buys Russian Oil Above Global $60 Cap (Newsmax)

 
WNU Editor: Just two days ago the EU was saying that oil prices will remain stable, and sanctions coupled with price caps on Russian oil were working .... Russian Oil Price Cap to Stay at $60, European Governments Told (Bloomberg). 
Sighhh .... 
As we learned today with this Japanese purchase of Russian  oil. Russian oil price caps are not universal (i.e. not working), and what is worse, the price of oil is spiking on today's decision by OPEC+ to cut oil production .... Oil Surges After OPEC+'s Unexpected Crude Production Cut. 
I personally thought just a few hours ago that it would take a few months before the Western cap on Russian oil prices would collapse. I was wrong. It just took one day.]]></summary>

* Sanna Marin became the world's youngest prime minister in 2019 at age 34 
* But her Social Democrats party is headed for defeat by two conservative parties 
Finland's 'Party Prime Minister' Sanna Marin has lost lost her bid for a second term - as a right-wing coalition claims victory over her Social Democrats in an extremely tight general election. 
Marin, who made global headlines after she was seen dancing wildly in leaked videos, became the world's youngest prime minister in 2019 at age 34 and had been fighting for a second term just days before Finland's historic accession to the NATO defence alliance. 
But her party has lost out to two conservative parties in an extremely tight three-way race for control of parliament.

WNU Editor: Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin 's party was re-soundly defeated in this election, and only days before Finland is to be formally accepted by NATO. Her defeat also continues the Zelensky curse. The EU political leaders who support Ukraine President Zelensky seem to have a history of getting defeated in the next election.

EurAsian Times: 50,000 North Korean Commandos Prepare To Join Russia’s Special Military Ops In Ukraine – Military Correspondent 
North Korea is preparing to send 500,000 soldiers from its armed forces on combat missions in support of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, a Russian state TV war correspondent has claimed. 
In his youtube video, Aleksander Sladkov, a seasoned Russian journalist specializing in military affairs, claimed that North Korea is firmly aligned with Russia in the ongoing conflict. 
He further added that Pyongyang is willing to contribute to the effort by dispatching its troops to take part in the special military operation – a term commonly used by Moscow instead of referring to the conflict as a war with Ukraine.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
