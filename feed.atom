        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maria Zakharova - spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry - warned the West that the advanced F-16 fighters delivered to Ukraine will be a fair target for Russia if they are based in NATO countries

 
Daily Mail: Russia threatens military strikes on Western countries if Ukraine's newly-donated F-16s are based in NATO territory 
* Russian foreign ministry said F-16s  in NATO countries will be legitimate targets 
Russia has threatened to target Western countries with missile strikes if Ukraine's newly-donated F-16 fighters are based in NATO territory. 
Such an act by Vladimir Putin would also certainly trigger a World War Three scenario between the West and Russia. 
It comes as the Kremlin warned today that a nuclear world war is closer than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

WNU Editor: The Russian foreign ministry is voicing its concerns that Bulgaria and other NATO nations may shift from using their bases for training F-16 pilots to being used as a base to launch strikes against the Russian military .... Bulgaria to allow Ukraine to use its skies for F-16 training (EurActiv). 
As to what is my take,
My fear is that the decision has already been made to permit Ukraine to use NATO bases to conduct military operations against Russia. I say this because President Biden himself warned to Russia two days ago that if Russia should attack a NATO base, it would mean war .... President Biden Signals The U.S. Has Plans To Send U.S. Troops To Fight Russia When Putin Acts Against NATO, and my gut is telling me that this announcement was not a coincidence.]]></summary>

The president warned congressional Republicans wavering on Ukraine: Provide aid now or send U.S. troops to fight Russia when Putin acts against NATO. 
President Joe Biden delivered his sternest warning yet to congressional Republicans balking at approving more aid to Ukraine: Pay up now or you'll pay more later, forced to send U.S. troops to fight Russian soldiers when an emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin moves in on a NATO member country. 
"Congress needs to pass supplemental funding for Ukraine before they break for the holiday. It's as simple as that," Biden said at the White House as the GOP-led House mulled Biden's request for $106 billion in emergency spending, including foreign aid.

"Frankly, I think It's stunning we have gotten to this point in the first place. Republicans in Congress are willing to give Putin the greatest gift he could hope for and abandon our global leadership," Biden said.

The U.S. military says a total of 78 attacks have been carried out against U.S. facilities over the past weeks: 37 were in Iraq and 41 in Syria 
The U.S. embassy in Baghdad was attacked by mortar fire on Friday morning that caused minor material damage but no casualties, U.S. and Iraqi officials said. 
Explosions were heard near the embassy in the capital city of Iraq at approximately 4:15 a.m. on Friday. An embassy spokesperson then confirmed the U.S. Embassy was attacked, adding: "Assessments are ongoing, but there are no reported casualties on the Embassy compound." 
The attack was confirmed by a U.S. military official who said the attack was launched at U.S. and Coalition forces in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses Iraqi government buildings and embassies.

A Falcon Heavy rocket is scheduled to launch the robotic vehicle at 8:14 p.m. EST on Sunday (Dec. 10). 
The U.S. Space Force's mysterious X-37B space plane is just about ready to take flight for the seventh time. 
The Space Force and SpaceX "are making final preparations" for the planned Sunday evening (Dec. 10) launch of the robotic X-37B, Space Force officials said in an emailed update today (Dec. 7). 
The space plane is scheduled to lift off atop a Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a 10-minute window that opens at 8:14 p.m. EST (0114 GMT on Dec. 11). If SpaceX webcasts the launch as expected, you'll be able to watch the action live here at Space.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump Jr. erupted in a profanity-filled tirade against Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on social media on Thursday evening, demanding an end to U.S. support for Ukraine against Russian aggression.
Trump Jr.'s remarks came in response to a right-wing account saying that former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson "confirm[ed]" that Austin warned "your uncles, cousins and sons" might be sent to fight in Russia if Ukraine didn't get the funding it needs.
"How about Go F--k Yourself!!!" wrote Trump Jr. "America doesn't need to keep funding an endless war with no path to victory."
He continued:
"If NATO is worried about Russia encroaching on NATO maybe they should be funding more of this but as always they let America do all the funding while they get virtually all the benefit. No more big wars no more funding the military industrial complex!"
Trump's eldest son added that, "For those of you who are idiots Ukraine lost this war quite some time ago we're just keeping them on life-support with never ending money!"
As of now, the battle lines in Ukraine appear to have reached a relative stalemate, with neither side making substantial breakthroughs and Russia frozen with Crimea and portions of eastern Ukraine still under their control.
ALSO READ: Nazis bullied a conservative Tennessee town. Locals punched back. Trump should be worried.
With current U.S. funding for Ukraine running out, Congress is locked in an impasse over how to get a new package of Ukraine aid, coupled with aid to Israel in their fight against Hamas, approved in the Senate.
Republicans are demanding that the aid be paired with new border controls, including some that could reduce legal immigration. Democratic lawmakers have fiercely resisted this, although President Joe Biden has signaled he's open to a compromise on some of the issues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) is sounding the alarm on communist garlic, The Cato Institute's Scott Lincicome pointed out Thursday. 
The Republican sent a letter to Washington, D.C. secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo pointing out that the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 gives the Commerce Secretary the power to investigate imports that could be national security threats — and that garlic from China is one of them.
"I write to request such an investigation into imports from Communist China of all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves, whether or not peeled, chilled, fresh, frozen, provisionally preserved or packed in water or other natural substance, and the threat they pose to U.S. national security," Scott wrote in his letter. 
"Food safety and security is an existential emergency that poses grave threats to our national security, public health and economic prosperity."

He doesn't give any specific security cause for concern from the bulbs.
The website Spices Inc and a report by USA Today says most of the garlic sold in the U.S. comes from China —  more than 60%.
Of domestic garlic, The California Farmland Trust says that 90 percent of commercial garlic comes from that state.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CBS/AFP: U.S. announces military drills with Guyana amid dispute over oil-rich region with Venezuela 
The United States announced joint military flight drills in Guyana on Thursday as tensions over a contested oil-rich region with neighbor Venezuela prompted the U.N. Security Council to call an urgent meeting. 
A border feud has been spiraling over the Essequibo region, which has been administered and controlled by Guyana for more than a century, although Venezuela also claims the disputed area. Venezuela recently conducted a referendum, which it claims citizens supported, that aims to give Venezuela authority over the Essequibo region. Guyanese officials said in response that the country is preparing to defend itself and its borders in case of an invasion. 
The spat is drawing in the international community, with the U.S. announcement of military exercises the latest sign that Washington is alarmed at the threat from the authoritarian leftist Venezuelan government of President Nicolás Maduro.

“America will not only spend money, but also shed its own blood,” if the U.S. doesn't assist Ukraine in its war against Russia and Russia prevails, said National Security spokesperson John Kirby during a briefing. 
Ukraine’s defeat will invite aggression against the eastern flank of NATO. The U.S. military will be compelled to enter the war in such a scenario, because the U.S. takes “very seriously” its commitments under Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which calls for a collective response to aggression against any member of the Alliance.

Of 42 donor countries tracked by the study, only 20 had committed new aid packages to Ukraine in the last three months, the smallest share since the start of the war. 
Ukraine's allies have drastically scaled back their pledges of new aid to the country, which have fallen to their lowest level since the start of the war, the Kiel Institute's Ukraine aid tracker showed Thursday. 
"The dynamics of support to Ukraine have slowed," the German-based institute said, adding that new military, financial and humanitarian aid promised to Ukraine between August and October 2023 fell almost 90 percent from the same period in 2022, reaching its lowest point since the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022. 
The figures come amid signs of growing cracks in Western support for Ukraine as Kyiv's highly anticipated counteroffensive fails to yield a breakthrough and the world's attention pivots to the Israel-Hamas war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An emergency spending bill to provide billions of dollars in new security assistance for Ukraine and Israel was blocked in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday as Republicans pressed their demands for tougher measures to control immigration at the U.S. border with Mexico. 
The vote was 49 in favor to 51 against, leaving the $110.5 billion measure short of the 60 votes needed in the 100-member Senate to pave the way to start debate, threatening President Joe Biden's push to provide new aid before the end of 2023. 
The vote was along party lines, with every Senate Republican voting no along with Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who generally votes with Democrats but had expressed concerns about funding Israel's "current inhumane military strategy" against Palestinians.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico:  EU warns of ‘huge risk’ of terrorist attacks before Christmas 
Ongoing Israel-Hamas war has knock-on effects for Europe, Ylva Johansson says. 
There is a “huge risk” of terror attacks in the EU ahead of Christmas, European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson warned on Tuesday, linking the threat to the ongoing war in the Middle East. 
“With the war between Israel and Hamas, and the polarization it causes in our society, with the upcoming holiday season, there is a huge risk of terrorist attacks in the European Union,” she told reporters before the start of the Justice and Home Affairs Council. 
Johansson’s comments follow an attack near the Eiffel Tower in Paris last weekend during which a German man was killed, and others injured, by a man who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, according to a French prosecutor. “We saw it recently in Paris, unfortunately we have seen it earlier as well,” Johansson said.

Kyiv Independent: Blinken announces 'one of last' defense aid packages 'unless Congress passes' further funding 
The U.S. announced on Dec. 6 a $175 million defense aid package for Ukraine from previously directed drawdowns, in what Secretary of State Antony Blinken said would be one of the last military aid packages to Ukraine if Congress fails to pass additional funding. 
U.S. President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass a Ukraine aid bill on Dec. 6, saying that failing to support the country would be a "gift" for Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
"Unless Congress acts to pass the president’s national security supplemental funding request, this will be one of the last security assistance packages we can provide to Ukraine," Blinken said in a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fellow actor filed a sexual assault complaint against Gérard Depardieu in September, prosecutors said Wednesday, adding to a string of allegations targeting the French star.
Helene Darras said that Depardieu assaulted her while filming a movie in 2007, Paris prosecutors said, confirming a report from broadcaster France 2.
Investigators were studying the complaint, which likely falls under France's statute of limitations, to decide whether or not to launch a probe.
Depardieu's lawyer Christian Saint-Palais could not immediately be reached for comment.
Darras told France 2 that Depardieu groped her when she was aged 26 and appearing as an extra in the film "Disco".
The older man "ran his hand over my thighs and my buttocks" then "said straight out: 'Do you want to come to my dressing room?'," she added.
Darras rejected the alleged advances, but "that didn't change anything," she went on. "He kept groping me between takes".
Depardieu was in 2020 charged in Paris after allegations of rapes and sexual assaults following a complaint by actor Charlotte Arnould.
Other women have since accused Depardieu of sexual violence in the press.
He insisted that he is "neither a rapist nor a predator" in a letter to conservative newspaper Le Figaro in October.
"Never, but never have I abused a woman," Depardieu wrote, saying that he would not be getting involved in "any projects" given the "context" of the allegations.

REMIX: ‘Has Kyiv already lost?’ – Germany’s Welt newspaper claims Ukraine is ‘crumbling’ and that Orbán was right but ‘nobody dares admit it’ 
In a shocking admission, top German newspaper Welt notes that Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán’s views on the Ukraine conflict were right all along

Germany’s Welt newspaper, perhaps the most popular publication in the country, is well known for its pro-Ukraine stance and ran numerous articles in the past about the likely success of Ukraine’s military offensive against Russia. However, in a column published yesterday by the paper’s chief correspondent, Sascha Lehnartz, the assessment of Ukraine’s chances in the war is decidedly bleak. 
Entitled “Has Kyiv already lost?” the article describes Ukraine’s military growing increasingly despondent to the point that the country’s commander-in-chief admits there is a “stalemate” at the front. 
“Winter is just around the corner. The counteroffensive seems to have failed. The allies are weary. And since the beginning of November at the latest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has a new opponent who was not necessarily to be expected: his own commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny,” writes Die Welt.

The UK press, known for its strong pro-Ukraine reporting, are now publishing stories that give a detailed look on how bleak the actual current situation is for the Ukraine Army ....

A classified briefing Tuesday on Ukraine devolved into a shouting match about border security as senators described a tense meeting that did little to break the Senate’s stalemate over whether to include tighter immigration policies in the aid package.

WNU Editor: So much for this being a classified briefing.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
