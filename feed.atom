        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday he seriously doubted that ramped up Chinese military activities near the Taiwan Strait were a sign of an imminent invasion of the island by Beijing.
"We've seen increased aerial activity in the straits, we've seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan," Austin said during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts.
"But whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, you know, I seriously doubt that," Austin said.

Soledar is a salt-mining town near the city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of a Russian assault aimed at capturing the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
"The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that part of our town of Soledar ... is some sort of a Russian possession," Zelenskiy said in a video address.
"But fighting continues. The Donetsk theatre of operations is holding."
In a separate statement on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the Russians were suffering heavy losses as they tried to take Soledar and cut off the supply routes for pro-Kyiv units.

Donelan told BBC radio a deal reportedly negotiated by the British Museum's chairman, George Osborne, was not about the permanent return to Greece of the ancient sculptures.
That was "not his intention", Donelan said referring to Osborne, a former finance minister under ex-prime minister David Cameron.
Such a move would "open a can of worms" and "open the gateway to the question of the entire contents of our museums", she said.
The sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, were taken from the Parthenon temple at the Acropolis in Athens in the early 19th century by British diplomat Tho…]]></summary>

Washington Free Beacon: Iran To Station Warships in Panama Canal  
Iran entering Pacific Ocean for first time Iran's navy is set to station warships for the first time in the Panama Canal, a critical trade route in America's backyard that has never before seen an Iranian military presence.
Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, the commander of Iran's navy, said on Wednesday that his forces will establish a presence in the Panama Canal later this year, marking the first time Iran's military has entered the Pacific Ocean. 
Iran in recent years has placed a greater focus on moving its military into Latin American territories as it strengthens relations with anti-American dictators in the region, most notably in Venezuela. 
Iranian vessels have docked more frequently in Venezuela as Tehran's hardline regime seeks to prop up dictator Nicolás Maduro. 
These moves are meant to provoke the United States and signal that Tehran has the ability to station its military apparatus a stone's throw from U.S. territory.

BBC: Afghanistan: Deadly suicide bombing outside foreign ministry 
A suicide bomb attack outside the Afghan foreign ministry in Kabul has caused heavy casualties.
 Police said at least five civilians had been killed but another Taliban official put the toll as high as 20. 
The attack took place about 16:00 local time (11:30 GMT) when the bomber tried, but failed to enter the ministry building itself, the Taliban said. 
No group has claimed responsibility. Several countries, including Turkey and China, have embassies in the area. 
Reports suggest a Chinese delegation was due to hold talks with the Afghan officials inside the foreign ministry building at the time of the attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: FAA fails to explain catastrophic 'computer failure' that delayed at least 7,000 flights and halted America's air traffic for the first time since 9/11 - as it lifts ground order on planes after two-and-a-half hours of chaos 
* The FAA's NOTAM system - which pilots use to see flight plans - failed overnight 
* The White House says there is 'no evidence' of a cyber attack  
* The issue was fixed by 9am but more than 7,000 flights were delayed as a result  
All flights across America were grounded today for the first time since 9/11 after an as-yet unexplained, FAA computer system failure.  
The first complaints by passengers that their flights had been grounded started at around 4am EST, but it wasn't until 6.30am that the FAA announced it had grounded all flights as a result of an overnight crash of its NOTAM system - which pilots use to receive hazard warnings and safety updates. 
By 9am, the issue had been resolved and flights were beginning to take off again.

Another edict that removes women from public life and makes it harder for the country’s most vulnerable to get help.
 Saara, who works for an international agency in Afghanistan, said that on the December day the Taliban banned women from working for nongovernmental organizations, she thought: Just “kill us at once.” 
This was the latest of the Taliban’s edicts to restrict the rights of women, like banning girls from attending secondary school in March, and then universities in December, and now taking away their jobs. They “have a knife,” she said of the Taliban. “It is not a knife which is able to cut something at once; you n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's top prosecutor's office on Tuesday said it launched an inquiry into new President Dina Boluarte and members of her cabinet over violent clashes that have seen at least 40 killed and hundreds injured since early December.
The inquiry comes after 17 civilians were killed in the country's southern Puno region on Monday - the most lethal day of protests since former President Pedro Castillo was ousted and detained last month. The violence continued on Tuesday with a police officer dying after his car was torched. 
The attorney general's office said it was investigating Boluarte along with Prime Minister Alberto Otarola, Defense Minister Jorge Chavez and Interior Minister Victor Rojas on charges of "genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In death as in life, Cardinal George Pell split opinion in Australia: while believers on Wednesday mourned the passing of a "great churchman", sexual abuse survivors said they would shed no tears.
One of the most powerful figures in the Roman Catholic Church, Pell died at the age of 81 on Tuesday in Rome due to heart complications following a hip operation.
The man who was convicted, jailed and then cleared of molesting two 13-year-old choirboys in the 1990s remains deeply polarizing.
"It was very sad personal news to hear and quite a shock," said Archbishop of Melbourne Peter Comensoli.
But Phillip Nagle, an abuse survivor in Victoria, said he believed Pell knew more about sexual abuse than he let on.
"None of us will be shedding any tears," he was quoted as saying in Melbourne's The Age …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's sports associations have been told to include "China" in their official names or risk having funding pulled, as authorities embrace nationalism after quashing democracy protests.
The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that its member associations have until July 1 to complete the name change.
Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China but competes separately from the country in international sports, including at the Olympics.
Fewer than 20 of the 83 Hong Kong sports organizations listed on the Olympic Committee's website have "China" in their names.
There is the Hong Kong China Swimming Association for example. However, Hong Kong's football association currently has no reference to China in its name.

The Gare du Nord is a busy commuter hub which also serves as a departure point for trains to northern France, London and northern Europe.
Police were treating the stabbings as attempted murder, not as a terrorist attack, a source close to the case said.
The attacker's motive was not immediately clear.
One of the six people was seriously wounded in the attack at 6:42 am (0542 GMT), while the other five sustained light injuries, prosecutors said.
The entire incident was over within two minutes, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters at the scene.
It was not immediately clear what type of weapon the attacker had used.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday appeared virtually at Hollywood’s 80th annual Golden Globe Awards to tell the audience of entertainment industry A-listers that “there will be no third World War” as the tide turns in Ukraine’s conflict with Russia. 
Zelensky highlighted the award show’s origins back in 1943, during World War II, and said Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion symbolizes “the struggle for the right of the new generations to know about the war only from movies.”  
“The First World War claimed millions of lives. The Second World War claimed tens of millions of them. There will be no third World War. It is not a trilogy,” Zelensky said, promising that Ukraine “will stop the Russian aggression” with the help of the free world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: White House Rips McCarthy-GOP Deal as Path to ‘Defund’ Military 
(Bloomberg) -- The White House accused GOP lawmakers of seeking to “defund” the military, seizing on an agreement to elect Kevin McCarthy speaker of the House that may lead to defense spending cuts. 
 “This push to defund our military in the name of politics is senseless and out of line with our national security needs,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement.
“There is bipartisan opposition to defense cuts because making us less capable of keeping the American people safe and advancing our national security interests would be a profound mistake that our nation cannot afford.” 
As part of the arrangement with conservative dissidents to win the speaker’s gavel on the 15th ballot early Saturday, McCarthy agreed to insist on capping discretionary spending across the government at $1.47 trillion for fiscal 2024 — about $130 billion less than in 2023.  
Some GOP lawmakers say that no part of the government should be spared, including the Pentagon.

China has suspended issuing short-term visas in South Korea and Japan after announcing it would retaliate against countries that required negative COVID-19 tests from Chinese travellers. 
China ditched mandatory quarantines for arrivals and allowed travel to resume across its border with Hong Kong on Sunday, removing the last major restrictions under the "zero-COVID" regime after Beijing abruptly reversed its "zero COVID" policy last month following historic protests. 
But the virus is spreading unchecked among its 1.4 billion people, and worries over the scale and impact of the outbreak have prompted countries including Australia, Japan, South Korea, the United States to require negative COVID-19 tests from travellers from China.

India is expected to surpass China and become the world’s most populous nation within the next three months, according to a recent report by the United Nations’ population division, marking a seismic shift on the global stage in a trend with significant social and economic impact for both countries. 
“Most people think India's economy is still a fraction of what it could be in the future, which means there's so much promise,” Dr. Audrey Truschke, an associate professor of South Asian History at Rutgers University, told Yahoo News, adding that much of the potential is due in large part to India being “such a young country.” 
Of the rapidly growing 1.41 billion people in India, about 1 in 4 are under the age of 15 and nearly half are under 25. By comparison, China’s population is about 1.45 billion, but those under 25 make up only a quarter of the population.

CNN — Ukrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the United States as soon as next week, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday. 
The training program will take place at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, where the US conducts its own training on operating and maintaining the advanced air defense system. 
Fort Sill is one of the Army’s four basic training locations and home to the service’s field artillery school, which has been training service members for more than a century. 
CNN first reported the news earlier on Tuesday, with two US officials familiar with the matter saying the decision had been made to begin training in the US.

The launch from Spaceport Cornwall in England did not go as planned. 
NEWQUAY, U.K. — The first-ever orbital mission to lift off from the United Kingdom did not go as planned. 
That flight, the "Start Me Up" mission by Virgin Orbit, started out well enough. The company's carrier plane, known as Cosmic Girl, lifted off from Spaceport Cornwall here on schedule Monday (Jan. 9) at 5:02 p.m. EST (2202 GMT).  
Cosmic Girl dropped Virgin Orbit's 70-foot-long (21 meters) LauncherOne rocket at 6:09 p.m. EST (2309 GMT), while the plane was off Ireland's southwest coast. The rocket's first stage did its job, and LauncherOne's two stages separated as planned about 3.5 minutes after the drop.

Prior to its Jan. 10 release, "Spare" was the talk of the year as several outlets leaked a few of its most damning bits.

— Financial Times (@FinancialTimes) January 10, 2023
   Washington Post: U.S., Japan set to announce shake-up of Marine Corps units to deter China 
Japan, already Washington’s most important ally in the Indo-Pacific, is deepening its strategic partnership with the United States in an effort to counter China — a development that will be showcased this week with a shake-up of U.S. Marine Corps units in Okinawa and a White House embrace of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. 
Kishida’s visit to Washington comes as his political standing is wavering, his poll approval ratings often below 40 percent, and with President Biden wanting to give a stalwart partner a boost. It comes, too, on the heels of Japan announcing a major hike in defense spending, and a new national security strategy that calls for “counterstrike” or long-range strike capability — enabling it to reach targets in mainland China. 
“The meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida will highlight the pivotal moment we are in for the US-Japan alliance,” White House officials said in a statement to The Post.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank slashed its 2023 growth forecasts on Tuesday to levels teetering on the brink of recession for many countries as the impact of central bank rate hikes intensifies, Russia's war in Ukraine continues, and the world's major economic engines sputter. 
The development lender said it expected global GDP growth of 1.7% in 2023, the slowest pace outside the 2009 and 2020 recessions since 1993. In its previous Global Economic Prospects report in June 2022, the bank had forecast 2023 global growth at 3.0%.  It forecast global growth in 2024 to pick up to 2.7% -- below the 2.9% estimate for 2022 -- and said average growth for the 2020-2024 period would be under 2% -- the slowest five-year pace since 1960.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Bogdan Kochubey
KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy stripped four political figures of their Ukrainian citizenship on Tuesday, including pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk who was transferred to Russia last year in a prisoner swap deal.
"I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
"If people's deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate."
Medvedchuk, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, headed a banned pro-Russian party the "Opposition Platform - For Life" in Ukraine and was facing treason charges before being transferred to Moscow in September 2022.
Kozak and Kuzmin had been both elected to Ukraine's parliament as members of Medvedchuk's party.
The United States imposed sanctions on Kozak, the owner of three television channels, in January of 2022 for alleged spreading of Russian disinformation, after Kyiv sought his arrest on treason charges.
Ukraine has also charged Kuzmin with high treason.
Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker also sanctioned by Washington, was charged in the United States in December with money laundering and sanctions violations.
He had been accused of helping Russia interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2020.

As the UAE tries to join Russia in mediating between Ankara and Damascus, the US is looking to establish a middle ground between Turkiye and the SDF in hopes of preventing normalization with Syria 
During a speech in Ankara on 5 January, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted that a meeting with his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad may soon take place, “as part of efforts for peace.” He added that a tripartite meeting between the foreign ministers of Turkiye, Russia and Syria is scheduled to be held in the near future for the first time since 2011. 
The upcoming meeting aims to enhance communication after Russian-sponsored talks between the Turkish and Syrian defense ministers were held in Moscow on 28 December. The meeting was the highest-level of official meetings between Ankara and Damascus since the start of the Syrian war.  In a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on 5 January, Erdogan called on the Syrian government to “take the steps to achieve a tangible solution concerning the case of Syria.”

Understanding Bolsonarismo, the red-pilled protest movement that sieged Brasilia.
 In Brazil’s capital on Sunday, thousands of protesters attacked government institutions in a dangerous echo of the United States’s January 6 insurrection. 
It comes in response to the election of Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva and the leftist Workers’ Party (known by the acronym PT), which ousted Jair Bolsonaro this fall. Lula may be the most skilled politician in recent memory, but he and PT come with baggage from previous administrations in the 2000s and ha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thousands of "hostile" web attacks launched from Russian IP addresses have targeted an online auction of prints by British graffiti artist Banksy in aid of Ukraine, the charity Legacy of War Foundation said Tuesday.
The elusive street artist is selling 50 new limited edition screen-prints through the charity to raise funds to support Ukrainian civilians affected by conflict.
To get one of the £5,000 ($6,080) prints, which show a mouse sliding down the side of a box with "FRAGILE" printed on it, supporters have to register online with the charity.
But a message posted on its website said it had "received over 1 million requests (and 3,500 hostile attacks from Russian IP addresses), so we would appreciate your patience at this time".
"We are currently sifting through the registered entries and will notify successful applicants shortly," it added.
Banksy previously said he supported the charity as he had seen one of its teams "sweep in and provide medical attention, heaters, fresh water and a friendly face to some very desperate people in a bombed-out building".
The artist confirmed he was behind seven murals that appeared on destroyed buildings around Kyiv last year.

FRANCE 24 spoke to several workers who do arduous jobs – and who are up in arms about the plans to take away the cherished right to retire at 62.
There’s been talk of Macron renewing his pensions reform for months – but everyone knows the broad outline. The centerpiece of the legislation will be raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, and increasing the number of years people must have worked to qualify for a full pension.
Macron became the first French president in a generation to lose a National Assembly majority in last year’s parliamentary elections. That m…]]></summary>

PARIS (Reuters) -The French should work two years longer before they can retire, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said, detailing an unpopular reform of the pension system that risks strikes and will test President Emmanuel Macron's ability to deliver change.
The long-delayed overhaul pushes the retirement age to 64, a move opposed by four in every five citizens according to an Odoxa poll, at a time when many are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis.
"I'm well aware that changing our pension system raises questions and fears among the French," Borne said on Tuesday, adding that her government would work on convincing the French that the reform was necessary.
"We offer today a project to balance our pension system, a project that is fair," …]]></summary>

Daniel Edmund Duggan was arrested in Australia late last year and now faces extradition to the United States, where he is accused of violating an arms embargo.
The 54-year-old was a highly-regarded jet pilot who spent 12 years in the US Marine Corps, reaching the rank of Major and working as a tactical flight instructor.
An indictment filed in 2016 -- but only unsealed in December last year -- alleged Duggan broke US arms control laws by providing "defence services" to "Chinese foreign nationals" after he left the military.
Defence lawyer Dennis Miralis on Tuesday said Duggan's "arbitrary" arrest appeared …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo doubled down on its ridicule of Iran's religious rulers on Tuesday, with fresh cartoons of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei despite protests from Iran and its allies.
"The mullahs aren't happy. The caricatures of their supreme leader... do not seem to have made them laugh," the paper's editor, known as "Riss", writes in the latest edition, which hits newsstands on Wednesday.
"Laughing at themselves has never been a strong point of tyrants," he added.
The paper was hit by a cyber attack after publishing cartoons of Khamenei in last week's special edition, which marked the anniversary of the 2015 attack on its Paris offices that left 12 dead.
"A digital attack doesn't leave anyone dead, but it sets the tone. The mullah's regime feels in such danger that it considers it vital to its existence to hack the website of a French newspaper," Riss wrote.
"It is an honour in one sense, but above all proves that they feel their power is very fragile."
There have been months of protests in Iran sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a woman arrested for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code.
Iran issued an official warning to France over the "insulting and indecent" cartoons in last week's Charlie Hebdo.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian movement in Lebanon, also condemned the cartoons, saying Khamenei was not just a ruler but "a religious symbol for tens of millions of believers".]]></summary>

For Biden, a historic border crisis, surging fentanyl deaths, and Mexico’s eroding democratic institutions are all interrelated problems. 
 When President Joe Biden arrived in Mexico City on Monday, it was less than a day after right-wing followers of the former Brazilian president stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court, and presidential palace. Less than a week before, a wave of violence engulfed a Mexican state after the country’s military arrested Ovidio Guzmán, the son of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán, and the head of the Sinaloa cartel.
So while trade, drugs, and immigration are the dominant themes of this week’s summit of No…]]></summary>

Similar protests by Tesla owners have sprung up in cities including Henan, Wuxi and Hangzhou in recent days, according to owners and social media posts. Tesla has faced online backlash over previous price cuts in China before but nothing as widespread as the current spontaneous protests.
The groups protesting across China were in touch with each other and would continue to press Tesla to offer them some compensation, said Damon Yu, 29, who bought a Model Y in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 11 people have died in storms across the Philippines in the past week, with more heavy rain expected in already sodden regions of the disaster-prone country, authorities said Tuesday.
Bad weather has plagued the country's southern and central islands since the Christmas weekend when downpours triggered flooding and landslides that left 52 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Since January 3, back-to-back storms have killed 11 people as floodwaters swept through houses, cut roads and swamped crops, the civil defense office said.
The state weather forecaster warned Tuesday of "serious flooding" in low-lying areas and landslides in the mountains of the central island of Samar.
Heavy rain has already inundated villages, with water levels reaching three meters (10 feet) in some places.
So far, one person was missing and more than 2,200 people had been evacuated from their homes, said Josh Echano, Northern Samar provincial disaster officer.
The number of evacuees was expected to rise.
"The flood is progressing since yesterday, it's not subsiding," Echano said.
"This could be fatal. This could be one of the worst (floods)."
The Philippines is ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, and scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer.

The "horizontal launch" mission had left from the coastal town of Newquay in southwest England, with Virgin's LauncherOne rocket carried under the wing of a modified Boeing 747 called "Cosmic Girl", and later released over the Atlantic Ocean.
"We appear to have an anomaly that has prevented us from reaching orbit," the company said. "We are evaluating the information."
The failure deals a further blow to European space ambitions after an Italian-built Vega-C rocket mission failed after lift-off from French Guiana in late December.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brown hillsides and slivers of snow -- a common sight across Europe's Alps, and a far cry from the winter wonderland tourists had banked on.
While some snow started to fall again early this week, Europe has seen "extreme" warm winter weather in recent days, experts say, with 2023 already posting record January temperatures across the region.
From Austria to France, Italy and Switzerland, slopes have melted away -- with temperatures too high even to make artificial snow.
Many lower-lying resorts have had to close, while others are offering reduced services.
"In the last days it's not been cold or wintery... so winter holidaymakers probably don't really feel like skiing," Nazar Nydza, managing director of the Semmering Hirschenkogel Bergbahnen told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit deep under the ocean off Indonesia and East Timor early Tuesday, injuring at least one person after rattling nearby islands, damaging homes and forcing residents to flee in panic.
The epicentre of the quake was 427 kilometres (265 miles) south of the Indonesian island of Ambon at a depth of 95 kilometres, the US Geological Survey reported.
Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said the tremor was felt on the eastern islands of Timor, the Maluku archipelago and Papua. It reported some aftershocks at a magnitude of 5.5.
"I was in bed, then I felt a little shake. I woke up and found out that many of my friends felt it too," Hamdi, an Indonesian in Ambon, told AFP.
The country's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said at least 15 homes …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would likely fail if the United States helps defend the island -- but at a debilitating cost to the American military itself, according to a US think tank Monday.
Military experts brought together by the Center for Strategic and International Studies to wargame the conflict said every likely direct participant in a war -- the United States, China, Taiwan and Japan -- would experience "enormous" losses.
Chinese missiles would likely destroy US air bases in Japan and as far as Guam, and sink two US aircraft carriers and between 10 and 20 destroyers and cruisers as the invasion opened.
But the Chinese invading force itself would be heavily destroyed before it ever occupied any significant part of Taiwan.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will host his US counterpart Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for three-way talks known as the "Three Amigos" summit.
While efforts to tackle migration and drug smuggling dominated a bilateral meeting between Lopez Obrador and Biden on Monday, the focus is expected to shift to the economy when Trudeau joins them.

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2026 would result in thousands of casualties among Chinese, United States, Taiwanese and Japanese forces, and it would be unlikely to result in a victory for Beijing, according to a prominent independent Washington think tank, which conducted war game simulations of a possible conflict that is preoccupying military and political leaders in Asia and Washington. 
A war over Taiwan could leave a victorious US military in as crippled a state as the Chinese forces it defeated.  At the end of the conflict, at least two US aircraft carriers would lie at the bottom of the Pacific and China’s modern navy, which is the largest in the world, would be in “shambles.”
