“I think Speaker Pelosi’s visit was unnecessary. It was driven as much by US domestic politics with the midterms coming up as what it was by her genuine and long-standing concern for human rights,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“It was clear that Pelosi made the visit against the wishes of the President.

Mr Trump's company, The Trump Organisation, is being investigated for misstating the value of assets and misleading tax authorities.

The former president said he had “no choice” but to remain silent under oath.

Mr Xiao warned in his address that there was no compromise on the issue of Taiwan and that it would “re-educate” the Taiwanese on China once it is reunited with the “motherland”. 

“I think it’s a clear signal that China’s ultimate intention, which they’ve made clear for decades, is the reunification of Taiwan with China,” he told Sky News Australia.

A few tips: Before whipping up a frozen treat for friends, make sure there’s room in their freezer to accommodate it.  For recipes that serve more than two, consider making half to eat soon and packing the other half to freeze and eat at a later date, or split a six-serving recipe into three meals into packing them in three two-portion containers.

The question is deeply personal for the President, who has long speculated that her son Beau developed brain cancer due to exposure to fireplaces while serving in Iraq as a member of the Delaware National Guard.  Before signing the legislation, Mr. Biden described the lingering effects of the exposures.

Alergant made the comments during a panel at the Blockchain Futurist Conference titled “The Future of Decentralized Finance” on August 9, which was covered by Cointelegraph reporters on the ground in Toronto, Canada. 
Alongside Alergant, Kevin Hobbs, CEO of Aventus Ventures, Lisa Loud, Co-Founder and CEO of FLUIDEFI, and Ryan Berkin, CEO and Co-Founder of Teller Finance, also participated in the panel.

That didn’t stop a string of Fox News hosts and pundits from collapsing Monday night, declaring the raid a corrupt coup that marked the end of America’s standing as the first country of the world.
In a brief period of sanity for the network, the Fox News anchor Shannon Bream clarified what we do about the raid: “It doesn’t happen overnight,” she said.  “Any DOJ or FBI, any administration will want to exercise exceptional caution.”
“This FBI has clearly made, and this Attorney General has made, the calculation that they think they have enough [evidence] to move forward and risk the political optics of this,” she said.

A year ago this person came to Greenfield to replace Father Tim.  Right away he shouted at Bishop William Byrne that he couldn’t handle the job, then set about destroying what Father Tim had worked diligently for 34 years to make a strong Catholic community. (Father Tim did the work of four priests).  Now he wants to bury the name of the Holy Trinity and the Blessed Sacrament and give it a name.  I understand that both churches have been around for about 200 years, so it would be an injustice not to have our own identity.  Please write, text or call Reverend William Byrne at 76 Elliot Street, Springfield, MA 01102-1730 and let him know that we are very proud of our churches and if any changes need to be made we should be involved in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite a massive wave of liquidations in the cryptocurrency market, some companies that have been selling off their crypto in recent months are not bearish on Bitcoin (BTC) at all.
Canadian investment firm Cypherpunk Holdings was one of the firms that opted to sell off crypto in the middle of the crypto winter of 2022, liquidating 100% of its Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) by June.  One of the world’s first public companies to invest in Bitcoin, Cypherpunk said at the time that it maintained its long-term “bullish outlook on crypto” despite selling off all of its digital coins.
One may find Cypherpunk’s crypto liquidation somewhat odd, as the company’s shares publicly trade under the symbol HODL on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  The acronym is widely used in the crypto community to refer to “Hold …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issey Miyakethe Japanese designer famous for his style of pleated clothes and his cult perfumes, and whose name has become a global synonym of cutting-edge fashion in the 1980ss, died August 5.  He was 84 years old.
The death was announced Tuesday by studio Miyake Design, which said the cause was liver cancer.  He did not say where Mr. Miyake died. 
Mr. Miyake is perhaps best known for his signature micro pleating, which he first unveiled in 1988 but has recently seen growing popularity among a new and younger clientele.


Its proprietary heat treatment system means the accordion pleats are machine washable, never lose their shape and offer the ease of loungewear.  He also produced the black turtleneck that became part of the signature look of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.


This is a developing story.

For Hampshire County voters, three Democratic candidates are running for Hampshire County Sheriff. 
Each has unique qualifications to run the Hampshire County Jail and Reformatory.  I believe Caitlin Sepeda’s background in public health and nursing gives her the vision to lead this facility into the future. 
I encourage constituents to read her position papers and meet her in person.  Her position papers outline how she plans to run the house of corrections.  By meeting her, you understand that she has the knowledge, skills and ability to put those plans into action.

The hotly contested race to lead the flagship East African nation of Kenya reaches its climax on Tuesday when 22 million registered voters must choose between William Ruto, 55, currently the country’s vice-president, and Raila Odinga, a 77-year-old political veteran years old who is making his fifth candidacy for the presidency.

It is also a chance for Emery, in his first season as Arsenal manager, to lead his side to the Champions League at the expense of bitter north London neighbors Tottenham Hotspur.
But Aubameyang, usually a lock from the penalty spot, fails to score.  That shot, that missed opportunity, was the moment, as far as Emery was concerned, that not only ended Arsenal’s hopes of playing alongside European footballi…]]></summary>

Calls on Neal to fix ‘fallout disposal provision’ for retirees

I don’t know how many people know about the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, but it makes it impossible for many of us in Massachusetts to increase our fixed incomes, especially in this horribly bloated economy. 
WEP essentially removes 60% of what you are owed to Social Security based on what you have contributed due to a state or municipal pension.  My husband was state, I was municipal.  This makes it impossible for many to retire, as their pension is not substantial and their Social Security payment has been decimated. 
I used to receive statements of the amount I was owed to Social Security to date, based on what I had contributed.  The Social Security …]]></summary>

Trump’s Florida residence was tied to an investigation into whether he illegally took government records when he left the White House have drawn attention to an obscure criminal law prohibiting the deletion of official documents.  Penalties for violations of this law include disqualification from holding any federal office.
Because Mr. Trump is widely believed to be preparing to run for president again in 2024, this unusual sanction has raised the prospect that he could be legally barred from returning to the White House.
Specifically, the law in question — Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code – makes it a crime if someone who has custody of government documents or records “conceals, removes, mutilates, erases,…]]></summary>

The outcome of the vote not only determines Kansas women’s abortion rights, but it is the mother of all political indicators following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v.  Wade.

FBI agents searched his Mar-A-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, according to Mr Trump. 

The former president expressed his anger at the raid in a statement saying it is an attack by “Radical Left Democrats”. 

“Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those countries, corrupt at a level not seen before.”]]></summary>

Mr Paterson said it was not Australia’s place to “dictate” to either Taiwan or US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi what they can do.  

“Where I think we have a very strong interest is in recognising the malign behaviour of the Chinese government,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“It is a grossly disproportionate reaction to fire ballistic missiles into other people’s territorial waters.”]]></summary>

CNN reports the investigation is in relation to the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been transferred to Florida.

Donald Trump, who was not in Florida at the time of the raid, released a statement about the incident.

"These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents," Mr Trump wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby schooled Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy on Tuesday about whether the United States "owned Afghanistan."
During a White House briefing on the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri, Doocy said President Joe Biden's administration "gave a country" to terrorists.
"What did you think was going to happen?" Doocy asked.
"I would take issue with the premise that we gave a whole country to terrorist groups," Kirby replied. 
"It's harboring the world's number one terrorist, how is that not giving a country to a terrorist-sympathizing group?" Doocy pressed.
Kirby objected to Doocy's assumptions.
"I mean, Peter, the way you ask that, it makes it sound like we owned Afghanistan a year ago," the White House official remarked. "It wasn't our country. It was an independent sovereign state and the president made a bold decision to end a war that had been going on for 20 years."

"It's beyond brazen that he would be living in a house of the Minister of Interior," said Graham. "So, my advice would be to move assets forward, get countries in the region who would not benefit from an al-Qaeda rise, and start hitting the training camps."
“What unnerves me is that al-Zawahiri felt comfortable enough being out in the open in the Kabul area after the Taliban takeover. So much for the Taliban rejecting al Qaeda," Graham tweeted on Monday evening. "This is proof positive that Afghanistan has once again become a safe haven for international terror…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington on Tuesday imposed a new round of sanctions targeting Kremlin-connected elites for their role in supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.
"As innocent people suffer from Russia's illegal war of aggression, Putin's allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
The financial sanctions hit Putin-associate and billionaire Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, who owns the Witanhurst estate, the second-largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace. They also targeted Guryev's son and Caribbean-based yacht Alfa Nero.
Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov, one of Russia's largest taxpayers, and two subsidiaries of his MMK, which is among the world's largest steel producers, also were slapped with sanctions, as well as two other Russian elites: Alina Maratovna Kabaeva and Natalya Valeryevna Popova, the statement said.
"The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin's enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives," Yellen said, adding that the goal is "to choke off revenue and equipment underpinning Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine."
In a joint action, the State Department imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions, on oligarchs "running massive revenue-generating companies," including Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko and Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko, as well as nearly 900 officials, and a series of defense- and technology-related firms aiding "Russia's war machine."
The Treasury sanctions seize any US-based funds or property owned by the individuals or organizations, and prohibit American-based firms from having any financial dealings with them, although investors will have a few weeks to wind down transactions with MMK.]]></summary>

Pelosi landed in Taiwan a little after 10 p.m. local time amid China's threats that they'd conduct military exercises around the island while she is there. 
Sullivan explained that he was among the group of Republicans who went to Taiwan in 2021 as China was withholding vaccinations to the island. Sullivan was joined by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) and too faced threats from China as they delivered vaccines. China told the 2021 group to reconsider their trip as well, but it was ignored.

The Egyptian jihadist, who the United States says has been killed in a hideout in the Afghan capital Kabul, never even attempted to replicate the charisma and influence of his predecessor Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States.
But after US special forces killed bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, he played a key role in encouraging a decentralization of the group, which resulted in Al-Qaeda franchises emerging all over the planet.
These include the Al-Shabaab who still control a large chunk of rural Somalia, the JNIM active in We…]]></summary>

Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement insisting the congressional delegation's trip to the island that most of the international community including the United States considers part of China "in no way contradicts" U.S. adherence to the "One China" policy, but rather "honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan's vibrant democracy."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) used her congressional Twitter account to claim that Democrats engaged in a conspiracy to claim terrorist mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed to boost their midterm fortunes.
In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Greene suggested that Democrats were taking action because President Joe Biden had not gotten a boost from Russia's war on Ukraine. 
"November is coming and proxy war with Russia, killing more people and grinding Ukraine to a stump, is not as popular with voters as the admin thought it would be," she opined. "The [White House] admin looks extremely weak & controlled by Zelensky and the Global World Order, but don’t be fooled."
Greene said that Democrats "are not done with weapon sales and money laundering in the form of 'humanitarian aid' in Ukraine."

She argued that there was a conspiracy to kill al-Zawahiri because Ukraine was "causing problems for weak Dems upcoming re-elections."
"They even pivoted back to killing an old Al Qaeda terrorist so Biden could murmur his tough guy talk claiming he led the killing of Zawahiri," the lawmaker wrote. "Biden should be impeached NOT taking credit!"
Greene said that there were many "good questions" about the killing.
"If we were in Afghanistan for so many years, why is it we just found out where Zawahiri is and finally killed him?" she asked. "What trade was made for that Intel?"
"Is there proof he was killed?" Greene continued. "It was recently reported he was sick and dying."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in Taiwan late on Tuesday, starting a visit that Beijing had warned her against taking, saying it would undermine Sino-US relations.
Live television images showed the 82-year-old lawmaker, who flew on a US military aircraft into Taipei's Songshan Airport, being greeted on arrival by Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
"Our congressional delegation’s visit to Taiwan honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant Democracy," Pelosi said in a statement shortly after landing.
"America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy."
China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, and a foreign ministry spokesman said earlier this week that any visit by Pelosi would be "a gross interference in China's internal affairs" and warned that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army will never sit idly by".
Pelosi was on a tour of Asia that includes announced visits to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan.

Russia's defence ministry, headed by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine's deputy head of military intelligence, had admitted to the Telegraph newspaper that Washington coordinates HIMARS missile strikes.

Truss is backed by 48% of Conservative Party members compared with 43% for former finance minister Sunak, according to the poll of 807 people by Italian data company Techne, carried out July 19-27.
This suggests a much tighter race than a previous poll of Conservative members carried out by YouGov on July 20-21 that showed Truss with a 24-point lead over Sunak.
Sunak and Truss are competing in a summer tour of hustings around Britain for the votes of about 200,000 Conservative members, who will select the next prime minister with the winner announced Sept. 5.

"We cannot say for sure right now whether she will or will not get there, but everything about this tour and the possible visit to Taiwan is purely provocative," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
China has repeatedly warned Pelosi against going to Taiwan, which it claims as its own. Beijing says a Pelosi visit would contravene the one-China principle that Washington has vowed to abide by.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A land iguana that disappeared more than a century ago from one of the Galapagos Islands is reproducing naturally following its reintroduction there, Ecuador's environment ministry announced Monday.
The reptile from the Conolophus subcristatus species, one of three land iguanas living on the archipelago, disappeared from Santiago Island in the early part of the 20th century according to a 1903-06 expedition there by the California Academy of Sciences, the ministry said.
In 2019, the Galapagos National Park (PNG) authority reintroduced more than 3,000 iguanas from a nearby island to restore the natural ecosystem of Santiago, which lies at the center of the Pacific archipelago.
The remote island chain was made famous by British geologist and naturalist Charles Darwin's observations on evolution there.
In 1835, Darwin recorded a huge number of iguanas of all ages on Santiago.
PNG director Danny Rueda said "187 years later we are once again seeing a healthy population of land iguanas with adults, juveniles and newborns.
"It's a great conservation achievement and strengthens our hopes of restoration on the islands that have been severely affected by introduced species."
Located close to 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos islands are home to unique flora and fauna and are a Natural World Heritage site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. killed top al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who served as Osama bin Laden's No. 2 in the ongoing attacks on the United States. But according to an NBC report from 2020, former President Donald Trump had an opportunity to do the same, but refused because he didn't recognize al-Zawahiri's name. 
Reporting in early 2020, NBC News reported that intelligence officials briefed then-President Trump many times about the most worrisome terrorist threats, specifically mentioning al-Zawahri.
Trump would ultimately agree to take out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Yemeni al Qaeda chief Qasim al-Rimi. But other of the significant names on the CIA's list were ignored.  
Trump "was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name," the report said at the time. 

"He would say, 'I've never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?'" the former official told NBC.
A Pentagon official agreed, noting, "That was the only name he knew." 
By contrast, Biden explained that after "relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family."
"This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians, and one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success," Biden also said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday's edition of CNN's "The Situation Room," retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling broke down the significance of the successful U.S. strike that took out Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda who took over from Osama bin Laden.
Zawahiri, noted Hertling, has been sought by the U.S. for decades — and was a critical piece of the terrorist operation.
"How significant is this strike killing the al-Qaeda leader?" asked anchor Wolf Blitzer.
"This is a target the U.S. has been going after for three decades, even before the 9/11 strike," said Hertling. "He leads al-Qaeda with various networks around the globe. Central places in control. These areas, we're talking about an individual who is the CEO of this organization. You can debate how powerful he is, compared to bin Laden, but it's a big deal."
Another important aspect, said Hertling, is how the U.S. was able to take him out despite no longer having on-the-ground intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, having withdrawn U.S. forces last year.
"This is more than likely a drone strike. I would give that a 70 percent possibility," said Hertling. "I would not rule out a hand strike on this individual, either. What you are talking about, the kinds of things we were talking about when we withdrew from Afghanistan, this will be an over-the-horizon strike with very little capability for collecting intelligence within Afghanistan. This was a significant hit by both the intelligence community and anyone who pulled off the operation."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed over the weekend in Afghanistan while hiding out at the home of an Afghan government official and Taliban member, the New York Times reported. 
According to reports, President Joe Biden, who was isolated with a rebound infection of COVID-19, authorized the strike against al-Zawahiri. Biden will address the nation at 7:30 p.m. EST Monday evening. 
He is among the most pursued terrorists in the world after the slaying of Osama bin Laden, MSNBC reported. 
The Times also reported that the operation was not a military one, and instead was conducted through the CIA. The government won't respond to questions about it, however. 
Al-Zawahiri was among the top organizers of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Towers, the Washington Post described. 
"Zawahiri was a senior adviser to bin Laden at the time of al-Qaeda’s first high-profile terrorist attacks, the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds of people," said the report. "Three years later, working from al-Qaeda’s base in Afghanistan, he helped oversee the planning of what would become one of history’s most audacious terrorist attacks: the Sept. 11 strikes in New York and Washington."
Sept. 11 hijackers were sent to begin training in the U.S. while Zawahiri was in charge of following up on other terrorist attacks that aimed to weaken the U.S. economy. 
"He launched an ambitious biological weapons program, establishing a laboratory in Afghanistan and dispatching disciples to search for sympathetic scientists as well as lethal strains of anthrax bacteria," said the Post.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[QAnon influencers and anti-vaxxers are spreading an antisemitic conspiracy theory about the global food crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Conspiracy theorist Twitter accounts have started pushing disinformation blaming Jewish people for the interruption of grain exports from Ukraine, echoing claims by the Russian government -- which has blamed western sanctions on the disruption, according to research by the Network Contagion Research Institute that was reported by The Guardian.
"According to NCRI, the accounts frequently link rising food insecurity to a 'cabal of shadowy, and often Jewish elites, for bringing about the New World Order,' rather than to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine," the newspaper reported.
Russia has blocked Ukraine's shipping ports, which puts millions of people in Africa and elsewhere at risk of starvation, but antisemitic social media users are making up claims about Jewish manipulation of the food supply.

“Never believe for one moment there’s a shortage of anything. Food. Water. Oil. They create and manufacture these shortages. These aren’t naturally occurring whatsoever," claimed QAnon influencer GhostEzra.
The NCRI and the Rutgers Miller Center conducted open-source analysis of Russian disinformation websites and individuals, and then analyzed the use of terms around food security on Twitter and Telegram, and detected the pattern of disinformation flowing from Kremlin-linked media and QAnon influencers and other conspiracy theorists.
“There is a significant overlap between QAnon and other anti-vax and online conspiracy communities,” said Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst at the NCRI and a research fellow at the Rutgers Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience. “Some of the more colorful food-mandate conspiracies intermingle with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a wide-ranging interview on the Australian radio's The Kyle and Jackie O Show, the father of billionaire industrialist and constant media obsession Elon Musk played down his son's accomplishments before discussing his recent weight gain.
During the over-the-top discussion, Errol Musk claimed that other members of his family have substantial accomplishments, telling the hosts, "You know, we are a family that have been doing a lot of things for a long time. It's not as if we suddenly started doing something."
He also added that rival son Kimbal is his actual "pride and joy," adding that that Elon's brother is also a "billionaire" -- albeit a single-billion billionaire.
Pressed on photos of a pale and fleshy Elon that have popped up in the tabloids recently, Errol told the hosts, "Elon is very strongly built but he's been eating badly," and stated he has been urging his son to use a supplement called garcinia cambogia to help with his weight gain.

Towards the end of the 20-minute interview, he was asked by the laughing hosts if his son is circumcised, and he joked it off by claiming he would send them a picture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced "a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War" and was just "one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation."
"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict," Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation," he said, calling on nations to "put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons."
Guterres's comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The meeting, held at the UN's headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.
Guterres said the conference was "a chance to strengthen" the treaty and "make it fit for the worrying world around us," citing Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.
"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used," the secretary-general implored, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of the August 6, 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city by the United States.
"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening," Guterres added.
In January, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- had pledged to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons.
At the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach agreement on substantive issues.

According to attorney Steve Zissou, Viktor Bout, who was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison after his conviction in 2011 for conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and supplying terrorist groups with weapons should be a serious candidate in the swap negotiations which led the CNN host to bring up Bout's criminal past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong has tipped back into a technical recession, new government figures showed Monday, weighed down by mounting interest rates, weakened global trade and the city's continued adherence to strict coronavirus controls.
Following a year-on-year decrease of 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the city's GDP again reported decline in the second quarter on Monday -- but with a narrower margin of 1.4 percent -- according to advance estimates released by the Census and Statistics Department.
The downturn is reversing last year's recovery when the economy enjoyed a 6.3 percent annual growth after the slowdown in 2019 and 2020, when the city was first upended by months of huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, and then the pandemic.
The Hong Kong government said the economic impr…]]></summary>

"This is the legacy of our ancestors... We are fighting to preserve it every day".

The 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- which has spearheaded so far fruitless diplomatic efforts to restore peace -- last week condemned the junta's execution of four prisoners.
Myanmar has been in chaos since a putsch in February last year and the death toll from the military's brutal crackdown on dissent has passed 2,100, according to a local monitoring group.
Ministers meeting in Phnom Penh from Wednesday are expected to lament the lack of progress on ASEAN's "five-point consensus" plan, agreed to in April last year, which called for an immediate end to violence and dialog…]]></summary>

About a month ago, a group of Washington, D.C. residents planted sunflowers in the public spaces outside the Russian embassy in the U.S. But last week, as the sunflowers grew taller, someone ripped them from the ground and threw them on the sidewalk. Activists returned last Sunday and planted more, pledging that they would continue to plant them every time they were pulled out. 
This weekend, however, something else happened. A group of Washingtonians came together with supplies and helped plant even more. At one point, two little girls took a bunch of sunflowers and laid them on the drive outside the embassy.
