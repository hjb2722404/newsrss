Breaking Defense: Sentinel ICBM faces year delay, Air Force One and F-15EX also at risk: GAO

 
A new watchdog report warns of a year-long delay for America's next ICBM, as well as potential schedule slips for F-15EX, KC-46A and the Air Force One replacement. 
WASHINGTON — The Air Force’s $96 billion Sentinel program that will field a new fleet of nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles is staring down a delay of about a year, the Government Accountability Office warned in a new report today. 
GAO’s annual review of Pentagon weapon systems [PDF] also raised concerns about other key Air Force programs, such as the F-15EX, KC-46A and Air Force One replacement known as the VC-25B. 
Top officials have signaled in recent months that the Sentinel could fall behind, pointing to issues such as supply chain constraints and workforce disruption. A timeline graphic compiled by GAO now states the missile’s initial operational capability (IOC) date is estimated for between April and June 2030, a delay of approximately one year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong recently welcomed Mrs Jo Duncan, Headmistress of Wycombe Abbey UK, to its Hong Kong campus to talk about the synergy between the two schools and to discuss what makes a Wycombe Abbey education special.   “It’s very exciting to have a family of international schools and there’s a great deal that we can do together as we look to the future, both in terms of pupil and staff interactions and the sharing of best practice,” said Mrs Duncan, who was appointed to the role of Headmistress at the UK school in 2019.    This was Mrs Duncan’s first visit to the Hong Kong campus since she took up her role and she was impressed by the eye-catching architecture of the purpose-built Hong Kong school, with its grand atrium and massive glass ceilings that allow natural light to filter in to its corridors. She noted what a privilege it was to study in such a lovely space.     “Coming from Britain where we often work in older, listed buildings where you can’t easily alter things because they’ve been there for hundreds of years, it is wonderful to see WASHK’s bright, modern building,” she said.   But beyond the four walls, Mrs Duncan was most excited to connect without staff and pupils and to talk about what is at the heart of a Wycombe Abbey education and how the ‘DNA’ from the UK school is transferred to the school in Hong Kong.   “It’s looking at how to take the ‘DNA’, and the heart of what makes Wycombe Abbey the school that it is and how we can best share that with our sister schools,” she said.      Founded in 1896, Wycombe Abbey UK consistently ranks as one of the top all-girls independent boarding and day schools and has educated a list of notable people including Dame Sarah Springman, former Rector at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, one of the foremost technical universities in the world, and Principal of St Hilda's College at the University of Oxford, and actor Sally Phillips, and CNN…]]></summary>

Washington Post: USAID cuts food aid supporting millions of Ethiopians amid charges of massive government theft 
The U.S. government is suspending food aid to Ethiopia after an investigation uncovered a widespread scheme to steal donated food, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said Thursday, a move that will affect millions of the world’s poorest people. Leaked documents given to donors and shared with The Washington Post indicate that the scheme was coordinated by elements within both the country’s federal and regional governments. 
Officials have been diverting aid from those who need it to feed the military and ex-combatants, and selling it on the open market to millers who re-exported the flour, according to an investigation by USAID that was summarized to The Post by officials familiar with the investigation.

Reuters: In Russia, the Talk Is of 'War' - Even From Putin 
MOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - For more than 15 months Russia has been fighting a war in Ukraine that the Kremlin refused to call a war - but that is changing: President Vladimir Putin is using the word "war" more often. 
When Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, he called it "a special military operation" - a euphemism the Kremlin, Russian ministers and state media mostly stuck to, even coining a new Russian acronym, the "SVO".
Calling the conflict a war was effectively outlawed for the Russian media by a series of very broad laws soon after the invasion. The Russian media was ordered not to use the word war - and has either complied or shut down. 
But in response to what Russia said was a major Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow, Putin last week used the word "war" four times in relation to Ukraine, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks.

WNU Editor: On Day One of the invasion I called this a war. All my friends, family members, and contacts in Russia have also been calling this a war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has reached a secret deal with Cuba to place an electronic eavesdropping facility on the island roughly 100 miles from Florida, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing U.S. officials familiar with classified intelligence. 
 Such a facility would allow Beijing to gather electronic communications from the southeastern United States, which houses many U.S. military bases, as well as monitor ship traffic, the newspaper reported. 
The countries have reached an agreement in principle, the officials said, with China to pay Cuba "several billion dollars" to allow the eavesdropping station, according to the Journal. 
The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the report. The Chinese and Cuban embassies in Washington also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dozens of Chinese fighters and bombers entered patrol area, says Taipei, in latest incursion by military 
Taiwan activated its defence systems on Thursday after reporting 37 Chinese military aircraft flying into the island’s air defence zone, some of which then flew into the western Pacific, in Beijing’s latest mass air incursion. 
China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has over the past three years regularly flown its air force into the skies near the island, though not into Taiwan’s territorial airspace. 
Taiwan’s defence ministry said that starting from 5am it had detected 37 Chinese air force planes, including J-11 and J-16 fighters as well as nuclear-capable H-6 bombers, flying into the south-western corner of its air defence identification zone, or ADIZ. The ADIZ is a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols to give its forces more time to respond to threats.

Fattah missile is a “big generational leap" for Iran weaponry, state TV says 
Iran on Tuesday unveiled what officials are describing as its first domestically-made hypersonic ballistic missile, one it claims can "bypass the most advanced anti-ballistic missile systems of the United States" and "Israel’s Iron Dome." 
The Fattah missile, which was showcased at a ceremony attended by Iranian President Ebrahim Rahisi and commanders of the country’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, has a top speed of around Mach 14 – more than 10,000 mph -- according to Reuters, citing Iranian state media. 
"The precision-guided Fattah hypersonic missile has a range of [870 miles] and it is capable of penetrating all defense shields," Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of the Guards' aerospace force, was quoted by Reuters as saying to state media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: Engineers modeled the disastrous flood that would follow a key dam in Ukraine being destroyed. The reality is even worse, they say. 
* Engineers predicted what would happen if Ukraine's Kakhovka Nova dam was breached. 
* The dam was breached for real on Tuesday, and the reality is worse than predicted, one said. 
* Russia and Ukraine are blaming each other for destroying the dam. 
The impact of Tuesday's breach of a major dam in Ukraine is likely worse than outlined in a widely-shared model of the disaster developed last year, engineers said. 
On Tuesday morning, videos of water flooding through a massive breach in the Kakhokva Nova hydroelectric dam in southern Ukraine were widely shared, with Ukraine and Russia blaming each other for the disaster. 
In the wake of the news, animated maps created in October last year by Swedish engineers Dämningsverket have widely recirculated on social media.

A state of emergency was declared following an explosion at the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine that also destroyed an adjacent hydroelectric power plant.
"The city is flooded," said Vladimir Leontyev, the Moscow-appointed mayor of Nova Kakhovka. The power plant is also underwater, he said.
On the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River, Leontyev said a total of 600 houses in three regions were affected by severe flooding.
An explosion destroyed the dam early Tuesday morning. Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up the dam and the nearby hydroelectric power station to disrupt the planned Ukrainian counteroffensive. Moscow denies this and claims that the Ukrainian army shelled the plant.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A huge Soviet-era dam on the Dnipro River that separates Russian and Ukrainian forces in southern Ukraine was breached on Tuesday, unleashing floodwaters across the war zone.
Ukraine said Russia had destroyed it, while Russia said Ukraine sabotaged it to cut off water supplies to Crimea and distract attention from a "faltering" counter-offensive.
What is the dam, what happened - and what do we not know?
THE KAKHOVKA DAM
The dam, part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, is 30 metres (98 feet) tall and 3.2 km (2 miles) long. Construction was started under Soviet leader Josef Stalin and finished under Nikita Khrushchev.
The dam bridged the Dnipro river, which forms the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the south of Ukraine.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's ruling party comfortably captured a major historic stronghold of the opposition in an election on Sunday, consolidating President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's hold on power ahead of the battle to succeed him next year.
Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) won the State of Mexico gubernatorial contest by more than 8 percentage points, according to preliminary results from the state's electoral institute.
The victory adds Mexico's most populous region to the 21 other states MORENA already controls, now more than two-thirds of the total. Another state is governed by a group allied to MORENA, giving the party a huge power base heading into the presidential elections due to be held on June 2, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Off the spectacular Greek tourist island of Santorini, divers drag deadly "ghost nets" from the depths of the Aegean Sea which have claimed the lives of thousands of fish.
"These abandoned nets are like fish traps," said diver Mika Panagiotopoulou, one of a group of volunteers who have been descending up to 45 meters to fish out discarded nets, tyres and plastic bags from the crystalline blue waters.
"For half a century the build-up of these abandoned nets has swept up thousands of fish and caused incalculable damage to the flora and fauna of our seas," said Santorini's mayor Antonis Sigalas, as the rubbish was gathered up at the little port of Vlychada before being recycled.

Some of the nets and plastic fished from the sea off Santorini ARIS MESSINIS
"For World Environment Day we want to highlight the dangers of abandoned fishing nets for our seas," said George Sarelakos, co-founder of Aegean Rebreath, the Greek NGO behind the clean-up.
"Discarded fishing nets account for about a tenth of the world's marine pollution and it's a real challenge because up to now it has been invisible -- because most people have no idea of what in hidden in the depths," he added.
Over the last five years, Aegean Rebreath's 300 volunteer divers have removed more than 28 tonnes of nets and hundreds of thousands of plastic bags -- one of the greatest scourges of the aquatic world -- from Greek waters.
Despite a tax being levied on plastic bags in Greece since 2018, shops still hand them out with abandon.
However, Sarelakos said there has been some progress. "There has been a change of mentality among fisherman and now they are handing (nets) over to be recycled."
"It is hard for a fisherman to survive so they put down more and more nets, which leads to fewer fish. It's a vicious circle," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 500 people were evacuated from their homes in northern Ecuador on Sunday following flooding caused by heavy rains, President Guillermo Lasso said.
No one had been reported dead or missing, he said.
Dozens of residents climbed onto the roofs or balconies of their homes to protect themselves from the rising waters, according to images released by the Ministry of Defense.
Rain had fallen for 12 hours without interruption, causing six rivers to overflow, Lasso said.
"The priority is to save their lives, let's protect them! We have already rescued 500 people and the work continues," he wrote on Twitter.
Authorities evacuated around 500 people by boat and another 30 by helicopter, the Risk Management Secretariat said.
Around 11,750 people were affected by the floods and 16 lost their homes in the province of Esmeraldas, which borders Colombia.
Classes were suspended in several towns where schools were damaged.
Five health centers were also affected.
Between January and May, 36 people have been killed and more than 99,000 affected across Ecuador.
In March, a landslide caused by heavy rains in the Andean town of Alausi buried dozens of houses, killing around 60 people.
Rescuers are still working to recover the bodies of 13 people who went missing in that disaster.

The car, in full working order and registered in France, beat expectations when it went under the hammer in the central town of Tours on Sunday.
The body of the 2CV was hand-crafted out of wood with the same famous curves as the post-war French classic.
It was snapped up by Paris-based collector Jean-Paul Favand, who owns a museum of vintage fairground attractions.
"I'm having difficulty talking after this bet," Favand told AFP by telephone afterwards.
The auction house had issued a guide price of 150,000-200,000 euros, saying it was "much more than a car -- it's a work of art".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VIENNA (Reuters) — Saudi Arabia will make a deep cut to its output in July on top of a broader OPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024 as the group seeks to boost flagging oil prices.

Saudi's energy ministry said the country's output would drop to 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from around 10 million bpd in May, the biggest reduction in years.
"This is a Saudi lollipop," Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference. "We wanted to ice the cake. We always want to add suspense. We don't want people to try to predict what we do... This market needs stabilisation".
OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, pumps around 40% of the world's crude, meaning its policy decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.

Washington (AFP) - When the Beatles broke up more than 50 years ago, devastated fans were left yearning for more. Now, artificial intelligence is offering just that.
From "re-uniting" the Fab Four on songs from their solo careers, to re-imagining surviving superstar Paul McCartney's later works with his voice restored to its youthful peak, the new creations show off how far this technology has come -- and raise a host of ethical and legal questions.

He began by discussing the Chinese plans for flying close to a U.S. jet and a ship sailing close to a U.S. Navy destroyer. According to Bolton, it's China trying to intimidate the United States and the Taiwanese government. 

"These incidents, as you reported, indicated both on the sea and in the air, are part of a larger Chinese project," said Bolton. "I think they're trying to warn the United States about keeping its commitments to Taiwan supplying it with weapons and the like.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
