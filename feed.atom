“So the Americans are very, very alert to the fact that the Chinese debt trap program … is the hook that they’re trying to reel all of these pacific nation islands in.”]]></summary>

Mr Mulvaney said rumours of Mr Biden being challenged at the election is an indication “there’s a problem within the party”. 

He added US Vice President Kamala Harris would be on the “top tier” of heirs to the President, but she has proven to be a “very bad candidate in her own right”. 

“The real issue is where is the centre of gravity in the Democratic Party – is it in the hardcore progressive left or the more centrist wing of the party?” he told Sky News Australia.

Reuters: Exclusive: Russia's Gazprom tells Europe gas halt beyond its control 
LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom has told customers in Europe it cannot guarantee gas supplies because of 'extraordinary' circumstances, according to a letter seen by Reuters, upping the ante in an economic tit-for-tat with the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
The July 14 letter from the Russian state gas monopoly said it was retroactively declaring force majeure on supplies dating from June 14. 
The news comes as Nord Stream 1, the key pipeline delivering Russian gas to Germany and beyond, is undergoing annual maintenance meant to conclude on Thursday. 
The letter added to Europe's fears that Moscow could keep the pipeline mothballed in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Russia over the war in Ukraine, heightening an energy crisis that risks tipping the region into recession. 
Known as an 'act of God' clause, force majeure is standard in business contracts and spells out extreme circumstances that excuse a party from their legal obligations.

WNU Editor: This declaration is primarily targeting Germany. This cut-off of natural gas, if it becomes permanent, is going to be a "death-blow" to Europe.

The former president died in Barcelona on July 8 at the age of 79, but when and where he will be buried sparked an intercontinental fight that pitted the Angolan government and his widow against some of his adult children.
Mr. dos Santos’ death came just weeks before a crucial election.  Angola’s ruling party and current president João Lourenço, along with Mr dos Santos’ widow, want to bring his body home for a state funeral and burial in a Soviet-style mausoleum – the kind spectacle that could rally the support of a party struggling to stay in power.

Since the two were elected in 1993 to the Diet, as the Japanese parliament is called, Mr Abe had been the most prominent politician.  A charismatic presence, he eclipsed Mr. Kishida, a pillar of the party which can be so steep that a schoolgirl recently asked her about the last time he actually laughed.  (His answer: whenever his beloved baseball team, Hiroshima Toyo Carp, wins.)
After Mr Kishida finally – on the second try – gained access to the Prime Minister’s Office, Mr Abe continued to harass him from behind the scenes.  He floated controversial ideas, such as a proposal that Japan would host US nuclear weapons, an…]]></summary>

It was a vital lifeline for residents, most of whom live in the remains of a once bustling train station.
Every morning, families squatting in cavernous Naucalpan vans woke their children up for a full day of school, part of a federal program to support working parents by extending hours past the half-day usual followed by most Mexican elementary schools.
But the extended day is over, a victim of the government’s focus on overhauling the welfare system in a shake-up that economists say will hurt Mexico’s poorest and hamper growth in the world’s 15th largest economy.

LONDON – Weather maps for Europe were blood red on Sunday as heat that scorched Spain and Italy and fanned fires in southwestern France headed north towards Britain .
London was hot in the 80s, but temperatures on Monday and Tuesday were expected to reach 100 or more and break records in a place where air conditioning is scarce and buildings are built to retain heat.


In France, the extreme temperatures that fueled wildfires in the south are expected to spread to the north, particularly along the Atlantic coast, which was bracing for unusually hot weather.

On the eve of its visit to Bethlehem, the Biden administration announced hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding for Palestinian services and said Israel had agreed to roll out 4G phone reception in Palestinian-run areas in West Bank.
The funding was welcomed by some Palestinian officials, who said it would help revive Palestinian hospitals, in particular.  But for some Palestinian protesters, these were piecemeal gestures that did little to advance the prospect of Palestinian statehood.

I had been on the train for about 40 hours and there was still a long way to go before our scheduled arrival in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Driving west, I walked to the back of the train to see the rising sun reflecting off the tracks.  We were crossing Nevada.

BBC: Ukraine war: Zelensky fires security chief and top prosecutor 
President Volodymyr Zelensky has fired the head of Ukraine's security agency (SBU) and the prosecutor general, citing many cases of treason in the two powerful organisations. 
He said more than 60 former employees were now working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied areas. 
A total of 651 collaboration and treason cases had been opened against law enforcement officials, he added. 
The sacked officials, Ivan Bakanov and Iryna Venediktova, have not commented. 
In his video address late on Sunday, Mr Zelensky said: "Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state... pose very serious questions to the relevant heads [of the two organisations]. 
"Each of these questions will receive a proper answer," the Ukrainian president added.

WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. Expect even more firings in the days and weeks to come. Ukraine is not winning this war, and it looks like President Zelensky has made the decision to replace people who will make a difference. 
Update: The hunt for traitors is what happens when things are not going well .... Zelensky explains why he fired Ukraine’s top security officials (RT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jak Knight, a comedian, writer and actor who first gained attention as the voice actor and writer for the Netflix animated series “Big Mouth”, died Thursday in Los Angeles.  He was 28 years old.
His family confirmed his death on Saturday  in a report.  The statement did not cite a cause.
Mr. Knight had recently completed filming “First director”, a film written and directed by actress Chelsea Peretti, as part of a cast including many other actors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The limited supply of new cars, high prices and rising interest rates are making automobiles increasingly unaffordable for many Americans.
In June, the average transaction price for a new car exceeded $48,000 for the first time, an increase of almost 13% over the previous year, Kelley Blue Book reported this week.
And because the interest rate on cars is influenced by the benchmark rate set by the Federal Reserve, car payments are skyrocketing as the Fed raises rates to combat inflation.  Most new car purchases are financed and the monthly average new car payment is now hovering around $700, a record high, according to recent industry reports.


“It’s now a combination of higher prices and higher rates,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, parent Kelley Blue Book.

“I don’t believe any of them, in the foreseeable future, are going to contemplate compromising their own independence, antagonising Australia and the US, by offering to host a Chinese facility.”

Mr Carr suggested China would “steer away” from such “adventurism” in the context of an improved relationship between Canberra and Beijing.

        <updated>2022-07-18T02:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jewelry and gems worth millions – a conservative figure puts the value at $10 million – were stolen from a Brink’s armored truck near Los Angeles last week, the security firm said, leaving some victims ask how such theft could have happened.
The merchandise was loaded onto a Brink’s truck at an event hosted by the International Gem and Jewelry Show on July 10 in San Mateo, near San Francisco, said Brandy Swanson, the group’s events director.  She said the truck was on its way to another exhibit 370 miles away at the Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena.
But in circumstances that have not been made public, the merchandise was taken from the truck near Los Angeles early Monday, said Brink’s spokeswoman Dana Callahan.


The value of the stolen merchandise, which included several gold and diamond necklaces, was not immediately clear.  It was also unclear how many pieces had been taken.


One of the jewelers, who requested anonymity for security reasons given the expensive jewelry he handles, estimated the total value of what was stolen at between $20 million and $50 million.  Ms. Callahan said it was less than $10 million.
“Based on information customers provided to us prior to shipping their items, the total value of missing items is less than $10 million,” Brink’s said in a statement.  “We are working with law enforcement and will fully reimburse our customers for the value of their assets that were stolen, in accordance with the terms of our contract.”
The jeweler said Brink’s was not transparent with jewelry owners and many fundamental questions about the loss remained unanswered.
Neither authorities nor Brink’s released details of what happened, including the location of the theft and whether anyone was injured.


A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was working with local authorities but could not provide more information.  In its statement, Brink’s called the episode “a loss incident.”

RFE: Senior Iranian Official Claims Tehran Capable Of Making Nukes But No Decision Made Yet  
A senior adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the country is capable of making a nuclear weapon but a decision whether to do so has not yet been made. 
Kamal Kharrazi's comments to Al-Jazeera TV on July 17 came after U.S. President Joe Biden vowed on a trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia that Washington would prevent Iran from "acquiring a nuclear weapon." 
Iran has long denied it is attempting to acquire or develop nuclear weapons and claims its program is strictly for civilian purposes, although it has continued to test-fire military-style missiles.
 Kharrazi's comments were a rare mention that Tehran could have an interest in such arms.

WNU Editor: Saying you can build a nuclear bomb is far from building and testing one. But with current talks on Iran's nuclear program all but dead now, it looks like Tehran has made the calculation to raise tensions so that their concerns can be addressed. 
This talk about building nuclear weapons is a direct provocation, and a clear indication to me that Iran believes now is the time to push their demands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNYUZ/New York Times: Biden Says He Confronted Saudi Prince Over Khashoggi. How True Is That? 
JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia — As President Biden told the tale, it sounded pretty dramatic. 
After meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, on Friday for the first time since taking office, the president insisted that he had pointedly blamed him for the murder of the columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
“He basically said that he was not personally responsible for it,” Mr. Biden recounted to reporters. “I indicated that I thought he was.” 
The only hitch? That’s not the way it happened, according to Saudi officials. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, who was present for the encounter, told reporters that he had not heard the president blame the crown prince. 
 Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Even the New York Times in the above post admits that Mr. Biden is by nature a storyteller with a penchant for embellishment. 
I think the Khashoggi issue was raised, but it was low key and brief. Two or three sentences at most between the two men. Definitely not as dramatic as President Biden is claiming it was. If President Biden was that confrontational, the Saudi would be really pissed right now, and we will all be knowing about it.]]></summary>

 US officials warned Turkey this week against expanding its so-called buffer zone in northeast Syria, saying such a move would complicate counter-ISIS measures, and would increase the violence that Kurds and Syrians in the region have faced since Turkey’s initial incursion in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Spent the day talking to friends and family who are still in Ukraine. Correction. It was more listening to friends and family on what they are going through right now in Ukraine. 
Sighhh ... it has been a draining day. But I should not complain. I am in Canada where I am safe. 
As for the above video report. Kudos to Dima at the Military Summary YouTube channel spending his day trying to understand the military situation on the ground by compiling both Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministry briefings into something that is meaningful. No one has come close to doing what he is doing, including all those high-paid retired Generals giving their 5 minute analysis on TV that is proven wrong 2 weeks later. 
Some other interesting news that I picked up today. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been making some remarks that is raising a few eyebrows. One .... he says he was misquoted when he said Ukraine will soon have a million soldiers. Reason being that his English is not good. He instead expects something like 700,000 soldiers. 
And two .... he has been quoted as saying that the Ukraine military has already suffered 100,000 casualties since the start of the war?!?!?!? I have been trying to find other Ukrainian media and government outlets to verify this casualty number, but no luck so far.

Russian media is saying that they have already destroyed a number of US supplied HIMARS systems, and that the Russian military advance continues. I am always skeptical of these reports, but I have noticed a reduction in reports of long range artillery strikes by Ukraine in the past few days.]]></summary>

Reuters: Ukraine war shows West's dominance is ending as China rises, Blair says  
LONDON (Reuters) - The Ukraine war shows that the West's dominance is coming to an end as China rises to superpower status in partnership with Russia at one of the most significant inflection points in centuries, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said. 
The world, Blair said, was at a turning point in history comparable with the end of World War Two or the collapse of the Soviet Union: but this time the West is clearly not in the ascendant. 
 "We are coming to the end of Western political and economic dominance," Blair said in a lecture entitled "After Ukraine, What Lessons Now for Western Leadership?" according to a text of the speech to a forum supporting the alliance between the United States and Europe at Ditchley Park west of London.

And Transport for London, the city’s public transport agency, urged people not to travel on Mondays and Tuesdays because the tracks could bend or warp under the effect of heat.
The UK government’s main emergency committee, Cobra, was also planning an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the response to the extreme weather.


Britain’s National Weather Service issued the most severe heat warning on Friday, putting parts of England under Red alert for Monday and Tuesday.  It was the fi…]]></summary>

Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A US Navy warship on Saturday challenged Chinese claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea, the US 7th Fleet said in a statement -- the second operation of its kind this week. 
The guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold sailed near the Spratly Islands -- known as the Nansha Islands in China -- in the southeastern South China Sea in a so-called "freedom of navigation operation" (FONOP), the 7th Fleet statement said. 
The US Navy operation in the island chain where China has built military foritifications on man-made islands challenged "restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People's Republic of China (PRC), Vietnam, and Taiwan," the statement said.

The kingdom said it is targeting production capacity of 13 million bpd by 2027 
Saudi Arabia will not have any additional capacity to increase oil production beyond 13 million barrels per day, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said during his address to the US-Arab summit in Jeddah. 
“The kingdom has announced an increase in its production capacity level to 13 million barrels per day, after which the kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production,” he said. 
The kingdom previously said it was aiming at production capacity of 13 million bpd by 2027.

WNU Editor: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was very careful on what he was promising. MBS was talking about "Production Capacity" NOT "production" when he mentioned that they will be increasing production capacity to 13 mb/d (from 12 mb/d) by 2027. In other-words. Do not expect any significant Saudi oil production in the near future.

“For the first time since 9/11, an American President is visiting this region without American troops being engaged in combat — in a combat mission in the region,” Biden said during a speech to the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 
“We’ll always honor the bravery and selfishness — selflessness of the — and sacrifices of the Americans who served, including my son, Major Beau Biden, who was stationed in Iraq for a year,” he said.

"If the government's got a dialogue wand it's a productive dialogue then of course it should be pursued – but if we're just being handled then that's not a productive use of time," Mr Dutton told Sky News Australia.

"The Australian government needs to be serious in the discussions and we need to ask China to explain their human rights abuses and to explain what's happening in relation to their military build up. 

"The government should be asking of China that if their conducting talks in good faith ... a sign of that good faith would be pulling back on the rapid expansion of their military arsenal."]]></summary>

Mr Dutton said it was not unreasonable to ask China to take concrete actions to demonstrate it is not heading down the path "the rest of the world believes them to be heading down".

In February, a Chinese Navy vessel aimed a military-grade laser at a RAAF P-8A Poseidon aircraft, which had been monitoring the ship from above over the Arafura Sea.

"Their own rhetoric in relation to Taiwan, their own actions in relation to the assaults on our military personnel – as I say the P-8 was put in a very precarious position – had that plane gone down we'd be having a very different discussion."]]></summary>

There is strong evidence that a space surveillance complex in Russia’s northern Caucasus is being outfitted with a new laser system called Kalina that will target optical systems of foreign imaging satellites flying over Russian territory. Initiated in 2011, the project has suffered numerous delays, but recent Google Earth imagery shows that construction is now well underway. Kalina will complement a mobile laser dazzler known as Peresvet that has been operational since late 2019. 
 The Krona space surveillance complex Kalina is part of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Krona space surveillance complex, situated several kilometers west of Zelenchukskaya, a place well known in the astronomical community. Also located in its immediate vicinity are the Russian Academy of Science’s Special Astrophysical Observatory (housing the six-meter BTA telescope) and the RATAN-600 radio telescope.

Patrick Buchanan: Is a US-Russia War Becoming Inevitable? 
If Putin makes a military move into Finland, the U.S. will go to war against the world’s largest nation with an arsenal of between 4,500 and 6,000 battlefield and strategic nuclear weapons… To go to war with the Soviet Union over the preservation of Finnish territory would have been seen as madness during the Cold War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice," he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Jeffrey Hall, special lecturer in Japanese studies at Japan’s Kanda University of International Studies, noted the growing online speculation that the group in question is the Unification Church, officially now known on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification that was founded by Sun Myung Moon, whose members are known colloquially as "Moonies."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms. There have been some cases in recent years where people illicitly made weapons themselves in Japan. But still, gun crime is very rare in Japan: last year th...]]></summary>

Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…]]></summary>

Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whizzing helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his official residence on Saturday shortly before protesters, angered by an unprecedented economic crisis, stormed and overran the compound.
Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa's resignation, has called an urgent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the "stoning of the devil" ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year's expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A day after the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, a steady stream of mourners, many in tears, arrived at the scene of his murder in western Japan to offer flowers and prayers.
People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.
When he heard about the death of Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, …]]></summary>

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Danila Davydov said he left Russia within weeks of the Kremlin sending troops into Ukraine because he feared having to fight in a war he doesn’t support.
The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
"I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave," Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…]]></summary>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain's departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world's fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
"We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
"Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being 'lynched,' as they put it, by the January 6 Committee," reported Julia Davis.
