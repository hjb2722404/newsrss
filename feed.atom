        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Global level of forced displacement climbs to record 110 million, UN says 
GENEVA (Reuters) - The number of people forcibly displaced around the world has climbed to a record 110 million people, the head of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said, with conflicts in Ukraine and Sudan spurring millions of people to flee their homes. 
The increase of around 19 million people to 108.4 million by the end of last year is the biggest annual jump on record, UNHCR said in a report released on Wednesday. 
That number has since risen further to 110 million, mostly due to Sudan's eight-week-old conflict, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told journalists.
"It's quite an indictment on the state of our world to have to report that," he said at a Geneva press conference.

RT: Moscow estimates Ukraine’s counteroffensive losses

 
Some 7,500 troops have been killed or injured in failed attacks since June 4, the Russian Defense Ministry has said  
Ukraine has lost several thousand service members since launching its much-anticipated counteroffensive earlier this month, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed on Wednesday. 
In a statement, the ministry said that Kiev’s forces have suffered some 7,500 killed or wounded, with the tally only including service members on the front line, and not those struck by Russian high-precision missiles and airstrikes deeper into Ukrainian territory. 
The estimated losses encompass the period from June 4, when the Russian Defense Ministry reported it had repelled a large-scale Ukrainian offensive along five sections of the front line in Donbass. Since then, Kiev’s troops have attempted to storm Russian positions on numerous occasions, failing to gain any ground, according to Moscow.

Daily Mail: Russian threat to cut Britain off from the internet: Former president Medvedev says Moscow could 'destroy our enemies' undersea cables' after report claims Western involvement in Nord Stream blast 
* Fears have been growing that Russia could target Britain's undersea cables 
* Medvedev has previously called British officials 'legitimate targets'

Medvedev made the threatening comments on his official channel on the Telegram messaging application early on Wednesday, amid fears that Russia could cut off cables connecting Britain to the internet causing widespread blackouts.

Daily Mail: Belarus has already started taking delivery of Russian nukes 
* Lukashenko said Belarus has started receiving Russian tactical nuclear weapons 
* It is Moscow's first move of such bombs outside Russia since fall of Soviet Union 
Belarus has already started taking delivery of Russian nukes, some of which President Alexander Lukashenko boasted are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons is Moscow's first move of such bombs  - which could potentially be used on the battlefield - outside Russian borders since the fall of the Soviet Union. 
 'We have missiles and bombs that we have received from Russia,' Lukashenko said in an interview with the Rossiya-1 Russian state TV channel which was posted on the Belarusian Belta state news agency's Telegram channel. 
'The bombs are three times more powerful than those (dropped on) Hiroshima and Nagasaki,' he said, speaking on a road in a forest clearing with military vehicles parked nearby and some kind of military storage facility visible in the background.

WNU Editor: From the New York Times (link here) .... 
 .... The issue of how to define Ukraine’s future in the alliance has overtaken a second question, how to come up long-term security assurances for Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s aides are telling members of Congress they want to move to something akin to what they call “the Israel model,” which has a 10-year-long security commitment with the United States. 
While Ukraine’s would almost certainly be shorter, the idea, administration officials say, would be to convince Mr. Putin that the flow of arms and training to Kyiv will not flag — and to bleed some of the politics out of episodic debates about how much aid to commit to Ukraine in the next six months or a year. 
This is the second time that the Western media is pushing out this trial balloon of an "Israeli model" for Ukraine. The first time was last month .... NATO Discussing Security Model for Ukraine like Israel's – WSJ (European Pravda). 
As to what is my take. 
The U.S. security model for Israel has resulted in decades of war and conflict between Israel and its neighbors. But this model, if applied to Ukraine, will result in the utter destruction of the country. The Russians, when it comes to war, are not like the Arabs. 
Update: Russian media is following this story closely .... Biden mulling ‘Israel model’ for Ukraine – NYT (RT).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: As Iran Emerges From Isolation, Israel Is Feeling Cornered 
(Bloomberg) -- Early this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a mock wartime meeting of his security cabinet in a bunker. Communities in northern Israel are preparing shelters for a long-term conflict. And the military is working overtime on a new laser system to intercept rockets. 
Their focus is Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
For years, Israel has considered a nuclear-armed Iran to be an existential threat, and directed its energies to confronting it and its regional proxies in Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian areas. 
But much is new in the past few months. Iran has emerged from diplomatic isolation, forging a key military alliance with Russia from which it’s seeking air defenses, restoring diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia and pushing its allies to fire missiles at Israel. It is also enriching more and more uranium, including a small amount almost to weapons grade — while denying any plans for making a bomb.

WNU Editor: The Middle East is rapidly changing. The wars that have engulfed the Middle East for the past few years appear to be ending, and Iran is restoring ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. But more importantly there is a growing perception in the Middle East that U.S. power and influence in the region is in decline, a scenario that does not favor a country like Israel that is heavily dependent on US economic and military aid.]]></summary>

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with China’s foreign minister by phone on Wednesday, a call that comes ahead of a highly anticipated visit by Washington’s top diplomat to Beijing as the two superpowers try to improve the dismal state of their ties. 
In his call with Qin Gang, Blinken discussed “the importance of maintaining open lines of communication” to responsibly manage US-China relations to “avoid miscalculation and conflict,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. 
Blinken also addressed a range of bilateral and global issues, and made clear “the US would continue to use diplomatic engagements to raise areas of concern as well as areas of potential cooperation,” according to the statement.

China Power: Debunking Reports of ‘Cracks’ in China’s Third Aircraft Carrier 
In recent weeks, rampant misinformation has spread online about China’s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian. In late May, netizens began posting images online that purportedly showed large cracks in the Fujian’s deck. 
On Twitter, one of these posts racked up nearly one million views, and numerous follow-on tweets have been viewed tens of thousands of times. Even more digital ink was spilled over these claims as news reports began to spread the tweets. 
These reports are false. There are no large cracks in the vessel’s deck. Commercial satellite imagery captured on May 15 shows no sign of cracks or similar markings on the deck. There are also no signs that major work has been done to those portions of the deck, which indicates no repairs were made.

CTV News/Canadian Press: Fox News shouldn't air in Canada despite Tucker Carlson ouster, LGBTQ2S+ group argues 
TORONTO - An advocacy group that wants the CRTC to ban Fox News says the network's "abusive content" extends beyond its divisive personalities such as recently fired host Tucker Carlson. 
Fox News should be banned from Canadian airwaves because it has "repeatedly and regularly" violated broadcasting standards with content that subjects many groups to hate, Egale Canada is arguing in its formal submission to Canada's broadcasting regulator.

Update: Could Fox News be banned from Canadian airwaves? CRTC weighs call (Global News)

 
WNU Editor: This is not an idle threat. The CRTC killed the cable news channel Sun Media (Canada's FOX News equivalent) a few years ago when it denied the company the license to expand to other regions of Canada in order to become profitable. 
On a personal note. On my cable package I have FOX News, but during its peak times (The Five for example) half of the time I cannot see it due to "technical reasons". But I have no problems seeing CNN or MSNBC. I have yet to receive an explanation from my cable provider (Videotron) on why this is case.]]></summary>

Russia's Defence Ministry released video footage on Tuesday of what it said were German-made Leopard tanks and U.S.-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles captured by Russian forces in a fierce battle with Ukrainian troops. 
 Reuters was able to confirm that the vehicles seen in the video were Leopard tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but was not able to independently verify the location or date of the footage. 
The Defence Ministry said the armoured vehicles and tanks were captured on the Zaporizhzhia front in southern Ukraine, one of the areas where Ukrainian forces have been trying to counter-attack. 
Two Leopard tanks were shown in the footage, which was released on the ministry's official channel on the Telegram messaging application, along with two damaged Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

Sonar 21: What Could Russia Demand to Negotiate an End to the War in Ukraine? 
I know that some in the West are suggesting that there may be a way to negotiate and end to the war in Ukraine and I think they do not understand what Russia is now likely to demand to secure such a deal. For starters, will Russia insist on securing the rights to all territory east of the Dnieper River and on a special status for Odessa? I think so. Odessa would no longer be ruled by Ukraine.
I also would expect Russia to demand (non-negotiable) the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the murder of 42 Russian speaking Ukrainians in 2014 who sought refuge in the Trade Unions House.

I also would expect that Russia will demand the dismantling of NATO Aegis missile systems in Poland and Romania and a ban on U.S. or NATO troops being posted in countries that share a border with Ukraine. In light of Russia’s stated goal of de-nazification I would not be surprised if Russia demands the laws of Ukraine be changed and that Nazi-affiliated parties and symbols be banned.

The leaders of France, Germany and Poland met in Paris to discuss giving Ukraine security guarantees. 
PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron warned on Monday that the Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces could last “weeks, even months.” 
“The counteroffensive has started. It’s going to be deployed for several weeks and even months. We are supporting it within the limits that we set ourselves,” Macron said alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Elysée Palace.

The French president hosted the German and Polish leaders to seek ways of helping Kyiv wrest back land from Russia. Poland's premier pressed for a clearer roadmap for Ukraine to join the NATO defensive alliance. 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish leader Andrzej Duda, with the Polish prime minister pressing the case for Ukraine to gain NATO membership. 
The three gathered to talk about military support for Kyiv's counteroffensive and humanitarian aid to the country after the breach of the Kherson region's Kakhovka dam. 
 "We have done everything to help it," Macron said of Ukraine's counteroffensive. "We have intensified the delivery of ammunition, weapons, and armored vehicles... We will continue in coming days and weeks."

Grassley, R-Iowa, revealed from the Senate floor Monday what was said to be a redacted reference in the FBI-generated FD-1023 form alleging a criminal bribery scheme between then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national that involved influence over U.S. policy decisions.

        <updated>2023-06-12T21:59:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an all-caps rant on his Truth Social platform Monday, former President Donald Trump vowed to appoint another special counsel to prosecute President Joe Biden. It was a single word that raised the alarm for an expert in religious extremism.
"NOW THAT THE 'SEAL' IS BROKEN, IN ADDITION TO CLOSING THE BORDER & REMOVING ALL OF THE 'CRIMINAL' ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ILLEGALLY INVADED OUR COUNTRY, MAKING AMERICA ENERGY INDEPENDENT, & EVEN DOMINANT AGAIN, & IMMEDIATELY ENDING THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA & UKRAINE, I WILL APPOINT A REAL SPECIAL 'PROSECUTOR' TO GO AFTER THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA, JOE BIDEN, THE ENTIRE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY, & ALL OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS, BORDERS, & COUNTRY ITSELF!" wrote Trump.
The use of "seal" may not be an accident, wrote religion reporter and extremism expert Jeff Sharlet. It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.
"QAnon & many fundamentalists will read this — & I don’t think it’s a stretch to imagine Trump’s people are aware of that — as both the indictment & 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ," wrote Sharlet.
The Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. 
This could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist — as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.
All of this comes as Trump prepares to face arraignment in Miami on Tuesday, and as authorities brace for the possibility of violence from Trump supporters in the vicinity, supported by escalating violent rhetoric on pro-Trump corners of the internet.]]></summary>

UN Secretary General António Guterres has issued a warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence and called for the creation of a regulatory body.
"Alarm bells over the latest form of artificial intelligence – generative AI – are deafening," Guterres said at a press conference in New York on Monday.
"Scientists and experts have called on the world to act, declaring AI an existential threat to humanity on a par with the risk of nuclear war. We must take those warnings seriously," he said.
Guterres presented a position paper in which the United Nations makes proposals on how to deal with AI worldwide and announced plans to create a high-level advisory body on the issue.
He also said that he supported the establishment of a regulatory authority, but that it could not be set up by him alone, only in partnership with the UN member states.
He suggested that such an authority could be inspired by what the International Atomic Energy Agency is today.]]></summary>

19Fortyfive: Is Joe Biden Hiding Intelligence on China’s Assistance to Russia?

 
Any transfer of weaponry from China to Ukraine would be significant, and it would likely mean the war is nowhere near concluding. 
Give credit where credit is due: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan masterfully declassified intelligence ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in order to take the wind out of the sails of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s propaganda. Thanks to the exposure of Putin’s intentions, not only the American audience but also much of the wider world recognized Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim. This held true even in countries like Iran where, despite their government’s support for Putin, ordinary people overwhelmingly see Ukraine as the victim and draw parallels between their own experience during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and what Ukrainians experience today.

SKY News: Iran: The West cannot stop us from building nuclear weapons but a deal is possible

 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's words come at a time of high tension between Iran and Israel, with Israel's leader already having said his country will do "whatever we need to do to defend ourselves". 
The West cannot stop Iran from building nuclear weapons, the country's supreme leader has said.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking on Sunday as tensions continue to mount over the country's nuclear work.

In words reported by state media, he said: "Talks about Tehran's nuclear weapons is a lie and [the West] know it.
"We do not want nuclear arms based on our beliefs, otherwise they would not have been able to stop it."

A deal with the West over the nuclear programme is possible, the supreme leader said, but only if Tehran can keep its nuclear infrastructure intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[-Lawyers for Ukraine at the top U.N. court on Monday rejected Russia's account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a "rambling conspiracy theory", in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
Kyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.
Last November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had "overall control" over the separatist forces.
Russia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine's MH17 case was based on "nonsense" and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.
On Monday, Ukraine's lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been "subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory" about the shooting down of MH17 which would be "better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet".
Kyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.
Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine's allegations on Thursday.
The World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in Colombia's southern jungle will tell their own story about the ordeal, the father of the two youngest siblings said on Sunday.
The children, aged 1 through 13, survived a May 1 plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults and were found on Friday in Caqueta province after weeks of searching by the military and Indigenous communities.
Their ordeal began in the early hours, when the Cessna 206 aircraft carrying seven people and traveling between Araracuara airport in Caqueta and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure.
"They will tell their stories and you will hear them," said Manuel Ranoque, the father of the 1-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, after visiting them at Bogota's military hospital.
"It's not easy to ask them because the children went 40 days without eating well, so I have not been able to get information from the oldest child," Ranoque told reporters.
Ranoque also told reporters the children's mother had survived for four days after the crash, an account disputed by another family member who also spoke to journalists. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -At least 10 people died and 25 were injured after a chartered bus carrying wedding guests rolled off a ramp at a roundabout in the Hunter region in Australia's New South Wales (NSW) state, police said on Monday.
The accident occurred around 11:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Sunday near the town of Greta, about 180 km (112 miles) northwest of Sydney, in an area famous for its vineyards and wedding spots.
"I understand they had been at a wedding together, it's my understanding they were travelling together ... presumably for their accommodation," NSW Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Tracy Chapman said during a televised media briefing.
At this stage, it appeared to be a single-vehicle accident, Chapman said. Police were still trying to identify all the passengers, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) - Honduras opened an embassy in China on Sunday, Chinese state media reported, after the Central American nation cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan earlier this year.
The embassy in Beijing was opened by foreign ministers from the two countries, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro is in China for a state visit, during which she is to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, state media have reported.
Tegucigalpa in March ended its decades-long relationship with Taipei and established diplomatic ties with Beijing.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

Zelensky commented after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv's long-expected counteroffensive was already failing.
Russia has reported thwarting Ukrainian attacks in the east and south.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
