Soldiers and analysts suggest defending city has become more of a political than practical issue, as Russian push continues 
Ukrainian soldiers are being pummelled on three sides by Russian forces who are trying to capture Bakhmut, a city in the eastern Donetsk region that has become the focus of the longest and one of the bloodiest battles since the war began. 
Ukraine’s authorities insist they will continue to try to hold the city despite them suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day – with some saying the reason is more political and symbolic than practical. Retreating from the city now, after so many soldiers died fighting to keep it, would be a hard reality to face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Imagine applying to 25 of the world’s top universities and getting accepted into all of them. Jamie Beaton did exactly that and that isn’t even the most impressive thing about him.   Beaton graduated from Harvard University in 2016 with a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree two years ahead of schedule. At just 20 years old, he became one of the youngest admits to Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), arguably the world’s top MBA school. In 2022, he completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford on the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.  But his success story is not just about impressive credentials — he uses his own experience to support other students to reach for the stars as he did. At just 17, Jamie co-founded Crimson Education, now the world's largest and most effective college admissions consulting firm which has supported over 20,000 students to gain offers to the most competitive universities. In Hong Kong alone, Crimson has helped more than 200 students to secure coveted offers from Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Princeton and so on.  Beaton’s success didn’t happen overnight. His journey began in his teenage years, when he fearlessly charged ahead in his interests and academic pursuits.     The Making of a Prodigy: Jamie’s Teenage Years  Beaton was no different from the average New Zealand teenager who loved playing video games and going to amusement parks. He had his secondary education at King's College, New Zealand, and planned to study medicine at his home university, the University of Auckland. Everything changed at 15 when he had a chat with a senior, who suggested that Beaton explore options outside Auckland. That’s when he started to shift his focus and set his sights on the Ivy League, Oxbridge, and other top international universities.  Beaton took 10 A-Levels instead of the usual three. With a stellar academic and extracurricular profile, he received offers from all 25 top universities he applied to,…]]></summary>

PARIS (Reuters) -Train and air traffic will again be disrupted in France on Thursday and garbage collection in cities including Paris will be patchy as strikes against a planned pension reform are set to enter a third consecutive day. 
Opinion polls show a majority of voters oppose President Emmanuel Macron's plan to delay the retirement age by two years to 64, but the government says the policy change is essential to ensure the system does not go bust. 
Workers in several sectors including oil refineries and railways continued to strike on Wednesday and plan to carry on for the rest of the week after record numbers of people took to the streets on Tuesday as part of a nationwide day of industrial action.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgia's ruling party said on Thursday it was dropping a bill on "foreign agents" after two nights of violent protests against what opponents said was a Russian-inspired authoritarian shift that imperilled hopes of the country joining the European Union. 
The Georgian Dream ruling party said in a statement it would "unconditionally withdraw the bill we supported, without any reservations". It cited the need to reduce "confrontation" in society, while also denouncing "lies" told about the bill by the "radical opposition". 
However, opposition leaders said the protests would resume at 7 p.m. (1500 GMT). Giga Lemonjava, a representative of the Droa party, said they were demanding that the government formally denounce the bill and release all those detained during the protests.

Warzone/The Drive: B-21 Raider Seen From Above In New Image 
As the B-21 creeps towards its first flight, still slated for later this year, we are getting new looks at it and new insights. 
Two new images of the B-21 Raider next-generation stealth bomber have been released by the U.S. Air Force. One is a detailed close-up of the B-21's nose and cockpit section, the other provides us with the first look at the planform of the secretive new jet, which aims to replace the B-2 and the B-1. 
The elevated image underscores the B-21's overall layout, which harkens back to what the B-2 would have looked like if requirements for low-level penetration were not introduced mid-way through its development. This planform also would have given the B-2 a substantially higher operating ceiling, which the B-21 will likely achieve. While the image overall is compressed due to the wide angle lens, it still highlights the B-21's smaller proportions compared to its now well over three decades-old progenitor.

Global freedoms declined for a 17th consecutive year in 2022 as the struggle for democracy approaches a turning point amid a curtailment of freedom of expression in countries such as Russia and Iran. 
Human rights watchdog Freedom House said in its annual report on freedoms around the world, released on March 9, that the number of countries to score zero for freedom of expression rose on the year to 33 from 14, with media freedom coming under pressure in at least 157 countries and territories during 2022.

Stoltenberg says NATO needs to ramp up arms production in order to keep supplies flowing to Ukraine 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said the hard-fought city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s Donetsk region may fall to Russian troops "in the coming days." 
His comments followed claims by Russia’s mercenary Wagner Group which said it had taken the eastern part of the city after months of a brutal ground and air offensive. 
Fox News Digital could not verify the group's claims and Stoltenberg did not confirm whether any part of the city has yet fallen to Moscow.

The European Union is looking at how to boost ammunition supplies in both the short and long term at a meeting in Stockholm. A top EU official has called for "a war economy." 
Defense ministers from the EU's 27 member states are meeting in the Swedish capital on Wednesday to debate plans to refill Ukraine's ammunition stockpiles from their own while also ramping up production within the bloc. 
The meeting comes amid concerns that Ukraine will run out of the 155-millimeter howitzer shells that have played a key role in the country's defense against the full-scale Russian invasion that began in February 2022. 
The EU ministers will discuss the possibility of sending €1 billion worth ($1.06 billion) of shells from their own stockpiles while at the same time considering how to ramp up the bloc's homegrown arms production capacities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China will deepen its cooperation with Russia to try to challenge the United States despite international condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine, the leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies said on Wednesday. 
"Despite global backlash over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China will maintain its diplomatic, defense, economic, and technology cooperation with Russia to continue trying to challenge the United States, even as it will limit public support," they said in a threat assessment released as the Senate Intelligence Committee held its annual hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A landlord in Canada changed the locks on a home and took votes from its occupants on whether one of the tenants could return, the Daily Hive reported. 
Man-Ling Weng claimed Daichi Araki owed him $4,500 in damages, which Araki disagreed with. 
Details from a British Columbia small claims case at the Civil Resolution Tribunal say Weng became a tenant at the home in 2019 but took over rent-collecting duties in 2020 as well as other responsibilities. Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. 
On September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive's report as "SJC," to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”

When Weng's return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn't initially signal any objections to the extended return date. 
Araki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.
"In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170," the Hive's report stated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed former President Donald Trump on Monday and, apparently, omitted crucial chunks of their conversation about Ukraine when it was broadcast to Hannity's radio audience.
Justin Baragona, the senior media reporter at The Daily Beast, noticed the discrepancy on Tuesday.
"According to Trump, all he needed to do was let Russia 'take over' parts of Ukraine," Baragona explained. "Saying that Russia was going for the 'whole enchilada' with Joe Biden as president, Trump added that Russia 'took over nothing' while he was in the White House because Russian President Vladimir Putin 'understood' that 'he would have never done it.'"
Trump added, "that's without even negotiating a deal. I could have negotiated. At worst, I could've made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could've worked a deal."
But as Baragona pointed out, that is not what Hannity played.
"Instead, shortly after Trump says, 'I could have negotiated,' the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that 'China no longer respects the United States,'" Baragona observed.
Baragona also noted that "besides asserting that he would have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine by making a deal to let them 'take over something,' Trump also said in the portion not aired by Fox that 'so many more people are dying than is being reported' while reiterating this 'would have never happened' under his watch."]]></summary>

"It's a treat dipped in blood," said vendor Mohammed Salha, 31, showing off truffles he spent a week collecting near his village in the central province of Hama.
"Every day I leave my house not knowing whether I will come back to my wife and daughter," he said, a brown keffiyeh scarf wrapped around his head.
"We risk our lives... but we don't care anymore, we want to feed our children," he told AFP, dark circles lining his weary eyes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A train crash in Egypt killed four people and injured more than 20, officials said Wednesday about the latest in a series of deadly accidents blamed on aging infrastructure and mismanagement.
The train overshot the station and ran into the buffers at the end of the track after passing through a stop signal, in the Nile Delta city of Qalyub north of Cairo, the National Railways Authority said.

Pictures from the scene showed emergency crews overnight using a crane to lift the derailed coach that appeared to be partially crumpled.

About 20 women held a rare demonstration in a Kabul street on Wednesday, calling on the international community to protect Afghans, AFP journalists witnessed.

To mark International Women's Day, capitals across the world are hosting marches, rallies and demonstrations, including Madrid, where broad tree-lined boulevards are regularly packed with a sea of purple, a color often associated with women's rights.
Marches took place on Wednesday in Thailand and Indonesia, where a few dozen women gathered in front of the country's parliament to urge lawmakers to pass a long-awaited bill to protect domestic workers and some chanted "long live Indonesian women".

 DNYUZ/Foreign Policy: China Is Practicing How to Sever Taiwan’s Internet 
As the United States was watching the skies in the aftermath of the spy balloon incident, China may have been acting at sea. In early February, maritime vessels disabled the two undersea cables connecting Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, a tiny archipelago just 10 nautical miles off China’s coast, to the internet. Now residents of the islands face highly reduced internet connectivity until the cables are repaired. The activity looks like targeted harassment by Beijing—or an exercise in preparation for cutting off the whole of Taiwan. 
On Feb. 2, a Chinese fishing vessel sailing close to the Matsu Islands severed one of the two cables, which connect the islands with Taiwan proper. Then, six days later, a Chinese freighter cut the second cable. Speaking shortly after the second cable was cut, Wong Po-tsung, the vice chair of Taiwan’s National Communications Commission, told reporters that there was no indication the incidents were intentional. It’s not uncommon for undersea cables to be damaged—but losing two in a row is either really unfortunate or quite possibly not a coincidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boat workers, bus drivers, doctors, teachers and Greek's entire public service sector brought the country to a near halt on Wednesday as strikes erupted in response to a train accident that killed 57.

The action particularly affected big cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki where traffic was chaotic, ferries remained in their docks and many islands were cut off from the mainland.
The country's major trade unions had called for the strike criticizing the government's privatization policy for last week's serious train accident and demanding a full investigation.
The deadly crash came after a passenger train ran onto a track on which a cargo train was approaching because of a wrong switch position.
The investigation into the accident has already revealed numerous serious mistakes within the state-owned railway company OSE. Critics have said that over the past two decades all governments had criminally neglected the Greek railways.
Ferries are moored in the port of Piraeus during a 24-hour strike. The umbrella organizations of Greek trade unions have called for nationwide strikes in protest at the collision of a passenger train with a freight train in northern Greece that killed 57 people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The White House on Tuesday denounced the kidnapping of four US citizens in Mexico, two of whom have been found dead, as "unacceptable," and said Washington would pursue justice for the victims.
"We're going to work closely with the Mexican government to ensure that justice is done in this case," White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
The four Americans crossed into Matamoros in northern Mexico, just opposite the US city of Brownsville, Texas, on Friday, according to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
They were fired upon by unidentified gunmen and taken hostage. Two were later found dead; of the other two, one is injured, according to Mexican authorities.
Kirby said the US was still learning about details of the incident from Mexican officials.
"Right now our focus is very squarely on these four Americans and the families that have been affected by the attack," he said.
"We don't have these four Americans back on home soil. And really that's what our focus is right now," he said.]]></summary>

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yielded to pressure over allegations China interfered in Canada’s elections, appointing a special investigator to study the matter. 
“Upholding confidence in our democratic process in our elections, in our institutions, is of utmost importance,” the prime minister told reporters Monday evening in Ottawa. 
The “independent special rapporteur” will have a wide mandate and make recommendations on fighting foreign meddling, he added. 
The issue will also be studied by a group of lawmakers cleared to see top-secret intelligence, Trudeau said.

WNU Editor: This is my take also .... Trudeau goes from standstill to 'panic mode' on Chinese interference (Don Martin, CTV News). According to all polls three-quarters of Canadians want answers, including this blogger who is also a Canadian.    
Update: All of this news first started from an intelligence leak. Not surprising, the Trudeau government, deeply embarrassed by all of these revelations, want to know who the leaker is .... RCMP investigating leaks alleging foreign election interference (CTV News).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British architect and urban planner David Chipperfield won the 2023 Pritzker Prize, the profession's most prestigious award, organizers announced Tuesday.
The 69-year-old was honored for "timeless modern design that confronts climate urgencies, transforms social relationships and reinvigorates cities," they said in a statement.
Chipperfield said he was "so overwhelmed" to become the prize's 52nd laureate.
"I take this award as an encouragement to continue to direct my attention not only to the substance of architecture and its meaning but also to the contribution that we can make as architects to address the existential challenges of climate change and societal inequality," the statement quoted him as saying.
Chipperfield is renowned for renovations and reconstructions of old buildings, updating them for the modern age while honoring their history and culture.
Some of his best known works include the Museo Jumex in Mexico City, a renovation of the Neues Museum in Berlin, and a new building for the Saint Louis Art Museum in Missouri.
"We know that, as architects, we can have a more prominent and engaged role in creating not only a more beautiful world but a fairer and more sustainable one too," said Chipperfield.
"We must rise to this challenge and help inspire the next generation to embrace this responsibility with vision and courage," he added.
Other major works of Chipperfield's include the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany and the Des Moines Public Library in Iowa.
"He is assured without hubris, consistently avoiding trendiness to confront and sustain the connections between tradition and innovation, serving history and humanity," said Tom Pritzker, Chairman of the Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award.

North Korea has threatened to take "quick, overwhelming action" after the United States flew a nuclear-capable B-52 bomber over the Korean Peninsula in an exercise with South Korean warplanes. 
Kim Yo Jong, the sister of dictator Kim Jong-Un, made the threat as the U.S. and South Korea continue to carry out joint military exercises. 
"We keep our eye on the restless military moves by the U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet military and are always on standby to take appropriate, quick and overwhelming action at any time according to our judgment," Kim Yo Jong said in the statement, as reported by state media.

Poor weather and downed communication lines have complicated rescue efforts on the far-flung island of Serasan, in the Natuna region between Borneo and peninsular Malaysia, home to about 8,000 people.
Pictures provided by Natuna's communication and information agency showed houses reduced to rubble, with fallen trees and torn roofs visible.
Body bags were lined up on top of a blue tarpaulin as officials gathered to pray for the victims.
Abdul Muhari, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), told local broadcaster Metro TV that rescuers had recovered 10 bodies at the scene, while villagers put the death toll at 15.

In a few weeks' time, as part of a conservation project, they will leave their small shed in the northeastern English port of Whitby for the open sea.
Whitby, whose dramatic abbey ruins were an inspiration for "Dracula" author Bram Stoker, is Europe's third-largest lobster port.
Some 100,000 lobsters are landed each year, providing jobs for 150 people. Joe Redfern, who runs the Whitby Lobster Hatchery, hopes eventually to release the same number each year from his tanks.
"We want to make sure that the marine environment is protected and the lobster populations are conserved for the future," the 31-year-old biology graduate told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once a rare sight in the Vatican's halls of power, women are increasingly being seen in senior posts under Pope Francis, but the gender battle is far from won.
The centuries-old institution has an inherently patriarchal image, from the Swiss Guards at the gates to the cardinals seated in St Peter's Square.
It reflects the wider Roman Catholic Church, which outlaws divorce, abortion and the ordination of women.
Yet the pontiff's push for reform has seen more women given roles in administrating the Vatican -- even if they are mainly behind the scenes.
From economists to secretaries, historians and archivists, 649 women worked in 2019 for the Roman Curia -- 24 percent of employees -- compared to 385 in 2010, according to the latest available figures.

The shallow quake struck at about 2:00 pm (0600 GMT), a few kilometers from Maragusan municipality in the mountainous gold-mining province of Davao de Oro on Mindanao island.
Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more harm than deeper ones, but local authorities said there were no reports of major damage.
Cherrylyn Dapiton of the Maragusan disaster office confirmed there had been a landslide near a road, but it had not affected anyone or blocked traffic.
Photos on the local government's Facebook page showed patients on beds or in wheelchairs outside a hospital after they were evacuated from the facility.
The quake lasted about 30 seconds…]]></summary>

Tsai plans to meet McCarthy in the United States in coming weeks, two sources told Reuters on Monday, a move that could replace the Republican speaker's anticipated but sensitive trip to the democratically governed island claimed by China.
China staged war games around Taiwan last August after a visit to Taipei by then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Speaking to reporters in parliament, Taiwan Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said he was not aware of a planned meeting between Tsai and McCarthy.

The US citizens crossed into Matamoros, in Tamaulipas state, on Friday in a white minivan with North Carolina license plates, the FBI said in a statement released by the US embassy in Mexico.
"Shortly after crossing into Mexico, unidentified gunmen fired upon the passengers in the (minivan). All four Americans were placed in a vehicle and taken from the scene by armed men," the FBI said.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that the victims were believed to have entered the country to buy medicines and got caught up in a confrontation between criminal groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican authorities found 103 unaccompanied minors mostly from Guatemala inside an abandoned truck trailer in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, the government said on Monday, in one of the biggest recent discoveries of migrant children traveling through Mexico.
In addition to the 103 children, authorities found 212 adults from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Ecuador in the trailer, the National Migration Institute (INM) said in a statement. Another 28 migrants traveling as families from Guatemala and El Salvador were also in the trailer, bringing the total number of passengers to 343.
Authorities discovered the trailer on a highway without a driver, INM said. It was outfitted with fans, a partially ventilated roof and a structure that created a second level inside the trailer.
A photo that INM distributed showed plastic bottles and other trash strewn across the floor of the long, narrow compartment.
The children will be put into custody of Veracruz's family services system while the other migrants will be processed to determine their legal status in Mexico, INM said.
Earlier this year, Mexican authorities found 57 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala at a checkpoint near the U.S.-Mexico border, and 20 other unaccompanied minors in a group of mostly Central Americans in the southern state of Chiapas.

The synthetic silk decoys inflated with an electric or petrol blower are used to fool the enemy in the battlefield, making them target the air-filled decoys instead of real weaponry.
The Inflatech company's managers have refused to confirm selling their products to Ukraine, citing military secrecy, but they admitted output had jumped by 100 percent over the past 12 months.
"Definitely we're selling to a lot of governments around the world, not only in Europe," sales and marketing director Poven Kumaresan told reporters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed a sphinx statue "with a smiley face and two dimples" near the Hathor Temple, one of the country's best preserved ancient sites, the tourism and antiquities ministry announced Monday.
It is the latest in a series of discoveries revealed over the past few months.
The limestone artefact, believed to be a stylised representation of an ancient Roman emperor, was found inside a two-level tomb near the temple in southern Egypt, the ministry said in a statement.
Next to the "beautifully and accurately carved" sphinx, researchers had found "a Roman stele written in demotic and hieroglyphic" scripts, the ministry's statement said.
Once fully deciphered, the stele may shed light on the identity of the sculpted ruler, who the Egyptian research team said could be Emperor Claudius.
Hathor Temple, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of the capital Cairo, was home to the Dendera Zodiac, a celestial map which has been displayed at the Louvre in Paris since 1922, more than a century after Frenchman Sebastien Louis Saulnier had blasted it out of the temple.
Egypt wants it back.
The country has unveiled major archaeological discoveries in recent months, primarily in the Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo but also in Giza, home of the only surviving structure of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
On Thursday, the antiquities ministry announced the discovery of a hidden nine-meter passage inside the Great Pyramid of Giza, which archaeologist Zahi Hawass said may lead to "the actual burial chamber" of pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops.
Further south, in Luxor, archaeologists had discovered an 1,800-year-old "complete residential city from the Roman era", authorities announced in January.
Some experts see such announcements as having more political and economic weight, than scientific, as Egypt is counting on tourism to revive its vital tourism industry amid a severe economic crisis.
The government aims to draw in 30 million tourists a year by 2028, up from 13 million before the pandemic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Romana Didulo, the conspiracy theorist leader known popularly as the "QAnon Queen," is now printing her own currency for followers to use -- after they sent her their actual money to make it happen.
Vice News reports that Didulo recently thanked her followers for donating their money to her so she could fund the creation of her own "loyalty money" currency.
Vice notes that the bills she has printed so far look rather cheap, but she has nonetheless promised followers that they contain "interdimensional security devices" to assure their authenticity.
A review of messages in QAnon chat groups shows that Didulo's followers are very excited about trying to use their newfound interdimensional riches to pay for things, including one woman who declared that “I am so hopeful that the loyalty money will allow me to purchase a prefab home or one of those tiny homes."
DON'T MISS: Trump's rambling CPAC speech leaves CNN analyst stunned: 'This is someone who is not well'
So far, however, it doesn't appear that there are any businesses that are accepting Didulo's money, although she says that she will "issue a royal decree, giving instructions to when and where, and whom [sic] can cash their loyalty money with the instructions to the Kingdom of Canada Treasury to cash the checks" at some point in the future.
In the past, Didulo has gotten her followers in trouble by discouraging them from paying their utility bills on the grounds that the services were now "free" by her decree. As a result, many saw their power getting shut off.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
