Ms Wong said Australia’s position has “always been and remains” in Tel Aviv.

“We were amongst the first countries to formally recognise Israel under Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley,” Ms Wong said during a media conference on Tuesday. 

“We remain, will not waver in our support of both Israel and the Jewish community in Australia. 

“We are equally unwavering in our support of the Palestinian people, including in the provision of humanitarian support.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. 
The Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. 
“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”
The official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”
The FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. 
"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”
“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States said Monday that it had confidence in Pakistan's ability to control its nuclear arsenal after President Joe Biden expressed alarm, leading Islamabad to summon the US ambassador.
"The United States is confident of Pakistan's commitment and its ability to secure its nuclear assets," State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
"The US has always viewed a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests and, more broadly, the US values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan," he said.
Biden made the off-the-cuff remarks on Pakistan's nuclear program Thursday while at a private Democratic Party fundraiser in California where he began to discuss challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China, a close ally of Pakistan.
"And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion," Biden said, according to a White House transcript.
Pakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a "responsible nuclear state" and that it takes safety measures "with the utmost seriousness."
US officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan's Taliban.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden's remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.
But Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.
Patel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.
"This is a relationship we view as important and it's something that we're going to continue to remain deeply engaged in," he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.
In an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned "peace plan" between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine's continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.
"This is a classic Putin play," she said of Musk's recent attempts to interject himself as a "peacemaker" between Russia and Ukraine. "Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin."
Hill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.

"He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process," she explained. "He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia."

Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv shortly before the first explosion at around 6:35 am (0335), followed by sirens across most of the country.
"The capital was attacked by kamikaze drones," the president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.
"The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation," he added.
"We need more air defense systems and as soon as possible. More weapons to defend the sky and destroy the enemy."

But few were prepared for the scale of the sound and fury – least of all Truss herself.
In just six weeks, the prime minister’s libertarian economic policies have triggered a financial crisis, emergency central bank intervention, multiple U-turns and the firing of her Treasury chief.
Now Truss faces a mutiny inside the governing Conservative Party that leaves her leadership hanging by a thread.
Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon fumed on Sunday that the last few weeks had brought “one horror story after another.”

The Saudi-led OPEC+ cartel -- which includes Russia -- has angered Washington by deciding to cut production by two million barrels per day from November, adding further pressure on soaring crude prices.
"It is telling that these false accusations did not come from the Ukrainian government," Prince Khaled wrote. "Although the OPEC+ decision, which was taken unanimously, was due to purely economic reasons, some accused the k…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ninety-two migrants were found almost naked and bruised after allegedly being forced across the Evros river from Turkey into Greece, Athens said Sunday, a charge fiercely denied by Ankara.
EU border agency Frontex confirmed to AFP the arrival of the group in circumstances which the Greek ministry for civil protection said sent out an "inhuman image."
"The Frontex officers reported that the migrants were found almost naked and some of them with visible injuries," said Paulina Bakula, spokeswoman for the organization.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet that it was "deeply distressed by the shocking reports and images of 92 people, who were reported to have been found at the Greek-Turkish land border, stripped of their clothes".

Stormy US-Saudi relations have seen new strain over Riyadh's recent support for oil production cuts, with Biden warning of unspecified "consequences."
The move last week by OPEC+ -- composed of the Riyadh-led OPEC cartel and an additional group of 10 exporters headed by Russia -- would reduce global output by up to two million barrels per day from November.
It could send energy prices soaring amid an energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, and as inflation-weary American voters prepare to cast ballots in midterm elections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva traded jabs and insults as they squared off Sunday in their first-ever head-to-head debate, two weeks from Brazil's presidential runoff election.
Lula attacked Bolsonaro as the "king of fake news," drawing accusations of lying, corruption and a "disgraceful" record in return, as the rivals sparred in the first debate for their polarizing second-round showdown on October 30.
Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-president (2003-2010) who is seeking a comeback at 76, was particularly fiery criticizing Bolsonaro over his handling of Covid-19, which has killed 687,000 people in Brazil, second only to the United States.

Xi Jinping versus the stans.
 Celebrity, in any country, comes with its fair share of hardship. In exchange for fame and stardom, stars give up normal levels of privacy; endure invasive scrutiny from fans, paparazzi, and the media; and mold themselves to inhuman standards of beauty and perfection in order to climb the ladder of success.
In China, however, those stressors pale beside the unique pressure of being a star in a hyper-consumerist culture that’s also tightly controlled by a state autocracy. Stars are expected to be poster children for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — to be wholesome, promote good values, avoid vice, and never, ever, get involved in a …]]></summary>

Near the southern border with Equatorial Guinea, eight villages have registered complaints with the Campo Ma'an national park, a vast area of virgin forest from where the animals emerge.
An estimated 500 gorillas and more than 200 elephants -- both endangered species -- roam the reserve's 264,000 hectares (652,000 acres).
A week after elephants flattened his banana plantation close by the park, Simplice Yomen, 47, is struggling to cope.
"We are at the end of our tether," he sighs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]    Thanks to the rise of smartphones and mobile technology, consumers are increasing their use of digital payment acceptance methods such as credit cards, mobile payment apps, and other forms of contactless payment methods to pay for everything, from big-ticket items to groceries and bus fares.

        <link href="https://www.newsrust.com/2022/10/italian-restaurant-campagnola-abandons.html"/>
        <updated>2022-10-17T07:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bold restaurant move to the Upper East Side, Campagnola – an “Italian country restaurant” at 1382 First Ave.  for nearly 40 years – has moved from its apartment building to the modern Impala condo tower two blocks north at 1456 First Ave., where its new owner will be Aby Rosen’s RFR Realty.
It’s a great change of venue for Campagnola, which has long attracted celebrities, politicians and senior law enforcement officials entering through a rustic front room with a vaulted ceiling.  The menu’s hearty southern and northern Italian dishes are suited to the “country” theme and “meant to be shared,” its website says.  
But the president of Meridian Retail Leasing, James Famularo, who negotiated the lease for Campagnola owner Curt Huegel said Huegel “relyed on a talented designer, Delphine Mauroit, owner of DMDesign & Architecture, to capture the soul and vibe of the original” – possibly including the original bar, furniture and artwork.
The new space in a former yoga studio at the base of the tower will have 3,400 “perfect L-shaped” square feet on the ground, Famularo said, plus 2,000 square feet in the basement.  The configuration allows the dining room to occupy the entire ground floor.
He couldn’t discuss the terms due to a nondisclosure agreement.  The move is expected to take place in about nine months.
The owner was replaced by Brandon Singer of MONA leasing, a brokerage firm backed by RFR.
Huegel’s company, Host Restaurants, owns several major locations in and out of town.  Among them is the Sefton Bar/Lounge opposite the original Campagnola – a lease which Famularo also managed.
Huegel was always known for restaurantsnot for the bars – but Famularo said he got the idea from Sefton when he noticed many Campagnola customers were looking for drinks nearby while waiting for their tables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former DFAT Australia-China Council scholar Andrew Phelan says the US sanctions recently imposed on the export of high-end computer chips to China have had a “dramatic” and immediate effect on manufacturing in the country. 

The Biden administration recently announced a set of controls that restrict the export of advanced chips, chipmaking equipment and design software created with technology from the United States. 

“Every American engineering executive involved in the chip manufacturing, chip industry in China has resigned, effectively immediately,” Mr Phelan told Sky News Australia. 

“And ASML, the Dutch supplier of the capital equipment that is used in making high-end chips has ceased servicing its Chinese customers. 

“So … I think the Americans anticipated the third term, they were worried about China’s advances in chips, in artificial intelligence, in weaponizing these things, so they have stepped in, in what is the biggest I think US move against China in the last several years.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has revealed India’s plans to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for cryptocurrencies during its G20 Presidency, from December 1, 2022 to November 30, 2023.
Sitharaman has already called for global collaboration to decide the future of crypto and has been cautious against mainstream crypto adoption citing financial stability risks.  However, speaking to local Indian journalists on October 15, she confirmed, “This (crypto) will also be part of India’s business (agenda during the G20 presidency).
The G20, or Group of Twenty, is a global forum for addressing major issues related to the global economy.  According to Sitharaman, no country alone can effectively manage or regulate crypto, adding that:

“But if it’s platforms, asset exchanges that have been created, buying and selling making profits and most importantly, these countries are able to understand the trade of money, are we able to establish for what purpose it is used?

Sitharaman further pointed to the use of crypto assets in money laundering, detected by India’s law enforcement agency, the Enforcement Directorate. 
She added that G20 members have also acknowledged the same concerns while reiterating the need for all countries to participate when it comes to effectively regulating crypto assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis said the need to reform the United Nations was "more than obvious" after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war exposed its limits, in an extract of his new book published Sunday.
The Argentine pontiff said Russia's February invasion of Ukraine highlighted the need to ensure the current multilateral structure -- especially the UN Security Council -- finds "more agile and effective ways of resolving conflicts".
"In wartime, it is essential to affirm that we need more multilateralism and a better multilateralism," but the UN is no longer fit for "new realities", he added in an extract published by La Stampa daily.
The organization was founded to prevent the horrors of two World Wars from happening again, but although the threat represented by those conflicts was still alive, "today's world is no longer the same", said Francis.
"The necessity of these reforms became more than obvious after the pandemic" when the current multilateral system "showed all its limits", he added.
Francis denounced the unequal distribution of vaccines as a "glaring example" of the law of the strongest prevailing over solidarity.
The 85-year-old advocated "organic reforms" aimed at allowing international organizations to rediscover their essential purpose of "serving the human family" and said international institutions must be the result of the "widest possible consensus".
The pope also proposed guaranteeing food, health, economic and social rights on which international institutions would base their decisions.
Francis's new book, "I ask you in the name of God: Ten prayers for a future of hope", is due to come out in Italy Tuesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two people were killed after torrential rain brought major flooding to the Greek island of Crete, firefighters said on Sunday.
Rain started to fall on Saturday morning in the southern Greek island, a popular holiday destination, hitting the Heraklion region particularly hard.
Greek firefighters said the body of a 49-year-old woman was found in the sea on Sunday, raising the death toll to two from the floods.
On Saturday, a man in his 50s was found dead after he was trapped in his car as torrential rains began.
The two individuals were going to Heraklion for work, Greek public television ERT reported.
A second missing individual was found alive on Saturday evening.
The rains forced the evacuation of several homes and unleashed extensive damage in seaside villages, where streets became rivers carrying away everything in their path, local media reported.
The flash floods pushed several cars into the sea along the beach of the seaside resort of Agia Pelagia, with some almost completely submerged in the water surrounded by debris.
The beach was covered in scrap including plastic bottles and toys, next to straw umbrellas.
The flooding also damaged more than 15 shops, mainly fine restaurants, in Agia Pelagia, popular with wealthy diners.
The Civil Defence department said it was mobilised and asked all citizens to be vigilant on Sunday in Crete and the surrounding islands of Rhodes, Karpathos, Kastellorizo and Kasos.

Should everything go to plan for Xi, the 69-year-old will be reconfirmed as the party's general secretary after the week-long meeting, cementing his position as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.
A heavy police presence was in place around Beijing early Sunday as authorities prepared for the twice-a-decade Congress -- set to open at 10 am (0200 GMT) at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square.
A fleet of buses whisked journalists and other attendees to a virtually empty square rimmed by fluttering red flags and bathed in autumn sunshine.

The 38-year-old Chilean American now crosses over to work in San Diego as an English teacher during the day and returns home in the evening to Mexico.
"One of the biggest reasons is the cost of living in Tijuana. It's significantly cheaper than in California," Zarate said.
Also, he added: "I love Mexican people and food."
His neighbor and fellow English teacher Mike Rachfal also made the move from San Diego, where he used to pay $1,275 a month to rent a studio.
"Here it's about half that," the 36-year-old said.
The cheaper rents can be a sensitive subject in Mexico, where wages are much lower than in the United States …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treasurer Jim Chalmers is returning from the United States from an “eventful pre-budget trip,” Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says. 

“He was in one of the last meetings Kwasi Kwarteng had as UK Chancellor of the Exchequer before Kwarteng was sacked by Prime Minister Liz Truss in Britain,” Mr Clennell said. 

“Kwarteng appeared agitated and distracted during the meetings apparently - and some of the speeches at the G20 finance ministers forum must have been uncomfortable for him - given they all stressed having your budget in line with central bank policy, and the UK Chancellor, then UK Chancellor, had gone for some big unscheduled tax cuts.

“Our Treasurer met with the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell just hours after a surprise high annual inflation figure of 8.2 per cent was recorded in the US.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the largest individual donors in the 2022 midterm elections is seeking to obtain citizenship in Malta, The New York Times reported on Saturday.
The newspaper based its report on documents it had viewed and "three people with knowledge of the matter."
"Mr. Thiel, 55, is in the process of acquiring at least his third passport even as he expands his financial influence over American politics," the newspaper reported. "Since backing Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the technology investor has become one of the largest individual donors in the midterm elections next month, spending more than $30 million on more than a dozen right-wing Congressional candidates who have decried globalization and pledged to put America first."
Thiel also has a New Zealand passport.
"There is no obvious tax benefit to Mr. Thiel to gaining Maltese citizenship, lawyers and immigration experts said, though wealthy Saudi, Russian and Chinese citizens sometimes seek a passport from the island nation for European Union access and to hedge against social or political turmoil at home," The Times reported. "What is clear is that a Maltese passport would give Mr. Thiel an escape hatch from the United States if his spending doesn’t change the country to his liking."
Thiel has been a major backer of the U.S. Senate campaigns of Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance in Ohio.
"Both candidates have espoused a form of nationalism that, in part, blames globalization and leaders’ involvement in international affairs for American stagnation," the newspaper reported. "Mr. Thiel has endorsed that worldview with his money and in speeches, including one at the National Conservatism Conference last year where he called nationalism 'a corrective' to the 'brain-dead, one-world state' of globalism."

		But Musk has found himself embroiled of late in public spats with Ukrainian leaders who were angered by his controversial proposals for de-escalating the conflict, which included acknowledging Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
	

		"The hell with it," Musk, the world's richest man, wrote on Twitter.
	

		"Even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free."

		Fighting is particularly intense in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk provinces bordering Russia. Together they make up the larger industrial Donbas, which Moscow has yet to fully capture.
	

		Russian forces have repeatedly tried to seize Bakhmut, which sits on a main road leading to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Both are situated in the Donetsk region.

Fox News’ highest rated host and mercurial the rapper, producer and fashion impresario enjoyed mutually beneficial media attention — which included relentless post-game coverage on Fox News — after their long encounter.
West, or Ye as he prefers to be called now, sat down with Carlson after making headlines at a fashion show in Paris where he proudly wore a “White Lives Matter” shirt.  The ensuing outrage aligned nicely with Carlson’s quest to prove that white people are under attack, so Carlson invited West on his show to continue that mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took us far too long to come to this, so I implore the Biden administration to do everything in their power to prevent the student debt forgiveness movement from entering its flop era already.

In August, to my good surprise, President Joe Biden announcement    forgiveness of up to $20,000 in student loan debt for certain borrowers ― fulfilling a campaign promise that people like me noticed did not look like a priority    of his administration.

“People can finally start to get out of this mountain of debt to pay rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a house, starting a family or starting a business,” Biden said    at the White House in remarks detailing the plan.  “And by the way, when that happens, the whole economy gets better.”

That amount is arguably still pretty cheap…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For high school teacher and mother Jennifer Shaffer, time and sleep are two precious assets.  So with the end of DST    approaching, the busy mother says she fears changing the clock. 
“It’s definitely going to mess us up and mess us up over the next few days, even a week,” Shaffer told CBS News. 
She is not alone.  according to one vote conducted by Monmouth University, six out of 10 Americans said they would rather make daylight saving time permanent — abandoning the practice of changing the clock twice a year created during World War I to save energy.

Turning our clocks back and forth may soon be a thing of the past – if a few lawmakers get their way.
This year, Congress brought the issue into the spotlight when the House energy committee heard testimony at a formal hearing about how changing the clock is linked to increased risk of depression, stroke and sleep disorders.  According to National Children’s Hospital sleep specialist Dr.  Tyish Hall Brown, changing watches can have an impact on the body.
“We have a kind of internal rhythm to our bodies and our health,” Brown said.  “And every time we move forward or backward, that too has to adjust.”
In March, the US Senate unanimously legislation passed    without warning to make DST permanent starting in 2023, if the US House and President agree.
Michigan Congressman Fred Upton said the effort will likely fall short in the House, in part because some people in the western section of the time zones say they are concerned that permanent daylight saving time could make mornings too dark and late. 
“Not only would [school buses] running in the dark, the kids would probably be in the second or third hour while it was still dark,” he said. 
Nearly 15 years ago, Upton championed an energy-saving law that extended DST    even later in November. 
“Particularly with global warming, climate change is real,” he said.  “Why not take advantage of this extra hour of sunlight?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a time when Republicans across the country are trying to downplay or flee Trump, Eric Trump went on TV to announce that the Republican Party is now Trump’s party.
video:

Eric Trump on Newsmax:
When we’re on that stage, we know you’re going to find out who your true friends are. My father was the first thing he said to our family, you know? I love fighting for this country. We use a surprising number of arrows, but we love red, white and blue. Well, I sure hope my dad does it again. 
I think he is the best president this country has ever had. He is willing to fight. No other Republican is willing to fight and I think he fundamentally changed the party. Republicans are no longer Republicans. This is the Trump Party.
Republicans are in a tight House race across the country. Swing district candidates are trying to pretend Donald Trump doesn’t exist, and here’s Eric Trump reminding America that voting for any Republican on the 2022 ballot is as good as voting for Donald Trump.
Republicans likely won’t win control of the Senate, as Trump’s Senate roster is a massive failure.
The GOP needs Donald Trump to leave on Election Day. His presence in the midterms hurt Republican voters. Instead, Eric Trump is touching his father’s ego and reminding every voter in America that the Republican Party that was once the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan now belongs to Donald Trump.

The study said federal generosity was insufficient, failed to target schools most in need, and was not associated with policy outcomes.
Analysts at the American Educational Research Association said schools may need $700 billion to address learning losses, mainly from remote instruction, but received about $189 billion in emergency relief funds for elementary and secondary schools in 2020 and 2021.
The funds, including the roughly $120 billion invested last year in President Biden’s massive pandemic relief bill, are aimed at measures such as increasing tutoring, offering extracurricular activities and buy…]]></summary>

"In the annals of successful political extortions, few rival the one that took place in Munich more than 80 years ago," Tribe and Aftergut wrote for The Bulwark. "On September 29, 1938, two days before a deadline that Hitler had announced for invading Czechoslovakia, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain yielded and agreed to meet with the German chancellor.
