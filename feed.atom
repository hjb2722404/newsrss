BEIJING (Reuters) -Beijing lashed back at NATO's accusation that China challenges the bloc's interests and security, and opposed any attempt by the military alliance to expand its footprint into the Asia-Pacific region. 
In a strongly worded communique issued midway into a two-day summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on Tuesday, NATO said the People's Republic of China (PRC) challenged its interests, security and values with its "ambitions and coercive policies". 
"The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic, and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up," NATO heads of state said in their communique.

The Office of Naval Intelligence is sounding the alarm about the huge gap in U.S. and Chinese shipbuilding capacity and its implications.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to support Sweden's bid to join Nato, the military alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg says. 
He said the Turkish leader would forward Sweden's bid to parliament in Ankara and "ensure ratification". 
Meanwhile, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said: "I am very happy, it is a good day for Sweden." 
Turkey had previously spent months blocking Sweden's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. 
As one of Nato's 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group.

Defense News: White House wants Ukraine inspector general out of defense bill 
WASHINGTON ― The White House on Monday told lawmakers it opposes a provision in the House’s annual defense policy bill that would create a special inspector general for Ukraine aid, modelled after the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. 
The Ukraine inspector general was one of several provisions in the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act that the White House, in an Office of Management and Budget statement on the bill, told Congress it wants removed.

Outgoing ambassador Graham Fletcher will see out his four-year term at the end of August – prompting Canberra officials to pause a meeting between the Prime Minister and China’s President Xi Jinping.

A breakdown between Australia and China saw him blocked from attending a Beijing court to see the trial of Australian journalist Cheng Lei.

A Canberra source says Mr Fletcher’s replacement has already been chosen and an announcement should be expected soon.]]></summary>

“When I was in position, for the first time in three decades, we reduced the number of Americans dying of a drug overdose into the low 70,000s,” he told Sky News Australia.

“Now officially it’s at 106,000 – what we’re hearing for 2022 is it’ll be even higher, probably close to 110,000 Americans.”]]></summary>

“We can never lose hope, there’s too many people struggling with an addiction and too many family members who are helping them for us to give up,” he told Sky News Australia.

“We know recovery is possible, we know treatment works, and we need to make sure that it’s more available – we pushed that under President Trump.

“Sadly, what I think we’re seeing is there’s so much available here, there’s so much of this drug that’s coming in from Mexico, that it’s just coming in in overwhelming numbers.”]]></summary>

Turkey's president has said his country will support Sweden's bid to join Nato if the European Union opens membership talks for his country. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would state his demand at the Nato summit in Lithuania later this week.

He added that he had informed US President Joe Biden of his intentions. 
 Mr Erdogan's comments come ahead of a meeting with Sweden's prime minister and Nato's secretary general in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. 
Turkey is a Nato member and so has a veto over any new country joining the group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ROME, Jul 10 (IPS)  - There seems to be no end in sight to the war in Ukraine. On the contrary it continues to escalate. The latest ratchet up has been the decision by the USA to supply the Ukrainian army with cluster bombs. These are nasty weapons which scatter and explode over a wide area. They are specifically designed to kill people rather that destroy infrastructure, military installations or communication hubs. They also have a sting in the tail – some of the bomblets remain unexploded, effectively becoming anti-personnel mines. These can turn wide swathes of territory into virtual no-go areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/07/10/34204">Read the full story, “The Ukraine War – Will it Ever End?”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When US superstar Taylor Swift announced yet more dates for her much-hyped world tour -- but once again skipped Canada -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could not shake it off.
In a tweet referencing the lyrics of Swift's songs, Trudeau urged her to fill the blank space and perform in America's neighbor to the north.
"It's me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you," Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. "So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon."
The artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.
She plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.
The bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer's lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.
Swift last came to Canada in 2018.]]></summary>

According to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index, the world's richest people added an average of $14 million per day to their wealth over the past six months, "the best half-year for billionaires since the back half of 2020, when the economy rebounded from a Covid-induced slump."
Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk saw the largest net worth boost of any global billionaire, adding nearly $97 billion in the first half of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, saw his wealth grow by close to $59 billion, the second-largest gain of any billionaire.

The app went live on Apple and Android app stores in 100 countries at 2300 GMT on Wednesday, and will run with no ads for now, but its release in Europe has been delayed over data privacy concerns.
Threads is the biggest challenger yet to Elon Musk-owned Twitter, which has seen a series of potential competitors emerge but not yet replace one of the world's biggest social media platforms, despite its struggles.
"10 million sign ups in seven hours," Zuckerberg wrote on his official Threads account Thursday.

Images from the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle lying on its side at the bottom of a steep cliff as rescuers worked nearby.
Fifteen women died, two of them while receiving hospital care, as well as 13 men and a child, the prosecutor said.

Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on June 24, seized the command centre there where Russia coordinates its war in Ukraine, and sent a column of fighters towards Moscow before standing down after striking a deal with the Kremlin.
His mutiny posed the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin since the Russian leader came to power more than two decades ago and has forced the Kremlin to move into a damage-limitation exercise in which it has stressed the loyalty of the armed forces and the unit…]]></summary>

The conservative head of the Paris region, Valerie Pecresse, has accused the university professor and former Black Panther of having views that "feed communitarian feeling and can encourage violence."
Speaking to a committee in March, the rightwinger also criticized Davis's belief in the idea of systemic racism, which she denied existed in France, and said "a certain number of recent declarations about France pose a problem."
She pointed in particular to a joint letter signed by Davis and other academics in 2021 which accused the French state of having a "colonial mentality" which was "manifest in France's …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey said the Hollywood actor grabbed him "like a cobra", a London court heard on Wednesday.
The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is the third of four men accusing Spacey of a string of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
The accuser said he met the US actor, who won Oscars for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", at an event in a West End theatre in 2005.
In a recording of a police interview played at Southwark Crown Court in south London, the man said Spacey "smelled of booze" and "looked disheveled" when he arrived.
"My first impression is that he seemed very arrogant," he added.
"I remember he looked me up and down and looked at my crotch region," the accuser said, adding that the actor made crude remarks towards him.
"It was very aggressive. I have never had anyone talk to me in that way. It was all getting hardcore," he said about the alleged comments.
The complainant said Spacey allegedly grabbed him "with such force it was really painful", describing it as "like a cobra coming out and getting hold".
"I remember freezing and pushing his arm away and feeling shellshocked and frustrated that anybody would be that sleazy," he added.
The accuser said he had initially put the incident "in a box" but it had "a detrimental effect" on his life.
The alleged victim criticized Spacey for coming out as gay several years ago when other allegations against him became public.
"He took no responsibility for it, he just said 'I'm gay'.
"He's still not hearing what he did was wrong –- that's sort of spurred me on a bit," the witness said.
The court has heard from two other complainants, one of whom said Spacey was an aggressive "predator" uncomfortable with his sexuality.
Another accuser alleged Spacey kissed his neck and grabbed his crotch.
The prosecution has described Spacey as a "sexual bully", whose preferred method of assault was grabbing other men in the crotch.
Spacey denies all the charges.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
