        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says China cannot dialogue with Australia in "good faith" while Beijing continues to amass nuclear weapons.

"If the government's got a dialogue wand it's a productive dialogue then of course it should be pursued – but if we're just being handled then that's not a productive use of time," Mr Dutton told Sky News Australia.

"The Australian government needs to be serious in the discussions and we need to ask China to explain their human rights abuses and to explain what's happening in relation to their military build up. 

"The government should be asking of China that if their conducting talks in good faith ... a sign of that good faith would be pulling back on the rapid expansion of their military arsenal."]]></summary>

Mr Chalmers said it had not yet been confirmed China would be lifting trade ban on Australian goods. 

“We’d like to see it happen … that would be a welcome step,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“We’d like to see it not stop there, it should extend to the restrictions that are placed on some of our other exports as well in the interests of our employers and exporters here in Australia.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says the government resuming talks with China is fine so long as Beijing indicates there will be no repeat in its behaviour that puts Australian Defence Force personnel at risk.

Mr Dutton said it was not unreasonable to ask China to take concrete actions to demonstrate it is not heading down the path "the rest of the world believes them to be heading down".

In February, a Chinese Navy vessel aimed a military-grade laser at a RAAF P-8A Poseidon aircraft, which had been monitoring the ship from above over the Arafura Sea.

"Their own rhetoric in relation to Taiwan, their own actions in relation to the assaults on our military personnel – as I say the P-8 was put in a very precarious position – had that plane gone down we'd be having a very different discussion."]]></summary>

"According to even the Biden-friendly politico.com, as far as oil prices are concerned, Joey of Arabia doesn't stand an ice cube's chance in the desert of getting the sheiks to do anything about pain at the pump," Mr Morrow said.

Mr Morrow said President Biden was certainly trying to make peace with the Saudis.

“This is just remarkable,” Ms Panahi said. 

“The patriarchy wins again and again,” she said. 

“It seems like biological male bodies are far better at being women than women are … where transwomen win woman of the year awards instead of women who have been women their entire lives.

DW: Russia's Gazprom says no sign of Nord Steam 1 turbine 
Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has asked German engineering firm Siemens for the return of a turbine that was being fixed in Canada. There are fears state-owned Gazprom could use the opportunity to cut off gas. 
The Russian gas supplier Gazprom said Saturday it had asked German engineering company Siemens for details about the return of a turbine — under maintenance in Canada — to ensure the delivery of gas from the Nord Stream pipeline to Europe. 
Gazprom is conducting maintenance on the pipeline over a 10-day period and has stopped delivering gas through the conduit, which runs beneath the Baltic Sea.

The Federalist: Did Gen. Milley Seize Presidential Power? Banks And Grassley Demand Answers 
Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, demanded Thursday that Gen. Mark Milley finally respond to allegations that he usurped presidential power over the military while he was President Donald Trump’s principal military adviser. Bob Woodward and Robert Costa raised the allegations in their 2021 book “Peril,” and according to the lawmakers, Milley still has not confirmed nor denied them.
“According to Bob Woodward’s book ‘Peril,’ Gen. Mark Milley directed senior military officers not to follow the president’s orders unless General Milley approved them first,” Banks said in a speech on the House floor on Thursday.

* President Biden laughed on Friday night after he was questioned about criticism over his fist bump with MBS 
* Image of the exchange drew harsh backlash from the widow of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
* Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in an assassination that US intel indicates was ordered by MBS 
* Biden told DailyMail.com reporter asking about potential future Saudi rights violations was 'silly question' 
* But Biden confirmed he brought up Khashoggi's murder in his meeting with MBS at the Saudi royal palace 
* 'I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it,' Biden said 
* Biden told reporters that MBS 'basically said he was not personally responsible' for the gruesome killing 
* 'I indicated I thought he was,' Biden continued. 'He said he was not personally responsible for it and he took action against those who were responsible' 
President Joe Biden laughed on Friday night after he was questioned about criticism over his fist bump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman outside the royal palace in Jeddah. 
The image of the friendly fist-bump drew harsh backlash from the publisher of the Washington Post and the widow of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in a gruesome assassination that US intelligence services say bin Salman ordered. 
Questioned about criticism of the fist bump by a DailyMail.com reporter, Biden laughed and then said it was a 'silly question' when asked how he can be sure another murder like that of Khashoggi wouldn't happen again.

One of Watson’s accusers filed a lawsuit last month against the Texans, Watson’s former employer, claiming the organization ‘turned a blind eye’ to Watson’s behavior towards female massage therapists while he played for the team.  She is the only plaintiff to file a lawsuit against the Texans, but in a statement, Buzbee said the settlements affect “all women who have made or intend to make claims against the Houston Texans organization.” .
Twenty-four women have filed lawsuits against Watson, alleging he assaulted or harassed them during massage appointments between 2020 and 2021 whil…]]></summary>

Of course, there were his bulletproof defensive skills and magical return of serve.  Add to that the eye-popping thrill of watching Mr. Djokovic, a 6ft 2in Serbian, display his Gumby-like flexibility and shredded physique (achieved on a gluten-free diet and state-of-the-art workout regimen ) in a three-hour, four-set final.  Yet for those who care about such things – fashion critics, for example – the elegance of Mr. Djokovic’s game has benefited from an anachronism dating back to the start of the tournament in 1877. Namely the strict white dress code still enforced by the legendary All England Club.…]]></summary>

Naftogaz which has a $335 million bond maturing as well as two interest payments due on July 19, said Russia’s invasion had left it short of cash as many of its customers were now unable to pay their bills. 
In its request for the payment freeze, Naftogaz said the five-month old war had resulted in a “significant economic and business decline in Ukraine” and that the missed bill payments had “negatively affected its liquidity position.”

Bloomberg: Biden Set to Leave Saudi Arabia With No Announcement on Oil 
President Joe Biden will leave the Middle East this week with no public announcements on increasing oil supply, people familiar with the matter said. 
Biden, who came to office vowing to turn the world’s biggest oil exporter into a “pariah” over the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, said he decided to make the trip to advance US interests and try and curb soaring gasoline prices, which have hurt him politically ahead of mid-term elections. 
Biden heads to Saudi Arabia from Israel later on Friday, where he’ll meet with King Salman bin Abdulaziz and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the nation’s de-facto ruler. He will meet other leaders from the oil-exporting Persian Gulf on Saturday.

Newsweek: Ukraine Building 'Army of Drones' Though Donations to Monitor Front Line  
Ukraine is building an "Army of Drones" to monitor the front lines of its ongoing war against Russia. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's global donation initiative United24 announced the "Army of Drones" project last week alongside the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the country's Ministry of Digital Transformation. 
The project calls for international donors to provide funds that the Ukrainian military will use to purchase drones, as well as direct "dronations" of unmanned aerial vehicles.

The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act is $37 billion above the president's request. 
The House approved sweeping defense policy legislation on Thursday that marks the second straight year Democrats and Republicans endorsed significant increases to President Joe Biden’s Pentagon spending plan. 
The $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act, approved in a 329-101 vote, is $37 billion more than the administration sought in military spending. 
On top of the budget, the bill also rebukes several of Biden’s national security plans. 
Members maintained a nuclear cruise missile the administration planned to scrap, hampered F-16 sales to Turkey and limited the number of aircraft and ships the Pentagon can retire.

WNU Editor: The House voted 329-101 to approve this $840 billion bill that includes funding for the Defense Department and directing policy at the agency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Independent: France to turn off lights as Macron warns of energy problems ahead 
President Emmanuel Macron has warned people in France to prepare for having public lights switched off at night and to get ready for a time of nationwide energy “sobriety”. 
In a grim warning for millions of ordinary French people, Mr Macron said because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions by Western states, energy and the prices of other goods had increased. 
With no end in sight for the Ukraine war, Mr Macron said, the French should brace themselves for costs to remain high. 
“This war will continue,” he said in a televised interview marking France’s national holiday, Bastille Day on Thursday. 
“The summer, early autumn will be very hard.”  “Russia is using energy, like it is using food, as a weapon of war,” Mr Macron said. 
“We should prepare ourselves for the scenario where we have to go without all Russian gas.” 
He said the government would prepare a “sobriety plan” to conserve energy, which would start with turning off public lights at night when they are not useful.

WNU Editor: French President Macron clearly believes that Russia is going to cut-off natural gas supplies soon. He also strongly believes that the Russia - Ukraine war is going to continue for a long time.

“Saudi Arabia is now a police state,” says one activist.
 Lina al-Hathloul is an activist from Saudi Arabia whose sister, Loujain, was imprisoned and tortured from 2018 to 2021. She traveled to Washington this week to explain to policymakers just how devastating it is that President Joe Biden has traveled to the Middle East to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, known as MBS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real Clear Politics: Republicans Are Favored to Win the Senate 
Recently there has been a spate of stories about Republicans’ difficulties in taking over the Senate. These analyses typically focus on candidates’ poor polling numbers in key states and the weakness of the Republican recruiting class. 
These aren’t absurd analyses; I’ve referred to the battle between the overall electoral environment and Republican candidate quality as “the irresistible force versus the immovable object” in previous columns. Had the Republican Party fielded its A-team in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, we probably would not be talking about Democrats even having a shot at retaining the Senate.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I agree with the above conclusions. There is going to be a lot of protest votes against President Biden, and a large number of soft-Democrat no-shows at the ballot box. 
There are not many vulnerable Democrats running for re-election this year, but all the Republicans need is a pick-up of one US Senate seat to gain control.   
Update: There is a definite shift in demographics on who supports the Republican and Democrat parties .... The Democratic electorate's seismic shift (Axios).]]></summary>

While it might almost seem like a question for a video game, U.S. Air Force planners are getting ready for a time when U.S. stealth fighters like the F-22 and F-35 could have to battle against China’s J-20 stealth fighter. Who would come out on top? An American veteran F-22 pilot took on a virtual representation of China’s Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter from the seat of a very real aircraft in flight back in 2020. The Chinese fighter was projected on the pilot’s augmented reality helmet-mounted display, giving a real pilot in a real aircraft the opportunity to train against a seemingly real foreign opponent.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in a "world war" with the West as he continues his invasion of Ukraine, an ally said Wednesday.  In an interview with independent Serbian TV Channel Pink, Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic, who has yet to condemn Putin for invading Ukraine, accused the West of sparking a "war" against Russia through the Ukrainian people.   "We should understand that amid the world war, all the talks that it’s a regional or a local war must be dropped. The entire Western world is fighting against Russia via Ukrainians. It is [a] global conflict," Vucic said, according to Russia’s state-run news agency TASS.

   Financial Times: Nato and EU sound alarm over risk of Ukraine weapons smuggling 
Countries call for greater tracking of arms to stop sales to Europe’s black market 
Nato and EU states are pushing for better tracking of weapons supplied to Ukraine in response to fears that criminal groups are smuggling them out of the country and on to Europe’s black market. 
Since Russia launched its war against Ukraine, western states have pledged more than $10bn in military support, from portable rocket launchers and armoured vehicles to rifles and vast amounts of ammunition. 
A number of Nato member states are discussing with Kyiv some form of tracking system or detailed inventory lists for weapons supplied to Ukraine, two western officials briefed on the talks told the Financial Times. 
 Ukraine’s government is setting up a more extensive weapons monitoring and tracing system with the help of western countries, a third person familiar with the situation said. 
“All these weapons land in southern Poland, get shipped to the border and then are just divided up into vehicles to cross: trucks, vans, sometimes private cars,” said one of the western officials. “And from that moment we go blank on their location and we have no idea where they go, where they are used or even if they stay in the country.”

The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine calls on all citizens of the United States to immediately leave the territory of Ukraine. This is caused by the cynical rocket fire of the Russian occupation forces of the cities of Ukraine. 
The corresponding statement is published on the official website of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. 
The Embassy notes that the security situation throughout Ukraine continues to be violent and unpredictable due to ongoing military attacks by Russia, with active fighting in country and uncertain safety conditions.

   Bloomberg: EU Set to Boost Ukraine Weapons Financing to 2.5 Billion Euros 
(Bloomberg) -- European Union member states are set to agree on 500 million euros ($500 million) more in military aid to Ukraine when the bloc’s foreign ministers meet Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. 
That would bring the total arms financing to 2.5 billion euros. The bloc in recent months has agreed to several rounds of arms financing for Ukraine under the so-called European Peace Facility, which reimburses governments for military deliveries to Ukraine.

“The fact that China also does appear to have filled a void, created by some of the economic sanctions that much of the rest of the world have imposed upon Russia, by picking up demand for Russian wheat and the like has not only been a failure to participate in those sanctions but has been an undermining of elements of those sanctions.”]]></summary>

The pledge comes during Mr Biden’s first visit to the Middle East as president.

“The United States and Israel reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our two countries,” the statement said.

“The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel’s capability to deter its enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination of threats.

“The United States stresses that integral to this pledge is the commitment never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that it is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome.”

The statement went on to reaffirm the US’ commitment to work with other partners to “confront” Iran’s aggression and “destabilising activates”.

“The United States and Israel affirm that they will continue to work together to combat all efforts to boycott or de-legitimise Israel, to deny its right to self-defence, or to unfairly single it out in any forum, including at the United Nations or the International Criminal Court,” the declaration said. 

President Biden also spoke about his trip as an opportunity to reassert America’s influence in the Middle East.]]></summary>

Middle East Monitor: BRICS expects Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to join group soon  
The president of the BRICS International Forum expects Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to join the group "very soon". In an interview with Russia's Izvestia, Purnima Anand said that China, Russia and India discussed this issue during the 14th BRICS Summit, which was held online last month. 
"All these countries have shown an interest in joining and are preparing to apply for membership. I think this is a good step, because expansion is always perceived positively; this will clearly increase the influence of BRICS in the world," explained Anand. "I hope that the accession of countries to BRICS will happen very quickly, because now all representatives of the core of the association are interested in expanding the organisation, so it will be very soon." 
She stressed that the accession of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey may not take place at the same time.

FOUNTAIN, Colo. — The local Army recruiting station was empty. The normally reliable recruiting grounds at the nearby Walmart were a bust. With the Army still thousands of soldiers short of its recruiting goal, the station commander, Sgt. First Class James Pulliam, dressed head to toe in camouflage, scanned a strip-mall parking lot for targets. 
He spotted a young woman getting out of a car, and put on his best salesman smile. 
“Hey, how’d you know I was going to be here today!” the sergeant said with an affable Carolina drawl, as if greeting an old friend. “I’m going to help put you in the Army!” 
These are tough times for military recruiting. Almost across the board, the armed forces are experiencing large shortfalls in enlistments this year — a deficit of thousands of entry-level troops that is on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War. It threatens to throw a wrench into the military’s machinery, leaving critical jobs unfilled and some platoons with too few people to function.

* Finland and Sweden have already broken with neutrality to join NATO alliance 
A majority of Swiss people now favour 'drawing closer' to NATO in one of the clearest signs yet of the seismic impact that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had on Europe. 
Switzerland has effectively been neutral for more than 500 years, but a new poll shows citizens increasingly believe that is not the best way to protect their country. 
Record-high numbers of Swiss now say the government should increase defence spending, maintain a fully-equipped army, and build tighter relations with NATO.

Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do "whatever is necessary to restore order" after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. 
Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. 
But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go.  Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. 
Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem.

* Covid death and case figures are starting to sharply rise once again as the BA.5 variant takes hold in the United States 
* America is averaging 649 deaths from the virus every day, a 97% increase over the past week that broke over a month of stagnant figures 
* Cases are creeping upwards as well, jumping 24% over the past week to 136,000 per day after weeks of sitting in the low 100,000s 
* On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci warned of an upcoming surge and recommended that Americans start masking-up in indoor public places 
Daily Covid infections and deaths are beginning to surge in the U.S. after over a month of little movement - signaling that a summer surge fueled by the BA.5 variant could now be under way. 
America is averaging 649 daily deaths from Covid, a 97 percent increase over the past week. It is the largest seven day increase in deaths since early December. 
Recorded infections have made a leap as well, to 136,903 per day. It is a 24 percent increase over seven days and the largest daily case average since February - when America was coming down off of the largest Covid surge of the pandemic.

MSF says corpses line only road into isolated area of Cite-Soleil, Haiti, which rival gangs have turned into a ‘battlefield’. 
Thousands of people are trapped without access to food, drinking water and medical care in an isolated part of the Haitian capital, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) has said, as clashes between rival gangs in Port-au-Prince’s Cite-Soleil neighbourhood escalate. 
In a statement, the humanitarian aid group said residents have been unable to leave an area in Cite-Soleil known as Brooklyn, while trucks that bring drinking water into the neighbourhood have been unable to enter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice," he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Jeffrey Hall, special lecturer in Japanese studies at Japan’s Kanda University of International Studies, noted the growing online speculation that the group in question is the Unification Church, officially now known on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification that was founded by Sun Myung Moon, whose members are known colloquially as "Moonies."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms. There have been some cases in recent years where people illicitly made weapons themselves in Japan. But still, gun crime is very rare in Japan: last year th...]]></summary>

Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…]]></summary>

Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whizzing helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his official residence on Saturday shortly before protesters, angered by an unprecedented economic crisis, stormed and overran the compound.
Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa's resignation, has called an urgent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the "stoning of the devil" ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year's expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A day after the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, a steady stream of mourners, many in tears, arrived at the scene of his murder in western Japan to offer flowers and prayers.
People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.
When he heard about the death of Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, …]]></summary>

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Danila Davydov said he left Russia within weeks of the Kremlin sending troops into Ukraine because he feared having to fight in a war he doesn’t support.
The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
"I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave," Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain's departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world's fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
"We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

In fact, according to the article, propagandists on Russian stations are speculating it could be the only way to escape the Western sanctions destroying their economy in retaliation for the war against Ukraine.
"Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being 'lynched,' as they put it, by the January 6 Committee," reported Julia Davis.
