That compares with 18% confidence in Chinese leader Xi Jinping and 60% for U.S. President Joe Biden and 59% German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 
Putin's worldwide approval has been on a downward trend during his two decades in power.

Al-Monitor: Iran replaces IRGC's intelligence chief 
Taeb's apparent dismissal comes after Israeli media outlets identified him as masterminding plots against Israeli citizens in Turkey. 
Iran has replaced the head of the intelligence unit for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Taeb, the IRGC confirmed on Thursday. 
“Guard Corps chief Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami appointed Gen. Mohammad Kazemi as the new head of the IRGC Intelligence Organization,” spokesman for the IRGC Ramezan Sharif said in a statement. Kazemi had previously run the IRGC’s Intelligence Protection Organization. 
Iran's state broadcaster IRIB reported Thursday that Taeb will now serve as an adviser to IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami.

* But any accession process to the EU is likely to take years if not decades 
* Ukrainian President Zelensky said he had been calling EU leaders to make case 
The European Parliament has approved Ukraine's bid to join the EU in a vote backed by an overwhelming majority of MEPs. 
Leaders of the member states will gather in Brussels later today to discuss calls to formally grant Ukraine 'candidate status' to join the bloc, as Russian forces slowly advance in the eastern Donbas region. 
But some member states have been lukewarm about letting Ukraine join the EU, and any accession process is likely to take years if not decades.

Everything was calm.  No alarm sounds.  No evacuation order came.  But the condo tower was about to collapse.

WASHINGTON — “It’s my Super Bowl,” an off-camera news anchor said during public hearings held by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.  But what’s a Super Bowl without stars, or even fans, I thought.  Former President Donald J. Trump and his family would certainly not show up in person.  Neither Rudolph W. Giuliani, once his personal attorney and former mayor of New York, nor any other who would be recognizable to anyone but a student of politics.

It was unclear exactly what investigators were looking for, but Mr. Clark played a pivotal role in President Donald J. Trump’s failed efforts in late 2020 to force the nation’s top prosecutors to support his election fraud allegations.
The law enforcement action at Mr. Clark’s home in suburban Virginia came just a day before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol is set to hold a hearing examining Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department after his election defeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Granite State poll of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire signals waning support for former President Donald J. Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee — and growing strength for Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida.
Among more than 300 likely Republican primary voters, 37% said they wanted Mr. Trump to be the party’s next presidential nominee, compared with 39% who said they would support Mr. DeSantis, within the margin of error of 5.5% for this question.  Mr. Trump is now “statistically linked” to Mr. DeSantis, according to the poll.
That’s a significant change from October, when a Granite State poll showed Mr. Trump had the support of 43% of likely Republican voters;  Mr. DeSantis was at 18%.


But Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the poll, warned there was still plenty of time before the 2024 presidential cycle: “It’s daylight saving time.  We haven’t even had the midterm elections yet.


The tightening between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis is “part of a typical pattern,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.  “As the primary draws closer, new candidates are emerging and attracting more media attention, and therefore more voter attention, than the losing candidate from the previous election.”
The survey was conducted from June 16 to 20.  It also showed that among more than 840 likely voters in the 2024 general election, Mr. DeSantis was a stronger Republican challenger than Mr. Trump to face President Biden in the next presidential election.
Mr. Biden, who won the state in 2020, would get 50% of the vote if he ran against Mr. Trump, who would get 43%, according to the poll.  But Mr. Biden was only expected to get 46% against Mr. DeSantis, who would get 47%, according to the poll.
In a brief interview, Mr. Smith described waning support for Mr. Trump as voters “move away from last year’s model to look at this year’s model”.

A bill that would allow New York to build state-owned renewable energy has suddenly been thrown into play, after being considered dead.  It passed the Senate despite strong opposition from energy producers, and after hours of fervent grassroots lobbying, activists proclaimed they had enough votes in the Assembly to pass.
But Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie never introduced the bill, and the session ended without a vote.


The failure to force Mr. Heastie’s hand was a glaring example of how more left-leaning state lawmakers have encountered headwinds this year, but it wasn’t the only one: proposals to protecting tenants from eviction, creating universal hea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rubble outline of collapsed walls and roofs is all that remains of the village where Zaitullah Ghurziwal lives, ravaged by a ruinous earthquake in Afghanistan that has left at least 1,000 people dead.
Survivors in Ghurza wander around in shock, looking for a place of shelter -- or to the sky in hope that aid will be delivered by aircraft.
"There are no blankets or tents... there's no shelter. People are lying on open ground," Ghurziwal tells AFP, pointing to the crumbled dwelling where he now holds out with six other families.
"We need food and water. Our entire water distribution system is destroyed. Everything is devastated."
Wednesday's 5.9-magnitude quake -- Afghanistan's deadliest in years -- struck hardest in rugged east Paktika province. In addition to damaging or destroying tho…]]></summary>

Euronews/AFP: Moscow renames US embassy street after Donetsk separatists 
The city of Moscow has renamed the official address of the US embassy in Moscow after pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. 
The street housing the embassy building has now been labelled "Donetsk People's Republic Square". 
The move now forces the US diplomatic mission to refer to the separatist territory in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. 
Russia recognised the independence of the region in February -- just before it launched its invasion of Ukraine -- but the US and the West have not recognised it. 
"The US embassy in Russia has a new official address," Moscow City Hall said in a statement.

"The war continues, the war is not over. And this is a war in which our citizens are dying, in which Ukrainian and foreign journalists are dying," said Tetyana Teren, executive director of PEN Ukraine, one of the organizers of the exhibition.
"That is why we ask foreign media to tell the truth about this war and continue to tell the world about Russia's crimes in our country," she told AFP.
Portraits of reporters and media workers who have become victims of the conflict stare down at passers-by from large black and white boards in the capital's centre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A gun battle left four police officers and eight suspected gang members dead in Mexico's western state of Jalisco, authorities said Thursday.
The clash happened on Wednesday night at a house in El Salto on the outskirts of the city of Guadalajara and, according to witnesses, lasted for more than an hour.
Eight suspects were killed and three others seriously injured, Jalisco Governor Enrique Alfaro said.
Two people being held captive inside the building were rescued following a tip-off that gunmen had been seen taking gagged people into the house, prosecutor Luis Mendez Ruiz told reporters.
Several people were arrested, and weapons and ammunition were seized.
Ten police officers have been murdered this year in Jalisco, one of Mexico's most violent states due to the presence of criminal gangs, according to official figures.
The western region, one of the country's most prosperous, is the cradle of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which authorities blame for numerous deaths and disappearances.
Its leader, Nemesio "El Mencho" Oseguera, is one of the world's most wanted drug lords, with the US Drug Enforcement Administration offering $10 million for his arrest.
More than 340,000 people have been killed in a spiral of bloodshed in Mexico since the government deployed the army to fight drug cartels in 2006.

The mass scale combat has pitted 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers, together with 450,000 recently mobilised citizen soldiers against about 200,000 Russian and separatist troops. The effort to arm, feed and supply these armies is a monumental task. Ammunition resupply i…]]></summary>

Business Insider: Take a look at China's biggest destroyer, a $920 million cruiser that's said to be the 2nd most powerful in the world after the USS Zumwalt 
* China has the biggest navy in the world in terms of number of vessels. 
* The Type 055 is the biggest destroyer class in China's People's Liberation Army Navy. 
* Chinese media has touted the ship as the second most powerful in the world after the USS Zumwalt.  China has the world's largest navy in terms of total number of vessels. 
The Type 055 is the biggest destroyer class in China's People's Liberation Army Navy.  China's navy has 355 vessels, outnumbering the US Navy's 297 vessels. 
China State Shipbuilding Corp. began building its biggest vessel — the Type 055 — in 2014. 
The Type 055 destroyers have been in service since 2020. 
The class of destroyers is also known as Renhai-class cruisers. As a multirole warship, it's equipped with weapons to counter missiles, ships, and submarines, according to the South China Morning Post.

After years of planning and months of training to climb Mount Everest on the first all-Black expedition to the world's tallest peak, 35-year-old Fred Campbell came down with a respiratory infection soon after arriving in Nepal in April.
Campbell fought the infection for weeks on acclimatization hikes with his mountaineering team, Full Circle Everest, but by the time he reached Camp 3 at 24,000 feet above sea level in the Himalayas, his fever spiked to 104 degrees.
The medical evacuation took Campbell back to E…]]></summary>

Only a “massive” and immediate scaling-up of funds and humanitarian relief can save Somalia from famine, a UN spokesperson has warned, as aid workers report children starving to death “before our eyes” amid rapidly escalating levels of malnutrition. 
In a message to G7 leaders who are meeting from Sunday in Germany, Michael Dunford, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) regional director for east Africa, said governments had to donate urgently and generously if there was to be any hope of avoiding catastrophe in the Horn of Africa country.

Putin claimed at a BRICS economic event that Moscow is creating dependable substitutes for international payments with its allies Brazil, India, China, and South Africa.
“The Russian system for transmitting financial messages is open to connecting banks from the five countries,” he declared, noting: “The geography of the use of the Russian payment system Mir is expanding.”

Since her ouster in a coup last year, Suu Kyi had been under house arrest at an undisclosed location in Naypyidaw, accompanied by several domestic staff and her dog, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strikes crippled Britain's rail network on Thursday as union bosses, train operating firms and the government faced off over demands that workers' pay increases keep pace with surging inflation.
A spike in the cost of food and fuel is pushing many household budgets to the brink and is driving trade unions to demand higher pay increases for their members. The government has urged wage restraint to avoid an inflationary spiral.
Unions formed picket lines around rail stations for the second day this week and warned of more industrial action unless a deal can be reached to improve pay and avoid redundancies.
"We'll continue to talk to the companies about everything that's been put on the table and we'll review that and see if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action," Mick Lynch, secretary-general of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), told the BBC.
"But if we don't get a settlement, it's extremely likely that there will be."
Although talks are ongoing, a third day of strikes is planned for Saturday. Other industries are also moving towards industrial action in what unions say could be a "summer of discontent".
The government has criticized the strikes, calling them counterproductive and most damaging for those on low incomes who depend on public transport and are unable to work from home.
Later on Thursday, ministers will set out planned changes to a law that would make it easier for businesses to use temporary staff, in a moved designed to minimize the impact of strike action.

"Once again trade unions are holding the country to ransom by grinding crucial public services and businesses to a halt. The situation we are in is not sustainable," Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said.
"Repealing these 1970s-era restrictions will give businesses freedom to access fully skilled staff at speed, all while allowing people to get on with their lives uninterrupted to help keep the economy ticking."

A Russian naval blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports has stopped grain shipments from the world's fourth-largest exporter of wheat and corn, raising the specter of shortages and hunger in low-income countries.
The knock-on effects of the food shortages mean many will die not only of starvation but from having weaker defenses against infectious diseases due to bad nutrition, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria told AFP this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this file photo, steam and smoke rise from a coal burning power plant in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, Dec. 16, 2009 (AP Photo)   
Business Insider: Europe is drawing up emergency plans to switch back to coal after Russia cuts natural-gas supplies 
* The Netherlands and Denmark triggered emergency energy plans on Monday. 
* Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Austria signaled a shift to coal as an emergency fuel. 
European countries have triggered emergency plans that could lead to rationing of natural gas and signaled a shift back to coal-fired power as the continent's largest buyers of Russian fuel seek to secure their energy supplies. 
Russian state gas giant Gazprom cut natural-gas supplies via the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany — which also goes to the rest of Europe — by more than half since last week, citing an equipment hold-up in Canada as a result of sanctions over the Ukraine war. 
German economy minister Robert Habeck and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week Gazprom's move was politically motivated, but Moscow insists it's technical. "We have gas, it is ready to be delivered, but the Europeans must give back the equipment, which should be repaired under their obligations," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday, Reuters reported.

The leaders of France, Germany and Italy have jointly visited Ukraine in an attempt to present a unified European front regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The one-day visit was long on rhetoric but short on substance: European unity remains elusive.  When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the European Union responded the following day with a package of unprecedented economic sanctions aimed at isolating Russia. 
The EU, which was praised for displaying "determination, unity and speed" in its response to Putin, was said to be facing a "transformative moment" that would allow the bloc to become a "geostrategic actor" on the global stage. An observer claimed that the EU had become "a top geopolitical protagonist" and that Europe "discovered that it's a superpower."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Rise of the killer robots! Watch an AI-powered tank shoot rounds and blow up targets in the first live fire of the unmanned 'Type-X' robotic combat vehicle 
* A robotics company showed off its AI-powered tank, dubbed Tank-X 
* The tank navigates obstacles on an open field and blows up targets 
* The idea is to let the robot head into battle, while human soldiers stay safe 
* At least 10 countries have already placed orders for the Type-X platform 
Imagine a world where wars are fought by AI-powered tanks, allowing soldiers to stay at a safe distance from the battlefield and yet, still demolish their enemies. 
Although this sounds like something out of a sci-fi film, the scenario is exactly what Milrem Robotics and Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace have shown in a first live fire of the PROTECTOR Remote Turret from the Type-X Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV).

It wasn't just the epic confusion unleashed by the Biden admin in the past few days over how to lower record gas prices (suggesting that Biden really has no idea what the 79-year-old president is doing), that sparked today's jump in crude oil and surge in energy names. 
Providing some bullish support for the oil cash, in his latest weekly note, Bank of America's energy analyst Fernando Blanch writes that even if the world goes into recession, Brent oil could average more than $75/bbl next year.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow's massive air and artillery attacks were aimed at destroying the entire Donbas region and urged Ukraine's allies to accelerate the shipment of heavy weapons to match Russia on the battlefield.
The fight for the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Ukraine's Luhansk region is "entering a sort of fearsome climax", said Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to Zelenskiy. Russia is seeking to capture both Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region - the nation's industrial heartland.

Matt Margolis, PJ Media: Is Kamala Harris Planning a Coup to Oust Biden? 
We’ve known about tensions between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for some time now, but former President Bill Clinton strategist Dick Morris believes Biden’s aides are now leaking damaging stories on Harris out of concern that she will attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office. 
Morris cites a New York Times story that dismisses Harris as not ready for prime time because she antagonizes her staff and botched her trip to the border. Morris believes the leak “must have undoubtedly come from the Biden forces.” 
Further, Morris says that he’s heard rumors close to the White House that Biden’s dementia is getting worse and has become harder to control and cover up. 
“I believe there may be a move coming to invoke the 25th Amendment against Biden and replace him with Harris,” Morris writes. “Biden’s people are pushing back against it by shooting at Harris and saying that she’s not really ready to be president.”

WNU Editor: I must admit that I am surprised that President Biden is still in office. I always watch and listen to his speeches and announcements, and I predicted last year that if his loss of cognitive abilities continue, he would be replaced in 2022. Well ... his cognitive capabilities have declined noticeably since last year, but he is still in the Oval Office. 
As to US Vice President Harris being the person who will initiate the moves necessary to have President Biden removed from office as the above PJ Media article suggests. I have my doubts that it will work that way..
My guess is that it will be the people who convinced candidate Biden and his staff to appoint Kamala Harris as his running mate in 2020 that will lay the groundwork for President Biden to leave, and it will be the people around President Biden as well as the leadership in the Democrat Party who will then finally tell him that his time is up.]]></summary>

President Joe Biden is fast heading into worst-ever territory as people are rejecting his handling of the economy — and him. 
In two new polls depressing the White House today, one put his approval rating at a career low of 32%, and another rejected the president’s finger-pointing on the economy. 
The latest Civiqs approval rating hit 32%, with 56% disapproving of the president. Even Democrats are expressing frustration, with their approval rate at a low 69%, according to the data.

* President Joe Biden again blamed inflation on 'Putin's Price Hike' on Wednesday 
* It came soon after Fed chair said Ukraine war is not the primary driver of inflation 
* Powell said that rate hikes will be decided on 'meeting by meeting' basis 
* The central bank will need to see 'compelling evidence' that inflation is coming down to stop the hikes 
* He acknowledged the risk of recession: 'It's certainly a possibility, and the events of the last few months around the world have made it more difficult' 
President Joe Biden has again blamed inflation on 'Putin's Price Hike' just moments after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that Russia's war in Ukraine was not the main driver of rising consumer prices. 
'I'm doing everything I can to blunt the Putin Price Hike and bring down the cost of gas and food,' Biden wrote in a tweet on Wednesday touting his release of oil from strategic reserves and efforts to help Ukraine export grain.

In St. Petersburg, the world's new powers gather to upend the US-concocted “rules-based order” and reconnect the globe their way 
The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum  has been configured for years now as absolutely essential to understand the evolving dynamics and the trials and tribulations of Eurasia integration. 
St. Petersburg in 2022 is even more crucial as it directly connects to three simultaneous developments I had previously outlined, in no particular order: 
* First, the coming of the “new G8” – four BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), plus Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico, whose GDP per purchasing parity power (PPP) already dwarfs the old, western-dominated G8. 
* Second, the Chinese “Three Rings” strategy of developing geoeconomic relations with its neighbors and partners. 
* Third, the development of BRICS+, or extended BRICS, including some members of the “new G8,” to be discussed at the upcoming summit in China.

CNN: Putin says Russia is rerouting trade to China and India  
President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Russia is rerouting trade to “reliable international partners” such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa as the West attempts to sever economic ties.
“We are actively engaged in reorienting our trade flows and foreign economic contacts towards reliable international partners, primarily the BRICS countries,” Putin said in his opening video address to the participants of the virtual BRICS Summit. The “BRICS” acronym refers to an informal grouping of the five developing economies. 
According to Putin, trade between Russia and the BRICS countries increased by 38% and reached $45 billion in the first three months of the year.

Bloomberg: Refugee Food Rations Cut as War in Ukraine Worsens Global Hunger 
(Bloomberg) -- The World Food Programme is cutting food rations for refugees by as much as half, as it faces a hunger crisis worsened by the war in Ukraine and funding constraints. 
“We are being forced to make the heart-breaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley said Monday in a statement. 
Food prices are near a record high after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sharply reduced Kyiv’s key exports of grain and vegetable oil, adding to price pressures from logistics snarl-ups and a rebound in demand after the pandemic. 
Efforts to let Ukraine resume crucial agricultural exports are moving slowly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) -Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and actress Jerry Hall are getting a divorce, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Murdoch got married to Hall in a low-key ceremony in central London in March 2016. The Fox Corp chairman and his former supermodel wife were frequent fodder for the tabloids, which chronicled their marriage at Spencer House and the festivities surrounding the elder Murdoch's 90th birthday celebration last year at Tavern on the Green in New York City.
Murdoch's divorce, his fourth, is unlikely to alter the ownership structure of businesses he holds stakes in, which include Fox Corp, the parent company of Fox News Channel, and News Corp publisher of the Wall Street Journal, according to the report.
The Murdoch family's shares in the companies he founded reside in a strictly managed trust.
Bryce Tom, a spokesperson for Murdoch, declined to comment. A representative for Hall did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Peace across the world has declined to the lowest level in 15 years as uncertainty over post-Covid economic recovery and Russia’s war in Ukraine loom large, according to the 16th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI). 
The report, produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) thinktank, said the rise in food and fuel costs have increased food insecurity and political instability globally, especially in south Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 
The average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.3 per cent in 2021, the report said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. Republican Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas used a hearing about toxic workplace culture to attack football star Tom Brady.
During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Wednesday, Fallon lashed out at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.
"Last week marked the anniversary of the scandal that led to Watergate, which led to felony convictions and the first resignation of a United States president," he said. "And a scant seven and a half years ago, another scandal rocked our nation threatening the very core and foundation of our republic, that being, of course, deflategate."
The congressman recalled the scandal "where in an AFC championship game, the NFL footballs, the pigskins, the rock, the pill, the hand egg, the melon and the leather was mysteriously underinflated by two PSI."
Fallon noted that the league eventually suspended Brady, referring to him by the nicknames "the GOAT, the California Cool, Real Slim Brady, the Master of the Tuck, the Lord of the Rings, Tom Terrific."
"Mr. Commissioner, I'm sure you're aware that many in New England worship Mr. Thomas Patrick Brady as a demigod of sorts," he continued. "My point here, sir, is this country simply can't afford another scandal, particularly a preventable one."
Fallon called on Goodell to change the NFL rules to "guarantee the consistency of the pressure of footballs."
The rant shocked sports reporter Ari Meirov.
"This hearing is off the rails," he wrote on Twitter.
One video of Fallon had nearly 40,000 views just hours after his remarks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A sweeping new law aimed at cracking down on Chinese forced labor could have significant — and unforeseen — ramifications for American businesses and consumers.
The law, which took effect on Tuesday, bars products from entering the United States if they have ties to Xinjiang, the far western region where Chinese authorities have carried out a massive repression on Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.
This could affect a wide range of products, including those using raw materials from Xinjiang or linked to the kind of Chinese labor and poverty reduction programs that the US government has deemed coercive – even if the finished product used only a tiny amount of material from Xinjiang somewhere along its journey.


The law, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — President Biden plans to ask Congress on Wednesday to temporarily suspend the federal gasoline taxan effort to mitigate soaring fuel prices that have stoked frustration across the United States.
In a speech on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden will ask Congress to lift federal taxes – about 18 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24 cents per gallon of diesel – until the end of September, just before the election in midterm in the fall, according to a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the announcement.  The president will also ask states to suspend their own gasoline taxes, hoping to ease the economic pain that has contributed to his waning popularity.
The White House will face an uphill battle to get Congress to approve the vacation, however.  While the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Brazilian former education minister accused of influence peddling, allegedly at the request of President Jair Bolsonaro, was arrested Wednesday, police and a defense lawyer said.
Milton Ribeiro resigned in March over allegations that he channeled public funds to allies of two influential Evangelical pastors at Bolsonaro's "special request."
Newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo revealed an audio recording of Ribeiro saying he gave priority in deciding school-funding requests to municipalities governed by "friends" of the pastors.
One mayor reportedly said he had been asked for a kilo of gold in exchange for having his school-funding request cleared.
The claims triggered calls from opposition lawmakers for Ribeiro and Bolsonaro to be investigated.
Bolsonaro, a conservative Catholic, won the presid…]]></summary>

UK Health Security Agency says evidence of limited community transmission of virus found in wastewater 
Public health officials have declared a national incident after routine surveillance of wastewater in north and east London found evidence of community transmission of poliovirus for the first time. 
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said waste from the Beckton sewage treatment works in Newham tested positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus in February and that further positive samples had been detected since. 
No cases of the disease or related paralysis have been reported, and the risk to the general public is considered low, but public health officials urged people to make sure that they and their families were up to date with polio vaccinations to reduce the risk of harm.

Scattered around Europe since Russia's invasion in February, life for top swimmers like Mykhailo Romanchuk whose father is "fighting on the eastern front" has been upended.
"Every morning he sends me (a message) that he is OK," said Romanchuk, 25, after winning a bronze medal in the 800m freestyle Tuesday.

* A powerful earthquake struck a rural, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more. 
* Officials warned that the toll may still rise. 
* Rescuers rushed to the area by helicopter, but the response is likely to be complicated since many international aid agencies left Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. 
A powerful earthquake struck a rugged, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing at least 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more in the country’s deadliest quake in two decades, the state-run news agency reported. Officials warned that the already grim toll may still rise.
In the remote area near the Pakistani border, residents searched for survivors and the dead by digging with their bare hands through the rubble of collapsed stone and mudbrick houses, according to footage shown by the news agency Bakhtar. 
It was not immediately clear if major rescue equipment was being sent — or even if it could reach the area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kate Bush, in a rare interview, has described her return to the top of the music charts as "quite shocking" after Netflix drama "Stranger Things" wowed a new generation of fans.
The much-loved British singer-songwriter also dwelt on her lockdown experience of binge-watching and gardening, and revealed that she prefers an old-style phone when out and about.
Bush's classic song "Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)" has surged to number one in Britain and elsewhere after featuring prominently, and movingly, in the fourth series of the sci-fi Netflix series set in the 1980s.
"It's such a great series, I thought that the track would get some attention," she told BBC radio in the interview, which was recorded Tuesday and broadcast Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Women will be allowed to take part in the main Viking-inspired torchlight procession on the remote Scottish island of Shetland for the first time next year, organizers said on Wednesday.
The committee in charge of the "Up Helly Aa" festival, which commemorates the end of the Christmas season, said that it was time to lift restrictions on women taking part in the traditionally male-only procession.
"The decision means the festival in Lerwick on Tuesday January 31, 2023 will have a different dimension to it, but we have no doubt that its essence and spirit will remain the same," committee secretary Robert Geddes said.
The event, which is popular among tourists, traditionally involved around 1,000 male participants known as guizers in Viking dress, dividing into squads to parade through the town.
The walk is led by the "Guizer Jarl" or "chief guizer", and culminates in the participants using their flaming torches to set ablaze a replica Viking longship.
The modern event, first held in 1881, is famous for its festive parties which often involve traditional Shetland dancing and copious alcohol consumption.
Rural "Up Helly Aa" processions on Shetland, which lies in the middle of the North Sea some 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Edinburgh, started allowing women to take part in 2015.
But the Lerwick committee stood firmly against allowing female participants to get involved in celebrating the island's Norse heritage.
"We felt that it was time to give squads a choice over their guizers, including allowing female participation," Geddes said.
The other criteria for participation -- that guizers be older than 16 and have lived in Shetland continuously for five years -- remains the same for the event, which has not been held since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The talks in Ankara between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan come one month before a visit to Riyadh by US president Joe Biden, for a regional summit focused on the energy crunch caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Erdogan's decision to revive ties with one of his biggest rivals is also driven in large part by economics and trade.
Turks' living standards are imploding one year before a general election that poses one of the biggest challenges of Erdogan's mercurial two-decade rule.

On the morning of December 19, 2015, the 54-year-old school monitor was napping at home in Longyearbyen, the main town in the Norwegian archipelago halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.
Suddenly, a mass of snow hurtled down from Sukkertoppen, the mountain overlooking the town, taking with it two rows of houses.
Selnes' home was swept away 80 meters (263 feet). The room where he was sleeping was completely demolished amid "a scraping sound like metal against a road".
To avoid being buried under the snow, he grabbed onto a ceiling lamp.

A powerful earthquake in Afghanistan killed more than 900 people and injured hundreds more on Wednesday, flattening homes and devastating entire villages in a nation already ravaged by decades of U.S.-led war and an ongoing economic collapse.
The earthquake, which hit overnight, had an estimated magnitude of 6.1 with an epicenter near the nation's border with Pakistan.
"The death toll is likely to rise as some of the villages are in remote areas in the mountains and it will take some time to collect details," said Salahuddin Ayubi, an official with the country's interior ministry, as disaster relief efforts continued.

"Another tarantula," says an operator as the Russian corvette of the Tarantul class becomes visible, traveling in a pack with other Russian vessels as several nearby NATO ships also criss-cross the placid northeastern European sea.
"It's busy down there," the soldier observes.
France's Atlantique 2 aircraft, in service since the 1980s to detect surface vessels and submarines, has been dispatched to track Russian and Russia-friendly ships, a task that became key after President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

The World Health Organization announced last week that it is "working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it causes."
Monkeypox's clades, which are different branches of the virus' family tree, have been particularly controversial because they are named after African regions.
Last year the WHO officially named Covid-19 variants after Greek letters to avoid stigmatizing the places where they were first detected.
Just days before the WHO announced it would change monkeypox's name, a group of 29 scientists wrote a letter saying there is an "urgent need for a non-discriminator…]]></summary>

Some 500 protesters among thousands who arrived in Quito from around the country in recent days were teargassed as they blockaded a street in the capital with burning tree branches.

William M. Arkin, Newsweek: Why Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky Won't Say Ukraine Is Winning the War 
Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky won't say it, and Vladimir Putin can't. But Ukraine is winning the war. 
Russian propaganda leaflets fluttered from the sky north of Kyiv last week. "They are trying to force you to defend the interests of others!" they declared, encouraging civilian to resist service in the military. The leaflets labeled the local regime "tycoons," "gangs" and "terrorists," claiming that the war-makers were serving only their own interests in fighting. 
One problem with these leaflets: they were addressed to "Citizens of the Chechen Republic!", intended for a different audience, from a different era, for a different war. Taken out of deep storage and shipped to Belarus, they were shot across the border by Soviet-era artillery, echoing an earlier time, representing a sloppy and uncoordinated war effort, speaking to no one.

WNU Editor: The above post is saying the complete opposite on what I see and know is happening in this war. In the current environment and taking into account what the West is providing to Ukraine I do not see a pathway for Ukraine to change the direction of the war. The only thing that will change the situation is a massive escalation in military support from the West to the Ukraine Army, and a complete imposition of sanctions on everything from Russia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden said he won't visit the Ukraine during his upcoming trip to Europe but he said he talks to President Volodymyr Zelensky three or four times a week   
CNN: Biden says it’s ‘not likely’ he will visit Ukraine on Europe trip  
President Joe Biden said Monday he is “not likely” to visit Ukraine when he travels to Europe for the Group of Seven summit and a meeting of NATO leaders later on this week. 
The President told reporters a stop in Ukraine is “not likely” on the upcoming trip, which will include stops in Germany and Spain. Biden said he does not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by adding a stop. 
On Saturday, Biden will travel to Schloss Elmau in southern Germany to attend the G7 Leaders’ Summit, a meeting that is expected to include a focus on Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine. 
On June 28, the President will travel to Madrid, Spain, for the 2022 NATO Summit – another alliance that has been aiding Ukraine amid Russia’s advancements.

DNYUZ/New York Times: After a Pivotal Period in Ukraine, U.S. Officials Predict the War’s Path 
WASHINGTON — When Russia shifted its military campaign to focus on eastern Ukraine this spring, senior officials in the Biden administration said the next four to six weeks of fighting would determine the war’s eventual path. 
That time has passed, and officials say the picture is increasingly clear: Russia is likely to end up with more territory, they said, but neither side will gain full control of the region as a depleted Russian military faces an opponent armed with increasingly sophisticated weapons. 
While Russia has seized territory in the easternmost region of Luhansk, its progress has been plodding.

WNU Editor: The narrative from American officials has definitely shifted in the past month on the Ukraine war. From being optimistic that Ukraine will persevere to one in which US officials are now pleading with their European allies to redouble their aid to Ukraine. 
Even President Biden has shifted his rhetoric. From calling for regime change in Moscow to now signaling that Ukraine must now compromise and sacrifice to end the war .... Biden says Ukraine might have to give Russia land in ‘negotiated settlement’ (NYPost).]]></summary>

The child of a wealthy Italian merchant, he had a playboy youth in the 12th century, went to war and spent a year in captivity.  He had mystical visions, stole from his disapproving father to give to the church, and dedicated himself to a life of poverty in imitation of Christ, founding a religious order.

Six years into the Taiwanese presidency of Tsai Ing-wen, tensions across the Taiwan Strait show no signs of abating.

Summit News: Ukraine Bans Main Opposition Party, Seizes All Its Assets 
‘Beacon of democracy’ cracks down on dissent.  Ukrainian authorities have banned the country’s main opposition party and seized all its assets, once again undermining the narrative that President Zelensky is presiding over a beacon of democracy. 
The country’s Ministry of Justice announced the move via Facebook, revealing that the Opposition Platform — For Life had been shut down and its assets, money and property transferred to the state. 
The party had previously had its operations suspended in March after it was accused of being complicit with Russia and being “anti-Ukrainian.” 
The ban means that Zelensky’s main political opposition has been eliminated. The OPPL was the second largest party in the country and its popularity surpassed that of Zelensky’s Servant of the People party last year. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The main opposition leader is under house arrest and facing treason charges (link here). To put it bluntly .... in today's Ukraine no dissent against the Zelensky government is permitted.
Ukraine is also attempting to extradite and imprison citizens who live in other European countries if they criticize Zelensky (link here).
