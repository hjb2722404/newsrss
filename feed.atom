The day before they left, two of the deceased, Robbie Phillips, 65, a travel consultant who was actually one of Sandals’ top salespeople, and her husband, Michael, 68, checked themselves into a medical facility complaining of nausea and vomiting, according to local authorities.  Donnis Chiarella, 65, who was staying on the other side of the wall, also visited a clinic, his son told ABC News.  All returned to their adjacent beachfront villas, where the Phillips and Ms Chiarella’s husband Vincent, 64, were found unresponsive the next morning according to local authorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since “Lemonade” (2016), her last solo studio album and accompanying film, Beyoncé has overwhelmed fans with a number of ambitious in-between projects.
In 2018, she performed as one of the headliners of the Coachella festival, where her show honored the tradition of historically black college and university marching bands, and was widely hailed as a triumph — one that “redirected its music, discarding its ties to pop and framing it squarely in a line of Southern black musical traditions,” as New York Times critic Jon Caramanica wrote.  The performance was later made into a Netflix special and an album, both titled “Homecoming.”
Also in 2018, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, her husband, released a joint album, “All is love” credited to the Carters.  And in June 2020, at the height of nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, she released a song, “Black Parade”, with lines like “Put your fist up, show black love.”
“Black Parade” won the Grammy Award the following year for Best R&B Performance, one of four prizes that night it took Beyoncé’s career to 28 – more than any other woman.  This year, Beyoncé was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song for “Be Alive,” from the movie “King Richard,” a biopic about Venus and Serena Williams’ father.
How the early leak will affect the commercial prospects of “Renaissance” remains unclear.  Years ago, the unauthorized release of music in advance could have devastating consequences for an album.  But that danger has been mitigated by the move to streaming.
And Beyoncé, like most other artists today, has taken advance orders for physical copies of her album, which will count on the charts as soon as they ship — usually the week of release.  On Beyoncé’s site, all four boxes of “Renaissance” and its limited-edition vinyl version are sold out.

The one-time president and long-time prime minister who now heads the national security council also posted two maps helpfully illustrating his argument.

Afghanistan is again facing risks of mass starvation in coming months as critical relief operations suffer substantial funding shortfalls. 
The World Food Program (WFP) says it faces a net funding shortage of $960 million to sustain humanitarian operations over the next six months. 
"Funding shortfalls and skyrocketing prices mean WFP has been forced to take hard decisions earlier this year to cut down activities to the bare minimum from June to August, temporarily focusing assistance on 10 million people who face the most urgent and life-threatening needs," Philippe Kropf, the WFP's head of communication in Afghanistan, told VOA.

Mr Biden said there will be “a lot of chatter” on Wall Street about whether the US is in recession but reassured people there are signs of “economic progression”. 

“Really the expectation of the US economy is not for strong growth, not for a strong rebound,” Mr Greenwood said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Thursday there was no deal yet with the United States on swapping detained U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner and a former Marine for an imprisoned Russian called by American prosecutors one of the world's most prolific arms dealers. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday the United States has made a "substantial offer" to Russia to release American citizens held in Russia. A source said that Washington was willing to exchange convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout, known as the "Merchant of Death." 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed surprise at the public remarks from Blinken. 
Russia has cautioned the United States that such discussions are best conducted in private.  "So far, there are no agreements in this area," Peskov told reporters in Moscow. "When discussing such topics, you don't conduct information attacks."

PKSOI: Semi Annual Lesson Reports: Defense Support to Stabilization (DSS)
The US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI) has released a two-volume collection on lessons learned for Defense Support to Stabilization or activities related to logistical support, supplies, and servicfes for federal agencies involved in stabilization activities. The Global Fragility Act of 2019 outlined a US strategy to prevent conflict and promote stability in countries identified by the Department of State in partnership with other federal agencies. Among those agencies is the Department of Defense (DOD) with its relatively new interagency support authority, the Defense Support to Stabilization, or DSS. This new authority allows DOD to provide logistical support, supplies and services to other federal agencies so that critical civilian expertise can be in place quickly and efficiently for a unity of effort that the interagency may have lacked in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We were briefed that over 75,000 Russians have either been killed or wounded, which is huge. You've got incredible amounts of investment in their land forces, over 80% of their land forces are bogged down, and they're tired,” @RepSlotkin told CNN. (h/t @MZanona @NatashaBertrand)
— Marshall Cohen (@MarshallCohen) July 28, 2022
   Business Insider: More than 75,000 Russian troops in Ukraine have been killed or injured, US says — one of the highest estimates so far 
* US officials think more than 75,000 Russians were killed or injured in Ukraine, reports said. 
* Estimates for Russian troop losses have varied, but this is one of the highest given so far. 
* Russia has not released its troop loss figures in months, and is accused of covering up its dead. 
US officials said that more than 75,000 Russians have been killed or injured as part of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to multiple reports. 
The figure would represent around half the total number of troops Russia sent to Ukraine at the start of its invasion. It is significantly higher than estimates US officials have given in public. 
CNN reporter Michael Cohen tweeted on Wednesday that Rep. Elissa Slotkin told CNN she and other House lawmakers had been given the 75,000 figure that day by US officials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[of ether (ETH) The 53% rally from July 13-18 gave the bulls an edge on July’s $1.26 billion monthly options expiration.  The move came as Ethereum developers set a tentative date for the “merger,” a transition out of the tedious proof-of-work (PoW) mining mechanism.

According to some analysts, by removing the additional issuance of ETH used to finance the energy cost required on traditional mining consensus, Ether could finally achieve “ultra-sound currency” status.

On Beacon Chain, the issuance will be around 1,600 ETH per day, which will significantly reduce inflation by 13,000 ETH per day on PoW. 
The merger sets the effects on the monetary policies of Ethereum to become ultrasonic money.

When Glenn Greenwald announced that he would host the premiere of a documentary on Alex Jones — and interviewing the infamous conspiracy theorist — many who once respected the famed investigative journalist lamented this new low in his career.
Greenwald retaliated in a series of tweets confusing the ‘damn stupid’ notion that journalists should refrain from interviewing bad people, pointing out that mainstream media journalists have no qualms about interviewing George W. Bush and his ilk.
Fair point.

The United States reported 4,639 known cases of monkeypox on Wednesday, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data – surpass The 3,738 Spanish cases for the highest tally in the world.  Globally, more than 20,600 cases have been confirmed in 77 countries.  Of that, more than 20,300 have been confirmed in countries that have never reported monkeypox infections.

In response to the increase in numbers, our government has issued a familiar appeal to the public.

And then I laughed, tickled by how easily Semans and his star, the charismatic Rebecca Hall, had persuaded me to invest in their crazy shenanigans.
But then Hall – as evidenced last year’s creepout, “The Night House” – has a knack for pumping gravity into somewhat bonkers narratives.  Here, she embodies Margaret, an executive in a sort of pharmaceutical outfit, and from the outset there is an intensity that borders on obsession.  Whether at work or as a protective single mother to her teenage daughter, Abbie (Grace Kaufman), Margaret is a calculated model of control.  Even her sex life is tig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Haiti gang violence: Gun battles rage in Port-au-Prince 
A war between Haitian gangs which has left hundreds dead since it flared up three weeks ago has spread to the centre of the capital, Port-au-Prince. 
Gang members engaged in a fierce gun battle with each other and with police on Wednesday. 
The city's temporary cathedral caught fire amid the fighting. 
It is not yet known how many people were killed in this latest battle but UN figures suggest more than 200 died between 8 and 17 July. 
Previously, the focal points of the battle between the G9 criminal alliance and a rival alliance calling itself G-Pèp had centred around the impoverished neighbourhood of Cité Soleil. But on Wednesday, video showed police confronting gang members not far from the presidential palace.

KYIV (Reuters) - The United States promised more military support for Ukraine, including drones, and is doing preliminary work on whether to send fighter aircraft, as fighting raged on in the east of the country five months into Russia's invasion.
Moscow and Kyiv signed a landmark deal on Friday to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports. However, representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the agreement ceremony in Istanbul, reflecting wider enmity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Friday's agreement as unlocking around $10 billion worth of grain exports, needed to ease a food crisis.

Petro, a 62-year-old economist who will become Colombia's first leftist leader next month, has been roundly critical of the U.S.-led war on drugs and was elected on promises to tackle deep inequality and climate change and to seek peace with remaining leftist rebels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General's office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
"Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense," said the statement.
"Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime."
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira's heart -- as a motive for the killing.

When the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, won a landslide victory in May, 2022, he went to visit the home of his mother Imelda, former first lady and wife of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
In a video showing mother congratulating son, one detail in Imelda’s opulent home stood out. On the wall, was a distinctive painting of an abstract nude rendered in blues and greens, on a red and orange bed. It was unmistakably Pablo Picasso’s “Femme Couchée VI”.

Lustosa wears no specialized suit or gloves, however, just a light net to cover his face. These bees are stingless.
"What a wonder!" Lustosa marvels at the honey-filled wax craters in the hive as the bees attack him furiously, but impotently -- his childlike amazement not diminished by six years working with the insects.
Long overlooked, Brazil's native bees are making a comeback, with people such as Lustosa, a 66-year-old public servant, getting in on the movement to boost their profile.
Of 550 stingless bee species known to exist in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world, some 250 are found in Brazil, according to Cristi…]]></summary>

One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury's website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO's plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the "reliability and transparency of its handling".
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
"For us they are part of the landscape," said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones "where there is fresh garbage," he added.

The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned "Iroojlaplap", or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a "Kailoojoj" in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.

Biden on Thursday insisted he was "doing great", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery," Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the "next ten days", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: "Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia and Ukraine are due Friday to sign an elusive agreement designed to resume grain shipments across the Black Sea for the first time since the Kremlin's invasion in February.
Here is what we know about the deal:
Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.
Its location in Istanbul is both a nod to Turkey's central location and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's key role in resolving a dispute which has often seemed to…]]></summary>

Authorities say police are investigating the killings, the worst of a series of brutal cases of cruelty to dogs.
But they face criticism from animal welfare activists who say laws defending domestic animals like dogs are not being enforced.
The latest killings took place at an industrial compound near the capital Doha on July 10, but the slaughter was only reported days later, activists told AFP.
Four men, two armed with hunting rifles, threatened guards at the factory and then killed 29 dogs and puppies, activists said. At least three others were wounded, including two in the late stages of pregnancy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of "I take care of Mexico," an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the "seriousness of the injuries" in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
"We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women's human rights and fight against gender-based violence," UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor's behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son's health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
"You're going to die," and "I'm going to burn you alive," the messages read.
"How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family," she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.]]></summary>
