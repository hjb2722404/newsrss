The state-owned company says the result was 200 per cent higher than their largest "annual historical profit", attributing their success to a "successful strategy" and government support.

Qatar CEO Akbar Al Baker says while competitors closed their routes, the airline adapted to "ever changing" travel restrictions and "never stopped flying".

“I read about this in the paper, that’s the information – the extent to which it has come at this point in time,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Australia. 

“I am going to NATO as a priority, because Australia is actually the largest non-NATO contributor to the efforts to support sovereignty in Ukraine,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recession is “not inevitable,” President Biden tells AP in an exclusive interview. Biden acknowledged Americans’ frustrations after a tumultuous two years of COVID and volatility in the economy, saying, “People are really, really down.” https://t.co/zo1Ntf77BM
— The Associated Press (@AP) June 16, 2022
   Daily Mail: Biden insists recession is NOT inevitable, admits Americans are 'really, really down' and 'need mental health' and calls Republican claims he caused inflation 'bizarre' in first press interview since February 10 
* Biden sat down with the AP, following a Feb. interview with NBC 
* He said Americans were 'really, really down'    * Said the need for mental health in the country has 'skyrocketed' 
* Comes amid his own low approval ratings and fears of a recession amid high inflation 
* The Fed board of governors raised rates by 75 basis points this week 
* He cited 3.6% unemployment rate as reason for optimism 
President Joe Biden said Americans are 'really, really down' amid record inflation and the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic – but said a recession is 'not inevitable.' 
He made the comments in a 30-minute sit down interview – his first formal sit-down since February, when he spoke to NBC and called interviewer Lester Holt a 'wise guy' over his inflation comments. 
This time, he said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by Republican lawmakers that last year's COVID-19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40-year high, calling that argument 'bizarre.'

VOA: EU, Egypt, Israel Agree to Export Israeli Liquified Natural Gas to Europe  
Cairo — Egypt, Israel and the European Union signed a gas deal Wednesday in which Egypt will export Israeli liquified natural gas to Europe via two Egyptian LNG plants. 
The memorandum of understanding was inked at the East Mediterranean Gas Forum in Cairo, expanding upon gas cooperation among the three partners. 
Representatives of participants at the gas forum applauded announcement of the deal. Egypt is the only country in the gas forum to have plants that can produce liquified natural gas.

WNU Editor: This is just a memorandum of understanding. It will be years before Israeli natural gas finds its way to Europe. And even then it may not happen. Israeli officials have made it very clear in the past that the priority customer for this natural gas will be Israel itself.

VOA: UN: Record Numbers Displaced by War, Persecution 
Geneva — A record 89.3 million people had been driven from their homes by war, violence, persecution, and human rights abuse by the end of 2021, up 8% from the previous year, according to the U.N. refugee agency’s annual Global Trends report. 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi says the figures are made even worse when the number of people forced to flee by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is included. 
"Ukraine has displaced anyway between 12 and 14 million people, depending on how you count them. So, the figure has exceeded 100 million. This is due to a rise in conflict and crisis," he said.

Morgenthau bought the co-op, located at 64 E. 86th St. with his wife and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Lucinda Franks, in 1996 — and remained there until his death.  Franks died in May 2021 – and the house is being sold by their estate.
Morgenthau held this position from 1975 until his retirement in 2009. He died in 2019, just 10 days shy of his 100th birthday.

Insider: Russia's former president says Ukraine might not 'even exist on the world map' in 2 years 
* Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president, says Ukraine might not exist in two years. 
* Medvedev, a Putin ally, is gaining a lot of attention over his bombastic Telegram posts. 
* Russia has been accused by Biden, among others, of committing genocide in Ukraine. 
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev made another bombastic statement on Telegram on Wednesday, suggesting that Ukraine might not exist in two years amid Russia's military offensive in the country. 
Medvedev was posting about Ukraine seeking liquefied natural gas from the US under a lend-lease plan that would see it pay Washington back in two years. 
The former Russian leader — a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — apparently is not a fan of this proposal, which comes as Europe vies to end its reliance on Russian energy in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

CNBC: The West’s unity over Ukraine could be starting to crack, just as Russia’s invasion gains ground 
* Western unity over the war in Ukraine is becoming more vulnerable as the conflict drags on.

After a three-year shutdown for repairs and upgrades, the collider has resumed firing protons — the bare innards of hydrogen atoms — around its 17-mile underground electromagnetic racetrack.  In early July, the collider will begin to smash these particles together to create sparks of primordial energy.
And so the great game of chasing the secret of the universe is about to resume, amid new developments and renewed hopes from particle physicists.  Even before its renovation, the collider had hinted that nature might hide something spectacular.

He finds it every time he sets out on Buffalo Bayou, a slow-moving river that runs through the nation’s fourth-largest city and heads toward its port.  And so it was on a recent sweltering morning when he and his longtime deckhand Trey Dennis headed on a small barge to a boom they had put on the water the day before.
“Ah, isn’t that nice,” said Bayou Dave, whose real name is David Rivers, as the boom took shape.
What they sought and knew they would find was cradled in the massive embrace of the boom: a vast jumble of swirling trash.


There was a toy plane, a yellow soccer ball, a foam egg carton, and a pink nail salon flip-flop.  There were takeout containers, disposable toothpicks and foam cups from 7-11 and Chick-fil-A.  …]]></summary>

He was 78 years old.
The cause was multiple health issues, her daughter Silvie Jensen said.
Good American Pinot Noir was rarely seen in 1972, when Mr. Jensen, in love with French Burgundy, the source of the world’s great Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays, set out to produce his own version in California.  With few exceptions, most American Pinot Noirs of the time were straightforward and fruity at best;  more often than not, these were hot central valley stews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese Premier Xi Jinping has signed a directive that permits 'the legal basis for troops to carry out military operations other than war', such as peacekeeping operations, disaster relief and humanitarian efforts, but could be used as a cover for an invasion of Taiwan   
Daily Mail: Is China gearing up for Putin-style 'special operation'? Fears for Taiwan as Xi signs directive allowing for 'non-war' use of military in echo of tactic used by Russia before Ukraine invasion 
* Xi Jinping signed directive allowing military to be used for 'non-war' purposes 
* It is feared it could lead to an invasion of Taiwan similar to invasion of Ukraine 
* Taiwan has threatened Beijing with its new cruise missile in event of an attack 
* Beijing is on a collision course with Australia over bases on the Solomon Islands 
China could be taking a leaf out of Russia's playbook by trialing a new directive which would expand the use of its burgeoning military for 'non-war' purposes. 
The directive, signed by President Xi Jinping, raises concerns Beijing could be paving the way for an invasion of Taiwan under the misnomer of a 'special military operation'. 
Coming in into effect on Wednesday, the directive could provide Beijing with the cover it needs to launch an assault on Taipei without the legal complications or international condemnation that comes with declaring war.

Newsweek: U.S. Nuclear Weapons Spending Compared to China and Russia 
Last year, the world's nine nuclear-armed states—the U.S., Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea—spent $82.4 billion collectively on their nuclear arsenals, a new report by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has revealed. 
That's an inflation-adjusted increase of approximately $6.5 billion from the previous year, where these countries had collectively spent $76 billion on their nuclear arsenal, according to ICAN. 
This increase in spending shows that despite a general ongoing trend of declining nuclear inventories, the nuclear-armed states have continued to invest in modernizing and improving their nuclear arsenals, as well as funding companies and think tanks writing about nuclear policies to support these huge spending budgets. 
The U.S. tops the ICAN's list of nuclear spending for 2021, with $44.2 billion spent on its nuclear weapons.

* Joe Biden spoke to Ukraine's Volodomyr Zelensky for 41 minutes on Wednesday 
* He told him he was sending another billion dollars in military assistance 
* It is believed to include anti-ship missile systems, rockets and artillery shells 
* It brings the US military aid total to more than $5.5 billion since Russia invaded 
* And it comes amid warnings that Ukraine is struggling to keep up with the pace of Russia's long-range shelling and rocket strikes in a new phase of the war 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced he was sending another one billion dollars in military support to Ukraine, after its leaders pleaded for more ammunition to help fight off the Russian invasion. 
The latest package will include anti-ship missile systems, artillery rockets, and rounds for howitzers, people familiar with the packages said. 
It means the U.S. has now delivered more than $5.5 billion of military support since Russia invaded more than 110 days ago.

But the exchanges are made and the players retire.  Injuries happen, and so do upsets.  The postseason game is a grueling glove to run, and it just keeps growing.  Winning a third straight title is one of the toughest feats in team sports, and it seems to be getting harder and harder.

(Bloomberg) -- Two giant Wall Street banks are withdrawing from handling trades of Russian debt after the Biden administration’s surprise announcement last week it’s banning US investors from scooping up such assets. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were still matching sellers who wanted out of the debts with interested buyers this month, according to market professionals. Now, JPMorgan is pulling back after the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said investors in the U.S. aren’t allowed to acquire them, a person with knowledge of the decision said. A spokesperson for Goldman said it’s halting such transactions, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don Perkins, a six-time Pro Bowl running back with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960s, died Thursday.  He was 84 years old.
The Cowboys and the University of New Mexico, where Perkins was a standout player before his professional career, announced the death.  No announcement said where he died, and none cited the cause.
Perkins rushed for 6,217 yards in 107 games with the Cowboys from 1961 to 1968. He is fourth on the team’s career list behind two Pro Football Hall of Famers – Emmitt Smith, the career leader of the NFL, and Tony Dorsett – and the current Cowboys.  running back, Ezekiel Elliott.  Perkins’ 42 rushing touchdowns rank fifth in team history.


While originally drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the ninth round of the 1960 draft, Perkins had already signed a personal services contract with the expansion Cowboys.  Dallas won its rights after sending the Colts a ninth-round draft pick.


Perkins missed the Cowboys’ inaugural season in 1960 with a broken foot.  He ran for 815 yards in 1961 and finished third in voting for NFL Rookie of the Year, behind Mike Ditka and Fran Tarkenton.  He had a career-high 945 rushing yards in 1962.


Donald Anthony Perkins was born on March 4, 1938 in Waterloo, Iowa.  He played for New Mexico from 1957 to 1959 and captained the team in its final two seasons.  The Lobos’ coach at the time, future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, said Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached.
Perkins returned to the Albuquerque area after his professional football career ended.  He then worked as a television and radio football analyst.


Information about survivors was not immediately available.
“Don is one of the greatest Lobos, and certainly one of the greatest football players to play for UNM,” New Mexico athletic director Eddie Nuñez said.  “He came back to New Mexico and worked for the state and was a tremendous ambassador for so many people.”

GENEVA (Reuters) - Any Chinese military attack on Taiwan would have a greater impact on global trade flows than the Ukraine war, Taipei's top trade negotiator told Reuters on Tuesday, saying it would lead to a shortage of semiconductor chips. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February has triggered commodity price hikes and food export bans, leading to fears of famine in poorer countries. 
John Deng said that, were China to attack Taiwan, the potential disruptions could be worse, citing the world's reliance on Taiwan for chips used in electric vehicles and mobile phones.

🇹🇼Taiwan’s legislative speaker reveals its mass produced supersonic cruise missiles, Yun Fong, are capable to attack Beijing.https://t.co/Y0q3ewVGw3

   Warzone/The Drive: Taiwan Official Warns Supersonic Cruise Missile Can Strike Beijing 
As China’s hostility intensifies, a top Taiwanese official warns that the Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile can reach out and touch Beijing. 
You Si Kun, President of Taiwan’s Legislative Assembly, or Yuan, gave a speech on Taiwan Overseas Network where he declared that the country’s domestically produced Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile is capable of reaching Beijing. The message follows ominous warnings made by Chinese military officials directly to their U.S. counterparts to avoid the Taiwan Strait, claiming it is not international waters. However, the United States, along with the vast majority of the international community, does not accept China’s claims in this regard. This also comes as U.S. President Joe Biden recently vowed to defend Taiwan amid a crisis, although the statement was walked back to a degree, leaving allies to question how a crisis could pan out.

Insider: The US Navy's plan to ditch its cruisers will leave it out of a small and well-armed club 
* The US Navy is trying to retire all of its guided-missile cruisers by 2027. 
* US cruisers are specialized for air defense and are among the best-armed naval ships in service. 
* Lawmakers are dismayed by the Navy plan, believing it will reduce US firepower as China's navy grows.
In April, the US Navy presented an ambitious plan to decommission all 22 of its Ticonderoga-class cruisers by 2027.  The move is not surprising. 
The Navy has tried to rid itself of its cruisers for years, but Congress has consistently rejected its proposals, largely out of concern that decommissioning them would take away a much-needed weapon as China's naval force continues to grow. 
With the retirement of the last battleships nearly 20 years ago, cruisers are the largest surface combatants — a category that generally doesn't include aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships — in service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The University of Tennessee has been widely hailed as the best college baseball team in a generation.  But like so many top seeds over the years, the Volunteers couldn’t navigate the NCAA baseball playoffs and were eliminated without even qualifying for the eight-team University World Series.
The playoffs started well for Tennessee.  After a 53-7 regular season and a Southeastern Conference title and No. 1 ranking, Tennessee was swept away by lesser competition in the early rounds.
But he met surprising opposition from Notre-Dame in the super regional, the round of 16 stage.
Notre Dame was one of the best unranked teams in the tournament, but they weren’t expected to beat a Tennessee team which had a home batting host and the best ERA in Division I. Tennessee also had the advantage of play…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Russian court on Tuesday extended the pretrial detention of WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner on drug trafficking charges until July 2, pushing her stay in prison beyond four months, according to the official TASS news agency.
The Moscow region Khimki court granted the 18-day extension at the request of investigators, the agency said citing the court’s press service.  It is typical for Russian courts to prolong detention several times until trial.  Ms Griner’s lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The American basketball star was arrested four months ago after Russian officials said they found vape cartridges containing traces of hash oil in her luggage as she walked through Sheremetyevo airport, the Moscow’s main international airport.  The charge carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.


Ms Griner was arrested on February 17, a week before Russia invaded Ukraine, but authorities did not reveal she was detained until days after the war began, raising fears that not be used as a bargaining chip in the global crisis.  There has been speculation that once convicted, Ms Griner could be part of a prisoner swap with the United States.


Two-time Olympic gold medalist Ms. Griner plays for the Phoenix Mercury and US officials meet with the team on Monday to discuss efforts to secure his release.  In May, the State Department said it determined Ms Griner had been “wrongfully detained.”
When taken into custody, Ms Griner was returning to Russia to perform for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team.  Many WNBA players supplement their income the league’s off-season playing internationally.

OilPrice.com: Libya Loses 1.1 Million Bpd As It Shuts Down Nearly All Its Oil Fields 
Libya is losing oil production at the rate of 1.1 million barrels daily, the country’s oil minister Mohammed Aoun has said, adding that almost all of the country’s oil fields were shut down. 
Libya’s largest field, El Sharara, was shut down last month along with El Feel, with reports saying that it was groups affiliated with the eastern parliament that shut down oil production, among them the Libyan National Army of Halifa Khaftar. 
According to Aoun, however, “it appears that the closure instructions were issued by an official body, the Petroleum Facilities Guard in the closure areas.”

OilPrice.com: Freeport LNG Not Expected To Resume Full Operations Until Late 2022 
Freeport LNG will not resume full operations at its liquefication plant on Quintana Island until the end of this year, according to the company’s Tuesday press release. 
While China’s LNG demand may be calming the hot LNG market, news that Freeport LNG’s Texas plant will not resume full operations until late 2022 may upset the market. 
“At this time, completion of all necessary repairs and a return to full plant operations is not expected until late 2022,” Freeport LNG said, adding that partial operations could be resumed within 90 days.

A part of me wonders if this was a Russian cyber attack to send a message to Europe? The timing for this shutdown is just too perfect.

France 24: Macron calls for French budget defence boost in 'war economy' 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday called for a boost to defence budgets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying France was now on a "war economy" footing. 
Speaking at Eurosatory, a weapons industry fair, Macron said Europe needed "a much larger defence industry" to avoid relying on suppliers elsewhere for its equipment needs. 
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, France "has entered into a war economy in which I believe we will find ourselves for a long time".

Washington Post: For Ukrainian troops, a need arises: Javelin customer service 
The Ukrainians had an urgent problem. Their Javelin missile launchers — sophisticated, finicky gear each costing six figures — were inoperable and no one in their unit could fix them. 
They sought help from two Americans, who engineered a fix for one by cannibalizing electrical components from a video game controller, said Mark Hayward, a U.S. Army veteran and volunteer trainer. 
The others, he said, were thought to be broken until it was discovered that the user instructions had gotten gummed up in Google Translate. 
Hayward recalled the episode with profound frustration that the Pentagon, which has rushed more than 5,000 Javelins to Ukraine, hasn’t done more to ensure that those battling Russian forces have help when such needs arise.

Pope Francis on June 14 asserted that World War III had already commenced, referring to the conflicts that have been taking place across the world in recent months. 
The pontiff went on to say that "we see" what is occurring in Ukraine in a different light because it is closer to us and pricks our senses more, however, "no one cares" about the fights taking place in parts of Africa, northern Nigeria, northern Congo, and Myanmar.

WNU Editor: I was surprised at the appearance of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at today's NATO meeting (see above). As a former politician, diplomat, and now leader of NATO, he knows that it is a rule for people in these positions to always look clean shaven, neat, and sharp looking. 
He definitely did not look like that today. In fact, he looked like shit. His tie was crooked, hair was messed-up, and this is the first time that I have seen him unshaven. 
Optics and perception is important to political leaders like Jens Stoltenberg. They always take the time to look good. My gut tells me that he is becoming stressed by the Russia - Ukraine war, or more to the point, the intelligence that he has access to is painting a very grim picture on what is really happening in eastern Ukraine. 
Long meetings. Continuous bad news. NATO members with their own agendas. Keeping a unified message among the alliance. It looks like being clean-cut for the cameras was not the priority for Jens Stoltenberg's at today's meeting.]]></summary>

Ukraine is thought to have struck a military base 40 miles inside Russia in an early-morning missile attack.  Footage showed what appeared to be a missile trail in the sky over the town of Klintsy early Tuesday, accompanied by a plume of smoke rising from a nearby base. 
Troops and helicopters then arrived to inspect what appeared to be a bomb crater, as local Telegram channels reported a fire spreading to a nearby apartment block.

Russian forces have destroyed the last bridge linking the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk to a Ukrainian held city on the other side of the river, cutting off all routes of evacuation for those remaining in the city, a Ukrainian official said on Monday evening. 
Sergei Gaidai, the governor of Lugansk, said on social media that some 70% of Sievierodonetsk was now under Russian control, describing the situation for Ukrainian soldiers holding out in the city as "difficult, but under control". 
At the same time, the destruction of the last bridge across the river to the twin city of Lysychansk meant that it was impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies, he said, nor remove any civilians still in Sievierodonetsk.

Wall Street Journal: Ukraine Has Begun Moving Sensitive Data Outside Its Borders  
Some government databases are already on cloud servers in Poland, and officials are negotiating similar arrangements with France, Estonia and several other nations 
Ukrainian government officials have begun storing sensitive data outside the country to protect it from Russian cyber and physical assault, and are negotiating with several European nations to move more databases abroad. 
Since the start of the war, around 150 registries from different government ministries and offices, or backup copies of them, have been moved abroad or are in discussions to be transferred, said George Dubinskiy, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. 
Previously, much of the government’s information trove was held in data centers in Ukraine, and needed first to be moved to the cloud before backup copies could be transferred, he said. 
The government prioritized important databases to move from old legacy data-storage systems, and created copies of those registries for storage in clouds outside Ukraine, he said. 
“To be on the safe side, we want to have our backups abroad,” Mr. Dubinskiy said.  Moving databases to the cloud adds a layer of security because government officials can still access it even if a data center in Ukraine were demolished by Russian weapons, he said. 
The government specified legal and security provisions to help protect the databases from cyber and other threats, he added.

CNN: US expects announcements of more weapons to Ukraine in meeting of nearly 50 countries 
Brussels CNN  — The US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages to be sent to Ukraine to help in its fight against Russia at a meeting of nearly 50 countries in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a senior US defense official. 
Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonetsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting recently. 
Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials have said it will be increasingly difficult to halt Russia’s incremental progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. 
“We hear what they’re saying, we absolutely hear what they’re saying,” said the senior defense official, who spoke of the “urgency” of the Ukraine Contact Group meeting Thursday in Brussels.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) -Armed men killed at least 100 civilians in a rural district of northern Burkina Faso close to the border with Niger over the weekend, a security source said. 
The attackers targeted men but appeared to spare women and children in Seytenga district on Saturday night, the security source and two other sources said, all speaking on condition of anonymity. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the assault happened in borderlands where militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are waging an insurgency.

VOA: Ethiopia PM Says Committee Created to Negotiate With Tigray Forces 
Addis Ababa — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has announced the formation of a committee to begin peace talks with Tigray forces after 18 months of war. 
Abiy spoke to parliament on Tuesday about the conflict in comments broadcast on state television.  “We need to repeat the victory that we made on the battlefield in peace talks,” he said adding that the war is hindering the country’s development. “Every bullet that is shot is like a dollar lost.”
Abiy said that the committee would be led by Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen and would be given 10 to 15 days to decide what will be up for negotiation.

Issue may derail alliance summit as Ankara digs in on accusation that Nordic countries harbour terrorists 
Turkey has said it is willing to delay Swedish and Finnish membership of Nato for more than a year unless it receives satisfactory assurances that the two Nordic countries are willing to address support for Kurdish groups it regards as terrorist organisations. 
Finland’s prime minister said on Tuesday that the two nations’ Nato applications could stall if the issue is not resolved before a vital Nato summit due to start in Madrid on 29 June.
