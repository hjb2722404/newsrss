        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breitbart: Report: Biden Administration Tried to Hide Chinese Spy Balloon from American Public 
The Biden administration was aware of the Chinese spy balloon entering United States airspace on January 28 but tried to hide its existence from the American people until being forced to go public, according to a report on Saturday.
Bloomberg News reported that the Biden administration was “well aware” that the balloon had entered U.S. airspace on Saturday, January 28, but decided to keep quiet about it so as not to ruin a planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China. 
The outlet reported:     
As it turns out, US authorities were well aware of the unidentified object that had entered American airspace on Jan. 28, that had then left and re-entered over North Idaho on Tuesday. But with such a high-profile trip at stake, keeping it on the down-low was key. 
However, on Wednesday, February 1, a Billings, Montana, resident spotted the balloon around 5:30 p.m. local time, and the next day, a local Montana paper published a report about it. Later that day, late Thursday afternoon, the Pentagon finally confirmed the existence of the balloon. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: It was only when the local public media started to report on the balloon that the Pentagon was finally forced to respond. So yes. It does look like this was a situation where some, at least in the Pentagon, wanted this story to not be made public for as long as possible.   
Update: This is a must read post from Bloomberg on the White House's response to this Chinese "spy" balloon .... From China to Big Sky: The Balloon That Unnerved the White House (Bloomberg).   
Update #2: Michael Ramirez is brutal (see below).]]></summary>

    EurAsian Times: Israel Identifies ‘3000 Targets’ Inside Iran To Strike Its Critical Military Infra – French Media Report 
Iran recently accused its fiercest rival and adversary in the region, Israel, of a drone attack on its military facility and vowed retaliation for the incident. In contrast, Israel is allegedly planning to stitch an anti-Iran military coalition to wipe our Iranian nukes. 
Corresponding with Iran’s ferocious warning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began his first visit to France after he returned to power. As speculated, the interaction between the two countries leaders was dominated by the Iranian question. 
French President Emmanuel Macron denounced Iran’s “headlong race” to build its nuclear program following a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu at the Élysée Palace. This is significant as recent local French media reports have claimed that Israeli outreach to France is part of a plot to stitch an anti-Iran military coalition.

Such a conflict will result in the immediate closure of the Straits of Hormuz to oil traffic, and a loss of almost a quarter of the world's oil production.
$300/barrel for oil and the economic shock-waves that such a war would unleash is something that the West is unprepared for. I also sense that there is no Western public appetite to get involved in such a conflict, nor any real political will.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's ex-president, dies aged 79 
Pakistan's former president General Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a coup in 1999, has died aged 79. 
The former leader - who was president between 2001 and 2008 - died in Dubai after a long illness, a statement from the country's army said. 
He had survived numerous assassination attempts, and found himself on the front line of the struggle between militant Islamists and the West. 
He supported the US "war on terror" after 9/11 despite domestic opposition.  In 2008 he suffered defeat in the polls and left the country six months later. 
When he returned in 2013 to try to contest the election, he was arrested and barred from standing. 
He was charged with high treason and was sentenced to death in absentia only for the decision to be overturned less than a month later. 
He left Pakistan for Dubai in 2016 to seek medical treatment and had been living in exile in the country ever since.

CIA Director William Burns said Thursday that the next six months would be "critical" in the war in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin betting that waning Western interest and "political fatigue" could afford his military a new chance at making battlefield gains. 
"Putin, I think, is betting right now that he can make time work for him," Burns said. "The key is going to be on the battlefield in the next six months, it seems to us." 
"Puncturing Putin's hubris, making clear that he's not only not going to be able to advance further in Ukraine, but as every month goes by, he runs a greater and greater risk of losing the territory that he's illegally seized from Ukraine so far," he continued. "So this next period, I think, is going to be absolutely crucial."

Russia and Ukraine on February 4 announced an exchange of prisoners that led to the release of 63 Russians and 116 Ukrainians and the return of the bodies of two foreign volunteers who were involved in humanitarian work in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. 
The Russian Ministry of Defense reported the return of its 63 Russian soldiers in a statement on its Telegram channel. The statement said that among those released were persons belonging to a "sensitive category," without elaborating. 
It added that the exchange was facilitated "thanks to the mediation of the leadership of the United Arab Emirates." 
Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, reported that 116 prisoners had returned home.

The Trump impeachment figure is raising money to help with vehicle and weapons repairs on the front lines. 
A group of former military officers and private donors is raising money to send Western mechanics close to the Ukrainian frontlines, where they will repair battle-damaged donated weapons and vehicles that have been flooding into the country. 
Leading the group is a familiar name in American politics: Alexander Vindman. 
The retired Army officer played a central role in then-President Donald Trump’s first impeachment hearings by testifying about the president’s 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy. During the call, Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate the son of then-candidate Joe Biden, Hunter, and his business ties in the country, and was accused of using U.S. military assistance as a lever.

* On Saturday, the US military shot down the Chinese spy balloon 
* It's the first time a foreign aircraft has been shot down over America since WWII 
* In July 1942, a Japanese jet was shot down over the Akutan Islands in Alaska 
The downing of the Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday marked the first time that the US military has shot down a foreign aircraft over American soil since World War II. 
A military fighter aircraft shot down the floating drone as it flew six nautical miles out over the Atlantic ocean on Saturday, drawing to a close a dramatic saga that shone a spotlight on worsening Sino-U.S. relations. 
 'We successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,' President Joe Biden said. Biden said he had issued an order on Wednesday to take down the balloon, but the Pentagon had recommended waiting until it could be done over open water.

President Erdoğan is blocking the quick membership addition of Sweden and Finland to the alliance.
 This July, NATO will meet for a key summit in Lithuania, a chance to get leaders together and showcase the alliance’s strength and renewed sense of purpose against the backdrop of Russia’s war against Ukraine. And NATO wants to do this in one very specific way: by welcoming two longtime holdouts, Sweden and Finland, into NATO. 
Except right now, Turkish President Recep Erdoğan is threatening to spoil it all.
Erdoğan, specifically, is raising new objections to the ascension of Finland and …]]></summary>

President Joe Biden is planning to shoot down the Chinese spy balloon over the Atlantic so that it can be captured and studied, a senior source has revealed. 
The aircraft was tracking towards the Carolinas this morning and is due to exit the east coast by noon after passing over a sensitive nuclear missile site in Montana dubbed America's 'Doomsday Base'.
The White House decided against shooting the balloon down over home soil amid fears for American lives and sparking an international incident, a senior US official said.

WNU Editor: Is this President Biden's "Sputnik moment"? .... Biden’s ‘Sputnik moment’: Is China’s spy balloon political warfare? (The Hill). This hurts President Biden because it takes him away from his messaging, and if this balloon is still floating above the US on Tuesday, it will be a diversion when he gives his "Speech on the Union" on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON — The number of Russian troops killed and wounded in Ukraine is approaching 200,000, a stark symbol of just how badly President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion has gone, according to American and other Western officials.

CNN: China and Russia are as close as ever, and that’s a problem for the US 
 Hong Kong CNN  — When Antony Blinken makes an expected trip to Beijing in the coming days for what would be the first visit to China by a US secretary of state since 2018, he will be cutting a stark contrast to the scene in the Chinese capital one year earlier. 
Then, Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for the opening of the Beijing Olympics – meeting for talks and dinner in Putin’s honor, and declaring a “no limits” partnership between the two neighbors. 
Weeks later, as Russian tanks rolled across the border into Ukraine starting an invasion that would devastate the country and cause a humanitarian crisis, Chinese leaders did not shrink from that declaration. 
Though Beijing claimed impartiality in the conflict and no advance knowledge of Russia’s intent, it also refused to condemn Moscow. Instead, it parroted Kremlin lines blaming NATO for provoking the conflict – further fracturing relationships with both Europe and the US.

WNU Editor: As long as I can remember a cornerstone of US foreign policy was to make sure that Russia and China never developed close ties, and to exploit the differences between the two. 
That was then. 
Today I see little if any differences between Russia and China, and a lot of common ground. The common ground is economic, security, and little if any trust of the U.S. and its allies.   I expect this "alliance" to continue to grow, and it will grow with other like-minded countries trough BRICS.]]></summary>

EurAsian Times: US Gets Access To 9 Military Bases In The Philippines; China Warns Manila Of Being ‘Dragged Into Troubled Waters’ 
With the US military steadily securing expanded access to critical military sites in the Philippines, China has warned this could lead to the Philippines being taken advantage of and dragged into troubled waters. 
Amid mounting concern over China’s increasing assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea and tension over self-ruled Taiwan, the US military managed to secure access to four additional bases in the Philippines. 
The United States already had access to five military bases in the Philippines.  The US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Philippines’ Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez said in a joint news conference at the Philippine military headquarters in Manila that the United States would be given access to four more bases under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).

Washington Post: Brazil sinks decommissioned aircraft carrier in face of contamination fears 
RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s navy said Friday night that it had carried out a “planned and controlled” operation to sink a decommissioned aircraft carrier nearly 220 miles off its coast — despite the objections of environmentalists and some government officials who argued that it contained toxic materials that could contaminate the ocean. 
The navy said in a statement that the operation to sink the São Paulo, a Clemenceau-class carrier, was carried out with the necessary technical competencies and safety measures in “order to avoid logistical, operational, environmental and economic losses to the Brazilian state.” 
Despite those assurances, it was a near certainty that not everyone would see it that way. Shipbreaking Platform, a coalition of nonprofits that advocates for the safe recycling of ships, said last week that a controlled sinking would “equate to a state-sponsored environmental crime.”

USNI News: U.S. Destroyer Operating Near the Black Sea for First Time Since Russia Invaded Ukraine 
USS Nitze (DDG-94) stopped on the edge of the Bosphorus Strait, on its way to make a port call in Turkey, USNI News understands. It’s the closest a U.S. warship has been to the Ukraine-Russia war since it started nearly a year ago. 
Nitze was seen by ship spotters at the lower edge of the strait on Friday. Turkey closed the Bosphorus Strait to warships on Feb. 28, 2022, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine. Since the closure, only warships with ports on the Black Sea, which includes Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and Turkish ships, can enter. 
The last American warship to transit the strait was USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51), which left the Black Sea on Dec. 15, 2021. The ship entered the Black Sea in November 2021 following a port visit in Bulgaria, USNI News previously reported.

Reuters: U.S. President Biden to Visit Poland -Polish President's Adviser 
WARSAW (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will visit Poland, the Polish president's foreign policy adviser said on Saturday. 
"We already know for sure that President Joe Biden will respond positively to President Duda's invitation and will come to Poland," Marcin Przydacz said on public TV. 
"We have agreed with the American side that we will announce the date of this visit in due course, but I can assure that it will be sooner rather than later," he added. 
Przydacz said that preparations are underway for the visit which "meets the expectations of both the White House and the expectations of the Polish side".  "But for us it will be very important and crucial to continue supporting Poland's security ...," he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: ANOTHER Chinese spy balloon spotted over the sky - this time in Latin America, Pentagon has confirmed the second balloon but says it is not heading towards the United States 
* The Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon was spotted flying over Latin America after a similar craft was seen flying over the US 
* Officials said the second balloon is not heading into America as it rejected China's claim that the balloon was a civilian ship that flew off course 
* After flying over Montana, home to US nuclear silos, the first balloon has reported flying further south in Missouri 
The Pentagon said another Chinese spy balloon has been spotted in the West on Friday, this time hovering over Latin America. 
Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said reports showed 'a balloon transiting Latin America,' confirming that it was another Chinese surveillance balloon like the one spotted flying over Montana and Missouri. 
Images from Central and South America of a balloon flying in the sky claim that the surveillance craft was somewhere over Costa Rica before reaching Venezuela.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic's presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society's political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination," Murangira said.
"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB."
"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime."
Rwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children's hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.
The vast majority of children are suffering from "moderate to severe malnutrition," complicated by other ailments including pneumonia, malaria and the stomach flu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the "toxicity" of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, "and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes", Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was "now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire", Cumming said.
"So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!"
The queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man was crushed to death by a "telescopic" urinal in central London on Friday, despite the efforts of ambulance crews, an air ambulance and firefighters.
Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London's West End, the city's theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a "telescopic urinal" when he became trapped, police said.
"We're sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene," Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
"Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration," said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence," added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a "quagmire."
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran's government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
"The victim publicized (the) Iranian government's human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution," Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, "highly dangerous" and a "propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology".
"You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you," Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS," he wrote. "SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!"
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES," Trump said. "Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!"
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a "genius" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.]]></summary>

Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
"Before encountering Earth, the asteroid's orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth's orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun," NASA said in a statement. "After its encounter, the asteroid's orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth's and Mars' orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days."
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Egypt unveiled Thursday a gold-laced mummy and four tombs, including of an ancient king's "secret keeper", discovered in the Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.
The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, "decorated with scenes of daily life," belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.
It was found in the pyramid complex of Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty, who reigned some 4,30…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Danish government's plan to abolish a public holiday to help fund the defense budget amid the war in Ukraine is putting Denmark's cherished welfare model at risk, the country's biggest trade union warned.
"It's a big threat to the Danish model", said Lizette Risgaard, the head of the FH union which has 1.3 million members in a country of 5.9 million inhabitants.
"Politicians should stay out of labour market issues. If they go through with this they'll be imposing their will and violate our agreements", she thundered in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.
The left-right government coalition in power since December, headed by Social Democratic Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, plans to scrap the religious holiday known as "Great Prayer Day", observed since the 17th century.
