Reuters: From war to wild weather, global crop problems point to years of high food prices 
(Reuters) - Eric Broten had planned to sow about 5,000 acres of corn this year on his farm in North Dakota, but persistent springtime rains limited him to just 3,500 in a state where a quarter or more of the planned corn could remain unsown this year. 
The difficulty planting corn, the single largest grain crop in the world, in the northern United States adds to a string of troubled crop harvests worldwide that point to multiple years of tight supplies and high food costs. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a major agricultural exporter, sent prices of wheat, soy and corn to near records earlier this year. 
Poor weather has also reduced grain harvests in China, India, South America and parts of Europe. Fertilizer shortages meanwhile are cutting yields of many crops around the globe.

Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky remarked that he would like to end the hostilities before the cold comes 
MOSCOW, June 28. /TASS/. Hostilities in Ukraine may end "before the end of today," if Kiev orders the nationalists to lay down their weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. 
"The Ukrainian side can end all this before the end of this day; an order is necessary for the nationalist units to lay down their weapons, an order is necessary for the Ukrainian military to lay down their weapons; and they must fulfill all Russia’s demands. 
Then everything will be over before the day ends," the spokesman said, commenting on Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s remark that he would like to end the hostilities before the cold comes.

“Instead of doing what is needed, the G7 are leaving millions to starve and cooking the planet.”

CNN: Biden officials privately doubt that Ukraine can win back all of its territory 
White House officials are losing confidence that Ukraine will ever be able to take back all of the land it has lost to Russia over the past four months of war, US officials told CNN, even with the heavier and more sophisticated weaponry the US and its allies plan to send. 
Advisers to President Joe Biden have begun debating internally how and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should shift his definition of a Ukrainian “victory” – adjusting for the possibility that his country has shrunk irreversibly. 
US officials emphasized to CNN that this more pessimistic assessment does not mean the US plans to pressure Ukraine into making any formal territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war. There is also hope that Ukrainian forces will be able to take back significant chunks of territory in a likely counteroffensive later this year.

WNU Editor: CNN has a lot of close ties to the Biden administration and the US intelligence community, and reporter Natasha Bertrand covers intelligence and national security stories. I would not be surprised if she has a few good sources in the White House, Pentagon, and the intelligence community, and they use her to pass-on administration thinking and analysis to the public. 
So what are they telling her now? 
They are telling her that the situation in Ukraine is becoming grim, and Ukraine is currently not in a position to launch a counter-offensive against Russia.]]></summary>

Just grabbing his stick was a chore, but he did it well enough to score one of the defining goals of a formidable series, the overtime winner in Game 4.
Nothing, Kadri claimed — not physical pain or racial abuse from opposing fans or even moments of his own indiscretion — would stop him from making the final.  So the medical trainers laced up his skates, as if he were a boy, and Kadri helped his teammates win the Cup, earning what he saw as a measure of redemption in the process.
“I just wanted to be in the thick of it,” Kadri said.  “I didn’t want to be on the outside looking in, so I did everything I could, devoting every …]]></summary>

António Guterres says the world must turn the tide of rising sea levels, ocean heating, acidification and plastics pollution 
The UN secretary general has declared that the world is in the middle of an “ocean emergency”, and urged governments to do more to restore ocean health.
Speaking at the opening of the UN ocean conference in Lisbon, Portugal, attended by global leaders and heads of state from 20 countries, António Guterres said: “Sadly, we have taken the ocean for granted and today we face what I would call an ocean emergency. 
We must turn the tide.”  Guterres said the “egoism” of some nations was hampering efforts to agree a long-awaited treaty to protect the world’s oceans.

Daily Mail: EXCLUSIVE: 'I think you're clear': VOICEMAIL from Joe Biden to Hunter about NY Times report on his Chinese business dealings proves he DID speak to his son about his relationship with criminal dubbed the 'spy chief of China' 
* Joe Biden called Hunter in December 2018 saying he wanted to talk to him after reading a New York Times story about Hunter's dealings with the Chinese oil giant CEFC 
* Files on Hunter's abandoned laptop previously disclosed by DailyMail.com show that he struck a deal with the Chinese company worth millions of dollars 
* The Times' 2018 story pointed out CEFC's chairman Ye Jianming had been arrested in China and his lieutenant Patrick Ho had been convicted of bribery 
* Hunter accidentally recorded himself referring to Ho as the 'spy chief of China' 
* After seeing the story online, Joe called Hunter and left a voicemail 
* 'I thought the article released online, it's going to be printed tomorrow in the Times, was good. I think you're clear,' Joe said in the voicemail 
* The message flies in the face of the president's repeated denials that he ever discussed Hunter's overseas business dealings with his son 
President Joe Biden spoke with Hunter about his business dealings with a Chinese criminal his son dubbed the 'spy chief of China,' a voicemail to his son reveals. 
The president has repeatedly denied personally and through his press secretary that he ever talked about Hunter's foreign business with his Hunter – despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 
Now, in a voicemail left on Hunter's iPhone, the evidence has come from POTUS' own mouth.

        <updated>2022-06-28T13:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WIMBLEDON, England — Last year’s Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini withdrew from this year’s tournament on Tuesday after testing positive for coronavirus.
Berrettini’s announcement of his withdrawal only came around two hours before he was due in court for his first-round match against Cristian Garin.
Berrettini, who is undefeated on grass courts this season and seeded No. 8 at Wimbledon, was a leading contender for the men’s singles title.  His withdrawal came a day after another player, Marin Cilic, Croatia’s No.14 seed and 2017 Wimbledon runner-up, also withdrew after testing positive.


The double withdrawal raised the prospect of an outbreak among the squad of players at Wimbledon, who are already missing several stars through injury and the tournament. ban on russian and belarusian players.


The ban means world No. 1-ranked men’s player Daniil Medvedev of Russia is barred from competing.  World number 2 Alexander Zverev is out for a long time after tearing ligaments in his right ankle at Roland Garros earlier this month.
Berrettini, a 6ft 6in Italian, missed several months of action earlier this season due to surgery on his right hand, his main playing hand. But he returned for the grass-court season earlier this month and won back-to-back titles at Stuttgart and Queen’s Club.
“I am heartbroken,” Berrettini said in a post on his Instagram account announcing his withdrawal.  “I’ve been having flu symptoms and self-isolating for the past few days.  Although the symptoms are not severe, I have decided it is important to have another test this morning to protect the health and safety of my fellow competitors and everyone else involved in the tournament.


“I have no words to describe the extreme disappointment I feel. The dream is over for this year, but I will come back stronger.

CNBC: U.S. blocks gold imports from Russia in latest round of sanctions targeting ‘Putin’s brutal war’ 
* The Treasury Department on Tuesday announced that the U.S. and a handful of key economic allies will prohibit imports of Russian gold. 
* The United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan are joining in the U.S. effort to ban gold imports from Russia. 
* The expanded sanctions represent the latest effort by the U.S. and its Group of Seven partners to target Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian economy. 
The Treasury Department on Tuesday announced that the U.S. and a handful of key economic allies will prohibit imports of Russian gold, Moscow’s largest export outside of the energy sector. 
The expanded sanctions represent the latest effort by the U.S. and its Group of Seven partners to target Russian President Vladimir Putin and alienate the country’s economy from international commerce and payments systems. 
The United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan are joining in the U.S. effort to ban gold imports from Russia.

Update: US unveils new Russia sanctions, implements ban on new imports of Russian gold (CNN).   
WNU Editor: To the best of my knowledge, the U.S. does not buy significant quantities of Russian gold. Even before the war. 
The UK has been the main importer of Russian gold, but this all ended when the war started in February. 
Bottom line. This gold import ban is just a symbolic move.
 Update: Factbox: Western ban on Russian gold imports is largely symbolic (Reuters).]]></summary>

Caracus Chronicle: The Maduro Administration Is Spying on Everyone  
A strange transparency report published by Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica shows how its Venezuelan subsidiary allowed the government to intervene over 20% of their subscribers phone lines. Here are the dirty details 
A transparency report recently published by Telefónica, the parent company of Movistar Venezuela, revealed indiscriminate and massive interceptions of the private communications of their Venezuelan subscribers, by order of security government agencies. 
According to the document, in 2021 Telefónica intercepted the communications of over 1.5 million (1,584,547) subscribers in Venezuela, more than 20% of Movistar telephone/internet accounts. 
These interventions were carried out by order of the government of Nicolás Maduro and included intercepting or “tapping” calls, monitoring SMS, giving the location of people through their cell phones and/or monitoring their internet traffic. 
Interventions in other countries in the region included in the report don’t even get close to 1%.

Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: US Indo–Pacific Chief Sees Largest Military Buildup In Chinese Army's History

Aquilino made the comment in a conversation hosted by the research institute the Foundation for Defense of Democracies on June 24 (pdf).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At noon on Thursday, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jnr will take his presidential oath on the steps of the Philippines’ former legislature, where his late father-president was once confronted by student activists with a black paper-mache coffin and a crocodile. His inauguration as the nation’s 17th president will be “very solemn and simple”, event organisers said. “We will not stray from tradition,” Marcos Jnr said. Historian Ambeth Ocampo surmised that the venue – the National Museum of Fine Arts building which used to house the Philippine Congress until Marcos Snr shut it down in 1972 – was chosen for its “optics”. Its American colonial-style period columns mimic the backdrop for the inauguration of US presidents who take their oath on the steps of the Capitol. Whoever picked the venue did not know Philippine history, said Ocampo, a former head of the National Historical Commission, on Sunday. First, Ocampo said, all three presidents who took their oaths there – Manuel Quezon, Jose Laurel and Manuel Roxas – not only failed to finish their term, two of them – Quezon and Roxas – died while in office. Second, “that is where the First Quarter Storm began”, said Ocampo, referring to the series of increasingly violent student protests following the 1969 election, in which Marcos Snr was accused of having cheated to win a second term. What does a Marcos Jnr presidency mean for Asean and democracy in the region? Playwright Bonifacio Ilagan, 70, intends to spend inauguration day protesting Marcos Jnr’s assumption to the presidency, in the same way he protested against his father 52 years ago when Marcos Snr delivered his State of the Nation Address on January 26, 1970, in the same building. He said on Monday: “I don’t know if Marcos Jnr realises that the venue was a historic site for student unrest and radicalisation.” Ilagan, who was jailed and tortured during Marcos Snr’s dictatorship, is the convenor of The Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law (CARMMA). Authorities have branded Ilagan and his…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: EXCLUSIVE: 'Their presence alone is a serious national security issue.' Dozens of sailors confirm their warships were swarmed by 'at least 100' otherworldly UFOs, as their accounts CONTRADICT Navy chief's effort to dismiss them as drones 
* Naval crew have told documentary maker Jeremy Corbell that US warships were swarmed in 2019 by 'at least 100' UFOs with unexplainable capabilities 
* Last year Corbell published videos from the warship incidents that set social media ablaze 
* The videos were verified by the Pentagon and showed flashing objects hovering above US Navy ships in the Pacific Ocean 
* In an historic hearing on UFOs last month, Navy chiefs tried to explain away the incident, saying they were 'reasonably confident' the objects were drones 
* Corbell is now hitting back, claiming that he has 'dozens' of accounts from crew, investigators and briefed officials who say that the UFOs were otherworldly 
* The nature and origin of the craft are still unknown, and witnesses say that they flew in ways that would put publicly known drone technology to shame 
* A crewman with direct knowledge of the case, who spoke to DailyMail.com on condition of anonymity, called the incident 'world-changing' 
Sailors on board a fleet of Navy warships sailing off the Southern California coast in July 2019 witnessed several of the ships being swarmed by a host of unidentified flying objects. 
The incident went on for hours, and then happened again and again throughout the month, with craft hovering and zipping around near the fleet with flashing multicolored lights. 
Navy chiefs have tried to explain away the incident, with the Deputy Director for Naval Intelligence saying he was 'reasonably confident' the objects were drones.

WNU Editor: They must be some great video of these incidents. I am also surprised that the US Navy has not shot one down. Or maybe they have, and are not telling anyone.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]  The Hong Kong Government is committed to promoting the development of innovation and technology and to grow Hong Kong as an international technology hub. Scientific work and technology has helped humankind in amazingly creative and innovative ways. Last year, the Hong Kong Innovation Foundation (HKIF) launched the first-ever Hong Kong Science Fair to encourage and challenge young minds to ‘Think Big Be Innovative’. Science projects provide opportunities for students to explore, learn from research and to discover new things. The Hong Kong Science Fair encourages students to be innovative and use technology to look at problems in different ways and to solve them. It is important to offer such opportunities to young people as it allows them to go through the thinking process which helps to develop their creativity and problem-solving skills. Interest in innovation and technology also grows as they grow these life-long skills.  According to the Global Innovation Index 2020, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou technology cluster is ranked the world’s second largest. With increased funding and investment in the necessary infrastructure from the Hong Kong government, the start-up ecosystem has expanded with a 6% rise in the number of start-ups in 2020 from the previous year (source: HKTDC). Hong Kong start-up’ major focuses include information and communication technologies (ICT), software as a service (SaaS), the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, biotech, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), as well as new materials. These start-ups operate in a number of sectors including  fintech, smart city and smart home, healthcare and big data applications.    Dr Daryl Ng, Chairman of the HKIF commended students for their dedication and zeal to complete their projects under challenging times. “We are honoured to have the opportunity to present the inaugural Hong Kong Science Fair.

Reuters: Macron tells Biden that UAE, Saudi can barely raise oil output 
GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany (Reuters) -Two top OPEC oil producers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, can barely increase oil production, French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said he had been told by the UAE's president. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been perceived as the only two countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with spare capacity to boost global deliveries that could reduce prices.
"I had a call with MbZ," Macron was heard telling U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the G7 summit, using shorthand for UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. "He told me two things. I'm at a maximum, maximum (production capacity). This is what he claims." 
"And then he said (the) Saudis can increase by 150 (thousands barrels per day). Maybe a little bit more, but they don't have huge capacities before six months' time," Macron said. 
The UAE's top energy official confirmed Macron's statement to the country's state news agency.

WNU Editor: Saudi Arabia and the UAE are making record profits with their energy exports. They have no interest to jeopardize this cash cow. 
 But what I find very revealing in the above Reuters report is that President Biden is told about this news directly from the French President. To put it bluntly. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are not talking to the White House, and it looks like they are using the French President of all people to be the messenger of this bad news.]]></summary>

Zero Hedge: Biden-Erdogan Meeting On The Table As Turkey Vows 'Won't Back Down' At NATO Summit 
The 2022 NATO summit in Madrid, Spain is set to kick off Tuesday and run through Thursday of this week; however, US officials say they don't expected Turkey's concerns over Sweden and Finland's membership bids to be allayed. 
One European diplomatic official told CNN that there's hope of "last moment" Turkish concessions: "My best projection based on what I've seen is that they will run this to the wire at Madrid. They also always prefer if they're going to make concessions to do it at the leader level, they believe that enhances that status," the unnamed official said. "It is Turkey's standard operating procedure not to give concessions till the last possible moment. And that last possible moment is usually defined as a bilateral with the US president, followed by a leaders meeting."

Daily Mail: How Africa and the Middle East could tip war in Putin's favour: Ukraine grain blockade is creating food crisis as 44 MILLION face starvation and regions' leaders pressure the West for peace deal 
* Russian invasion of Ukraine has blocked grain exports, and will likely cause food shortages for years to come 
* 44million at risk of starvation while another 395million will see shortages, World Food Programme warned 
* Africa and Middle East will be hardest-hit regions, as leaders pressure the West to help bring war to an end 
* African Union leader Macky Sall and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa have joined likes of Turkey's Erdogan and Saudi Arabia's Bin Salman in calling for a peace deal, which experts say would favour Russia 
Ukraine believes its fate will be decided in the mud and blood of Donbas - where its troops are trying to grind Russia's army into the dirt using skill, courage, and a fearsome arsenal of Western weaponry. 
But it seems increasingly likely that its destiny could be decided on another frontline, thousands of miles away: In the deserts of the Middle East and drought-stricken farmlands of Africa, where 44million people who relied on the country for food are now facing famine unless the conflict can be brought to a swift end. 
Blockades of Ukraine's main Black Sea ports have placed a stranglehold on grain supplies which previously fed 400million, threatening starvation and riots from Libya to Liberia, and Syria to South Sudan.

* Volodymyr Zelensky said 1,000 civilians were inside the building at the time of the savage attack

Scores of civilians were feared killed or wounded in a Russian missile strike Monday on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk, Ukrainian officials said. 
At least 13 people were dead and more than 40 wounded by two long-range X-22 missiles fired from Tu-22M3 bombers that flew from Shaykovka airfield in Russia's Kaluga region, said Ukraine's air force command. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Telegram post that the number of victims was 'unimaginable,' citing reports that more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack.

RT: Putin to attend G20 summit – Kremlin  
The Russian leader will travel to Indonesia for the meeting, despite Western leaders calling for Moscow’s expulsion  
Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Indonesia this November, the Kremlin announced on Monday. While multiple Western leaders have demanded Russia’s expulsion from the event, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is hosting this year's gathering, has invited Putin to the meeting in Bali. 
Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov announced Putin’s attendance, but told reporters that it is still unclear in what capacity the Russian leader will participate. “I hope that the pandemic will allow this important forum to be held in person, but I cannot guess,” Ushakov said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says even though the decision on Roe v Wade was leaked several weeks in advance, there’s still a “shock to the system” that things are different to what they were last week. 

He also said Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade “doesn’t do anything on abortion” other than say you don’t have the “federal right” to have one. 

“That was the law as it has existed in this country before Roe in 1973, and it’s now the law again,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“That’s what Roe did. 

“Roe actually overturned a Texas law from the 1970s that limited the right to abortion.”]]></summary>

* Boris Johnson today declared 'the price of freedom is worth paying' as he was challenged over the cost of his support for Ukraine 
* Compared repelling Russia's invasion to defeat of the Nazis in World War Two

Mr Johnson made the remarks after world leaders pledged to set a price cap on Russian oil and impose trade tariffs to make Putin pay for his invasion, which is now dragging into its fifth month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia may have defaulted for the first time on foreign bonds since the Bolsheviks refused to pay on a vast debt pile after the 1917 Revolution, but its $1.8 trillion economy is showing no sign of sinking just yet. 
The sanctions imposed by the West over Russia's invasion of Ukraine delivered the biggest external shock to Russia's economy since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, but the economy has - so far - been remarkably resilient. 
Russia's 2022 "default", announced by the United States on Monday but rejected by the Kremlin, is very different to debt crises of previous years: in 1918 the Bolsheviks didn't want to pay and in 1998 Russia could not pay its domestic debts. 
This time, Moscow can pay and says it is ready to but the West is preventing it.

Update: Russia’s economy holds up in the face of sanctions – but will it last? (France 24)   
WNU editor: I expected some hard times, but not what many in the West were predicting when sanctions were imposed. Certainly not the economy imploding or the ruble crashing as President Biden was saying in March. 
My prediction. 
Russia will be shifting its economic focus away from the West and more to Asia and the emerging economies in the Middle East and Africa. And what the West should be worried about is the growing ties between Russia and China and their mutual desire to establish a financial system independent from the West, and the dethronement of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 31-year-old man has been detained in south-western Germany, accused of stabbing several people in a shelter for asylum seekers.
One man was killed and at least five people were injured in the knife attack late on Sunday, police said on Monday.
The Nigerian man, also a resident at the accommodation in the small town of Kressbronn on Lake Constance, allegedly knocked on the doors of the rooms on Sunday evening and stabbed whomever opened the doors.
A 38-year-old Syrian man died on the spot. Those injured included a 37-year-old man and four women aged between 28 and 34.
One man who was seriously injured was flown to hospital by helicopter. The four others were taken to hospital by ambulance.
The officers arrested the suspect in front of the building. His motive and further background of the crime were initially unclear.
The man is known to have threatened several people with a knife or a similar object in the shelter in May, a police spokesperson confirmed on Monday evening.
He was then transferred to a psychiatric clinic, but the spokesperson was unable to say when he had returned to the accommodation.

But from Brexit to a scandal-plagued prime minister occupying Downing Street, a lot has changed since the last vote.
"After everything that has happened – Brexit, Covid, Boris Johnson – it is time to set out a different and better vision," Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared in a June 14 speech in Edinburgh outlining a “refreshed case for independence".

* Zelensky will warn G7 leaders Monday that they cannot delay weapons deliveries 
* His forces are outgunned by Russian troops in the east of Ukraine 
* It also emerged that the U.S. has bought an advanced missile defense system

Daily Mail: The US is to send an advanced long-range missile defense system to Ukraine as President Zelensky urges G7 to help end Russian war by winter 
* Zelensky will warn G7 leaders Monday that they cannot delay weapons deliveries 
* His forces are outgunned by Russian troops in the east of Ukraine 
* It also emerged that the U.S. has bought an advanced missile defense system 
* The Norwegian NASAMS would provide medium to long-range defense 
The U.S. is to announce that it has bought an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine, according to several reports, as President Volodomyr Zelensky continues to urge more help for his country as it battles heavy Russian attacks in the Donbas region. 
Zelensky used a video address to G7 leaders meeting in Germany to repeat his warnings that delays in delivering military aid would only embolden Russia in its attacks. 
And he asked world leaders for urgent help to end the war by winter, according to diplomatic sources.

Biden may be stuck with symbolic wins at G7 and NATO summits.
 Four months into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the effects of the war are not contained in those two countries. The conflict’s economic fronts, with the rise of energy prices and an emerging food crisis, are compounded by inflation and the likely potential of the war carrying on for months and years.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg painted the planned move, which alliance leaders are set to adopt during a summit in Madrid this week, as part of the 30-member organization's efforts to bolster its defense of the Baltic nations, which have been clamoring for a "credible military construct... that will deter" Russian President Vladimir Putin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US basketball star Brittney Griner, who is in detention in Russia on drug charges, will go on trial in Russia on July 1, a court said on Monday.
Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist and WNBA champion, was detained at Moscow airport in February after she was found carrying vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her luggage.
She was charged with drug smuggling, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison in Russia.
Griner's detention came days before Russian President Vladimir Putin defied US warnings and sent troops into Ukraine, prompting Western powers to impose sweeping sanctions and send military aid to Kyiv.
A court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow said on Monday that Griner's trial will begin on July 1.
Griner's lawyer said on Monday the court had extended her detention for the duration of the trial.
"This was absolutely expected," he said.
He said his client, who was seen by journalists being escorted in handcuffs, was "worried".
Washington says that Russia has "wrongfully detained" the six-foot-nine (2.06-meter) basketball star, 31, and turned her case over to the US special envoy in charge of hostages.
The WNBA has also said it is working to bring Griner home.
She is considered among the greatest female basketball players and is a high points scorer.
She was playing club basketball in Russia before the resumption of the US season, a common practice for American stars seeking additional income.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States, Israel and four Arab countries agreed to closer cooperation and annual foreign ministers' meetings on Monday, two weeks before President Joe Biden's first visit to the Middle East.
Bahrain, host of the six-way talks, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco all opened ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, while Egypt made peace with the Jewish state in 1979.
Monday's meeting follows a foreign ministers' summit in the Negev desert in March, and comes ahead of Biden's visit to Israel, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia from July 13 to 16.
"We're trying to build a new regional framework... and tangible initiatives that can put flesh on the bones of the Negev forum," said Yael Lempert, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.
Working groups will investigate cooperation on six areas including security, clean energy and food and water security. A joint statement also gave support for a negotiated settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
"It's a very holistic approach, towards trying to advance this goal of building a new architecture that really has meaningful results," Lempert told reporters.
The six countries' foreign ministers are expected to meet annually and the next ministerial talks should take place later this year, the statement said.
The Manama meeting is part of a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region ahead of Biden's visit, which Washington has played up as a boost for regional ties.
The US president has drawn heavy criticism over the trip, which contradicts his description of Saudi Arabia as a "pariah" over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.
His visit to the world's top oil exporter follows a sharp rise in crude prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, causing pain for US voters and economies around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A trial began Sunday for an Egyptian man accused of stabbing a woman to death in a public street after she rejected his advances -- a case that has sparked widespread outrage.
A video went viral last week appearing to show the victim, identified as student Nayera Ashraf, being stabbed by a young man outside her university.
The crime has triggered widespread anger both in Egypt and beyond, having been followed a few days later by a similar incident in which Jordanian student Iman Irshaid was shot dead on a university campus.
Social media users immediately drew comparisons between the two murders, decrying cases of femicide in the Arab world.
At the Mansoura Criminal Court, 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Cairo, Mohamed Adel was accused of "premeditated murder", after confessing to intentionally killing the victim, an AFP correspondent said.
Ashraf had previously reported the alleged perpetrator to the authorities, fearing that he would attack her, according to her father and witnesses.
The maximum penalty for murder is death in Egypt, which carried out the third highest number of executions in the world in 2021, according to Amnesty International.
"He stabbed her several times," said the prosecution, which found "messages threatening to cut her throat" on the victim's phone.
The next hearing is set for Tuesday, the defendant's lawyer, Ahmed Hamad, told AFP.
In a rare occurrence among cases involving violence against women, authorities allowed television cameras to film the hearing on Sunday.
On social media, many Jordanian and Egyptian users called for the perpetrator to be sentenced to death, while others said men must "learn to take no for an answer".
Egyptian preacher Mabrouk Attia sparked outrage last week after suggesting that the victim would not have met the same fate had she been veiled.
Nearly eight million Egyptian women were victims of violence committed by their partners or relatives, or by strangers in public spaces, according to a United Nations survey conducted in 2015.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of the wooden stands collapsed during a bullfight in central Colombia Sunday, sending spectators plunging to the ground and killing at least four people and injuring hundreds, authorities said.
The disaster took place in a stadium in the city of El Espinal in Tolima state during a traditional event called “corraleja” in which members of the public enter the ring to engage the bulls.
Videos taken during the bullfight show a multi-story section of the stands collapsing as people screamed.
“We have activated the hospital network in Tolima,” Tolima Gov. José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”
Mayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.
Late Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.
Besides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.
Orozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.
President-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.
“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.
Current President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.
“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja. We will call for an investigation.”

Coral reefs across Southeast Asia have been badly hit by global warming, with scientists warning their degradation could have devastating environmental and economic knock-on effects.
Recent photos taken off Hon Mun island -- about 14 kilometers from the city of Nha Trang and popular with divers thanks to its diverse ecosystem -- showed the reef bleached and damaged.

Reuters: Qatar to host indirect Iran-U.S. talks on reviving 2015 nuclear deal-media 
DUBAI (Reuters) -Qatar will host indirect talks between Iran and the United States in coming days, Iranian media reported on Monday, amid a push by the European Union to break a months-long impasse in negotiations to reinstate a 2015 nuclear pact. 
"Iran has chosen Qatar to host the talks because of Doha's friendly ties with Tehran," Mohammad Marandi, a media adviser to Iran's top nuclear negotiator, told the ISNA news agency. 
A source briefed on the visit said that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, was expected to arrive in Doha on Monday and meet with the Qatari foreign minister. 
An Iranian official told Reuters that Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, would be in Doha for the talks on Tuesday and Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Google was hit with an antitrust complaint on Monday after Danish online job-search rival Jobindex took its grievance to European Union regulators, alleging the Alphabet-owned business had unfairly favoured its own job search service.
The complaint could reinvigorate EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's scrutiny of the service, Google for Jobs. Vestager said three years ago she was looking into the issue, but has yet to take any action.
The European Commission said it would assess the complaint according to the standard procedures. Jobindex's action comes four years after German media group Axel Springer's jobs portal Stepstone filed a similar complaint against Google.

Iran says it has tested its Zuljanah satellite launcher for a second time ahead of the expected start of talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal. 
State-run media on June 26 broadcast footage of the rocket blasting off, and Ahmad Hosseini, spokesman for Iran's Defense Ministry, said the 25.5-meter-long rocket was capable of carrying a satellite that would ultimately gather data in low-Earth orbit and promote Iran's space industry. 
"The second launch of the Zuljanah satellite carrier has taken place in order to achieve the predetermined research objectives," said Hosseini, according to state news agency IRNA.

In a soft, even slightly reserved voice, Argento wanted to wrap up a recent interview so he could see his grandchildren — the offspring of his daughter, actress Asia Argento — before heading to New York the next day, where “Beware of Dario Argento: A 20-Film Retrospectiveruns at Lincoln Center through June 29.
“I won’t see them for a while,” he said of the children, before chasing his interlocutor.  Hardly the modus operandi of a “master of horror”.


But that’s not to say Argento, 81, isn’t up for a bit of mayhem or gore just yet.

RFE: Interview: How Much Is China Helping Russia Finance Its War In Ukraine?  
China’s growing appetite for discounted Russian oil has made it the leading financier of the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine by giving Moscow a reliable revenue source that blunts the impact of tough Western sanctions against its economy. 
Four months after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, China has overtaken Germany as the biggest single buyer of Russian energy, with oil sales to China -- and India, another energy-hungry Asian nation -- helping to fill a gap left by Europe, Russia’s biggest export market. 
China and India have together bought an estimated 2.4 million barrels of Russian crude oil a day in May, half of Russia's total exports.

Andrew Milburn, Modern War Institute: Time Is Not on Kyiv’s Side: Training, Weapons, and Attrition in Ukraine 
The battalion commander shrugged helplessly when we advised him that five days was a completely inadequate amount of time in which to train his soldiers. “This is all we have—they are needed on the front,” he replied with grim finality. A few days later, on a separate course that we were running for his medics, half of our class disappeared on the second day. “We have had casualties,” was the only explanation we received. Even in units that fall within the Ukrainian special operations command, most soldiers are sent to the front line with very little training. In one such unit, we estimated that just 20 percent had even fired a weapon before heading to combat.

Washington Times: As U.S. troops reach 100K in Europe, questions mount over endgame, long-term effects 
Pressure grows on Europe to bolster its military spending ahead of NATO summit  The number of American troops in Europe has risen sharply in the four months since Russia invaded Ukraine, from about 65,000 in mid-February to 100,000 today. 
That increase, one of the most rapid U.S. military buildups on the continent in the post-Cold War era, has no clear end date or any obvious metrics to determine when troops could come home or be repositioned to other theaters such as the Indo-Pacific. 
Instead, their mission is to deter further Russian aggression and prevent any attack on NATO territory. That goal will prove difficult to measure and could justify a years-long mission as Russia and Ukraine settle into a slow, bloody war of attrition in the Donbas.

QUITO (Reuters) -Ecuadorean President Guillermo Lasso said on Sunday he would cut prices for gasoline and diesel by 10 cents a gallon, the latest concession to try to end nearly two weeks of anti-government protests in which at least six people have died.
The sometimes-violent demonstrations by largely indigenous protesters demanding lower fuel and food prices, among other things, began on June 13 and have slashed Ecuador's oil production.
Lasso, whose adversarial relationship with the national assembly has worsened during the protests, had already withdrawn security measures and announced subsidized fertilizers and debt forgiveness, and his government met this weekend with indigenous groups.
The leader of the CONAIE indigenous organization, Leonidas Iza, had flagged …]]></summary>

    Zero Hedge: Turkish FM Urges 'Greater Turkey' As EU Sides With Greece In Territorial Dispute 
On Friday Turkey lashed out at a series of positions the EU summit in Brussels took regarding territorial disputes with Greece in the Aegean and Mediterranean - specifically on drilling rights and Ankara's charge that Greece is "militarizing" its islands in violation of historic treaties, an accusation which the EU has not backed. This also as Turkey has been seething over Ukraine and Moldova so quickly being granted EU candidate status. 
The EU has consistently sided with defending Greece and Cyprus' pushback against expansive Turkish claims, which the Turkish foreign ministry slammed as decisions which are "prejudiced, lack vision, and are disconnected from reality."

First, Tyler Hyde, the band’s bassist, sat up front and sang — his voice jumping between a soft pop squeal and a raspy screech.  The following May, Kershaw, usually on the piano, took over, her voice soft and snappy like that of a folk singer.  Then Lewis Evans, the saxophonist, sang two songs.
“Dope as hell,” said Charlie Wayne, the band’s drummer, as Evans finished.  Evans didn’t seem too sure.  “I was a little too slow!”  he said, looking frustrated.

KYIV/POKROVSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russian forces were fighting to achieve one of their strategic objectives in Ukraine on Monday as Moscow-backed separatists said they were pushing into Lysychansk, the last major city still held by Ukrainian troops in eastern Luhansk province.
Lysychansk is the new focus of the war after its twin city of Sievierodonetsk fell on Saturday, in a victory for Moscow's campaign to seize the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk on behalf of pro-Russian separatists.
Tass news agency on Sunday quoted a separatist official as saying Moscow's forces had entered Lysychansk from five directions and were isolating Ukrainian defenders. Reuters could not confirm the report.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Sunday that if Russia succeeds in its takeover of Ukraine, the global results would be “absolutely catastrophic.” 
Russia has been continuing its relentless attacks on Ukraine that started in late February. On Sunday, Russian forces unleashed a round of missiles on Kyiv, its first attack on the capital in weeks. 
Several view the strikes as a show of defiance against the Group of Seven leaders that were meeting the same day to discuss efforts to restrict and pressure the Kremlin.  Still, Johnson urged the West to continue its support of Ukraine as the war drags on. Allowing Russian success could set a dangerous precedent, he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Russia Defaults on Foreign Debt for First Time Since 1918 
(Bloomberg) -- Russia defaulted on its foreign-currency sovereign debt for the first time in a century, the culmination of ever-tougher Western sanctions that shut down payment routes to overseas creditors. 
For months, the country found paths around the penalties imposed after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. But at the end of the day on Sunday, the grace period on about $100 million of snared interest payments due May 27 expired, a deadline considered an event of default if missed.
It’s a grim marker in the country’s rapid transformation into an economic, financial and political outcast. The nation’s eurobonds have traded at distressed levels since the start of March, the central bank’s foreign reserves remain frozen, and the biggest banks are severed from the global financial system.    
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: This default is mostly symbolic. Russia has more than enough funds that are frozen in the central banks of North America and Europe to pay these financial notes. This issue is now going to the courts, and I predict that it will take years before it is resolved. In the meantime the Russia ruble is worth more today than before the start of the war (link here).

CNN: Small banks in China are running into trouble. Savers could lose everything  
Peter had put his life savings of about $6 million into accounts at three small banks in China’s central Henan province. He says he hasn’t been able to access them since April. 
The 45-year-old entrepreneur asked us to call him Peter for security reasons. He’s from the eastern city of Wenzhou and is just one of thousands of depositors who have been fighting to recover their savings from at least six banks in rural provinces in central China. 
“I’m close to having a nervous breakdown. I can’t sleep,” Peter told CNN Business. 
When he tried to access his accounts online, a statement would pop up on the homepage informing him that the website was under maintenance and services would be unavailable for a while, Peter told CNN Business. Two months later, those services have not been restored. 
The trouble began in April, when four banks in Henan suspended cash withdrawals.

Bloomberg: G-7 Latest: Leaders to Commit to Indefinite Support for Ukraine 
 (Bloomberg) -- Group of Seven leaders will commit to providing indefinite support to Ukraine for its defense against Russia’s invasion, according to the text of a draft statement from their summit in Bavaria. 
“We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” the text of a draft statement seen by Bloomberg said. The wording is important because members of the alliance are concerned about the war dragging on and some, including Germany and France, have hinted that they may be more open to the idea of a negotiated cease-fire.

The two men, who are from different political generations but both took office last year, have made common cause over Ukraine as they sought to heal ties that were sorely strained under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.

“Another 10 days to two weeks,” he said, explaining how long it takes before the crop is ready for harvest.
Mr. Corbea, a farmer for nearly three decades, has rarely experienced a season like this.  The bloody Russian invasion of Ukraine, a breadbasket for the world, has caused upheaval in world grain markets.  Coastal blockade have trapped millions of tons of wheat and corn inside Ukraine.  With famine in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia, a frantic rush for new suppliers and alternative shipping routes is underway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[REHOBOTH BEACH, Del.  – President Biden said Monday he was considering seeking a gasoline tax exemption to mitigate high fuel prices, a major political dilemma for the White House as it struggling to cope with record inflation.
“I hope to have a decision based on the data I’m looking for by the end of the week,” the president told reporters in Delaware.
Suspending the gasoline tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, would require congressional action.  In February, when Democratic lawmakers explored the ideaSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, called it a gimmick.


The national average for regular gasoline was $4.98 a gallon on Monday, according to AAAafter $5 topping this month.  Oil and refined fuel prices hit their highest level in 14 years, largely due to The Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions, as well as a rebound in energy consumption as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.


The White House and congressional Democrats have been discussing a nationwide gas tax exemption as one of the few options to reduce the cost at the pump, as external factors have been key drivers behind the surge. price.  The high cost of gas is emerging as a significant handicap for Mr. Biden and Democratic lawmakers as the midterm elections approach.
When gas prices jumped in March, the White House turned towards the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, ordering the release of up to one million barrels of oil a day for 180 days in hopes of meeting demand.  The overall effect has been limited and gasoline prices remain close to record highs.
Mr Biden said on Monday that his team planned to meet with the CEOs of major oil companies this week.  He reprimanded some of the biggest oil companies last week to make a profit as US consumers suffered high prices.

The death toll in an attempt by hundreds of migrants to break through a border fence between Morocco and a Spanish exclave earlier this week has risen to 23, Moroccan state television reported on Sunday.
On Friday, Rabat said 18 migrants had died, while others and security forces were injured, during a mass attempt to storm the border to the Spanish exclave of Melilla.
Five further migrants have since died, raising the toll to 23, state television reported late on Saturday, citing unnamed local sources.
The 18 injured migrants and one member of security forces are still under medical observation, the broadcaster added without elaborating.
The independent Moroccan Association of Human Rights accused the security forces of using "unjustified" violence against the migrants and mistreating them.
Amin Abidar, the group’s head in the city of Nador near the border with Melilla, told dpa that migrants had been left trapped on the ground for hours without medical assistance.
For its part, Morocco's Interior Ministry accused the migrants of using violence.
Morocco became independent from France and Spain in 1956. Nevertheless, Spain still holds two autonomous cities there: Melilla and Ceuta, 250 kilometres further west on the Strait of Gibraltar. Both are claimed by Rabat.
Near the two cities, tens of thousands of people, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, often wait for a chance to enter the EU.
Usually, several hundred people at a time try to surprise the border officials and get across the border en masse.

Ukrainian shelling on Saturday forced Russian troops to suspend the evacuation of people from a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, just hours after Moscow's forces took the city, Tass news agency quoted local police as saying.
The fall of Sievierodonetsk, following weeks of some of the war's bloodiest fighting, is the biggest defeat for Ukraine since it lost control of the southern port of Mariupol in May.

US President Joe Biden has arrived in Germany ahead of the G7 summit in Bavaria's Schloss Elmau, on what is his first visit to the country since taking office.
Air Force One landed in Munich late on Saturday night, from where Biden continued to Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps, where the G7 summit begins on Sunday.
Biden is also due to meet for bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is hosting the event. The G7 summit, which lasts until Tuesday, will focus on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its global consequences.
Only last Thursday, the US pledged further arms deliveries to Ukraine worth $450 million, taking the total value of weaponry and other military equipment committed by Washington to Kiev to around $6.1 billion.
