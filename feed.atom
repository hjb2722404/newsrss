        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturday is chore day for me. Also helping this afternoon an elderly Ukrainian couple move to a home that a Ukrainian-Canadian family have opened for them to stay with them for a few months. Charity work never ends. 
Blogging will return this evening.
Just some final thoughts. 

The timing of the Sevastopol attack only hours after the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the UK of being responsible for damaging the Nord Stream pipeline attacks is bothering me on every level. 
This war is clearly escalating to an entirely new level. 
On another note. 
The Western narrative is saying that Russia is losing the war and Putin is facing great opposition within Russia itself. But what I see on the ground is the opposite. A rush from the West to supply more money and weapons to Ukraine, more sanctions, massive electrical black-outs in Ukraine, and now numerous reports from Russia of direct Western involvement in the war on the ground.  
We are also seeing a growing protest movement against EU policy towards the war (link here), and link here.
Something does not add up.]]></summary>

   WNU Editor: I suspect US drones are flying in the region 24/7. But optics is everything, and this has all the looks of being a coordinated attack by Ukraine and NATO against the Russian fleet at Sevastopol. 
There are now reports (yet to be confirmed) that some Russian warships were damaged in the attack. 
 I am surprised that the tracker was not turned-off by this US drone.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: 'Massive' drone attack on Black Sea Fleet - Russia 
Ukraine has carried out a "massive" drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, damaging one warship, Russia says.  Nine drones were used, a top official said. Ukraine has not commented. 
Without providing evidence, Russia accused British troops of being involved in that attack - and in blowing up gas pipelines last month. 
The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was "peddling false claims of an epic scale."  Saturday's attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by occupying Russians. 
Russia has replied by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yahoo News: As temperatures begin to fall, Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine's vulnerable power grid 
KYIV — Large parts of the Ukrainian capital have been experiencing rolling blackouts in recent weeks, after increased Russian attacks over the past month that have destroyed an estimated 30% of Ukraine’s power and heating generation capacity. 
Kyiv has accused Russia, which continues to suffer a string of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield, of pursuing a determined strategy of targeting such facilities in order both to increase Ukrainian refugee flows into Europe and to freeze the population at home into submission.
Ukraine’s power stations and electricity distribution network have also been heavily bombed in the past few weeks. On Oct. 22, a thermal power station in Lutsk, in Ukraine’s northwest, was hit by three Russian cruise missiles, according to the city’s mayor, Ihor Polishchuk, leading to critical damage.

Breaking Defense:  Boeing defense racks up $2.8B in costs this quarter, with losses from KC-46 and new Air Force One  
“We’re not embarrassed by [the cost overruns]; they are what they are. And we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers,” said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.  
WASHINGTON — Boeing disclosed a whopping $2.8 billion loss on defense programs this quarter, led by significant cost overruns on the KC-46 tanker and new Air Force One, the company stated today. 
Losses were sustained on KC-46, T-7A Red Hawk trainer, the Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone, VC-25B — better known as Air Force One, when the president is onboard — and NASA’s Commercial Crew program, Boeing said in a news release. 
The overruns were “driven by higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs, as well as technical challenges” and “were also impacted by unfavorable performance on other programs,” Boeing said.

It remains unchanged.”   “The provocative gestures, such as the visits to Taiwan by the U.S. highest dignitaries, are seen in Russia as nothing but a provocation. Why do that? Honestly, I cannot answer that,” the Russian president said.

WNU Editor: There are many reasons why Ukraine's counter-offensives have stalled. Supply lines and lack of supplies/fortified Russian positions backed by more reinforcements and superior artillery fire/lack of trained manpower/etc.. But Russian drones have definitely had an impact, from detecting Ukraine military movements to knocking out a good portion of Ukraine's electrical grid. 
I also see the Russian military copying the same drone tactics that Azerbaijan used in their last war with Armenia. Armenian forces were dug in and reinforced, but Azerbaijan's drones made mincemeat out of them using Turkish-supplied drones, as well as knocking out Armenian reinforcements that were then sent in.]]></summary>

   USA Today: Exclusive poll: Republican support rises ahead of Election Day, with inflation driving voters  
After SCOTUS reversed Roe v. Wade, some Democrats thought the issue would disrupt typical midterm factors like views of the economy. But the new poll shows many voters going back to basics. 
 * Voters overwhelmingly view the election as a way to send a message to the White House. 
 *  Biden's upbeat reassurances on the economy aren't breaking through with voters. 
 * Asked whether inflation or abortion mattered more to them, respondents chose inflation by 56%-40%. 
Republicans are resurgent as the midterm campaign heads into its final stretch, an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, amid angst about President Joe Biden's leadership and the nation's economy. 
As Americans feel the bite of inflation in their daily lives, from eating out less often to canceling vacations, voters overwhelmingly view the election as a way to send a message to the White House – and by double digits, that message is to change course.

WNU Editor: I tell my Republican friends to not get cocky. President Trump was polling similar numbers in 2020 ..... 40% of Hispanics and 21% of Blacks backing Republican candidates .... but the polls were wrong and he lost the election that also ended with the Democrats winning the House and Senate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not everyone is convinced that Mark Zuckerberg’s massive metaverse experiment is a good idea.  Since Facebook rebranded as Meta in 2021, the social media giant has increasingly focused on connecting the digital and physical worlds through augmented reality.  However, a company shareholder recently sent a letter to the CEO calling the metaverse investment “super-sized and terrifying.”
It didn’t take long for these concerns to be justified.  Meta released its third quarter financial results after the October 26 bell and, perhaps unsurprisingly, its metaverse division underperformed.  Meta’s Reality Labs lost $3.672 billion in the quarter, mirroring a similar decline in the first quarter.  This is the risk you run when you venture into uncharted territory.

Chinese refiners have increased their crude oil purchases ahead of the year’s end as they see higher fuel exports in the final months of the year. 
According to Bloomberg, Chinese companies have bought at least 10 million barrels of crude over the past week, mostly from the Middle East, West Africa, and Brazil, signaling the demand situation has changed for the better. 
One of the main reasons for this demand optimism is the global diesel shortage. A decline in global refining capacity, especially in Europe and the United States has curbed the supply of the fuel that is essential for every economy and now there are warning signals flashing on both sides of the Atlantic.

Update: China Goes On Crude Buying Spree After OPEC+ Cuts (Zero Hedge)   
WNU Editor: While the US is emptying out its strategic oil reserve, the Chinese are stocking up with the expectation that the price of oil is going skyward in the coming weeks. 
OPEC+ cutting oil production. EU ban on Russian oil starting in December. The signs are all there for $100 USD/barrel and more in 2023.   
Update #2: This top US banker is right .... Jamie Dimon Says “We are getting energy completely wrong” and He's Right (Mish Talk). 
Update #3: US Diesel supplies continue to fall, and prices continue to climb .... Gas prices down again, diesel higher (DRGNews). Pray for warm weather.]]></summary>

Outrage over her killing has led to protests worldwide – women chopped off their hair and many Muslim women burned their hijabs.

   Reuters: Czech Protesters Call for New Government, Direct Gas Talks With Russia 
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Czechs protested in Prague on Friday, demanding the centre-right government step down to allow an early election and calling for talks with Russia on gas supplies ahead of winter.

Police estimated the crowd in the lower tens of thousands, less than the two previous rallies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Pentagon DEFENDS plans to cut U.S. nuclear capabilities - despite Putin's threats: Defense secretary insists there's no need for a new sea-launched missile - and again insists there's no indication Russia will use a dirty bomb in Ukraine 
* The Pentagon published its National Defense Strategy on Thursday 
* It is a declassified form of a classified document already circulated to lawmakers 
* Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin briefed reporters on its contents 
* He was asked if cutting a sea-launched missile sent the right message to Putin 
* 'He understands what our capability is,' said Austin in response 
Eight months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with China stepping up its nuclear, space and cyberforce capabilities, on Thursday the Pentagon defended its decision to scrap development of a new sea-launched cruise missile. 
The decision to cancel the submarine-launched cruise missile comes even though senior military figures wanted it to continue. 
And at the same time the Pentagon also confirmed it was retiring the B83-1 gravity bomb - 80 to 100 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: 'Live fire used again' as Iran protests swell 
Three demonstrators have been killed during clashes with Iranian security forces in the western town of Mahabad, state media has reported. 
The protesters reportedly targeted government buildings after attending the memorial ceremony of a man killed during unrest in the country. 
Security forces also reportedly opened fire at a cemetery near Khorramabad. 
Rights group Amnesty International says security forces have killed eight people since Wednesday. 
Unrest has rocked the country since Mahsa Amini died in police custody 40 days ago after allegedly wearing her Islamic headscarf "improperly".

WNU Editor: This blog has covered many protests in Iran over the years. But this one is different. It is happening in most of the country, and people of all ages are involved. But as long as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards with their guns continue to support and protect the leadership, it is unfortunate but change is not going to happen in Iran anytime soon.

Jair Bolsonaro takes on socialist candidate and former president Lula in Brazil's run-off election on Sunday
RIO DE JANEIRO - Embattled incumbent Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro closed out his underdog campaign last night in his home state of Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of enthusiastic Bolsonaro supporters, clad in Brazil’s yellow soccer jerseys, packed the plaza in Campo Grande, a western suburb of Rio de Janeiro. 
Amidst scorching heat, which caused a few medical emergencies, popular Brazilian televangelist Silas Malafaia, and Rio de Janeiro Governor Claudio Castro warmed up the crowd. The gathering was part military muster, part campaign rally and part religious revival. 
The run-off election will be held this Sunday.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Polls in the first round of Brazil's Presidential election were predicting a landslide win for Lula. That did not happen, and in fact Bolsonaro's party did not only win key regional elections but also control of both chambers of Congress .... Right-wing wins in Brazil's Congress show staying power of 'Bolsonarismo' (Reuters). 
Will the same happen on Sunday? 
I do not know. 
But I do know that if Lula does win the Presidency, he will be facing a Congress that will oppose him.

CBC: RCMP running short of officers to protect cabinet ministers from a growing number of threats  
Ministers' teams don't always agree with the RCMP's assessments of danger levels 
The RCMP's close protection unit is running short of the specialized officers it needs to protect elected officials, undermining its ability to respond to federal ministers' growing demands for security services, new figures show. 
In the Ottawa region alone, 75 positions out of a total of 315 in the RCMP's protection unit are unstaffed — a vacancy rate of 24 per cent — according to data obtained by Radio-Canada. Similar vacancy rates afflict the RCMP's close protection units in other parts of the country, the RCMP said. 
Several RCMP and government officials said the shortage of officers is complicating the force's efforts to protect the prime minister, the Governor General, Supreme Court justices, diplomats and foreign dignitaries.
"Even for the prime minister, they are short-staffed at the moment," said a government source.

WNU Editor: The RCMP's focus and priority is to protect Prime Minister Trudeau. And that focus has exploded to protection levels that no former Canadian PM has ever had. Check out the PM's motorcade in Montreal two months ago (see below).  

NOW: Trudeau's motorcade in Montreal, Quebec.

— Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) October 28, 2022
   DW: German president calls for unity in 'state of nation' speech 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned of "tougher years" ahead for Germany and also called for action on climate change and pledged support for Ukraine. 
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivered what has been dubbed a "state of the nation" speech on Friday at his official residence, Bellevue Palace. The theme of his remarks was "what connects us makes us stronger." 
The speech came at a time of uncertainly for Germany, and Steinmeier touched on many of the issues weighing on the minds of many people in the country. These included a cost of living crisis amidst soaring inflation and an energy crunch, as well as the war in Ukraine.   
Read more ....   
Update #1: 'No room for old dreams', German president says of Russia ties (Reuters)  
Update #2: Steinmeier says Germany, Russia "are standing against each other" (TASS)   
WNU Editor: The success of Germany's industrial base has been due to three factors. An innovative and hard working population, coupled with stable governments and having access to cheap and stable energy supplies from Russia. 
No more now. 
Germany is now forced to buy from other energy suppliers that are not cheap, and definitely not stable. In turn the impact on the German economy from this energy cut-off has in turn been disastrous, with Germany's industrial base now closing down and looking to relocate elsewhere. 
So yes. 
In his speech the German President is correct that the cost of living crisis amidst soaring inflation and an energy crunch is on the minds of most Germans. But German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and what is worse, no change in policies.
 Update #3: Maybe I talked to soon on Germany not changing its policies .... Germany Is Dismantling A Wind Farm To Make Way For A Coal Mine (OilPrice.com).]]></summary>

Israel and Lebanon finalized an agreement defining their maritime borders in the Mediterranean on Thursday, President Joe Biden announced on Twitter, inking a United States-brokered deal at the United Nations mission on the land border between the countries. 
The signing ceremony officially settles a years-long maritime border dispute involving major oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean.  The neighboring countries – still formally at war – had been at odds for years over an area of the sea off the coast of Israel and Lebanon. 
The area in question touches the Karish oil and gas field and a region known as the Qanaa prospect. The deal gives oil and gas rights in the Karish field to Israel, while Lebanon gets access to the Qanaa prospect – with Israel earning 17% of the profits.

North Korea fired two, short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) off its east coast on Friday, South Korea's military has said, while it has been wrapping up nearly two weeks of major drills aimed at deterring its neighbour. 
This latest launch — at a time of growing fears that North Korea is readying for its first nuclear test since 2017 — was the latest in a record year of its tests, whether of short-range missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), or other weapons.

Beijing understands the Ukraine situation perfectly, the Russian president told the Valdai Club  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has revealed that he did not give advance notice of the special operation in Ukraine to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. There was no need, Putin said on Thursday at the Valdai Discussion Club meeting, adding that Russia and China are both sovereign nations and that Beijing has a clear understanding of the situation in Ukraine. 
“No,” Putin said, when moderator Fyodor Lukyanov asked if he’d told Xi about the military operation – which started on February 24 – when the two leaders met twenty days prior. Nor was Xi resentful or offended by that, the Russian president explained.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese cities from Wuhan in central China to Xining in the northwest are doubling down on COVID-19 curbs, sealing up buildings, locking down districts and throwing millions into distress in a scramble to halt widening outbreaks. 
China on Thursday reported a third straight day of more than 1,000 new COVID cases nationwide, a modest tally compared with the tens of thousands per day that sent Shanghai into a full-blown lockdown earlier this year but enough to trigger more restrictions across the country. 
China's coronavirus case load has remained small by global standards, but its ultra-strict and disruptive containment measures this year against the highly transmissible Omicron variant have weighed heavily on the world's second-largest economy.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine will have long-lasting effects on energy supply and markets, a new report suggests. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the world faces its first "truly global energy crisis" as a result. 
 It added that unaffordable energy bills remain a huge problem, driven up as the exports of oil and gas have been restricted. 
But the crisis should also be seen as a turning point, speeding up the world's transition to green energy, it said. 
"With unrelenting geopolitical and economic concerns, energy markets remain extremely vulnerable, and the crisis is a reminder of the fragility and unsustainability of the current global energy system. 
"The heaviest burden is falling on poorer households where a larger share of income is spent on energy", the report warned.

Ukrainians living in and around Kyiv have been told of a “sharp deterioration” in the region’s electricity supply after a fresh wave of Russian strikes aimed at sapping public morale as the country’s cold winter approaches. 
A local energy supplier, Yasno, warned that existing blackouts could last a lot longer than a previously planned schedule of four-hour outages and that the capital already faced an electricity deficit of about 30% or more.

“I just think it’s going to be a write-off, really."

Ms Krakue said also Prince Harry has led "quite an interesting life" and that he does have a lot of "stuff of substance to say".

"Unfortunately that has been completely drowned out by the madness which he has descended into with all this woke stuff with Meghan," she said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Pentagon’s Strategy Won’t Rule Out Nuclear Use Against Non-Nuclear Threats 
(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon’s new National Defense Strategy rejected limits on using nuclear weapons long championed by arms control advocates and in the past by President Joe Biden. 
Citing burgeoning threats from China and Russia, the Defense Department said in the document released Thursday that “by the 2030s the United States will, for the first time in its history face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries.”

Update: Pentagon Reverses Strategy, No Longer Rules Out Use Of Nukes Against Non-Nuclear Threat While Putin Declares ‘No Reason’ For Russia To Use Nukes (New Wars)   
WNU Editor: This is a major policy change, and one that President Biden hmself promised not to change during the 2020 Presidential campaign. 
The Defense Department’s 2022 National Defense Strategy is here .... 2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States.    
Update #2: Going through the 2022 National Strategy document right now. From what I have read so far, it is a document that reflects how tense and dangerous the world is becoming. In the meantime the critics are appalled by what they are reading .... 'A Terrifying Document': Critics Say Biden Nuclear Policy Makes the World More Dangerous (Common Dreams).   
Update #3: Putin is always reminding people of this (see below): 

Putin: The only country in the world that has used nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state is the United States of America

Axios: Putin: "It doesn't make sense" to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine 
Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that he would conduct a nuclear strike in Ukraine, saying Thursday that "it doesn't make sense for us to do it.   
Driving the news: Putin has deployed veiled nuclear threats several times in the past few months. His remarks come just a day after Putin oversaw the start of annual drills of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. 
* Recent weeks have brought heightened fears about Russia's claims that Ukraine plans to detonate a "dirty bomb" on its own territory, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials have denied. 
* The claims have sparked concerns about a potential "false flag" operation by Russia that could escalate the war in Ukraine.

WASHINGTON — After six months of delays, the Biden administration today released the unclassified version of its National Defense Strategy — and despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the department remains confident the long-term threat lies not in Moscow, but in Beijing.
