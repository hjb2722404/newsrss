        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's pressure for a "humanitarian pause" in its war on Hamas, conditioning it on the release of hostages taken from Israel to Gaza. France reacted to an Israeli strike on the French Institute in Gaza with "astonishment" and "incomprehension", French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said on Friday, demanding a full investigation. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned that a wider conflict in the Middle East was a "realistic possibility". Read our live blog to see how the day's events unfolded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi has taken aim at the United Nations for enabling the Islamic Republic of Iran to use the organisation to “legitimise itself”.  

Ms Boniadi sat down with Sky News Australia host Laura Jayes to discuss the dangerous regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Ms Boniadi urged the West to enforce sanctions on Iranian officials amid the rampant human rights abuses in the country.  

She said the Islamic Republic is using the United Nations to “normalise” itself to the global public. 

“The problem with the UN is … when UN member states and their representatives don’t stand for democracy, and they play into the Islamic Republic’s propaganda and side with them, then we’re never going to see change,” she told Sky News Australia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[She tried to censure and it came up short. 
Now she's shaming the names who didn't vote in favor. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib," Greene said on Wednesday. "This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC."

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.
"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger," she said. "And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate."
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.
"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib," tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: "motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans."

And CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: "House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution."]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/tommy-tuberville-senate-protest-blockade/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-01T22:12:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.]]></summary>

EruAsian Times: French Rafales ‘Trounce’ Eurofighters As Germany Blocks Sale Of Typhoon Jets To Saudi Arabia – Reports

 
Germany loosened export restrictions against Saudi Arabia earlier this year. Still, it refused to allow the sale of the 4.5th generation Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet to the kingdom, despite the UK government’s intense lobbying. Berlin’s refusal, unfortunately, poses a significant challenge to Britain’s production lines. 
The United Kingdom is likely to see a loss of 6,000 jobs in the defense sector and no manufacturing of fighter jets for a decade in the face of Germany’s unwillingness to green-light the sale of Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the Royal Saudi Air Force, British newspaper The Sun reported.
Berlin is blocking a multibillion-dollar agreement to sell 48 Typhoons to Saudi Arabia, and ministers have threatened to “close” BAE production lines if the contract is refused. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz clarified in July this year that Germany will not deliver Eurofighter combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia soon.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts.
