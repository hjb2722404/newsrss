Dr Turner said it has essentially come down to supply and demand.

“Ultimately, the supply’s being shortened, particularly gas and prices are rocketing as a result,” he told Sky News Australia.

This has the potential to “hamper” the Department of Justice’s investigation into the former president, according to Ms Nielsen.]]></summary>

"Gazprom’s production is not falling, or you will scare everyone now, but [it is] only rising," he said at a meeting devoted to Kamchatka’s social and economic development after Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that as a program for Kamchatka’s gasification and field development was adopted 15 years ago Novatek started production, but the resource base was not confirmed, which caused a decline in production over the past years. The replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential, he added.

WNU Editor: Some differ with Putin's Gazprom assessment .... Russian state-energy giant Gazprom saw its natural-gas production in July slump to its lowest level since 2008 (Insider). 
As to what is my take. 
Gazprom's export of natural gas has declined this summer because of pipeline and turbine issues, and with Nord Stream 1 now shut down indefinitely, its production will fall even more. But I think this is temporary. There is now a push to export natural gas to energy hungry countries in Asia .... Gazprom discussing accelerated redirection of gas supplies eastward — Energy Minister (TASS). Ditto with oil production/exports .... Russia able to adapt to EU oil embargo — Energy Minister (TASS).]]></summary>

RT: Ditching Russian gas no way to reach climate goals – Putin 
EU should have been better prepared for its green energy transition, the Russian president says 
The EU’s decision to slash natural gas imports while trying to reach climate goals was a mistake, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday during an environmental forum in Kamchatka in Russia’s Far East. 
“First, they (EU) jumped ahead, and then, after cutting off Russian gas supplies, returned everything that was reviled,” Putin stated. 
He emphasized that all nations are in favor of reducing emissions into the atmosphere, noting however that everything should be done in a timely manner. “And if you jump ahead, get cheap Russian gas, and then cut off the supply of this gas yourself and immediately switch back to everything that was previously condemned, including coal-fired generation, this, of course, is not the best option for solving global problems,” the Russian president said.

Pro-Russian forces are to blame for the protest against the Czech government’s foreign and economic policy in which 70,000 people gathered, according to Czech conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala. 
The event was organised by radical political groups, including Communist Party and Freedom and the Direct Democracy Party. 
Organisers criticised the high energy prices and the pro-Western course of the current government. They also demanded short-term contracts for cheap gas and oil supplies or replacement of the management of the public TV and Radio broadcasters. 
The demonstration was called “Czechia First”. Some participants carried anti-EU or anti-NATO banners.

Update: Biden ripped for saying 'MAGA proposals are a threat to the very soul of this country' (FOX News)   
WNU Editor: President Biden is not following the rule that when you are digging a hole for yourself you should stop.  President Biden's tweets are below:  

MAGA proposals are a threat to the very soul of this country.
— President Biden (@POTUS) September 4, 2022
   
The MAGA agenda represents an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.
 It doesn’t respect our Constitution.
It doesn’t believe in the rule of law.
And it doesn’t recognize the will of the people.

Frustration over the rising cost of living has compelled hundreds of thousands of workers who staff ports, trains and mailrooms to go on strike.

Nord Stream 1 operations will be hampered as long as Western restrictions remain in place, Dmitry Peskov says 
The technical issues with gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline will persist until the West lifts sanctions it has slapped on Russia over the ongoing Ukraine conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. 
On August 31, Gazprom completely shut down gas deliveries via the pipeline. Although initially Nord Stream 1 was slated to resume gas transit on Friday, Gazprom announced that it would remain closed indefinitely due to technical issues. 
“Problems in [gas] deliveries arose due to sanctions that have been imposed on our country and a number of companies by Western countries, including Germany and the UK. There are no other reasons behind supply issues,” Peskov noted.

* Liz Truss has been named as the new Conservative leader this afternoon - and will become PM tomorrow 
* There are signs Ms Truss is planning to freeze energy bills with massive £100billion bailout package 
* Gas prices have soared again after Russia closed down a key pipeline to Europe amid the Ukraine standoff 
Liz Truss vowed to be 'bold' in cutting taxes and reviving the economy after defeating Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest today. 
Ms Truss takes the helm of a country in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis after seeing off the former chancellor's challenge with support from 81,326 party members, compared to Mr Sunak's 60,399. 
The 57 per cent to 43 per cent result - closer than some had expected - was announced by 1922 committee chair Sir Graham Brady in a glitzy ceremony at the QE2 Centre in Westminster.

FOX News: Ukraine's Zelenskyy accuses Russia of 'preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans' this winter 
Russia shut down the critical Nord Stream 1 pipeline this week, which carries natural gas to Germany 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of using energy as a weapon by keeping a critical pipeline to Germany shut down in recent days, exacerbating electricity and natural gas shortfalls ahead of the winter months. 
"Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European — in all countries of our continent," Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Saturday. 
 "Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles. This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans."

Stars and Stripes/Washington Post: Ukrainians line up to donate blood to save 'soldiers who are fighting for us' 
MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — Hundreds of civilians and soldiers lined up Saturday in response to calls for blood donations in this southern front-line city holding off Russian forces. 
"They said on TV that there was an urgent need for blood today," said Svitlana Mymokhod, 58, an accountant who began cooking for local army units after the Russian invasion in late February. 
When officials pleaded for B-negative donors, Mymokhod's blood type, it led her to donate for the first time in 20 years, she said as she methodically squeezed a rubber ball while crimson tubes led from her arm.  "We need to give more blood to save the soldiers who are fighting for us."

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the attacks took place across 13 different locations in the James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon areas of Saskatchewan on Sunday.

“At this stage in our investigation, we believe some of the victims have been targeted by the suspects and others have been attacked randomly,” Rhonda Blackmore, Assistant Commissioner of RCMP Saskatchewan, said.

Police issued a province-wide Dangerous Person Alert for two suspects, identified as Damien Sanderson and Myles Sanderson.

The search for both suspects was still underway as of Sunday night, police said.

“It is horrific what has happened in our province today,” Blackmore said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Post has revealed Joe Biden spent 234 days on vacation out of 589 days since becoming president.

Republicans have been calling out President Biden for being away from the White House for two-thirds of August.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates hit back back at the criticism of Mr Biden’s travelling, saying "presidency is a nonstop job that chief executives can do from anywhere in the world".

“Regardless of location, he has taken fewer vacation days than the modern norm," he said.

"Being somewhere other than the White House is not the same thing as being on vacation. 

"And President Biden is constantly focused on the numbers that are most important to the American people: lowering costs for families — like prescription drugs and energy — reducing the deficit to fight inflation, creating the most jobs of any year in American history and bringing manufacturing jobs back from overseas, growing the membership of NATO, and passing the most significant gun reform law in almost 30 years.”  

The 79-year-old's critics have mocked the constant travels, arguing the country runs better when the president is "away".

"Out of the last 32 days, Joe Biden has spent 23 of those days on vacation. I’m not criticizing him for it. Our nation is better off with him away on his medical retreats—I mean vacations," said Breanna Morello.

"41 per cent of Americans have picked up a side job while Joe Biden spent half of August on vacation," said Lance Gooden.]]></summary>

Washington Post: Chilean voters decisively reject leftist constitution 
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chileans on Sunday delivered a resounding rejection to a new leftist constitution that aimed to transform the country into a more egalitarian society. 
In a referendum, Chilean voters were asked to approve or reject a proposal to replace the country’s 1980 dictatorship-era constitution — considered one of the most market-friendly in the world — with one of the world’s most inclusive. 
The new charter envisioned a dramatic shift to the left in the South American nation, expanding the role of government and calling for an economic model that would narrow inequalities and help lift up the poor. 
But for many Chileans, the proposed changes were too drastic. 
With more than 95 percent of ballot boxes tallied Sunday night, about 62 percent of voters rejected the charter, while 38 percent approved it, according to Chile’s electoral authority.

WNU Editor: It was not even close .... With 96% of the votes counted in Sunday’s plebiscite, the rejection camp had 61.9% support compared to 38.1% for approval amid what appeared to be a heavy turnout with long lines at polling states. Voting was mandatory. (AP)

Duffy, a former congressman who spurred donald trump as an expert, and Oz, who was endorsed by the former president, apparently doesn’t think Trump is being called “angry.”

Republic World:  Putin's Visit To G20 Summit Will Be Decided On Many Factors Including Security: Kremlin  
Kremlin stated that the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the G20 summit would be determined after deciding "all factors". 
As the ruthless war between Russia and Ukraine continues unabated, the Kremlin stated that the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the G20 summit would be determined after deciding "all factors," which would also include security, Tass reported. Notably, the Bali Summit is scheduled to take place in Indonesia in November.

Update: Moscow speaks out on Putin’s G20 trip (RT)   
WNU Editor: The Indonesian President is already on the record that Putin will be traveling to Bali for the G20 Summit, but I will be surprised if Russian President Putin does go this November. The war in Ukraine and the Russian economy are the priorities for the Kremlin right now, not having a face to face meeting with leaders like Xi or Salman for a few hours. But then again, Putin does like these face-to-face meetings, and he may decide to go there anyway.]]></summary>

RT: Russia is unreliable energy partner – Germany 
Chancellor Scholz says his country has been severely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict   German Chancellor Olaf Scholz claimed on Sunday that Russia cannot be considered a reliable energy supplier, and accused Moscow of breaching its contractual obligations. 
Speaking at a news conference with party leaders from the Greens and pro-business FDP, he said Moscow was always a reliable energy partner “even during the Cold War,” but that the rule no longer applies.

Germany has seized control of a local unit of Russian natural-gas giant Gazprom, saying it will do 'what is necessary' to maintain energy supply in the country (Business Insider), the German Chancellor is delusional if he thinks this will not impact Russian natural gas exports to Germany.

* Former President Donald Trump slammed President Biden at a rally on Saturday and called him an enemy of the state 
* The rally was for Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, and also featured Marjorie Taylor Greene 
* Trump said Biden vilifies anybody who voted for Trump, referring to a divisive recent Biden speech 
* The former president stoked an old flame when he slammed Hillary Clinton during the speech, instigating chants of 'lock her up'

Former President Donald Trump slammed President Biden and the Democratic party at a rally on Saturday for Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and hinted at a possible presidential run in 2024. 
'As you know this week, Joe Biden came to Philadelphia Pennsylvania to give the most vicious, hateful and divisive speech ever delivered by an American president, vilifying 75 million citizens - plus probably another 75 to 150, if we want to be accurate about it,' Trump said of Biden's recent speech. 
'He's an enemy of the state, you want to know the truth.'

France’s minister for energy transition said Friday that French electricity giant EDF has committed to restart all its nuclear reactors by this winter to help the country through the broad energy crisis aggravated by the war in Ukraine. 
Agnès Pannier-Runacher said the government is taking steps to “avoid restrictive measures” over energy use in the peak winter cold season, following a special government meeting over energy issues. 
France relies on nuclear energy for about 67% of its electricity – more than any other country – and on gas for about 7%.

WNU Editor: Many of these reactors were shut down for maintenance issues. Hence the concerns over safety. But France is still dependent for a quarter of its electricity needs from other sources, and there will be a cost albeit a smaller one when compared to the UK, Germany, etc..

Bloomberg: Microsoft Combat Goggles Win First US Army Approval for Delivery 
(Bloomberg) -- The US Army is taking delivery of a first batch of high-tech combat goggles made by Microsoft Corp., citing encouraging results from testing in the field. 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Douglas Bush has “cleared the Army to begin accepting” some of the 5,000 sets of goggles, spokesman Jamal Beck said in a statement. 
Their delivery had been placed on hold over concern about the device’s performance until more rigorous testing took place.  Based on the test results so far the service “is adjusting its fielding plan to allow for time to correct deficiencies and also field to units that are focused on training activities,” Beck said.

 Simple Flying: Putin Says "There Has Not Been An Order Like This For A Long Time" 
Vladimir Putin and Aeroflot CEO Sergei Aleksandrovsky discussed an order for 323 Russian-built aircraft in the Kremlin last Friday. 
Last Friday, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, had a meeting with Aeroflot CEO Sergei Aleksandrovsky. The meeting was held in Moscow at the Kremlin, focusing on Aeroflot's work in passenger transportation.   
Straight down to business 
Simple Flying was, unfortunately, not invited to the August 26 meeting, but we do have the official transcript, which is a fascinating insight. It's an all-business meeting, or at least the transcript is, with a critical point about halfway through, when Putin asks the Aeroflot CEO, "What do you see in the mid-term?"

Zero Hedge: Sweden, Austria Start Bailing Out Energy Companies Triggering Europe's "Minsky Moment" 
Last weekend, Credit Suisse repo guru published what may have been the most insightful snippet of the entire European energy crisis (to date) when he extended the infamous "Minsky Moment" framework to Europe, and specifically Germany, which he said "can’t cover its payments without Russian gas and the government is asking citizens to conserve energy to leave more for industry." He then elaborated that "Minsky moments are triggered by excessive financial leverage, and in the context of supply chains, leverage means excessive operating leverage: in Germany, $2 trillion of value added depends on $20 billion of gas from Russia… …that’s 100-times leverage – much more than Lehman’s." (Zoltan's entire note is a must read for everyone with a passing interest in what comes next).

DW: Ukraine battles to avoid hyperinflation as war costs soar 
Ukraine's central bank has been de facto printing money to pay its troops, but the measure is unsustainable. More international support is vital, but how much new cash could be raised domestically? 
As the war against Russia enters its seventh month, Ukraine is stuck between a financial rock and a hard place as it seeks to stay afloat while fighting off Moscow's invading forces. 
Tax revenues have plummeted due to an economy in free fall while military spending has skyrocketed, leaving the government facing a budget shortfall of $5 billion (€5.02 billion) per month. 
To make up for the lack of cash, the country's central bank has effectively been printing money — buying government bonds to the tune of $7.7 billion over the past six months. The Financial Times reported that the printing presses effectively created $3.6 billion in June alone.

Iran announces defensive measures days after attempting to seize several U.S. drones from international waters  Iran has armed 51 cities and towns with a civil defense system aimed to respond to any foreign attack as tensions with the U.S. have mounted in recent weeks.

Axios: U.S. restricts chip sales to China 
Graphics-chip maker Nvidia announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales to China, "effective immediately."   
Driving the news: The U.S. government has imposed a new license requirement "for any future export to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia" in order to "address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a 'military end use,'" per the filing.   
Why it matters: The new rule marks a significant escalation in the Biden administration's efforts to prevent future supply chain crises and increase competition with China's government — as tensions with Beijing continue to simmer following visits to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other U.S. officials this month.

Four reported engine fires occurred over the past 90 days, the Army says. Here's everything to know about these heavy lift helicopters and their recent problems. 
The US Army operates hundreds of large helicopters called Chinooks. The flying machine’s job is straightforward and unflashy: To transport people or equipment. But the Chinook fleet is not going anywhere right now, because the Army has grounded them. The problem leading to the grounding is a series of engine fires—there have been four reported fires over the past 90 days, according to an Army spokesperson. 
The news of the vast grounding was reported earlier this week by The Wall Street Journal. 
Here’s what to know about this unique military helicopter and why it was grounded.

Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations has said it’s “alarming” that no one from the 56-member Russian advance team and delegation headed by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has received a U.S. entry visa to attend a UN General Assembly debate in New York later this month. 
“This is even more alarming since for the last several months the authorities of the United States have been constantly refusing to grant entry visas to a number of Russian delegates assigned to take part in the official United Nations events,” Vasily Nebenzia said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 
Nebenzia said applications to attend the high-level UN meetings starting September 19 had been submitted to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
