FOX News: Family forced to pay to ship body of Marine killed after Pentagon policy change: 'Egregious injustice'

 
Nonprofit stepped in to pay $60,000 to move Sgt Nicole Gee's remains to Arlington National Cemetery 
A Republican lawmaker is sounding the alarm after being notified that one of the 13 Gold Star families from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was forced to pay to move the body of their loved one.

Nicole L. Gee, who were forced to find funding in the thousands to move her body to its final resting place after her 2021 death in Afghanistan. 
The Gee family secured the funding, which came to "a staggering $60,000," to move their loved one's body after a nonprofit organization stepped in to cover the cost, Mills said.

Messenger: Freed in Russia Prisoner Swap, US Marine Injured Fighting in Ukraine (Exclusive)

 
US officials are frustrated that Trevor Reed went to Ukraine after the efforts made to bring him home from Russia 
A Marine veteran who was freed from Russia in a 2022 prisoner exchange has volunteered to fight for Ukraine and is now asking for U.S. government help after sustaining injuries on the battlefield, The Messenger has learned. 
Trevor Reed was wounded after stepping on a landmine roughly two weeks ago, according to two U.S. military officials who were briefed on the events. Reed had spent more than two years in Russian custody before winning his freedom in April 2022. 
The officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to Defense Department regulations, said they did not know the extent of Reed’s injuries but said he had suffered shrapnel wounds from the explosion. One of the sources said Reed was being treated in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and had requested transfer to an American military facility in either Germany or Poland.

AFP: UN talks seek to fix 'broken' global food system 
A three-day United Nations summit opened in Rome on Monday aimed at tackling a "broken" global food system where millions are starving, two billion are overweight or obese and the planet is suffering. 
The food systems summit comes amid growing food insecurity around the world, with UN agencies warning of an increasing number of people suffering from chronic hunger. 
"In a world of plenty, it is outrageous that people continue to suffer and die from hunger," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the opening of the meeting. 
"Global food systems are broken -- and billions of people are paying the price."

The ability to engage targets at operational and strategic depth critically enables the conduct of offensive and defensive maneuvers and can shape the conditions for victory on the battlefield.  Yet, as a result of structural underfunding and different procurement priorities, European states have long ignored the shift towards stand-off range and precision strike in modern war. This has resulted in European missile arsenals not fit for purpose for high-intensity warfare. Deliveries of long-range strike weapons to Ukraine will further reinforce

The shock of invasion has expanded NATO’s ranks and galvanized unprecedented transatlantic security cooperation. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping’s refusal to condemn the actions of his “best and bosom friend” has fueled suspicions about Beijing’s intentions in European capitals, raising the perceived probability of war in the Indo-Pacific and creating new possibilities for

ABC News Australia: The behind-the-scenes story of the mysterious 'nuclear football' that follows the US president everywhere 
The heavy black bag that follows the US president's every step, commonly nicknamed the "nuclear football" has been shrouded in secrecy for decades. 
But the most important — and mysterious — "football" in the world isn't really a football at all. 
Officially called the "Presidential Emergency Satchel", the nuclear football is a bulky briefcase that contains atomic war plans and enables the president to transmit nuclear orders to the Pentagon. 
The heavy case is carried by a military officer who is never far behind the president. 
But apart from sightings as the commander-in-chief boards a helicopter or exits meetings with world leaders, many details of the case remain classified.

Business Insider: Air forces are ditching runways to prepare their jets to keep operating when enemies aim for their bases 
* The British air force plans to operate its Typhoon and F-35B jets on highways in the next year. 
* It is meant to be a test of the British air force's ability to operate away from its main bases. 
* Many militaries use highways as runways, and it's getting new interest as threats to airbases grow. 
The war in Ukraine has reinforced many things that militaries knew about major conflicts. One of the most important is that air power is vital to ensuring ground forces survive and advance. 
But sustaining power in the air requires having places where jets and helicopters can land, refuel, and rearm. On a modern battlefield, where long-range weapons can reach far behind the frontlines and drones constantly roam overhead, protecting aircraft from the enemy is hard.

Politico: China secretly sends enough gear to Russia to equip an army

 
Shipments of military-capable hardware expose a China-sized loophole in Western sanctions. 
The pictures posted on the Chinese company’s website show a tall, Caucasian man with a crew cut and flattened nose inspecting body armor at its factory.
“This spring, one of our customers came to our company to confirm the style and quantity of bulletproof vests, and carefully tested the quality of our vests,” Shanghai H Win, a manufacturer of military-grade protective gear, proudly reported on its website in March. The customer “immediately directly confirmed the order quantity of bulletproof vests and subsequent purchase intention.” 
The identity of the smiling customer isn’t clear, but there’s a fair chance he was Russian: According to customs records obtained by POLITICO, Russian buyers have declared orders for hundreds of thousands of bulletproof vests and helmets made by Shanghai H Win — the items listed in the documents match those in the company’s online catalog.

(Reuters) - Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Monday that it had found traces of explosives on a ship travelling from Turkey to the port of Rostov-on-Don in Russia to pick up grain. 
The FSB said the ship had been docked in the Ukrainian port of Kiliia in May, and that it may have been used to deliver explosives to Ukraine.
It said the ship had changed its name while in the Turkish port of Tuzla earlier this month and replaced its crew, which had consisted of 12 Ukrainian nationals.

A “conversation has commenced” with North Korea over US Army Pvt. Travis King, who crossed the border between North and South Korea last week in the demilitarized zone separating the two nations, the deputy commander of the United Nations Command (UNC) said Monday.
King, believed to be the first US soldier to cross into North Korea since 1982, had a history of assault, was facing disciplinary action over his conduct and was meant to go back to the US the day before the incident.

Soldiers tell Sky News how they have discovered mines and booby traps hidden in doors and in the magazines of automatic weapons - and even attached to dead bodies. 
For the members of the demining unit in Ukraine's 35th marine brigade, every step is fraught with peril - every action is beset with risk - during a period that has been particularly dangerous. 
As the Ukrainians press ahead with their summer offensive, the Russians have countered with Soviet-era tactics.

Territory and communities along the 1,000km (621 mile) frontier have been saturated with anti-personnel mines, anti-vehicle and anti-tank mines, and remotely-detonated mines.

The fighting broke out on April 15 as the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) vied for power. 
Since then, more than 3 million people have been uprooted, including more than 700,000 who have fled to neighbouring countries. Some 1,136 people have been killed, according to the health ministry, though officials believe the number is higher.

No casualties were reported, Russian officials said. 
Several drone attacks struck Crimea and Moscow overnight, causing the evacuation of several villages in the Russian-occupied peninsula and damaging buildings in the vicinity of the defense ministry in the Russian capital, Russian officials said Monday. 
“Drone strikes on two non-residential buildings were recorded at around four o’clock this morning,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in the early hours of Monday, adding there had been “no serious damage or casualties.” 
“Two Ukrainian UAVs were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed” over Moscow, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement, accusing Kyiv of being responsible for the attack.

Israel's parliament on Monday passed the Netanyahu coalition's controversial bill that will significantly limit the Supreme Court's ability to review government decisions, despite mass protests and pressure from the Biden administration to not rush the vote.

 
Why it matters: It's the first piece of legislation that is part of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul — a plan that has destabilized Israel's economy, military and foreign relations. 
* Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition have for months faced mass anti-government protests over the plan. Thousands of Israeli reservists, including fighter pilots and members of the intelligence, cyber and special operations units in the IDF, warned in recent days they will not report to duty if the bill passed.

The center-right Popular Party won the most votes but does not appear to have a path to form a government. 
MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is poised to remain prime minister as a result of Sunday’s inconclusive national elections in which the center-right Popular Party won the most votes but was left with no clear path to form a government. 
As expected, none of Spain’s major parties secured a governing majority. 
With 99 percent of the votes tallied, the Popular Party had 136 seats, the Socialists 122, the far-right Vox 33, and the left-wing Sumar 31. 
Prior to the vote, conservative leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo indicated that he would be willing to form a coalition government with Vox, but both parties fell short of the 176 seats needed to control the Spanish parliament.

So says the "liberal" New York Times 
Three days ago, I got a story in my New York Times email feed on “A Turning Point in Military Spending.” The article celebrated the greater willingness of NATO members as well as countries like Japan to spend more on military weaponry, which, according to the “liberal” NYT, will help to preserve democracy. Interestingly, even as NATO members have started to spend more, the Pentagon is still demanding yet higher budgets, abetted by Congress. I thought if NATO spent more, the USA could finally spend less? 
No matter. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the hyping of what used to be called the “Yellow Peril,” today read “China,” is ensuring record military spending in the USA as yearly Pentagon budgets approach $900 billion. That figure does not include the roughly $120 billion or more in aid already provided to Ukraine in its war with Russia. And since the Biden administration’s commitment to Ukraine remains open-ended, you can add scores of billion more to that sum if the war persists into the fall and winter.

Modern Diplomacy: U.S. report: One third of Ukraine’s Bradley vehicles taken out 
Following the delivery of American M2 Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine in April, multiple Western sources have reported at least one third of the vehicles have been visually confirmed as having been abandoned, damaged or destroyed, ‘Military Watch Magazine’ informs. 
This was supported by prior reports, including one from the New York Times, highlighting that Ukraine’s Western-trained 47th Mechanised Brigade had lost 30 percent of its Bradleys within just two weeks. 
 The first images of the vehicles taking heavy losses in combat, alongside German supplied Leopard 2A6 tanks, emerged in early June. Although Washington has pledged to continue to supply new Bradleys to Ukraine, and to eventually supplement them with M1A2 Abrams tanks, it has also repeatedly been made clear by officials and lawmakers in the United States that the future of arms supplies to the Eastern European country will depend heavily on the success of its new offensives.

WNU Editor: As of today there there been no official confirmation from Ukraine or its allies on what are Ukraine's exact armor losses. But when you have Russian President Putin bragging that Ukraine lost 15 Leopards and 20 Bradleys in one day, even if Putin is exaggerating the losses must be very high .... 15 Leopards, 20 Bradleys destroyed in one day, Putin confirms (RT).]]></summary>

Wall Street Journal: Ukraine's Lack of Weaponry and Training Risks Stalemate in Fight With Russia 
BRUSSELS—When Ukraine launched its big counteroffensive this spring, Western military officials knew Kyiv didn’t have all the training or weapons—from shells to warplanes—that it needed to dislodge Russian forces. But they hoped Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day. 
They haven’t. Deep and deadly minefields, extensive fortifications and Russian air power have combined to largely block significant advances by Ukrainian troops. Instead, the campaign risks descending into a stalemate with the potential to burn through lives and equipment without a major shift in momentum. 
As the likelihood of any large-scale breakthrough by the Ukrainians this year dims, it raises the unsettling prospect for Washington and its allies of a longer war—one that would require a huge new infusion of sophisticated armaments and more training to give Kyiv a chance at victory.

Update: West knew Ukraine wasn't ready for counteroffensive – WSJ (RT)

 
WNU Editor: The West has always underestimated Russia, with this counteroffensive being just another example of the West underestimating Russia. 
Sighhh ....
The hope in the West that Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day reminds me of something that Hillary Clinton said a decade ago. Hope is not a strategy. But apparently for the West and Ukraine's political leaders hope was the strategy.]]></summary>

“Bill has always given me clear, straightforward analysis that prioritizes the safety and security of the American people, reflecting the integral role the C.I.A. plays in our national security decision-making at this critical time,” Mr. Biden said in a statement.

Daily Beast: Taiwan’s ‘Doomsday Drills’: A Chilling Glimpse of War With China

 
The drill simulating a Chinese attack will include shelter orders and traffic stops, bringing cities to a near standstill in hopes of giving civilians the best shot at survival. 
From Monday through Thursday this week, Taiwan will be running a defense exercise simulating a Chinese air attack, preparing civilians for what to do if China invades. And from Monday through Friday, Taiwan will be running a live-fire exercise to test Taiwan’s combat readiness to respond to a Chinese invasion, according to the Ministry of National Defense. 
Civilians will be required to shelter in place when the defense drill is underway, according to CNA. In some locales, drivers out on the streets will be asked to stop their cars and evacuate them, as will passengers on public transportation, bringing cities to a near standstill, according to Taipei’s Department of Transportation. 
The entire drill is aimed at reducing casualties in the case of an attack from China, which has been growing increasingly aggressive towards Taiwan. Over the last few weeks, China has sent a record number of warships to waters surrounding Taiwan. According to American officials, the current U.S. government assessment is that Chinese President Xi Jinping is working to be prepared for conflict in either 2025 or 2027.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cohen, who has previously said that former president Donald Trump's disrespect for the security of classified information really amounts to a disrespect for the men and women behind that classified information who put their lives on the line for the country, was asked on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta about the "far-right Republicans" who argue that culture war add-ons recently passed in the House as part of a military budget "will help rid the military to what they describe as wokeness."
Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
"We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars," he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a "wokeness problem," Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
"What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?"

In the morning, a tourist suffered a mild heat stroke while visiting the Acropolis, Athens' archaeological landmark. She was taken to hospital but is not in danger, the emergency services said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of "permanent, irreversible harm" to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister's granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps' successor Mark Harper said he was "satisfied" that the project's "harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits".
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
"This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it's not over yet," Gooding said.

The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a "sexual bully" who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men's crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a "big flirt" but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Nikolai", a 21-year-old transgender man, says he does not know how he can keep living in Russia after lawmakers moved to outlaw gender transitions.
The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine.
"I feel total despair," said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
"If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned," he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadly fires have raged for a century in mines in India's Jharkhand state, where Savitri Mahto is one of 100,000 people risking their lives shovelling coal to supply insatiable demand.
"The land is charred because of the fires," said Mahto, 22, illegally scavenging amid the flames on the edge of a vast commercial opencast mine for the dirty fossil fuel. "We live in fear every day".
Underground fires, which scientists believe started in a mine accident in 1916, create sinkholes that swallow people and homes. Coal pickers and activists report hundreds of people have died over the decades.
"Accidents have happened before, and they keep on happening because the land is sinking," Mahto told AFP, as she tended a stack of burning rocks to produce coking coal, a more stable fuel sold for cooking a…]]></summary>

The country may be synonymous with the beautiful game, but it banned women from the sport for nearly four decades until 1979.
Ahead of the Women's World Cup starting next week in Australia and New Zealand, where Brazil will be in action, Mendes recalled the lengths she went to in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a soccer player.
As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil's impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.
She used to dig a hole next to the pitch to hide in until the enforcers left, then crawled out again to continue kicking the ball aroun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Athens Acropolis, Greece's top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening "to protect workers and visitors", Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
"It's highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday)," the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
"Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?" asked Blitzer.
"He needs to lift the holdings," said Austin. "This is a national security issue, a readiness issue."
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin's call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?" asked Blitzer.
"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy," said Austin. "I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them."
"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?" asked Blitzer.
"That's our policy," said Austin.

"Put on your CIA director cap for a moment," said Tapper. "What do you think went through Putin's mind today when President Biden declared that Putin has already lost the war?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been "eaten alive."
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates "do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door." 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions," she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a "racial justice issue," citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doctors were able to complete a "miracle" surgery where they reattached a boy's head who had suffered an "internal decapitation" as a result of being hit by a car while he was riding his bike, Fox News reported.  
Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was "almost completely detached from the base of his neck." The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use "new plates and fixations in the damaged area." 
"Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room," Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
"The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing," Einav said.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-13T14:52:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a "big flirt" but denied any "aggressive" behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to "come off the road".
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said "it didn't happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way".
"It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic," Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a "big flirt".
But the alleged victim "made it clear that he did not want to go any further," the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt "crushed" after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a "stab in the back".
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as "madness".
"I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn't and never have to anyone in my life," Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn't recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", was artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
