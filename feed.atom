Chinese refiners have increased their crude oil purchases ahead of the year’s end as they see higher fuel exports in the final months of the year. 
According to Bloomberg, Chinese companies have bought at least 10 million barrels of crude over the past week, mostly from the Middle East, West Africa, and Brazil, signaling the demand situation has changed for the better. 
One of the main reasons for this demand optimism is the global diesel shortage. A decline in global refining capacity, especially in Europe and the United States has curbed the supply of the fuel that is essential for every economy and now there are warning signals flashing on both sides of the Atlantic.

Update: China Goes On Crude Buying Spree After OPEC+ Cuts (Zero Hedge)   
WNU Editor: While the US is emptying out its strategic oil reserve, the Chinese are stocking up with the expectation that the price of oil is going skyward in the coming weeks. 
OPEC+ cutting oil production. EU ban on Russian oil starting in December. The signs are all there for $100 USD/barrel and more in 2023.   
Update #2: This top US banker is right .... Jamie Dimon Says “We are getting energy completely wrong” and He's Right (Mish Talk). 
Update #3: US Diesel supplies continue to fall, and prices continue to climb .... Gas prices down again, diesel higher (DRGNews). Pray for warm weather.]]></summary>

Outrage over her killing has led to protests worldwide – women chopped off their hair and many Muslim women burned their hijabs.

   Reuters: Czech Protesters Call for New Government, Direct Gas Talks With Russia 
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Czechs protested in Prague on Friday, demanding the centre-right government step down to allow an early election and calling for talks with Russia on gas supplies ahead of winter.

Police estimated the crowd in the lower tens of thousands, less than the two previous rallies.

France and Germany want to negotiate with Washington about unfair competition — but they are ready to hit back if necessary. 
BERLIN/PARIS — After publicly falling out, Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron have found something they agree on: mounting alarm over unfair competition from the U.S. and the potential need for Europe to hit back. 
The German chancellor and the French president discussed their joint concerns during nearly three-and-a-half hours of talks over a lunch of fish, wine and Champagne in Paris on Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, the Delaware Supreme Court has become the latest US judicial body to backtrack access to vote when that struck the state’s recently passed same-day registration and mail-in voting laws.

That this latest attack on the vote took place in deep blue Delaware – the president’s home Joe Biden and proud ambassador of its history as the first state to ratify our Constitution — makes the symbolism particularly painful.

* The Pentagon published its National Defense Strategy on Thursday 
* It is a declassified form of a classified document already circulated to lawmakers 
* Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin briefed reporters on its contents 
* He was asked if cutting a sea-launched missile sent the right message to Putin 
* 'He understands what our capability is,' said Austin in response 
Eight months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with China stepping up its nuclear, space and cyberforce capabilities, on Thursday the Pentagon defended its decision to scrap development of a new sea-launched cruise missile. 
The decision to cancel the submarine-launched cruise missile comes even though senior military figures wanted it to continue. 
And at the same time the Pentagon also confirmed it was retiring the B83-1 gravity bomb - 80 to 100 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.

Three demonstrators have been killed during clashes with Iranian security forces in the western town of Mahabad, state media has reported. 
The protesters reportedly targeted government buildings after attending the memorial ceremony of a man killed during unrest in the country. 
Security forces also reportedly opened fire at a cemetery near Khorramabad. 
Rights group Amnesty International says security forces have killed eight people since Wednesday. 
Unrest has rocked the country since Mahsa Amini died in police custody 40 days ago after allegedly wearing her Islamic headscarf "improperly".

WNU Editor: This blog has covered many protests in Iran over the years. But this one is different. It is happening in most of the country, and people of all ages are involved. But as long as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards with their guns continue to support and protect the leadership, it is unfortunate but change is not going to happen in Iran anytime soon.

Jair Bolsonaro takes on socialist candidate and former president Lula in Brazil's run-off election on Sunday
RIO DE JANEIRO - Embattled incumbent Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro closed out his underdog campaign last night in his home state of Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of enthusiastic Bolsonaro supporters, clad in Brazil’s yellow soccer jerseys, packed the plaza in Campo Grande, a western suburb of Rio de Janeiro. 
Amidst scorching heat, which caused a few medical emergencies, popular Brazilian televangelist Silas Malafaia, and Rio de Janeiro Governor Claudio Castro warmed up the crowd. The gathering was part military muster, part campaign rally and part religious revival. 
The run-off election will be held this Sunday.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Polls in the first round of Brazil's Presidential election were predicting a landslide win for Lula. That did not happen, and in fact Bolsonaro's party did not only win key regional elections but also control of both chambers of Congress .... Right-wing wins in Brazil's Congress show staying power of 'Bolsonarismo' (Reuters). 
Will the same happen on Sunday? 
I do not know. 
But I do know that if Lula does win the Presidency, he will be facing a Congress that will oppose him.

CBC: RCMP running short of officers to protect cabinet ministers from a growing number of threats  
Ministers' teams don't always agree with the RCMP's assessments of danger levels 
The RCMP's close protection unit is running short of the specialized officers it needs to protect elected officials, undermining its ability to respond to federal ministers' growing demands for security services, new figures show. 
In the Ottawa region alone, 75 positions out of a total of 315 in the RCMP's protection unit are unstaffed — a vacancy rate of 24 per cent — according to data obtained by Radio-Canada. Similar vacancy rates afflict the RCMP's close protection units in other parts of the country, the RCMP said. 
Several RCMP and government officials said the shortage of officers is complicating the force's efforts to protect the prime minister, the Governor General, Supreme Court justices, diplomats and foreign dignitaries.
"Even for the prime minister, they are short-staffed at the moment," said a government source.

WNU Editor: The RCMP's focus and priority is to protect Prime Minister Trudeau. And that focus has exploded to protection levels that no former Canadian PM has ever had. Check out the PM's motorcade in Montreal two months ago (see below).

— Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) October 28, 2022
   DW: German president calls for unity in 'state of nation' speech 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned of "tougher years" ahead for Germany and also called for action on climate change and pledged support for Ukraine. 
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivered what has been dubbed a "state of the nation" speech on Friday at his official residence, Bellevue Palace. The theme of his remarks was "what connects us makes us stronger." 
The speech came at a time of uncertainly for Germany, and Steinmeier touched on many of the issues weighing on the minds of many people in the country. These included a cost of living crisis amidst soaring inflation and an energy crunch, as well as the war in Ukraine.   
Read more ....   
Update #1: 'No room for old dreams', German president says of Russia ties (Reuters)  
Update #2: Steinmeier says Germany, Russia "are standing against each other" (TASS)   
WNU Editor: The success of Germany's industrial base has been due to three factors. An innovative and hard working population, coupled with stable governments and having access to cheap and stable energy supplies from Russia. 
No more now. 
Germany is now forced to buy from other energy suppliers that are not cheap, and definitely not stable. In turn the impact on the German economy from this energy cut-off has in turn been disastrous, with Germany's industrial base now closing down and looking to relocate elsewhere. 
So yes. 
In his speech the German President is correct that the cost of living crisis amidst soaring inflation and an energy crunch is on the minds of most Germans. But German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and what is worse, no change in policies.
 Update #3: Maybe I talked to soon on Germany not changing its policies .... Germany Is Dismantling A Wind Farm To Make Way For A Coal Mine (OilPrice.com).]]></summary>

Israel and Lebanon finalized an agreement defining their maritime borders in the Mediterranean on Thursday, President Joe Biden announced on Twitter, inking a United States-brokered deal at the United Nations mission on the land border between the countries. 
The signing ceremony officially settles a years-long maritime border dispute involving major oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean.  The neighboring countries – still formally at war – had been at odds for years over an area of the sea off the coast of Israel and Lebanon. 
The area in question touches the Karish oil and gas field and a region known as the Qanaa prospect. The deal gives oil and gas rights in the Karish field to Israel, while Lebanon gets access to the Qanaa prospect – with Israel earning 17% of the profits.

North Korea fired two, short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) off its east coast on Friday, South Korea's military has said, while it has been wrapping up nearly two weeks of major drills aimed at deterring its neighbour. 
This latest launch — at a time of growing fears that North Korea is readying for its first nuclear test since 2017 — was the latest in a record year of its tests, whether of short-range missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), or other weapons.

Beijing understands the Ukraine situation perfectly, the Russian president told the Valdai Club  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has revealed that he did not give advance notice of the special operation in Ukraine to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. There was no need, Putin said on Thursday at the Valdai Discussion Club meeting, adding that Russia and China are both sovereign nations and that Beijing has a clear understanding of the situation in Ukraine. 
“No,” Putin said, when moderator Fyodor Lukyanov asked if he’d told Xi about the military operation – which started on February 24 – when the two leaders met twenty days prior. Nor was Xi resentful or offended by that, the Russian president explained.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese cities from Wuhan in central China to Xining in the northwest are doubling down on COVID-19 curbs, sealing up buildings, locking down districts and throwing millions into distress in a scramble to halt widening outbreaks. 
China on Thursday reported a third straight day of more than 1,000 new COVID cases nationwide, a modest tally compared with the tens of thousands per day that sent Shanghai into a full-blown lockdown earlier this year but enough to trigger more restrictions across the country. 
China's coronavirus case load has remained small by global standards, but its ultra-strict and disruptive containment measures this year against the highly transmissible Omicron variant have weighed heavily on the world's second-largest economy.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine will have long-lasting effects on energy supply and markets, a new report suggests. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the world faces its first "truly global energy crisis" as a result. 
 It added that unaffordable energy bills remain a huge problem, driven up as the exports of oil and gas have been restricted. 
But the crisis should also be seen as a turning point, speeding up the world's transition to green energy, it said. 
"With unrelenting geopolitical and economic concerns, energy markets remain extremely vulnerable, and the crisis is a reminder of the fragility and unsustainability of the current global energy system. 
"The heaviest burden is falling on poorer households where a larger share of income is spent on energy", the report warned.

A local energy supplier, Yasno, warned that existing blackouts could last a lot longer than a previously planned schedule of four-hour outages and that the capital already faced an electricity deficit of about 30% or more.

“I just think it’s going to be a write-off, really."

Ms Krakue said also Prince Harry has led "quite an interesting life" and that he does have a lot of "stuff of substance to say".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Pentagon’s Strategy Won’t Rule Out Nuclear Use Against Non-Nuclear Threats 
(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon’s new National Defense Strategy rejected limits on using nuclear weapons long championed by arms control advocates and in the past by President Joe Biden. 
Citing burgeoning threats from China and Russia, the Defense Department said in the document released Thursday that “by the 2030s the United States will, for the first time in its history face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries.” 
In response, the US will “maintain a very high bar for nuclear employment” without ruling out using the weapons in retaliation to a non-nuclear strategic threat to the homeland, US forces abroad or allies.

Update: Pentagon Reverses Strategy, No Longer Rules Out Use Of Nukes Against Non-Nuclear Threat While Putin Declares ‘No Reason’ For Russia To Use Nukes (New Wars)   
WNU Editor: This is a major policy change, and one that President Biden hmself promised not to change during the 2020 Presidential campaign. 
The Defense Department’s 2022 National Defense Strategy is here .... 2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States.    
Update #2: Going through the 2022 National Strategy document right now. From what I have read so far, it is a document that reflects how tense and dangerous the world is becoming. In the meantime the critics are appalled by what they are reading .... 'A Terrifying Document': Critics Say Biden Nuclear Policy Makes the World More Dangerous (Common Dreams).   
Update #3: Putin is always reminding people of this (see below): 

Putin: The only country in the world that has used nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state is the United States of America

Zero Hedge: Putin's 'Viceroy Of The Donbas' & Top Confidant Seen As Likely Successor To Presidency 
During the opening months of the Ukraine war top US generals and officials went on record predicting that the conflict is likely to drag on for "years" to come. For example a headline in March observed it will turn into a quagmire, and that lawmakers at the Capitol were briefed "it is likely to last 10, 15, or 20 years." 
And now, fast-forward to the invasion's eight-month mark, where it does look to be settling in to a protracted stalemated situation. All the while speculation over the future of "Putin's war" and even his personal health abounds, with sensational headlines such as this in the UK Times this month: "Putin at 70: isolated, irrational and fearing for his health."   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: Sergey Kiriyenko has been a Kremlin insider for decades (link here) who has deep ties to Putin .... Sergey Kiriyenko, the ‘Viceroy of the Donbas’ who helped launch Putin’s career (France 24). 
He is a hardliner, and Ukraine intelligence believes he is the one who will succeed Putin .... Kiriyenko sees himself as Putin successor, says Ukrainian military intelligence (The New Voice of Ukraine). Ukraine has also marked him as a target .... Putin's Right Hand Man Narrowly Avoids Ukraine Ambush–Report (Newsweek). 
Bottom line. 
Sergey Kiriyenko is as establishment as you can get in Russia. But he does not have a political base outside of the Kremlin, which is why he will not be the one replacing Putin. But he will be one of many players on who will be Putin's replacement.]]></summary>

* The US Army and Navy successfully launched a rocket at a Virginia NASA facility on Wednesday, the Pentagon confirmed 
* NASA's Wallop Flight Facility in Virginia hosted the launch for testing of a new class of hypersonic weapons 
* The testing of the weapons comes as Russia and China have had more success building the weapons than the US 
The US Army and Navy successfully launched a rocket while testing a new class of hypersonic weapons at a seaside NASA facility, the Pentagon confirmed. 
NASA's Wallop Flight Facility in Virginia hosted the test by Sandia National Laboratories which evaluated hypersonic weapon communications and navigation equipment as well as advanced materials that can withstand the heat in a 'realistic hypersonic environment,' according to a Navy statement. 
The testing comes amid growing concerns Russia and China have had more success developing their own hypersonic weapons than the US.

U.S. energy executives told Jennifer Granholm that shuttered crude oil refineries won’t restart, Valero’s Chief Executive Joe Gorder said on Tuesday. 
The comments were made to the U.S. Energy Secretary at a recent White House meeting with energy executives, Reuters reported on Tuesday. 
“The one interesting thing that came out of it, too, was there was consideration for the ability to restart refining capacity that had been shut down, and  I think the general sentiment was that wasn’t going to happen,” Gorder said.

CNBC: The U.S. Army is struggling to find the recruits its needs to win the fight over the future 
* The U.S. Army. fell short of its 2022 recruitment goal by 25%, and recently cut its projection for its total force for this year by 10,000. 
* U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said at the CNBC Work Summit on Wednesday that it’s become harder for the military to compete for recruits. 
* Like all large employees, a tight labor market is a factor, but the health issues of young Americans including obesity, and misperceptions about serving after 20 years of war, are big issues to overcome. 
The U.S. Army is spending more than ever before on technology to replace an aging military infrastructure, from artificial intelligence to new fighting machines moving 1980s tanks off the field of battle. 
But the Secretary of the U.S. Army says the nation risks falling behind in the race against China if it can’t recruit enough Americans into the service to be trained on how national defense is being remade for future conflicts.

London CNN Business  — Europe has more natural gas than it knows what to do with. So much, in fact, that spot prices briefly went negative earlier this week. 
For months, officials have warned of an energy crisis this winter as Russia — once the region’s biggest supplier of natural gas — slashed supplies in retaliation for sanctions Europe imposed over its invasion of Ukraine. 
Now, EU gas storage facilities are close to full, tankers carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) are lining up at ports, unable to unload their cargoes, and prices are tumbling. 
The price of benchmark European natural gas futures has dropped 20% since last Thursday, and by more than 70% since hitting a record high in late August. On Monday, Dutch gas spot prices for delivery within an hour — which reflect real time European market conditions — dipped below €0, according to data from the Intercontinental Exchange.

Update #1: Natural-Gas Prices Have Plunged. Why It Might Not Last. (Barrons)  
Update #2: Energy crisis: Europe's gas prices fall below €100 MWh for the first time since mid-June (Euronews)   
WNU Editor: No one expects this to last. Prices are still double from last year, and a cold winter is going to boost these prices to record highs.   I say enjoy the break in prices, and hope that this is going to be a warm winter.]]></summary>

A U.S. aircraft carrier is prepared to lead an international charge should Russia escalate attacks against Ukraine and its allies. 
The USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77), christened in 2006 and delivered to the Navy in 2009, is in the Adriatic Sea leading Neptune Strike 2022—a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) deployment that tests deterrence and defense in the Euro-Atlantic area. 
Allied and partner nations taking part include Albania, Canada, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Update: 'Ready for anything': US aircraft carrier crew training for war with Russia but aims to deter threats (SKY News)   
WNU Editor: Is Ukraine vital to America's strategic interests? Is it enough to justify the US going to war with Russia over this region? 
Sighhh .... so much has now been invested in this conflict by Western governments that I have to say yes. 
But are European and American citizens as committed as their governments to go to war? 
The polls say yes to providing aid .... Majority of Americans say U.S. should back Ukraine until Russia withdraws (Axios). But is there support for actually sending US forces to directly engage in war against Russia? To have an actual war with all the damage and destruction that it will cause on both sides? Maybe even resulting in a limited or massive nuclear exchange?

My gut says no.
