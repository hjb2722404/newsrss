        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two million baby swings and swings were recalled on Monday for posing a strangulation hazard after one baby died and another was rescued from entanglement.
Restraint straps on MamaRoo swings and RockaRoo rockers hang below the seat when not in use, creating the possibility that crawling babies can get caught in them, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has declared.
The company behind the two models, 4moms, “has received two reports of entanglement incidents involving infants becoming entangled in the strap under the unoccupied MamaRoo infant swing after crawling under the seat, including a 10-month-old baby who died of asphyxiation, and a 10-month-old baby who suffered bruising to his neck before being rescued by a caregiver,” a safety commission statement said.

Workers are paid as W-2 employees, not independent contractors, which means they are still protected by federal labor laws and elements of the social safety net, including the workers’ compensation for injury.
Snagajob, an hourly work platform, says these shifts have tripled from 2020 to 2021, and are likely to quintuple in 2022 – mostly as a side income because people’s regular jobs weren’t enough.
“I think if they got the ultimate flexibility and all the compensation they wanted from their full-time employer, there would probably be less need for shifts,” said Snagajob chief executive Mathieu Stevenson.  “But the reality is, in the overwhe…]]></summary>

She had studied conflict security and development, a subject she became interested in after living in Hong Kong during the 2019 pro-democracy protests, and began applying for jobs in the United States and Europe. 
Hearing no response, she poured her energy into volunteer work, and in March she began helping family friend Rachel Brooks, who ran an after-school English program for local students, and also started helping out at an abbey in Cavagnolo that was hosting Ukrainian refugees. 
“I was like, ‘OK, tell me what to do,'” Ms Bovi said, about her  work at the abbey.  “I studied this in school, but I don’t have any concrete experience.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TikTok’s design makes it a breeding ground for misinformation, the researchers found.  They wrote that the videos could easily be manipulated and reposted on the platform and featured alongside stolen or original content.  Pseudonyms are common;  parody and comedy videos are easily misinterpreted as fact;  popularity affects the visibility of comments;  and the data about posting time and other details are not clearly displayed on the mobile app.
(Shorenstein Center researchers noted, however, that TikTok is less vulnerable to so-called brigadier, in which groups coordinate to spread a message widely, than platforms like Twitter or Facebook.)
In the first quarter of 2022, more than 60% of videos containing harmful misinformation were viewed by users before being deleted, TikTok said.  Last year, a group of behavioral scientists who had worked with TikTok said an effort to attach warnings to posts with unsubstantiated content reduced sharing by 24% but limited views by just 5%.
The researchers said misinformation will continue to thrive on TikTok as long as the platform refuses to disclose data about the origins of its videos or share information about its algorithms.  Last month, TikTok said it would offer access to a version of its application programming interface, or API, this year, but it didn’t say whether it would do so until the midterms.
Filippo Menczer, professor of computer science and computer science and director of the Indiana University Social Media Observatory, said he had offered research collaborations to TikTok and had been told ” Absolutely not”.
“At least with Facebook and Twitter, there is some level of transparency, but, in the case of TikTok, we have no idea,” he said.  “Without resources, without being able to access the data, we don’t know who is suspended, what content is removed, if it acts on reports or what the criteria are.  It’s completely opaque and we can’t independently assess anything.

Iran and Russia have expanded the level of their strategic cooperation in various fields. Most recently in space, when a Russian rocket launched an Iranian satellite into orbit from a Russian spaceport in Kazakhstan, writes analyst and Middle East expert Elijah J. Magnier. 
Russia signed a contract with Iran to buy 1,000 drones after Iran supplied several aircraft and a simulator on which Russian officers trained: they successfully used the first drones in Ukraine. The move is considered unprecedented for a superpower that buys drones from Iran. Tehran considers it recognition of its advanced and efficient military industry, achieved despite 43 years of US sanctions against the Islamic Republic.

WNU Editor: I am unsure about the 1,000 number, but US intelligence believes Russian operators have been training on these drones for the past few weeks .... Russian officials trained in Iran as part of drone deal, U.S. says (Reuters).

The SUN: PANIC STATIONS Putin’s officials in ‘secret talks with the West to end Ukraine war’ as ‘panicked’ Moscow elite go ‘behind tyrant’s back 
VLADIMIR Putin's panicked cronies are secretly reaching out to the West to try and bring Russia's disastrous war in Ukraine to an end, intelligence chiefs have alleged. 
Russia's elite are increasingly despairing about the sanctions imposed on the country in the wake of Vlad's bloody invasion and are trying to negotiate for peace, a senior Kremlin official is reported to have claimed. 
A document believed to have been circulated around Western intelligence agencies and supposedly seen by The Mirror said: "A representative of Putin's inner circle sent a signal about the desire to negotiate. 
"The mood of the Kremlin elite is panic." 
Putin's backstabbing official isn't named in the document but has been described as a "pillar of the regime" in Russia. 
Ukraine believes high-ranking Kremlin officials are attempting to reach out to Western intelligence agencies behind Putin's back, a Kyiv diplomatic source told The Mirror.

As China waged extensive military exercises off of Taiwan last week, a group of American defense experts in Washington was focused on their own simulation of an eventual — but for now entirely hypothetical — US-China war over the island. 
The unofficial what-if game is being conducted on the fifth floor of an office building not far from the White House, and it posits a US military response to a Chinese invasion in 2026. 
Even though the participants bring an American perspective, they are finding that a US-Taiwan victory, if there is one, could come at a huge cost.

A five-member delegation, led by Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, are in Taiwan on Sunday and Monday as part of a larger trip through Asia, according to the American Institute in Taiwan.

One of the main arguments made by Goel is that the traditional business model that NFT games compete against may be inherently weaker.  In traditional games, users typically purchase in-game items with real money, but they cannot sell those items to recoup a dollar value.

John Fetterman having a lot of fun on Twitter at the expense of dr. Mehmet Ozhis Republican rival for the Pennsylvania Senate seat, and Oz can’t seem to help stepping on rakes in his attempts to fight back.
Fetterman, who is currently lieutenant governor of Keystone State, made Oz’s longtime residence in neighboring New Jersey a central part of his campaign message, poking fun at Oz as an out-of-touch millionaire celebrity of Pennsylvania blue-collar voters.
One of Fetterman’s most memorable Twitter zingers was responding to an Oz campaign video to point out that it was filmed at his New Jersey mansion which was profiled in People.

Pro tip: Don’t film a senatorial campaign commercial from your New Jersey mansion. https://t.co/D9BDweZmym pic.twitter.com/p…]]></summary>

Case in point: Residents of Florence/Northampton have expressed concern over new building owners’ plans to evict – via an unaffordable rent increase – the Pizza Factory and replace it with a cannabis retail store called Euphoria.
This article was probably the first time most readers had heard of this project.  As proposed, Euphorium would be owned by father and son Marco and Richard Aranzullo of Connecticut.

UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced 'a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War' and was just 'one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.' 
'We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,' Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
'Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,' he said, calling on nations to 'put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.'

It was hard to blame him for crying.  “Kat’a” is a heart-pounding tragedy about a small-town woman trapped in a loveless marriage and driven to suicide after having a brief affair.  Janacek’s music crushes her ethereal fantasies with the brutal fist of reality.
At Barrie Kosky’s the staging was the culmination of a week in Salzburg, classical music’s preeminent annual event, which runs until August 31.  Kosky has reduced this stripped-down work even further, to its core of trembling human beings.

A huge nuclear power plant occupied by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine is "completely out of control", the head of the UN's nuclear agency says.  Rafael Grossi was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying the Zaporizhzhia plant needed an inspection and repairs.
"You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility," he said. 
Europe's biggest nuclear plant is dangerously close to the fighting. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia earlier this week of using the plant, which it overran in March, as a military base to launch attacks on Ukrainian forces.

Daily Mail: America is 'on edge of war with Russia and China', says former US secretary of State Henry Kissinger - and blames US leaders having 'trouble defining a direction' 
* Henry Kissinger served as Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon 
* He suggested to the Wall Street Journal over the weekend that leaders in today's US political climate have trouble separating personal values from negotiations 
* 'All you can do is not to accelerate the tensions and to create options, and for that you have to have some purpose,' he said of issues with China and Russia 
* It comes as another Congressional delegation is en route to Taiwan 
* House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit was seen by some as exacerbating tensions 
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned on Friday that the United States could be 'on the edge of war' with Russia and China, as the Biden administration grapples with its historically low relations with the two autocratic regimes. 
Without naming names, the 99-year-old statesman suggested that American leaders have 'trouble defining a direction' in today's political climate, which he believes has contributed to rising global tensions. 
 'We are at the edge of war with Russia and China on issues which we partly created,' Kissinger told the Wall Street Journal.

Kremlin says White House supplying information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes  The role of American intelligence in the war in Ukraine has been put under scrutiny after Russia accused the White House of supplying targeting information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes. 
Russia’s defence ministry claimed Washington was “directly involved” in the war, and had passed on intelligence that had led to the “mass deaths of civilians”. The US was responsible for rocket attacks by Kyiv on populated areas in the eastern Donbas and in other regions, it said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As boring as that makes me, I liked knowing about baby gear.  My wife liked that I knew about baby equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a long-term gamble on liquid natural gas, but it paid off and turned the United States into a major exporter of fossil fuels.
Journalist Jake Bittle delves into the career of Charif Souki, the Lebanese-American entrepreneur whose appetite for risk changed the course of America’s energy sector.
The article describes how Mr. Souki went from restaurant owner in Los Angeles to co-founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy, an oil and gas company specializing in liquefied natural gas, and provides insight into his process of reflection: “According to Souki,” writes Mr. Bittle, “the need to provide energy to the world in the short term outweighs the long-term demand to act on carbon emissions”.


At a time of acute climate anxiety, Mr. Souki’s rationale might seem outdated, even brazen.  The world may be facing energy and climate crises, Mr Souki told The New York Times, “but one is going to happen this month, and the other is 40 years from now.”


“If you tell someone, ‘You’re going to run out of power this month,’ and then you tell the same person about what’s going to happen 40 years from now,” he said, “they say, ‘What do you care about in 40 years?’  »

“I went to review my membership at The Shed, and they said I had to come to this event tonight.  They said I looked great.  That’s how it is in New York.  – Michael Anthony Pegues at the shed

Before the game started, the Cleveland Browns quarterback did something else that had taken almost as long to come: He apologized for the first time since more than two dozen women said he had them. sexually assaulted or harassed during massage appointments.
As Watson took the field, greeted by boos from the sparse crowd at TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, a league adviser continued to weigh his eligibility for the upcoming regular season.


The day before the match and an apology from Watson, The Associated Press reported that Watson would be willing to accept an eight-game suspension and a $5 million fine, after his representatives initially argued over not running out of time.

In other words, the clay would be a bad choice.  This is where the term feet of clay comes from, connoting a weak foundation, a flaw that could bring down a person of honor.  Which brings us to Fernando Tatis Jr.

The lights were on at the therapy art gallery, but there were no visitors.  Not a scrap of paper was moved to the psychological and social services unit.
Beneficiaries of the Saudi government program, which helps prisoners reintegrate into society, were on leave for family visits for Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice season, leaving the place eerily empty, like a campus American university at Christmas.  Pause.
Only one painting in the gallery offered a glimpse of the religious tolerance that characterizes the program: it was of a woman smelling a flower, her hair uncovered and flowing, against the night sky.

“Democrats call Republicans extremists because Republicans have become a party of extremists, crazies have taken over the asylum. People who are in the mainstream of the Republican Party today, there’s 10 years, would have been avoided by the party leadership,” Smith said.

    The City of Amherst government is again trying to take over the parking lot from the citizens of Amherst.  Now they also want to remove parking on Sunset Avenue and Elm Street. 
The Amherst City Council should allow as much unpaid daytime parking as possible for visitors, workers and students.  I know the owners of Lincoln Avenue have been reciting horror stories about parking on this street, but that’s not what I see on a daily basis.  I see a manageable traffic pattern under control with frequent speed bumps. 
I also see hard-working members of the community: workers, students and visitors, who use a public resource – free public parking – in a careful and efficient way.  Those people parking on Lincoln Avenue are doing …]]></summary>

In 2018, she promised that 2022 would be her last year as House Democratic leader, access a term limit to quell an uprising and secure a second term as president.  In January, she announced she was running for another two-year term in the House.
With the House passing the sweeping measure to tackle climate change and prescription drug prices on Friday — “a glorious day for us,” Ms Pelosi rejoiced — and her China-defying trip to Taiwan serving cornerstone of her diplomatic career, the question of what comes next for Ms Pelosi is only intensifying.

Nearly six million people depend on the cocoa industry in the West African nation of Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest cocoa producer.  But most of them are not involved in processing the crispy, sour beans that are turned into a sweet treat.

While the pandemic is ongoing, I have resumed eating carefully in restaurants.  And, in particular, I started looking again for restaurants that are as much local institutions as places to grab a bite to eat.


Most of them, perhaps all of them, will never attract the attention of Michelin Guide critics.  Their decor is generally modest, as are their prices.  But all found a magical combination of distinctive food, great service and a friendly atmosphere that gave them longevity in a business notorious for its short lifespan.
