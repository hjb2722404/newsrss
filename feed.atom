Men Lose Sleep over Video Games and Alcohol: study
An American Academy of Sleep Medicine survey found that men don’t get enough sleep because they’d rather do fun and relaxing things like drink alcohol and play video games.

The musical case against the musicians — who face RICO charges for alleged gang activity — is built on decades of racist precedent.
 Back in May, rapper and record label exec Young Thug was arrested on suspicion of gang activity and conspiracy to violate Georgia’s criminal racketeering law. Days later, Gunna — Young Thug’s Billboard-topping protégé who is signed to his label — and 26 others were charged in a 56-count RICO indictment for gang activity, including robbery and murder. 
“Prosecutors are alleging that they are part of a gang that has committed a number of crimes throughout Atlanta,” said Jewel Wicker, editor-at-large for Capital B Atlanta in an interview with…]]></summary>

Three months ago, Sonya, a 25-year-old who works at a major mobile gaming company and moonlights as a tutor, made one of the toughest decisions of her life: She left Russia. 
She had an old but cozy communal apartment with her boyfriend and two other roommates in Moscow’s city center, a tight-knit group of friends, and spent several days a week taking classes at a local dance academy—her lifelong passion. 
 “It’s my home. My family, friends are there. My whole life. How can you possibly abandon all these things?" she told Fortune.

RT: Putin orders Russian military to boost manpower 
The Russian president signs a decree on adding 137,000 troops to the Armed Forces 
The size of the Russian military is set to increase to 1.15 million troops next year, in line with a decree that President Vladimir Putin signed on Thursday. 
The document, published on the government’s website, adds 137,000 to the ranks of the Armed Forces from January 1, 2023.  It also instructs the cabinet to allocate the necessary funds for the expansion. 
The move comes amid the Russian military operation in Ukraine, launched in late February.

* Taiwan proposed $19 billion in defense spending for next year on Thursday, a double-digit increase on 2022 that includes funds for new fighter jets, weeks after China staged large-scale war games around the island it views as its sovereign territory. 
* China carried out its largest-ever military exercises around the democratically governed island after a visit this month by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The trip infuriated Beijing, which saw it as an attempt by Washington to interfere in China’s internal affairs. 
Taiwan proposed $19 billion in defense spending for next year on Thursday, a double-digit increase on 2022 that includes funds for new fighter jets, weeks after China staged large-scale war games around the island it views as its sovereign territory. 
China carried out its largest-ever military exercises around the democratically governed island after a visit this month by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The trip infuriated Beijing, which saw it as an attempt by Washington to interfere in China’s internal affairs. 
The overall proposed defense budget by President Tsai Ing-wen’s Cabinet sets a 13.9% year-on-year increase to a record T$586.3 billion ($19.41 billion).

Reuters: Taliban say they've not found body of al Qaeda leader 
KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban have not found the body of Ayman al-Zawahiri and are continuing investigations, group spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said on Thursday, after the United States said they killed the al Qaeda leader in an airstrike in Kabul last month. 
The United States killed Zawahiri with a missile fired from a drone while he stood on a balcony at his hideout in July, U.S. officials said, in the biggest blow to al Qaeda since U.S. Navy SEALS shot dead Osama bin Laden more than a decade ago.

WNU Editor: It is not in the Taliban's interest that Al Qaeda Leader Ayman al-Zawahiri's body is found.

Daily Mail: FBI whistleblower claims bureau leaders ordered staff NOT to investigate Hunter Biden laptop and told them 'the FBI is not going to change the outcome of the election again'

* Horowitz said the OIG would not investigate the FBI's handling of the laptop so as not to interfere with the DOJ's investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs 
The FBI deliberately dragged its feet on the Hunter Biden investigation and told agents not to look into the Hunter Biden laptop, according to new whistleblowers who spoke with Sen. Ron Johnson. 
Johnson, R-Wisc., sent a letter to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Tuesday bringing forth the new whistleblower claims.   'Recently, my office heard from individuals with knowledge of the FBI’s apparent corruption,' Johnson said.

Meanwhile during the evening (local time), The Jerusalem Post reports that President Biden has authorized a second round of US airstrikes:    
A second round of airstrikes by the US-led international coalition operating in Iraq and Syria targeted Iran-linked sites in the Deir al-Zor region of eastern Syria on Wednesday evening, according to local reports. 
 The airstrikes targeted Iran-backed militias in the city of Al-Mayadin and Saker Island, according to the reports.

L.A. Times: Six months of war in Ukraine — and it's only growing more dangerous 
Far from bogging down in a stalemate, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has evolved into an increasingly dangerous conflict as it passes the six-month mark, with fighting around Europe's largest nuclear plant, a high-profile assassination in Moscow, escalating threats and daring Ukrainian attacks in Russian-held territory.
"The dynamic of the battlefield" is shifting, said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of U.S. Army Europe. Armed with increasingly lethal weapons from the U.S. and other allies, Ukraine has been able to occasionally seize the initiative and surprise Russian forces. 
It is not clear, however, how long that can last or whether Ukraine can build on those small victories enough to dictate the course of the war.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I am focused on the massive battles that are now occurring in the Donbas. This is where the main portions of the Russian and Ukraine armies are deployed, and if there is a collapse of the Ukraine army in the Donbas in the coming weeks that some are now predicting, the chaos that will ensue will put tremendous pressure on Ukraine's allies to get directly involved in the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andrew Osborn, Reuters: Analysis-Putin bets winter gas chokehold will yield Ukraine peace - on his terms 
LONDON (Reuters) - Cold winters helped Moscow defeat Napoleon and Hitler. President Vladimir Putin is now betting that sky-rocketing energy prices and possible shortages this winter will persuade Europe to strong arm Ukraine into a truce -- on Russia's terms. 
That, say two Russian sources familiar with Kremlin thinking, is the only path to peace that Moscow sees, given Kyiv says it will not negotiate until Russia leaves all of Ukraine. 
"We have time, we can wait," said one source close to the Russian authorities, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.

WNU Editor: The Russian leadership may want a quick end to the war, but for the past 2 - 3 months the Kremlin and Russian media narrative has been focused on telling Russians that this conflict is going to last a minimum of 2 years. Putin has calculated (correctly in my opinion) that time is on Russia's side.

The above Reuters analysis is correct that if Europe experiences a crippling energy crisis this winter, they have the power to tell Ukraine to capitulate and end the war or EU aid and support will end. Faced with such an option, Kyiv will have no choice but to sue for peace. But my gut tells me that the EU is going to stick it out. They have vested all of their credibility in a Ukraine victory that will be total and complete.]]></summary>

Jerusalem Post: IAF F-35s penetrated Iranian airspace months ago - Saudi report  
According to the report, the purpose of the operation - conducted with the US - was to simulate an aerial and maritime strike on Iran in the Red Sea. 
Israeli Air Force F-35 advanced fifth-generation fighter jets penetrated Iranian airspace multiple times over the last two months, according to the Saudi media outlet Elaph. Both Iranian and Russian radars failed to locate them, according to the report. 
According to the news site, Israel and the US have conducted large-scale exercises over the Red Sea in order to simulate an aerial and maritime strike on Iran and the seizure of Iranian vessels in the Gulf Sea. 
The exercises come as part of a series of drills conducted by the two countries both secretly and publicly in order to prepare for strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Defense One: China Could Overtake US in Space Without ‘Urgent Action,’ Warns New Pentagon Report 
America needs a long-term goal in space to be able to compete with Beijing, Pentagon industrial-base group writes. 
The United States could be eclipsed by China in orbit unless it unites around a common goal for space, as it did during the race to the Moon a half-century ago, according to a report released Wednesday. 
 China is working to become the world’s dominant space power “economically, diplomatically, and militarily” by 2045, according to the State of the Space Industrial Base report for 2022, which was written by officials from the Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit, Air Force, and Air Force Research Laboratory. 
They argue that the United States must quickly act to maintain its advantage over Beijing, including using more commercial technology and setting long-term, bipartisan policy goals.

Politico: U.S. reacts to Iranian comments on draft nuclear deal 
Negotiations appear to be inching toward the finish line. 
VIENNA — The U.S. and Iran are closing in on an agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal after almost 17 months of negotiations. 
The United States relayed to the EU on Wednesday its much-awaited response to Iran’s comments on the draft proposal to restore the nuclear deal, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told POLITICO. 
The spokesperson of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani confirmed that it had received the U.S. response via EU senior official Enrique Mora, who acts as a mediator and coordinator of the talks. 
Iran still refuses to talk directly with the U.S. “Iran has started reviewing the US comments, and after the review Tehran will submit its views to the coordinator,” Kanaani said.

Newsweek: What Is Russia's Anti-Putin 'National Republican Army'? 
Darya Dugina, daughter of an influential ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was killed in a suspected car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow organized by the so-called National Republican Army (NRA), according to a former member of Russia's Duma who is now living in exile. 
Former Russian state deputy Ilya Ponomarev, in an appearance on his Russian-language opposition TV channel "Utro Fevralya" in Kyiv, alleged that Dugina, 30, was killed by Russian partisans from the NRA. He said both Dugin and his daughter were targets. 
Dugina was the daughter of Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, who has been credited with being a key architect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

There are conflicting reports about the origin of the mysterious drone and how exactly Taiwanese forces dealt with it. 
Two bewildered-looking soldiers gaze up, as a drone appears over their position, seemingly unexpectedly.

Moments later, the troops appear to hurl rocks at the drone in an effort to knock it out of the sky. This is a drone’s eye view of one aspect of the ongoing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and a startling reminder of what’s a fairly new facet of warfare and one that’s proven generally difficult to effectively counter.

In 2018, shortly after Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Massachusetts lawmakers concerned about Roe’s possible overthrow passed a law contradicting archaic statutes targeting young women – known as the Wicked Women Act – repealing abortion and contraception bans still in effect but unenforceable at the time due to Roe and other court rulings.

BBC: India sacks officers for accidentally firing missile into Pakistan 
India's government has sacked three air force officers for the "accidental firing of a missile" into Pakistan in March. 
The incident had escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations.  Delhi had blamed the "deeply regrettable" incident on a "technical malfunction" during routine maintenance. 
Islamabad warned Delhi to "be mindful of the unpleasant consequences of such negligence" and to avoid a repeat. 
The officers responsible for the 9 March incident have been terminated from service, the Indian Air Force said in a statement on Tuesday.

London (CNN Business)The United Kingdom will have to find an answer to soaring energy bills soon or risk a humanitarian crisis. 
But freezing gas and electricity prices over the next two winters could cost the government over £100 billion ($118 billion), more than it spent paying millions of people's salaries during the pandemic. 
Earlier this year, the UK government tried to protect households against 90% of the expected increases in energy bills through tax cuts, energy bill rebates and direct payments. 
But natural gas and power prices have shot up since then, as have forecasts of future increases.

(CNN)Voters in the oil-rich African nation of Angola will go to the polls on Wednesday to decide who will lead the country -- the party that has been in power for nearly five decades, or an opposition promising a fresh start especially for disaffected youth.

Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz is due to see Sullivan in Washington on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Biden orders airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria following attacks near base holding US troops last week 
(CNN)President Joe Biden ordered airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria on Tuesday, a little over a week after a number of rockets struck near a military base in northeastern Syria housing US troops. 
The airstrikes conducted by the US military targeted Iranian-backed groups in Deir ez-Zor Syria, US Central Command said in a statement. The strikes targeted "infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps," Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for CENTCOM, said in the statement. 
"At President Biden's direction, US military forces conducted precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor Syria today. These precision strikes are intended to defend and protect US forces from attacks like the ones on August 15 against US personnel by Iran-backed groups," he said, referring to last week's attacks on the Green Village base near the Iraqi border. The incident did not result in damage or injuries.

Rebels in the Tigray region of Ethiopia accused the central government in Addis Ababa and militias aligned with them of launching what it termed a "large-scale offensive" Wednesday before the Ethiopian government turned around and accused Tigray of the very thing it had been accused of.

360   News 360: Turkey claims that several NATO member countries want the Ukraine-Russia war to continue 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Tuesday that several member countries of the Atlantic Alliance, not just the United States, want the war between Russia and Ukraine to continue.
"There are those who wanted to sabotage the grain deal. But it is not the United States. The contribution (of Washington) has been the removal of restrictions on export of Russian fertilizers, unblocking of ports, (removal of restrictions) on banking operations," he stressed. 
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry also explained, during an interview with the Haber Global channel, that 33 ships have already left Ukraine thanks to the protection agreement signed last month in Istanbul between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations.

Two new models have emerged that could give us clues to the appearance of China’s secretive new long-range bomber.  
The saga of China’s H-20 next-generation bomber may have taken a very interesting new turn, with the appearance of at least two models showing a new aircraft design, or at least a concept, that seems to have strong similarities to how the H-20 is expected to look. That last point is crucial, since we have not, so far, seen any official renderings of the H-20 beyond depictions that are highly obscured, and which may not actually bear much of a relationship to the final design. However, with recent hints of an imminent first flight dropped by China’s state-run media, there seems to be momentum gathering behind the long-awaited bomber, suggesting its official unveiling — or a state-approved leaking — may not be far off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter has been accused of misleading regulators about its protections against spam accounts and hackers by the social media company’s former security chief Peiter Zatko. 

Mr Zatko has made the allegations in a complaint filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, saying the platform falsely claimed it had a strong security plan.

The claims could affect legal proceedings between Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who have sued each other. 

According to Mr Musk’s lawyers, Mr Zatko has already been subpoenaed. 

Mr Musk is trying to withdraw from a $USD44 billion deal to buy the social media company over Twitter's failure to provide information about spam and bot accounts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first photos have been released from China’s raid on Chinese-Australian journalist Cheng Lei. 

Ms Lei has now been detained by Chinese authorities for two years following her arrest for leaking state secrets, and there have been serious concerns for her health and safety following her detainment. 

The new images that have been obtained have revealed what her apartment looked like when she was arrested, according to Sky News host James Morrow.

“They took her passport, her computer ... we get a sense of what it was like,” Mr Morrow told Sky News Australia. 

In the Daily Telegraph's new film ‘Disappeared – The Cheng Lei Story’, the photos are just one revelation. 

Ms Lei's family and friend’s plea to the Chinese government has been for it to show some compassion and let her return home to Australia.

Mr Morrow believes there is hope that after the Chinese national party congress later this year, there may be some softening of this relationship.]]></summary>

Officers on the scene of the accident said they "observed objective signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication," according to the documents.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has urged Western nations to provide more weapons more quickly to help Ukraine retake territory occupied by Russia, including the peninsula of Crimea occupied since 2014. 
Speaking at Tuesday's Crimea Platform summit, Stoltenberg also warned that a harsh winter lies ahead for Ukraine and its NATO supporters, necessitating continued backing for Kyiv despite the costs. 
"NATO is part of the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group to mobilize support, and I actively engage with leaders to urge them to provide more weapons, and more ammunition, more quickly," Stoltenberg said. 
"Winter is coming, and it will be hard," Stoltenberg said. "What we see now is a grinding war of attrition. This is a battle of wills and a battle of logistics. Therefore, we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term, so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation."

Daily Mail: Biden to give Ukraine $3billion - the largest weapons package since Putin invaded in February - bringing the total in US assistance to $13billion amid fears Russia will start attacking more civilian centers 
* As the war drags on with no end in sight, U.S. officials are reportedly shifting their strategy toward a longer-term campaign 
* The money will fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two 
* Earlier shipments, most of them done under Presidential Drawdown Authority, have focused on Ukraine's more immediate needs 
* With the added $3 billion, the Biden administration will have offered a total of near $14 billion over the course of 19 aid packages since February 
The Biden administration is preparing another $3 billion arms package for Ukraine to mark the six month anniversary of the Russian invasion. 
As the war drags on with no end in sight, U.S. officials are reportedly shifting their strategy toward a longer-term campaign, offering the funds to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers for years to come. 
The Biden administration is expected to announce the package on Wednesday - exactly six months after the invasion on Feb. 24.

RT: More Russians are disillusioned with Western values – poll 
Western democracy and culture are destructive, every fourth Russian says 
The number of Russians who believe Western values to be beneficial to the country has fallen drastically in the last 20 years, according to a poll conducted earlier this month by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM) and published on Tuesday.

WNU Editor: I would not use the word "disillusioned". I would use the word contempt. And this is a radical change from just 20 years ago.

Promoting social values that many do not identify with. Many struggling to afford the basics. And forget about making enough to afford a home. The only other thing that I can add is that most Americans agree .... 74% Of Americans Say The U.S. Is On The Wrong Track In A New NBC News Poll (August 21, 2022).]]></summary>
