Hungary is becoming increasingly isolated within the NATO military alliance. Even before the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán went against the grain compared to other European Union countries. 
But he has since lost his most important patron: Poland.   In a speech in February, in which he referenced World War II, Orbán admitted that he had run out of allies: "The other countries thought that if the Germans could not resist so much external pressure, they wouldn't be able to either”. 
“So, they moved from the peace camp to the war camp. That leaves just us two: Hungary and the Vatican," he added.

Business Insider: US would destroy Taiwan's semiconductor factories rather than letting them fall into China's hands, a former national security advisor says 
* A former national security advisor said the US would "never" let China gain hold of Taiwan's semiconductor factories. 
* Robert O'Brien told Semafor that China could "control the world economy" with the factories. 
* TSMC is the world's largest chipmaker, powering most of the devices and equipment used every day. 
A former national security advisor said the US would destroy Taiwan's semiconductor factories if China seemed on the verge of controlling them after an invasion. 
Robert O'Brien, who served as national security advisor in the Trump administration, told Semafor the US "and its allies are never going to let those factories fall into Chinese hands." 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is the world's largest chipmaker, making up an estimated 90% of the market for advanced processors. The company produces chips for most devices and equipment like phones and cars that are used every day. More advanced chips produced by the manufacturer are used in highly advanced technology like machine learning and guided missiles. 
If China were to take control of these factories, the country would be "like the new OPEC of silicon chips," O'Brien said, adding that China would be able to "control the world economy."

CNN: Taiwan unveils its new combat and surveillance drones as China threat grows  
A Taiwanese state-owned military weapons developer unveiled five new types of indigenous military drones on Tuesday, as the self-ruled island looks to boost its asymmetric warfare capabilities against China’s growing military threat. 
A CNN team was among reporters invited to the National Chung-shan Institute of Science and Technology, where the Taiwanese weapons developer displayed eight types of locally developed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) – including five models that were shown to the public for the first time. 
The new drones come in different sizes and are equipped with either combat or surveillance capabilities, said Eric Chi, director of the institute’s Aeronautical Systems Research Division, who added that the devices were designed for use by different branches of Taiwan’s military.

The United States, Australia and Britain on Monday unveiled details of a plan to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines from the early 2030s to counter China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. 
Addressing a ceremony at the U.S. naval base in San Diego, accompanied by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, U.S. President Joe Biden called the agreement under the 2021 AUKUS partnership part of a shared commitment to a free-and-open Indo-Pacific region with two of America's "most stalwart and capable allies." 
Sunak called it "a powerful partnership," adding: "For the first time ever it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across the Atlantic and Pacific keeping our oceans free ... for decades to come."

Politico:  U.S. officials project calm as China stuns world with Iran-Saudi deal  
Some U.S. officials argue that American and Chinese interests may align in this case. 
The détente China brokered between Iran and Saudi Arabia is spurring breathless talk in some corners of a regional paradigm shift and even the rise of a Beijing-centric world order. 
The Biden administration’s reaction, however, amounts to: Nothing to see here, folks. 
U.S. officials have issued brief public statements that downplay the initiative. Asked for details in interviews, they argued that, among other things: It’s a one-off case; it was in China’s economic interest to broker the deal; it doesn’t translate into long-term alliances; and anything that helps calm the region is in America’s interest. 
That display of nonchalance also suggests that the administration is eager to stave off concerns that China is eroding America’s global influence at a time when the Biden administration seeks solidarity with partners and allies to counter what Secretary of State Antony Blinken calls Beijing’s threat to the “rules-based international order.”

WNU Editor: All that I can say is that if it was the Biden administration that brokered this truce between Iran and Saudi Arabia instead of China, we would be hearing non-stop praise from the main stream media and from US officials themselves on how great this brokered truce is.]]></summary>

Washington Post: Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow 
DNIPROPETROVSK REGION, Ukraine — The quality of Ukraine’s military force, once considered a substantial advantage over Russia, has been degraded by a year of casualties that have taken many of the most experienced fighters off the battlefield, leading some Ukrainian officials to question Kyiv’s readiness to mount a much-anticipated spring offensive. 
U.S. and European officials have estimated that as many as 120,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the start of Russia’s invasion early last year, compared with about 200,000 on the Russian side, which has a much larger military and roughly triple the population from which to draw conscripts. 
Ukraine keeps its running casualty numbers secret, even from its staunchest Western supporters.   Statistics aside, an influx of inexperienced draftees, brought in to plug the losses, has changed the profile of the Ukrainian force, which is also suffering from basic shortages of ammunition, including artillery shells and mortar bombs, according to military personnel in the field.

Politico:  ‘Little fissures’: The U.S.-Ukraine war unity is slowly cracking apart 
A tough week for U.S.-Ukraine news reveals an imperfect harmony. 
The United States and Ukraine have largely been in lockstep since President Joe Biden’s administration pledged support for “as long as it takes” in resisting Moscow’s relentless invasion. 
But more than a year into the war, there are growing differences behind the scenes between Washington and Kyiv on war aims, and potential flashpoints loom on how, and when, the conflict will end. 
“The administration doesn’t have a clear policy objective and a clear goal. Is it to drag this thing out, which is precisely what Vladimir Putin wants?” said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Is it to just give them enough to survive and not to win? I don’t see a policy for victory right now, and if we don’t have that, then what are we doing?”   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: This is an extraordinary article that highlights the divisions that are now growing between Washington and Kyiv. In the article there is nothing but criticisms from US officials on Ukrainian President Zelensky .... and I think this is the first time that I am reading a major US media outlet criticizing the Ukrainian President. 
There is also US criticisms on Ukrainian war policies, and what is more shocking, are US officials telling Politico that they strongly believe that Ukraine was behind the Nord Stream pipeline attack. There is also criticisms on Ukraine being committed to the defense of Bakhmut against the advice of US military officials. 
But what struck me were US officials expressing their frustration over constant Ukrainian demands for more weapons and monies, and disappointment that they have not shown the proper appreciation of US efforts. 
Needless to say. This is a must read article for today.]]></summary>

Reuters: Taiwan says defence spending to focus on readying for 'total blockade' by China 
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's defence spending this year will focus on preparing weapons and equipment for a "total blockade" by China, including parts for F-16 fighters and replenishing weapons, the military said in a report. 
China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, staged war games around the island in August, firing missiles over Taipei and declaring no-fly and no-sail zones in a simulation of how it would seek to cut Taiwan off in a war.
In a report seeking parliamentary budget approval, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters on Monday, Taiwan's defence ministry said it began reviewing its strategic fuel reserves and repair abilities last year, but did not give details. 
In "anticipation of a total blockade of the Taiwan Strait", spending this year would include replenishment of artillery and rocket stocks, and parts for F-16 fighters "to strengthen combat continuity", the ministry said.

   WNU Editor: More details on former President Trump losing his account at Signature Bank is here .... Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank cut future ties with Trump, citing Capitol riots (NBC). 
Speaking of former President Trump. 

The main stream media narrative is to blame former President Trump for this banking crisis .... Why Trump is being called out in the Silicon Valley Bank collapse (Business Insider). Cannot say that I am surprised. The Biden administration and their media allies cannot say that the real reason why these banks are failing is due to inflation forcing the Fed to raise interest rates. High interest rates that have now collapsed the assets that these affected bank had in long term US Treasury bond portfolios (see below). 

Silicon Valley Bank did not fail because of loan defaults. It failed because rapidly rising interest rates collapsed the value of its long term bond portfolio. #Bidenflation is the cause of these bank failures.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy plan to speak by video link in what would be their first conversation since Russia’s invasion, a Ukrainian official familiar with the preparations said. 
No date has yet been set for the conversation, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that aren’t yet public. 
There was no immediate comment from Zelenskiy’s press office. The session would come after a visit by Xi to Moscow expected next week, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

* Hedge fund boss Bill Ackman today warned the 'economy will not function' unless Joe Biden 'guarantees all deposits now' as the crisis hit the Big Four banks 
* Among the worst affected regional banks was Western Alliance which saw its stock plunge by 75 percent as the opening bell sounded on Wall Street 
* 'The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation needs to explicitly guarantee all deposits now. 
Hours matter,' Ackman said as he called for government backing  At least 20 regional banks were hit with trading halts this morning as turmoil sparked by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse gripped Wall Street. 
Hedge fund boss Bill Ackman warned the 'economy will not function' unless Joe Biden 'guarantees all deposits now' as the contagion spread to the Big Four trillion-dollar US banks. 
Wells Fargo's stock dropped 7.5 percent, Bank of America fell 7.4 percent, Citigroup plunged 5.8 percent and JP Morgan was down 2.7 percent.

So what is my prediction. 
My optimistic take is that this crisis is going to cost US taxpayers hundreds of billions if not more. This also guarantees a recession in the coming months. Stock markets will be negatively impacted. And the debt crisis is also gong to get worse. Throw in inflation, high interest rates, and it is obvious that everyone's balance sheet and take-home is going to take a hit. 
You do not want to know what my pessimistic take on this crisis is. When I think about it I feel like throwing up.]]></summary>

* President Joe Biden tried to help avoid a full-blown banking crisis with short remarks Monday morning before the markets opened 
* He said that bank managers of the collapsed institutions would be fired 
President Joe Biden on Monday said the U.S. banking system is 'safe' and assured on-edge taxpayers they won't foot the bill for the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. 
Biden tried to project calm amid fears of a financial meltdown and a run on the banks after shares plummeted 74 percent in pre-market trading amid the second-largest banking collapse in U.S. history. 
He defended his administration's response in his less than four-minute remarks, said the executives at Silicon Valley Bank should be fired and pointed the finger at Donald Trump for rolling back regulations.

Reuters: Exclusive: China's Xi plans Russia visit as soon as next week - sources 
Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to travel to Russia to meet his counterpart Vladimir Putin as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said, which would be sooner than previously expected. 
Plans for a visit come as China has been offering to broker peace in Ukraine, an effort that has been met with scepticism in the West given Beijing's diplomatic support for Russia. 
Putin said last month that a Xi visit had been agreed, though the Kremlin chief gave no date for a possible visit.
The Wall Street Journal reported last month that a visit to Moscow could take place in April or early May. 
 China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the possibility of Xi going to Moscow.

While the Biden administration’s weakness and decline in military readiness concerning China goes unreported or under-reported in the United States, those nations most vulnerable to Chinese aggression and intimidation are aware of the rising risk of war. 
When nations assess their national security status, they analyze all alliances and associations, including military, economic, etc. A critical aspect of that analysis will be the United States and its ability and willingness to fulfill its strategic security obligations.    
Fading US Security Guarantees in the Region 
Today, those obligations, first and foremost, involve the threats that China and its de facto proxy, North Korea, pose to the region. Every national security advisor or minister of defense in the Asia-Pacific region that relies on U.S. security guarantees must ask themselves, “Are we as secure today as we were yesterday under American security guarantees?”

WNU Editor: Everyone outside the U.S., Canada, and the EU is seeing what I am seeing. A decline in US influence, commitment, diplomacy, and the ability to quickly respond to a crisis. 
Last week's brokered deal by China between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a case in point. In the past the US would be centered stage in such a deal. No more now. 
In the case of Asia.  When America's allies look at the US they see a lot of rhetoric, but very little if any follow-up. That is why every U.S. ally in Asia is scrambling right now to boost their defense budgets. They are also shoring up their military and political alliances. They know the US is now limited on what it can do, and in the face of a more assertive and aggressive China, everyone is now responding to this new geopolitical environment.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Chinese military successfully uses AI WARSHIP design programme to do a year's work in a DAY as Beijing looks to create a navy more powerful than America's 
* AI perfectly navigated more than 400 complex design tasks, researchers said 
* Senior engineer claimed ship design was the key limiting factor to naval growth 
* Comes as US Navy Secretary warns China's navy is growing beyond US capacity 
A Chinese research team claims it used an AI programme to design the electrical system of a warship in a day - a task that takes a team of humans with advanced computer tools almost a year. 
A study published in China's journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems last month said the AI designer completed all of its tasks with 100 per cent accuracy, breezing through complex design problems. 
China's Ship Design and Research Centre said the AI perfectly navigated more than 400 challenging design tasks, prompting leading senior engineer Luo Wei to declare the programme was 'ready for engineering applications' in China's shipbuilding industry to boost the speed of warship manufacturing.

 (Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon’s $170 billion procurement request for the new fiscal year focuses on replacing munitions supplied to Ukraine as well as well as weapons like long-range missiles, which would be necessary in a conflict with China, according to an internal budget document. 
The Defense Department will ask for $76.8 billion for the Navy and Marines, with $32.8 billion in new ship construction; $61 billion for the Air Force, which includes the US Space Force: and $24.4 billion for the Army, according to the official P-1 summary document obtained by Bloomberg News. 
The companion R-1 research and development document requests $145 billion overall, with $46 billion to the Air Force, $27 billion to the Navy and $15.7 billion the Army. The documents are to be released Monday by the Pentagon as part of its detailed disclosure of the budget request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

Ms Roberts’ remarks come after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were evicted from Frogmore Cottage by King Charles following the release of the Duke of Sussex’s bombshell memoir Spare. 

“William and Kate would rather have Prince Andrew and all the chaos that comes with him as their neighbour … rather than his own brother and his own sister-in-law,” she told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo. 

“I find the way that William has played this is absolutely textbook – it's really strategic with a really strong hit of … revenge.”]]></summary>

The Intel Drop: 2nd Kinzhal Attack Hits NATO’s Western Command Center 80 meters Underground, 40 Killed 
IN western Ukraine a Russian Forces Kinzhal struck a bunker extending to 80 metres deep. The RF believes this bunker near Lvov was a NATO strategic command point used to control anti-aircraft systems. It’s still early days but the RF assumes there were up to 300 personnel in the bunker, 40 of which were high ranking foreign specialists, hence we can expect 40 body bags heading west in due course. Unconfirmed in the Nikolaevsk region the RF destroyed four senior militants, and a number of officers and planners. 
As NATO fly’s its spy planes along the Moldavian/Transnistrian (Priednestrovie) border collecting data for the Ukrainians, their troops are positioning themselves to invade Transnistria in Moldova’s breakaway region. A significant build-up of Ukrainian personnel and equipment including setting up of artillery positions and an “unprecedented” increase of drone flights over the region indicate the preparation for an invasion of the sovereign territory that was declared independent in the early 1990s. Half of Transnistria’s 500,000 residents have Russian citizenship.

WNU Editor: Cannot confirm this report. But it had to be a high priority target for Russia to use a hypersonic missile. I am also wondering if this was the reason why a B-52H bomber did a nuclear exercise targeting Saint Petersburg early this week (i.e. to send a message to Moscow) ....

CNN: North Korea fires 2 missiles from submarine, state media reports  
North Korea launched two missiles from a submarine in the waters of the Sea of Japan Sunday morning local time, according to the state-run news agency KCNA. 
The “strategic cruise missiles” were launched from a “8.24 Yongung” submarine, according to KCNA – the same vessel used to test North Korea’s first submarine-launched ballistic missile in 2016, CNN previously reported. 
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said earlier Sunday that North Korea fired at least one unidentified missile from a submarine near the port city of Sinpo in the South Hamgyong province. 
KCNA claimed the missiles flew for over an hour, traveling roughly 1,500 km (932 miles) per hour and performing figure-of-eight shaped patterns before “precisely” hitting a target.

* The Navy's newest supercarrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, is underway with all its airpower. 
* This is the first time the $13 billion ship operated with its entire air wing embarked, a Navy official told Insider. 
* The Ford is underway for a composite training unit exercise known as COMPTUEX, the official said. 
USS Gerald R. Ford — the US Navy's newest supercarrier — is operating underway with all of its available airpower for the first time. 
A Navy official confirmed to Insider reporting from Navy Times that this is the first time the entire carrier air wing has been embarked on the Ford for an underway period. The ship is underway for a composite training unit exercise known as COMPTUEX. 
This exercise "assesses a carrier strike group's abilities to conduct military operations at sea and project power ashore through joint planning and execution of challenging and realistic training scenarios," 2nd Fleet spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Kristi Johnson told Insider. "This evaluation is planned and executed by the Carrier Strike Group 4 staff, and it tests the mission-readiness of deployable assets to perform as an integrated unit."

Reuters: Iran to buy Su-35 fighter jets from Russia - Iranian broadcaster 
DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said on Saturday, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia's war on Ukraine. 
"The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase," the broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York as saying. 
IRIB's report did not carry any Russian confirmation of the deal, details of which were not disclosed. 
The mission said Iran had also inquired about buying military aircraft from several other unnamed countries, IRIB reported.  Iran's purchase of Russian fighter jets was first reported by news website Semafor on Thursday.

Hamburg lawmakers are asking whether a deadly attack on Jehovah's Witnesses could have been prevented, pointing to material in the public domain that hinted at religious extremism, plus an anonymous tip-off when he applied for a gun licence.
The Left Party called on the Hamburg Senate to clarify unanswered questions about the rampage, said Deniz Celik, interior policy spokesman for the Left Party in Hamburg's State Parliament, in a statement on Sunday.

Daily Mail: Terrified Russians are ordered to take anti-radiation pills and rush to nuclear bomb shelters as TV station servers are HACKED 
* TV and radio stations in Moscow and the Sverdlovsk region were interrupted 
* It is the third such hacking in the past month which hijacked Russian broadcasts 
Russians were warned today to take anti-radiation pills and rush to their nearest nuclear bomb shelters after hackers compromised state television servers to broadcast chilling messages. 
TV and radio programmes in Moscow and the Sverdlovsk region, including Yekaterinburg city, were interrupted with an alarming message telling citizens a missile strike had been conducted on Russian soil. 
The population was urged to take potassium iodide pills, don gas masks to protect themselves and to seek shelter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Sunday, adding that he hoped the exchange would take place soon.
"Regarding the issue of prisoner swaps between Iran and the U.S. we have reached an agreement in the recent days and if everything goes well on the U.S. side, I think we will witness a prisoner exchange in a short period," Amirabdollahian said.
"On our part everything is ready, while the U.S. is currently working on the final technical coordination."
One of several Americans held in Iran is Siamak Namazi, a businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, who was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government.
Emad Sharghi, an Iranian-American businessman was first arrested in 2018 when he was working for a tech investment company, is also jailed in Iran, as is Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship.
Iranian sources told Reuters that two regional countries were involved in the series of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington for the release of prisoners.
For years, Tehran has sought the release of more than a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the glitz of Sunday's Oscars, the first Irish language film to earn a nomination is sparking renewed interest in a native tongue spoken by so few it is considered endangered by the United Nations cultural agency.
Competing for best international feature, "An Cailín Ciúin" (The Quiet Girl) last year became the first Irish language film to gross more than 1 million euros ($1.06 million) at the UK and Irish box office. It has remained a fixture in cinemas across English-speaking Ireland.
Director Colm Bairéad says the success feels like it is boosting a language he grew up feeling self-conscious about because of its rarity. Raised in a bilingual household, the Dubliner's father would make a point of shouting across the street in Iri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court's powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.
As the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.
"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids," said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.
The protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.
National police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.
The now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and "will not yield to any political pressure on the matter".
Netanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.
"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister'," said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.

Greece has asked for others to imitate the Vatican Museums after they agreed this month to return three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon. London and Athens are in talks over the Parthenon Sculptures held by the British Museum.
The Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis in Athens, was completed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the goddess Athena, and its decorative friezes contain some of the greatest examples of ancient Greek sculpture.

The 20-year-old man suspected of keeping 11 people hostage in a pharmacy for five hours on Friday in Germany's south-western city of Karlsruhe has been taken into custody, authorities said on Saturday
According to the public prosecutor's office and the police, a judge issued an arrest warrant on charges of hostage-taking.
The 20-year-old suspect, who is known to the police, held the 11 hostages for almost five hours until special forces stormed the pharmacy and overpowered him.
The perpetrator was armed but he acted alone, police said earlier.

Day and night there are these attacks, Zelensky said in his nightly video message broadcast in Kiev on Saturday. "Rockets and artillery, drones and mortars: The vicious state uses a variety of weapons with the one goal of destroying life and leaving nothing human behind," Zelensky said.
"Ruins, rubble, craters where missiles hit are the self-portrait of Russia that it paints where life exists without Russia," the Ukrainian head of state said. The country stands for evil, he said. "It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment."
Zelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.]]></summary>

Rosalia Messina Denaro was arrested earlier this month not far from Palermo, where her godfather brother was caught on January 16 after 30 years on the run.
She is accused of issuing orders, keeping the books and transmitting secret messages for her sibling while he was in hiding.
For many years, women linked to the Cosa Nostra Mafia seemed born to become widows, portrayed in films as black-veiled Madonnas, leading funeral processions in sorrowful dignity.
The reality is far more complex, with many wives, daughters and sisters playing active roles while their men are on the run, in prison…]]></summary>

BEIJING (Reuters) -Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China's premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity's sclerotic stock market.
Li's back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.
In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai's new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China's hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mexican authorities have arrested five people over the deadly kidnapping of a group of Americans, after the suspects were left in the street with their hands tied by alleged cartel members, officials said Friday.
The four US citizens, two of whom died, were snatched at gunpoint after crossing the border into crime-plagued Tamaulipas state on Friday in a minivan, apparently so that one could have cosmetic surgery.
Tamaulipas prosecutor Irving Barrios said that a warrant had been executed for five people for the crimes of kidnapping and homicide.
They are the same five men who were found Thursday with their hands bound on a street in the city of Matamoros, apparently dumped by fellow members of the Gulf Cartel, a source in the prosecutor's office told AFP.

"The world has gone mad," says one mourner holding a bouquet of white roses and approaching the entrance of the brick building, cordoned off by police.
The body bags are carefully placed in hearses before being driven away and the man with the bouquet leaves with his flowers still in hand.
"It really upsets me," says Tatjana Popczy, who lives just 200 metres (yards) from the centre where a former member of the Jehovah's Witnesses burst into a service at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) on Thursday, killing six people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won't be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia's year-long military invasion.
As reported by CBS News' Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a "bigger war" in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was "done" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while "America First" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow on Friday accused foreign countries of fomenting days of mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia's borders.
Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial "foreign agent" legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
