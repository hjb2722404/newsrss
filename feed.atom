“These small island developing states are not Australian dependencies,” he told Sky News Australia.

“But they will make decisions in their own national interest, they’ll want to have a dialogue with China.

“I don’t believe any of them, in the foreseeable future, are going to contemplate compromising their own independence, antagonising Australia and the US, by offering to host a Chinese facility.”

Mr Carr suggested China would “steer away” from such “adventurism” in the context of an improved relationship between Canberra and Beijing.

“They’d be roundly criticised and it would get not just attention from the US and us but attention from the European states,” he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jewelry and gems worth millions – a conservative figure puts the value at $10 million – were stolen from a Brink’s armored truck near Los Angeles last week, the security firm said, leaving some victims ask how such theft could have happened.
The merchandise was loaded onto a Brink’s truck at an event hosted by the International Gem and Jewelry Show on July 10 in San Mateo, near San Francisco, said Brandy Swanson, the group’s events director.  She said the truck was on its way to another exhibit 370 miles away at the Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena.
But in circumstances that have not been made public, the merchandise was taken from the truck near Los Angeles early Monday, said Brink’s spokeswoman Dana Callahan.


The value of the stolen merchandise, which included several gold and diamond necklaces, was not immediately clear.  It was also unclear how many pieces had been taken.


One of the jewelers, who requested anonymity for security reasons given the expensive jewelry he handles, estimated the total value of what was stolen at between $20 million and $50 million.  Ms. Callahan said it was less than $10 million.
“Based on information customers provided to us prior to shipping their items, the total value of missing items is less than $10 million,” Brink’s said in a statement.  “We are working with law enforcement and will fully reimburse our customers for the value of their assets that were stolen, in accordance with the terms of our contract.”
The jeweler said Brink’s was not transparent with jewelry owners and many fundamental questions about the loss remained unanswered.
Neither authorities nor Brink’s released details of what happened, including the location of the theft and whether anyone was injured.


A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was working with local authorities but could not provide more information.  In its statement, Brink’s called the episode “a loss incident.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Spent the day talking to friends and family who are still in Ukraine. Correction. It was more listening to friends and family on what they are going through right now in Ukraine. 
Sighhh ... it has been a draining day. But I should not complain. I am in Canada where I am safe. 
As for the above video report. Kudos to Dima at the Military Summary YouTube channel spending his day trying to understand the military situation on the ground by compiling both Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministry briefings into something that is meaningful. No one has come close to doing what he is doing, including all those high-paid retired Generals giving their 5 minute analysis on TV that is proven wrong 2 weeks later. 
Some other interesting news that I picked up today. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been making some remarks that is raising a few eyebrows. One .... he says he was misquoted when he said Ukraine will soon have a million soldiers. Reason being that his English is not good. He instead expects something like 700,000 soldiers. 
And two .... he has been quoted as saying that the Ukraine military has already suffered 100,000 casualties since the start of the war?!?!?!? I have been trying to find other Ukrainian media and government outlets to verify this casualty number, but no luck so far.

Russian media is saying that they have already destroyed a number of US supplied HIMARS systems, and that the Russian military advance continues. I am always skeptical of these reports, but I have noticed a reduction in reports of long range artillery strikes by Ukraine in the past few days.]]></summary>

Reuters: Ukraine war shows West's dominance is ending as China rises, Blair says  
LONDON (Reuters) - The Ukraine war shows that the West's dominance is coming to an end as China rises to superpower status in partnership with Russia at one of the most significant inflection points in centuries, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said. 
The world, Blair said, was at a turning point in history comparable with the end of World War Two or the collapse of the Soviet Union: but this time the West is clearly not in the ascendant. 
 "We are coming to the end of Western political and economic dominance," Blair said in a lecture entitled "After Ukraine, What Lessons Now for Western Leadership?" according to a text of the speech to a forum supporting the alliance between the United States and Europe at Ditchley Park west of London.

Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A US Navy warship on Saturday challenged Chinese claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea, the US 7th Fleet said in a statement -- the second operation of its kind this week. 
The guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold sailed near the Spratly Islands -- known as the Nansha Islands in China -- in the southeastern South China Sea in a so-called "freedom of navigation operation" (FONOP), the 7th Fleet statement said. 
The US Navy operation in the island chain where China has built military foritifications on man-made islands challenged "restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People's Republic of China (PRC), Vietnam, and Taiwan," the statement said.

Saudi Arabia will not have any additional capacity to increase oil production beyond 13 million barrels per day, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said during his address to the US-Arab summit in Jeddah. 
“The kingdom has announced an increase in its production capacity level to 13 million barrels per day, after which the kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production,” he said.

WNU Editor: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was very careful on what he was promising. MBS was talking about "Production Capacity" NOT "production" when he mentioned that they will be increasing production capacity to 13 mb/d (from 12 mb/d) by 2027. In other-words. Do not expect any significant Saudi oil production in the near future.

"The Australian government needs to be serious in the discussions and we need to ask China to explain their human rights abuses and to explain what's happening in relation to their military build up.

Mr Dutton said it was not unreasonable to ask China to take concrete actions to demonstrate it is not heading down the path "the rest of the world believes them to be heading down".

In February, a Chinese Navy vessel aimed a military-grade laser at a RAAF P-8A Poseidon aircraft, which had been monitoring the ship from above over the Arafura Sea.

"Their own rhetoric in relation to Taiwan, their own actions in relation to the assaults on our military personnel – as I say the P-8 was put in a very precarious position – had that plane gone down we'd be having a very different discussion."]]></summary>

“Anything would be better than whatever it was that Kamala just said,” Ms Cousens said.

"According to even the Biden-friendly politico.com, as far as oil prices are concerned, Joey of Arabia doesn't stand an ice cube's chance in the desert of getting the sheiks to do anything about pain at the pump," Mr Morrow said.

Mr Morrow said President Biden was certainly trying to make peace with the Saudis.

"Fist bumping with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – you know, the same guy Biden said had made Saudi Arabia a 'pariah state' for his brutal hit job on Muslim Brotherhood-connected journalist Jamal Khashoggi."]]></summary>

Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas is in the running for the NCAA’s ‘Woman of the Year’ award. 

“This is just remarkable,” Ms Panahi said. 

“The patriarchy wins again and again,” she said. 

“It seems like biological male bodies are far better at being women than women are … where transwomen win woman of the year awards instead of women who have been women their entire lives.

There is strong evidence that a space surveillance complex in Russia’s northern Caucasus is being outfitted with a new laser system called Kalina that will target optical systems of foreign imaging satellites flying over Russian territory. Initiated in 2011, the project has suffered numerous delays, but recent Google Earth imagery shows that construction is now well underway. Kalina will complement a mobile laser dazzler known as Peresvet that has been operational since late 2019. 
 The Krona space surveillance complex Kalina is part of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Krona space surveillance complex, situated several kilometers west of Zelenchukskaya, a place well known in the astronomical community. Also located in its immediate vicinity are the Russian Academy of Science’s Special Astrophysical Observatory (housing the six-meter BTA telescope) and the RATAN-600 radio telescope.

DW: Russia's Gazprom says no sign of Nord Steam 1 turbine 
Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has asked German engineering firm Siemens for the return of a turbine that was being fixed in Canada. There are fears state-owned Gazprom could use the opportunity to cut off gas. 
The Russian gas supplier Gazprom said Saturday it had asked German engineering company Siemens for details about the return of a turbine — under maintenance in Canada — to ensure the delivery of gas from the Nord Stream pipeline to Europe. 
Gazprom is conducting maintenance on the pipeline over a 10-day period and has stopped delivering gas through the conduit, which runs beneath the Baltic Sea.

The Federalist: Did Gen. Milley Seize Presidential Power? Banks And Grassley Demand Answers 
Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, demanded Thursday that Gen. Mark Milley finally respond to allegations that he usurped presidential power over the military while he was President Donald Trump’s principal military adviser. Bob Woodward and Robert Costa raised the allegations in their 2021 book “Peril,” and according to the lawmakers, Milley still has not confirmed nor denied them.
“According to Bob Woodward’s book ‘Peril,’ Gen. Mark Milley directed senior military officers not to follow the president’s orders unless General Milley approved them first,” Banks said in a speech on the House floor on Thursday.

* President Biden laughed on Friday night after he was questioned about criticism over his fist bump with MBS 
* Image of the exchange drew harsh backlash from the widow of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
* Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in an assassination that US intel indicates was ordered by MBS 
* Biden told DailyMail.com reporter asking about potential future Saudi rights violations was 'silly question' 
* But Biden confirmed he brought up Khashoggi's murder in his meeting with MBS at the Saudi royal palace 
* 'I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it,' Biden said 
* Biden told reporters that MBS 'basically said he was not personally responsible' for the gruesome killing 
* 'I indicated I thought he was,' Biden continued. 'He said he was not personally responsible for it and he took action against those who were responsible' 
President Joe Biden laughed on Friday night after he was questioned about criticism over his fist bump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman outside the royal palace in Jeddah. 
The image of the friendly fist-bump drew harsh backlash from the publisher of the Washington Post and the widow of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in a gruesome assassination that US intelligence services say bin Salman ordered. 
Questioned about criticism of the fist bump by a DailyMail.com reporter, Biden laughed and then said it was a 'silly question' when asked how he can be sure another murder like that of Khashoggi wouldn't happen again.

One of Watson’s accusers filed a lawsuit last month against the Texans, Watson’s former employer, claiming the organization ‘turned a blind eye’ to Watson’s behavior towards female massage therapists while he played for the team.  She is the only plaintiff to file a lawsuit against the Texans, but in a statement, Buzbee said the settlements affect “all women who have made or intend to make claims against the Houston Texans organization.” .

Of course, there were his bulletproof defensive skills and magical return of serve.  Add to that the eye-popping thrill of watching Mr. Djokovic, a 6ft 2in Serbian, display his Gumby-like flexibility and shredded physique (achieved on a gluten-free diet and state-of-the-art workout regimen ) in a three-hour, four-set final.  Yet for those who care about such things – fashion critics, for example – the elegance of Mr. Djokovic’s game has benefited from an anachronism dating back to the start of the tournament in 1877. Namely the strict white dress code still enforced by the legendary All England Club.…]]></summary>

Naftogaz which has a $335 million bond maturing as well as two interest payments due on July 19, said Russia’s invasion had left it short of cash as many of its customers were now unable to pay their bills.

Bloomberg: Biden Set to Leave Saudi Arabia With No Announcement on Oil 
President Joe Biden will leave the Middle East this week with no public announcements on increasing oil supply, people familiar with the matter said. 
Biden, who came to office vowing to turn the world’s biggest oil exporter into a “pariah” over the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, said he decided to make the trip to advance US interests and try and curb soaring gasoline prices, which have hurt him politically ahead of mid-term elections. 
Biden heads to Saudi Arabia from Israel later on Friday, where he’ll meet with King Salman bin Abdulaziz and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the nation’s de-facto ruler. He will meet other leaders from the oil-exporting Persian Gulf on Saturday.

Newsweek: Ukraine Building 'Army of Drones' Though Donations to Monitor Front Line  
Ukraine is building an "Army of Drones" to monitor the front lines of its ongoing war against Russia. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's global donation initiative United24 announced the "Army of Drones" project last week alongside the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the country's Ministry of Digital Transformation. 
The project calls for international donors to provide funds that the Ukrainian military will use to purchase drones, as well as direct "dronations" of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Woods was, perhaps for the last time as a British Open contender, at No. 18 on the Old Course in St. Andrews.  He had sealed two triumphs here, ended his Grand Slam career here, dreamed for decades of being here.

Cheers rumbled from the stands, and not just those along No 18, as fiercely as they did when Woods tipped his cap on the Swilcan Bridge minutes after 3 p.m.  He had rubbed his eyes on the promenade, had tilted his cap a little more, and then, finally, the spectators and even the seagulls fell silent.

The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act is $37 billion above the president's request. 
The House approved sweeping defense policy legislation on Thursday that marks the second straight year Democrats and Republicans endorsed significant increases to President Joe Biden’s Pentagon spending plan. 
The $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act, approved in a 329-101 vote, is $37 billion more than the administration sought in military spending. 
On top of the budget, the bill also rebukes several of Biden’s national security plans. 
Members maintained a nuclear cruise missile the administration planned to scrap, hampered F-16 sales to Turkey and limited the number of aircraft and ships the Pentagon can retire.

WNU Editor: The House voted 329-101 to approve this $840 billion bill that includes funding for the Defense Department and directing policy at the agency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice," he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, poses for a picture at the Bundestag in Berlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister is not just a portentous political event. His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.
Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sixteen people were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir, with rescuers searching for dozens more missing, after flash floods swept away hundreds of tents near a popular Hindu pilgrimage site, officials said Saturday.
Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whizzing helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.
"We found 16 bodies so far and at least 40 are missing," an official from the state disaster response agency told AFP.
"Security forces and all the rescue teams are looking for the missing and injured," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his official residence on Saturday shortly before protesters, angered by an unprecedented economic crisis, stormed and overran the compound.
Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa's resignation, has called an urgent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the "stoning of the devil" ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year's expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
"I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave," Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…]]></summary>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain's departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world's fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
"We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

"Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being 'lynched,' as they put it, by the January 6 Committee," reported Julia Davis.
