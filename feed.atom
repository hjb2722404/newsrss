Politico: Israel needs to protect civilians or risk ‘strategic failure’ in Gaza

 
The warning comes as the Biden administration increases pressure on Israel to keep Palestinians safe. 
SIMI VALLEY, California — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered a stark public warning to Israel on Saturday, saying the government there risks “strategic defeat” in Gaza if it doesn’t do more to protect civilians.
The comments came a day after the breakdown in negotiations over hostage and prisoner releases led to the resumption of the Israel-Hamas war. Austin told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum that if Israel doesn’t do everything possible to protect civilians, it might help “drive [Palestinians] into the arms of the enemy,” and would “replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”

Contrary to what is sometimes heard among U.S. security practitioners in classrooms, conferences, and conversations, this is not a social justice program. It is not a diversity, equity, and inclusion mandate, or a call for the government to “do the right thing.” And regardless of what the name might make you think, it is not just about women.  Rather, the

CARACAS (Reuters) - Voters in Venezuela rejected in a Sunday referendum the International Court of Justice's jurisdiction over the country's long-running territorial dispute with neighboring Guyana and backed the creation of a new state in the Esequibo region.

“It's not able to get the Israelis to do anything,” Mr Siracusa said. 

He said reports have shown Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a plan to reduce the population of Gaza Palestinians to the lowest possible level. 

Mr Siracusa says the United States’ push for a two-state solution is as “dead as the dodo”. 

“We’re in a terrible place here because this can only get worse before it gets better.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Australia to lift its nuclear ban after the government rejected a nuclear pledge at the COP28 summit. 

The declaration to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050 was endorsed by more than 20 countries at the UN climate change conference. 

When asked by 17-year-old Nuclear for Australia founder Will Shackel about nuclear energy's role in global plans to decarbonise, President Macron said he hopes Australia will manage to lift the ban. 

“Nuclear energy is a source that is necessary to succeed for carbon neutrality in 2050,” Mr Macron said. 

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has criticised Labor, claiming the Albanese government has isolated itself from AUKUS allies by not endorsing the pledge.]]></summary>

President Joe Biden’s administration is publicly attempting to avoid a war with Iran, but American officials continue to fan the flames of war with incendiary rhetoric as the war in Gaza risks expanding into a broader regional conflict. 
For instance, on Nov. 26, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said the Biden administration needs to take a “massive retaliation” against Iran to end attacks on U.S. assets.

WNU Editor: The economic disaster that would ensue with the closure of the Strait of Hormuz and a shutdown of almost a quarter of the world's oil supply will be incalculable.

Military stockpiles and other resources are low due to the U.S. commitment to support Ukraine in its war against Russia, and Iran has spent years preparing itself in the event of an Israeli and/or U.S. attack. 
One should also not ignore the massive blow-back from U.S. allies who will be adversely affected by such a conflict. This is an easy prediction. A U.S. - Iran war will not receive the support from the West that the U.S. would want, unlike Iran who will be receiving enormous support from countries like China and Russia.]]></summary>

Politico:  US intelligence community was not aware of Hamas’ plan to attack Israel, Kirby confirms

 
His comments come after the New York Times reported that Israeli officials obtained the plans more than a year before the Oct. 7 attack occurred. 
The U.S. intelligence community was not aware of Hamas’ plan to attack Israel, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday, after the New York Times reported last week that Israeli officials obtained the plans more than a year before the Oct. 7 attack occurred.
“The intelligence community has indicated that they did not have access to this document,” Kirby told NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press.” POLITICO reported Friday that there was no indication Israel had shared the blueprint for the attack with the United States.

New York Times: Israel Knew Hamas’ Attack Plan More Than a Year Ago 
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli officials obtained Hamas’ battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show.

The approximately 40-page document, which Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” outlined, point by point, exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths of about 1,200 people. 
The translated document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters.

Seattle Times/New York Times: Intelligence Errors Prompt Scrutiny of Israeli Generals, but Little Backlash 
JERUSALEM — Israel’s military leadership faced heightened public scrutiny this past week after a string of damaging revelations in the Israeli media and The New York Times suggested that senior officers had ignored or dismissed intelligence reports about the likelihood of a major Hamas attack. 
According to those reports, the Israeli military obtained a copy of a battle plan that Hamas ultimately used during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, but officers wrongly judged that Hamas would be unable to carry it out. A commander also dismissed a subordinate’s warning in July that the group was running drills and building the capacity to set the plan in motion. 
The news raised expectations among political commentators that, after the war ends, senior military and security chiefs will either resign or be fired over the intelligence failures. 
Supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seized upon the reports, using the allegations of military failure to deflect from accusations that Netanyahu was partly to blame for what many Israelis consider the country’s worst security failure in 50 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Israel says it uncovered 800 shafts to Hamas tunnels below Gaza 
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli forces have found 800 shafts leading to Hamas' vast subterranean network of tunnels and bunkers since a Gaza ground operation began on Oct 27, and have destroyed more than half of them, the military said on Sunday. 
The Palestinian Islamist group said before the now eight-week-old war in the Gaza Strip that it had hundreds of kilometres of tunnels - a network comparable in size to the New York subway system - to protect and serve as operational bases. 
That has made them prime targets for Israeli air strikes with penetrating munitions and army engineers using mapping robots and exploding gel that can be poured into the passages. 
"The tunnel shafts were located in civilian areas, many of which were near or inside civilian buildings and structures, such as schools, kindergartens, mosques and playgrounds," the military said in a statement on Sunday.

The Guardian: ‘The Gospel’: how Israel uses AI to select bombing targets in Gaza

 
Concerns over data-driven ‘factory’ that significantly increases the number of targets for strikes in the Palestinian territory 
Israel’s military has made no secret of the intensity of its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. In the early days of the offensive, the head of its air force spoke of relentless, “around the clock” airstrikes. His forces, he said, were only striking military targets, but he added: “We are not being surgical.” 
There has, however, been relatively little attention paid to the methods used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to select targets in Gaza, and to the role artificial intelligence has played in their bombing campaign. 
As Israel resumes its offensive after a seven-day ceasefire, there are mounting concerns about the IDF’s targeting approach in a war against Hamas that, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, has so far killed more than 15,000 people in the territory.

* Saudi Arabia may "flush" the market with a flood of supply that would sink prices, an expert said. 
* That comes as OPEC+ concluded its latest meeting where members pledged voluntary production cuts without giving firm commitments. 
* Meanwhile, US crude output has been on a tear this year, hitting new record highs. 
Saudi Arabia may flood the market with more oil supplies, reversing its production curbs, as the world's top crude exporter tries to regain control of prices, an energy market veteran said. 
That comes as OPEC+ concluded its latest meeting where members pledged voluntary production cuts without giving firm commitments, prompting oil prices to fall. 
"We've more or less been saying potentially Saudi needs to just flush this thing out," Paul Sankey from Sankey Research told CNBC on Friday.

For more than a decade, people have been saying that the era of US dominance is coming to an end. But in reality there are still no other global players to rival it 
In recent years, the idea that the United States is an empire in decline has gained considerable support, some of it from quarters that until very recently would have denied it was ever an empire at all. The New York Times, for instance, has run columns that describe a “remarkably benign” American empire that is “in retreat”, or even at risk of decline and fall. 
Yet the shadow American power still casts over the rest of the world is unmistakable. The US has military superiority over all other countries, control of the world’s oceans via critical sea lanes, garrisons on every continent, a network of alliances that covers much of the industrial world, the ability to render individuals to secret prisons in countries from Cuba to Thailand, preponderant influence over the global financial system, about 30% of the world’s wealth and a continental economy not dependent on international trade.

WNU Editor: The US is the major power of the world, and we are still in a uni-polar world. But the trend line is clear. U.S. power is in decline, and we will be living in a multi-polar world in the next few years. I give it another 5 to 10 years.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Justice Department announced charges against an Indian man who's accused of directing an assassination plot. 
Nikhil "Nick" Gupta was charged on Wednesday after an Indian government employee who works on security and intelligence encouraged him to take out a Sikh activist who supports a sovereign state in northern India, the Department of Justice said.
The defendant conspired from India to assassinate, right here in New York City, a U.S. citizen of Indian origin who has publicly advocated for the establishment of a sovereign state for Sikhs," said Manhattan prosecutor Damian Williams in a statement.
It's the second such incident announced in the past week. According to President Joe Biden's administration, investigators foiled another plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States.
Among the most startling details in the Justice Department's statement is an alleged revelation from Gupta to an undercover DEA agent that another Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, "was also the target." 
In fact, he revealed, "We have so many targets."

Sikh groups, including some active in the United States and Canada, have vocally advocated for their own state to be parsed out of India. 
The Diplomat detailed leaked Pakistani documents it says point to an assassination program being orchestrated by India, though the site claimed the leak is attempting to capitalize on India's negative publicity. 
The Intercept's report last week also cited the same intelligence assessment, saying that the Indian government's "Research and Analysis Wing" has been plotting a global assassination plot in several countries in a coordinated effort to target Sikh and Kashmiri activists abroad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Hamas's deadly October 7 attack on southern Israel, the father of 17-year-old hostage Mia Leimberg had been praying for her safe release from captivity in Gaza -- and the return of the family pet.
To Moshe Leimberg's great joy, his daughter was finally freed on Tuesday as part of a group of hostages 12 -- 10 Israelis and two Thais -- that also included her mother and aunt.
And the release of the hostages under an agreement to pause fighting between Israel and Hamas also solved the mystery of what happened to Mia's pet dog Bella.
At the time of the Palestinian militant group's attack, the dog had been with Mia on the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Yitzhak, where she and her mother Gabriela had been visiting her aunt.
Leimberg searched for the fluffy white dog in the aftermath of the assault -- in which around 240 hostages were taken, Israeli officials say -- hoping it would be a comfort for his daughter when she finally returned, Israeli daily Israel Hayom reported.
The fate of the animal became clear on Tuesday when pictures were beamed around the world of Mia -- flanked by masked and armed fighters from Hamas and militant group the Islamic Jihad -- being handed over to Red Cross officials.
She was carrying Bella in her arms, which it now appears was with her all along.
Israeli officials say the Hamas attack on October 7 killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians.
In response, Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and has unleashed an air and ground campaign that the Hamas government says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.

On October 7, hundreds of Hamas gunmen pour across the border from Gaza, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage in the worst attack in Israel's history, traumatizing the country and stunning the world.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to "destroy" Hamas and Israel launches air bombardments followed by a ground offensive that reduces entire neighborhoods in the densely packed Palestinian territory to rubble.
As Gaza's destruction and death toll mount, international pressure grows on Israel to pause it's offensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis presided over his weekly audience Wednesday despite the flu that caused him to scrap a trip to Dubai, but asked an aide to deliver his reading for him.
The Argentine pontiff, 86, looked tired and sounded breathless as he told the audience at the Vatican that "I'm still not well with this flu".
Francis, who had part of a lung removed when he was younger, was forced Tuesday to cancel his scheduled trip to key UN climate talks, following advice from his doctors.
The pope had been due to travel to Dubai from Friday to Sunday, but is suffering from an inflammation of the respiratory tract, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.
Francis spoke at the end of Wednesday's audience to call for an end to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, wheezing as he did so.
But he looked cheered by a circus performance put on for him, complete with acrobats on roller skates.
And before the general audience he told visiting members of the Celtic football club that he was feeling "better than yesterday".
The pope, who turns 87 next month, has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from knee and hip pain to an inflamed colon and most recently, hernia surgery in June.
He was also hospitalized for three nights in March with bronchitis, which was cured with antibiotics.
On Saturday, he cancelled events due to what the Vatican called "light flu symptoms".
It said that a CT scan had ruled out "risks of pulmonary complications" and Francis was receiving antibiotics intravenously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the outskirts of the eastern German town of Wittenberg, a corrugated iron gate painted with green leaves welcomes visitors to the "Koenigreich Deutschland" (Kingdom of Germany).
Those who step through the gate to the cluster of buildings on the other side are entering place that styles itself a country, complete with its own flag, laws, currency and ID cards.
The so-called Kingdom of Germany was founded by former chef and karate teacher Peter Fitzek, who anointed himself as "king" in 2012 in an elaborate ceremony complete with a crown and scepter.
Fitzek and his followers are part of a movement known as the Reichsbuerger (Citizens of the Reich), a loose grouping of in some cases violent extremists and conspiracy theorists who reject the legitimacy of the modern German republic.

The findings were published Monday in the leadup to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) set to kick off Thursday in the United Arab Emirates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, former President Donald Trump has avoided agreeing with intelligence assessments that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered on his behalf during the 2016 presidential election.
Most infamously, Trump rejected the American intelligence community's assessment about Russia's actions at a press conference in Helsinki, Finland where he stood next to Putin and said, "President Putin says it's not Russia, I don't see any reason why it would be."
But it seems that Trump will actually blame Putin for 2016 election interference if doing so will help keep him out of prison.
Politico's Kyle Cheney flags a legal filing by Trump's attorneys this week in which they dispute special counsel Jack Smith's claims that Trump has damaged Americans' faith in the electoral system by essentially arguing that Putin did it first.
"The Special Counsel's Office falsely alleges that President Trump 'eroded public faith in the administration of the election,'" the filing states. "The 2016 [Intelligence Community Assessment] uses strikingly similar language to attribute the origins of that erosion to foreign influence -- that is, foreign efforts to 'undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.'"
The filing went on to argue that "President Trump is entitled to the detailed information supporting the conclusions in the 2016 Election ICA... in order to demonstrate to a jury that he did not create or cause the environment that the prosecution seeks to blame him for."
What Trump's lawyers leave out is the fact that Trump openly encouraged Russia to hack political rival Hillary Clinton's email server and release her private communications.
When Russia eventually leaked hacked emails from Clinton's campaign to WikiLeaks, Trump eagerly promoted them while on the campaign trail as evidence of Clinton's purported corruption.]]></summary>

Wilders, whose stunning general election win on Wednesday sent shock waves through the Netherlands and the whole of Europe, put forward a fresh candidate for a "scout" to oversee the coalition horse-trading.
His first appointment, Gom Van Strien, was forced to step down on Monday following allegations of fraud at a previous company. "Not my dream start," admitted Wilders.
After a brief meeting of top party leaders, Wilders' new candidate, former Labour Party education minister Ronald Plasterk, won "broad support", according to Lower House chairwoman Vera Bergkamp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Monday she was quitting Elon Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which she described as a "global sewer" and a tool to disrupt democracy.
"I've made the decision to leave X," Hidalgo said in an op-ed in French newspaper Le Monde. "X has in recent years become a weapon of mass destruction of our democracies", she wrote.
The 64-year-old Socialist, who unsuccessfully stood for the presidency in 2022, joined Twitter as it was then known in 2009 and has been a frequent user of the platform.
She accused X of promoting "misinformation", "anti-Semitism and racism."
"The list of abuses is endless", she added. "This media has become a vast global sewer."
Since Musk took over Twitter in 2022, a number of high-profile figures said they were leaving the popular social platform, but there has been no mass exodus.
Several politicians including EU industry chief Thierry Breton have announced that they are opening accounts on competing networks in addition to maintaining their presence on X.
The City of Paris account will remain on X, the mayor's office told AFP.
By contrast, some organisations have taken the plunge, including the US public radio network NPR, or the German anti-discrimination agency.
Hidalgo has regularly faced personal attacks on social media including Twitter, as well as sometimes criticism over the lack of cleanliness and security in Paris.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New documents surfaced in September indicating that Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel may have played a double role during World War II, serving not only as an informant for the Nazis but also as a member of the French Resistance. But a historian who has analysed the new evidence says he has “serious doubts” about her alleged membership in La Résistance, suggesting the French fashion icon may have used the documents to restore her reputation after the war.
The previously unseen documents were revealed to the public in mid-September at the opening of a London exhibition tracing the life and legacy of the French couturier. Alongside more than 50 of Chanel’s iconic tweed suits and a whole room dedicated to Chanel No. 5 perfume, a part of the “Gabrielle Chanel: Fashion Manifesto” retrospective also deal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British airline Virgin Atlantic on Tuesday operates the first transatlantic flight powered entirely by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), but environmental groups criticized the event as "greenwashing".
The flight will leave London's Heathrow airport at 1130 GMT bound for New York's JFK.
It is the first time that SAF will be used "in both engines, by a commercial airline, for long-haul flight", the airline said in a statement.
However, the Boeing 787 plane equipped with Rolls-Royce engines will not carry any paying passengers or cargo.
SAFs are produced from renewable biomass and waste resources and can be used in jet fuel to a maximum of 50 percent, having been blended with kerosene, in modern aircraft.

The reclusive North has one of the most highly controlled societies in the world, with leader Kim Jong Un accused of using a system of patronage and repression to retain absolute power.

However the additional two-day pause in fighting was not enough to meet all the needs of the people suffering in Gaza, Guterres warned.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
