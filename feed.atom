        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: China Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a Day 
(Bloomberg) -- Nearly 37 million people in China may have been infected with Covid-19 on a single day this week, according to estimates from the government’s top health authority, making the country’s outbreak by far the world’s largest.  
As many as 248 million people, or nearly 18% of the population, likely contracted the virus in the first 20 days of December, according to minutes from an internal meeting of China’s National Health Commission held on Wednesday, confirmed with people involved in the discussions. 
If accurate, the infection rate would dwarf the previous daily record of about 4 million, set in January 2022.  
Beijing’s swift dismantling of Covid Zero restrictions has led to the unfettered spread of the highly contagious omicron variants in a population with low levels of natural immunity. More than half the residents of Sichuan province, in China’s southwest, and the capital Beijing have been infected, according to the agency’s estimates.

Marine Times: Why the Marine Corps may nix gender identifiers for drill instructors 
A new academic report on efforts to integrate Marine Corps boot camp recommends dropping gender-specific salutations for drill instructors, but service leaders are not convinced they want to take that step. 
The lengthy report, commissioned by the Corps from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020 and completed in 2022, points out that half of the military services already have done away with gendered identifiers for training staff. 
“The Army, Navy, and Coast Guard effectively de-emphasize gender in an integrated environment,” the report states. “Instead of saying ‘ma’am’ or ‘sir,’ recruits in these Services refer to their drill instructors using their ranks or roles followed by their last names. Gendered identifiers prime recruits to think about or visually search for a drill instructor’s gender first, before their rank or role.”

Moldova’s spy chief warned on Monday (19 December) of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east next year and said Moscow still aimed to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. 
The comments by Alexandru Musteaţă, head of the Information and Security Service, echo recent messages out of Ukraine where top army generals have warned in recent days of the threat of a major new Russian offensive early next year. 
“The question is not whether the Russian Federation will undertake a new advance towards Moldova’s territory, but when it will do so,” Musteaţă told the TVR-Moldova television channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington Post: Senate backs plan to use money from seized Russian assets to aid Ukraine 
The Senate unanimously backed a plan to use certain confiscated Russian assets to aid Ukraine in its war with Russia. 
The United States and other countries targeted Russia and its oligarchs with a host of diplomatic and economic sanctions as punishment after it invaded its neighboring country in February. 
But U.S. law limited how money from those assets could be used, according to lawmakers.  The amendment, passed by a voice vote, is attached to the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill that passed the Senate 68-29 on Thursday. 
The House is expected to pass the spending package, which will include the amendment, ahead of a Friday deadline to keep the government funded.  President Biden supported using proceeds from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine and is expected to sign the spending package into law.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Presidents Biden and Zelensky   
New Voice Of Ukraine: Zelenskyy to unveil peace plan in February, WSJ reports 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his team are working on a peace proposal to be presented around Feb. 24, 2023 – the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 22, citing EU and Ukrainian diplomats. 
According to the report, Kyiv first seeks to maximize its negotiating position by securing as many “military victories” as it can. 
EU diplomats told WSJ that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin still hopes to launch another major offensive between February and April 2023, and therefore is unlikely to seriously consider negotiations before he can see if the plan pans out.

Update: Kiev is mulling peace plan, WSJ reports (RT)   
WNU Editor: The WSJ article is behind a paywall. 
When Ukrainian President Zelensky was in Washington this week he told some in Congress that he had proposed a “peace formula” in his meeting with President Biden where he hopes will result in joint security guarantees for decades to come. I can only assume that it is the same 10-point peace formula that he has been circulating for the past two months, the big one being the complete withdrawal of all Russian troops to the borders before 2014. 
Update #2: The Kremlin has responded to these media reports .... Kremlin comments on Kiev’s purported peace plan (RT). But I know that when it comes to the Zelensky government and Western guarantees, Moscow no longer trusts Zelensky and the West.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Germany Revives Coal as Energy Security Trumps Climate Goals 
Germany is set to boost its reliance on coal as it battles an unprecedented energy crisis — even at the expense of its ambitious climate goals. 
Europe’s largest economy is burning the fossil fuel for electricity at the fastest pace in at least six years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s also poised to be one of the few nations to increase coal imports next year.
On Thursday, utility Uniper SE said it would extend commercial operations of two of its coal-fired plants in Germany until March 2024 at the latest, in an effort to conserve natural gas in the coming winters. 
Across the globe, highly polluting — and relatively cheap — coal is making a comeback as countries seek to prevent soaring energy costs from triggering an economic meltdown. In Europe, the crisis is acute, after Russia curbed gas supplies in the fallout of its war in Ukraine. Germany is now trying to balance the short-term priority of bolstering energy security with the longer-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2045.

Update: Energy crisis fuels coal comeback in Germany (Euronews/Reuters) 
WNU Editor: On the one hand we hear German officials praising German efforts to cut gas production .... Germany Has Dramatically Slashed Its Dependence On Russian Gas (OilPrice.com), on the other hand we hear the opposite from other officials .... German regulator: gas consumption up, savings target missed (Reuters). But in this discussion is the uncomfortable truth that coal is making a comeback, and it is making a mockery of Germany's vaunted green energy efforts. 
One more note. According to German media reports Germany is consuming almost 1% of its natural gas stockpile per-day. That means by the end of March Germany will be out of natural gas, and when it comes to future supplies the country be completely dependent for LNG and what they can get from Norway.]]></summary>

An employee of the German intelligence agency the BND has been arrested after being suspected of sending classified information to Russia.
Federal prosecutors on Wednesday arrested an employee of Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, on suspicion of treason after an internal BND investigation revealed that he had allegedly been leaking classified information to Russia. 
Prosecutors said that the suspect was a German national named Carsten L., and that his home and workplace, and that of one other person, had been searched. 
In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the BND said that the employee had been placed in custody and that searches at two BND offices had been carried out.

A Swedish court's refusal to extradite a Turkish journalist, wanted for alleged links to the 2016 coup, has soured negotiations over Sweden's NATO ascension. 
Turkey's foreign minister said on Thursday that Sweden was not even "halfway" through fulfilling commitments made to secure Ankara's support for its NATO membership, despite appreciation for the steps thus far taken. 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke in a press conference with Swedish counterpart Tobias Billstrom, who is in Ankara on a visit. 
Turkey reached atrilateral agreement with Sweden and Finland last June during the NATO summit in Madrid regarding steps it said the two Nordic countries needed to make to secure its approval for joining the alliance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Putin FINALLY refers to Ukrainian invasion as a WAR for the first time in ten months: Opposition figures point out Vladimir should be jailed for breaking his own law 
* Vladimir Putin said in a speech that Russia's goal was to 'end this war' 
* The tyrant had outlawed the use of the word, with opposition figures jailed 
* He had previously always referred to his invasion as a 'special military operation'  
Vladimir Putin has finally referred to his brutal invasion of Ukraine as a 'war' - breaking his own law against the use of the word. 
Previously, the Russian tyrant had always labelled the bloody ten-month conflict a 'special military operation' and banned any reference to the true nature of his barbaric campaign.
Thousands of Russians have been punished, with some jailed and others fined, for describing the invasion as a 'war' - and now opposition leaders are demanding that Putin faces the same treatment.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: Everyone I know in Russia refers to this conflict as a war. And this is actually not the first time that Putin has referred to this conflict as a war. I saw and heard him use the term at least twice when he met the mothers and wives of soldiers killed in Ukraine a month or two ago. 
But I understand the Russian legal reasons why the term "special operations" is used. If the word war becomes part of the official language of this conflict, it then means that the Kremlin must make an official declaration of war against Ukraine. And the Kremlin is not ready to go down that road yet. It is the same reason why Ukraine has not declared war against Russia. It opens a Pandora's Box of legal steps that like the Kremlin the Kyiv government does not want to get into.]]></summary>

Iran issues threatening statement after Zelenskyy speech to Congress 
Iran on Thursday took a swing at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over comments he made to Congress this week and denied accusations that Tehran has supplied Russia with drones. 
"Mr. Zelenskyy had better know that Iran’s strategic patience over such unfounded accusations is not endless," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said in a threatening message posted to the ministry’s website.  
Kanaani also advised Zelenskyy "to draw a lesson from the fate of some other political leaders who contented themselves with the U.S. support."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of pro-Kremlin state media prediction that the U.S. support for Ukraine would die out, Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov became enraged when he saw an image of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris as they accepted and proudly held up the Ukrainian flag, The Daily Beast reports. 
As a guest was speaking, Solovyov reportedly was texting with producers, demanding that they remove the clip of Zelensky in the U.S. When the producers didn't react to his demands fast enough, he said, "Guys, get rid of this video, if you can’t read what is being written to you!”
“Zelensky is already on his way to Washington. It’s perhaps a natural path for any traitor... He betrayed his entire Soviet past,” he said. “Our weapon-makers are more talented anyway. Our men are more ingenious because we’re Russians—of many different nationalities. God is with us! Either we will win, or humanity will cease to exist, because the Lord won’t stand for the triumph of warriors of the Antichrist. We are the Lord’s weapon, we are his avenging right hand.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While investigating reports that Russian forces took children from two orphanages in Kherson, Ukraine, Sky News found CCTV footage that captured the moment Russians arrived to find the children.
The footage shows agents with Russia's secret police, the FSB, leading Russian soldiers through an orphanage. 
"They confiscated all the children's files," orphanage director Volodymyr Sahaidak told Sky News, "because they couldn't figure out where the children were, so they took files, they took computers, they took away the CCTV system because they wanted to know where the children had gone."
According to Sky News, no children were at the orphanage at the time because the community had heard the call from the orphanage to hide them. "The entire village rallied together to protect the children, taking them in, three or four per family. They ran the risk of collaborators exposing them to the Russians and being arrested or shot," Sky News' report stated.

The Russians never found the orphans, but sent another fifteen children from elsewhere in Ukraine for the orphanage to look after. Sky News has seen videos showing orphanage staff taking them in and treating them as their own. When the Russians finally retreated from the region, they came and took all 15 children with them.

Zelensky enjoyed a hero's welcome on a lightning trip on Wednesday in which US President Joe Biden committed nearly $1.8 billion in military supplies including, for the first time, the Patriot missile defense system.

Some GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), did not attend the speech, while Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and others did not stand up to applaud, although many Republicans expressed support for additional aid to Ukraine.
"I think behind the scenes there are discussions," McCaskill told "Morning Joe."

Times of Israel: 7 weeks after election win, Putin finally calls to congratulate Netanyahu 
Incoming prime minister expresses hope that war in Ukraine will end soon, and determination to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons 
Russian President Vladimir Putin called Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday morning, hours after the Likud leader announced he had formed a government. 
Putin, who has developed a close relationship with Netanyahu over the past decade, congratulated him on his election victory in November and on establishing his coalition, according to the Israeli readout of the call. 
“There is mutual confidence that Russian-Israeli relations will continue to develop progressively, and contacts at various levels will continue,” said the Russian Foreign Ministry after the call.

Update: Putin calls Netanyahu as Zelensky visits Washington (Jerusalem Post)   
WNU Editor: Netanyahu only announced two days ago that he had succeeded in putting together a coalition government. Putin's phone call happened after that.   Both leaders are very close. I expect this relationship will continue in the future.]]></summary>

Western intelligence agencies believe the Russians have suffered casualties of more than 100,000 killed or wounded and that some of the most elite and best-equipped Russian military units have been destroyed. The collective morale and will of the Russian soldiers in Ukraine — and likely of the Russian military as a whole — has been severely degraded. A significant portion of the territory that the Russians captured during their initial invasion nine or 10 months ago has since been retaken by the Ukrainians.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday denounced psychological violence and abuse of power in the Church, as the case of a prominent priest accused of exploiting his authority to sexually abuse nuns has rocked the Vatican.
The 86-year-old pope made his comments in his annual Christmas address to cardinals, bishops and other members of the Curia, the central administration of the Vatican.
Francis has often used the occasion to decry perceived flaws in the top bureaucracy, such as gossip, cliques and infighting.
After mentioning wars, the pope said: "Besides the violence of arms, there is also verbal violence, psychological violence, the violence of the abuse of power, the hidden violence of gossip."
He added that no one should "profit from his or her position a…]]></summary>

The 82-year-old "requires greater care related to renal and cardiac dysfunctions," said the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo.
It also reported a "progression" of his cancer, but said Pele was not in intensive care.
Considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time, Pele was hospitalized in Sao Paulo on November 29 for what his medical team called a re-evaluation of his chemotherapy treatments, which he has been receiving since having surgery to remove a colon tumor in September 2021.

KYIV (Reuters) - As Russian cruise missiles sped towards their target this month, a Ukrainian pilot gave chase in an old Soviet MiG-29 fighter jet and locked onto two of them, but could not take the shot: they were nearing a large town and it was too risky.
He said he passed the targets on to Ukraine's ground-based air defences which shot them down, as they have done hundreds of missiles since October, blunting the impact of a Russian air campaign that aims to destroy the country's power grid.
"Fortunately for us, they succeeded," the 29-year-old pilot, whose codename is Juice, told Reuters, describing the Dec. 5 incident.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A small group of Afghan women staged a defiant protest in Kabul on Thursday against a Taliban order banning them from universities, an activist said, adding that some were arrested.
In the latest move to restrict human rights in Afghanistan, the Taliban's minister for higher education on Tuesday ordered all public and private universities to bar women from attending.
"They expelled women from universities. Oh, the respected people, support, support. Rights for everyone or no one!" chanted the protesters as they rallied in a Kabul neighborhood, footage obtained by AFP showed.
A protester at the rally told AFP "some of the girls" had been arrested by women police officers. Two were released, but several remained in custody, she added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Three hundred days after Russian leader Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine with hopes of swift conquest, Zelensky enjoyed a hero's welcome on a lightning trip to Washington where President Joe Biden committed nearly $1.8 billion in military supplies including, for the first time, the Patriot missile defense system.
Zelensky -- whose media savvy and rugged demeanor have helped rally world opinion -- wore his trademark green military fatigues as he held talks at the White House and addressed Congress, where he handed over an Ukrainian flag fresh from the battlefield.

In the largest fine imposed in 2022, the National Commission for Technology and Freedoms (CNIL) said Microsoft's search engine Bing had not set up a system allowing users to refuse cookies as simply as accepting them.
The French regulator said that after investigations it found that "when users visited this site, cookies were deposited on their terminal without their consent, while these cookies were used, among others, for advertising purposes."

Washington Post: Netanyahu announces new government with sweeping powers to far-right allies 
TEL AVIV — Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu announced the formation of the most far-right government in the country’s history Wednesday night, marking the imminent return of its longest-serving leader and granting an unprecedented portion of power to his far-right and ultra-Orthodox allies, who have vowed to make far-reaching legislative changes in the country. 
Netanyahu said the new coalition, which includes once-fringe ultranationalist and ultrareligious parties, would serve “all citizens of Israel.” He has said that he aims to swear in the new government in the coming week. 
ost of the agreements, made after 1½ months of marathon negotiations between Netanyahu and his six coalition partners, have not been finalized. But the new government has already sparked concern among Israelis and members of the international community over bills that seek to prioritize Israel’s Jewish character over its democratic one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VOA: Taliban Bans Afghan Women from Universities  
Women and girls in Afghanistan suffered another setback in their push for equal access to education on Wednesday. Many universities closed their doors to female students hoping to take exams and attend class. 
 Reports by Voice of America and the Associated Press said young women could be seen crying after they were not permitted to go into their university buildings. 
Taliban fighters in Kabul and other Afghan cities blocked the students from going into their classrooms.  The action came one day after the Taliban administration shared a letter that said private and public universities should ban women and girls as soon as possible.

King Dollar is facing a revolt. 
Tired of a too-strong and newly weaponized greenback, some of the world’s biggest economies are exploring ways to circumvent the US currency. 
Smaller nations, including at least a dozen in Asia, are also experimenting with de-dollarization. And corporates around the world are selling an unprecedented portion of their debt in local currencies, wary of further dollar strength. 
No one is saying the greenback will be dethroned anytime soon from its reign as the principal medium of exchange. Calls for “peak dollar” have many times proven premature.

WNU Editor: The seizure of Russia's dollar assets was a wake-up call for everyone to start looking for alternatives. Raising interest rates and making the US dollar stronger so that America's inflation crisis can be dumped on everyone else has made this looking for an alternative to the US dollar into a rush.And while I do expect the US dollar to be the main currency that will be used in international trade and contracts, I give it another a decade before this is no longer the case.]]></summary>

Bloomberg: Putin Pledges Unlimited Spending to Ensure Victory in Ukraine 
(Bloomberg) -- President Vladimir Putin said Russia has “no limitations” on military spending for the war in Ukraine, as he urged the army to deliver on his declared goals with the invasion approaching its 11th month. 
“The country and government is giving everything that the army asks for — everything,” Putin told top military officials at the Defense Ministry’s annual meeting in Moscow on Wednesday. “I trust that there will be an appropriate response and the results will be achieved.” 
Russia should expand its armed forces to 1.5 million troops from the current 1.15 million to ensure its security, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin. The total should include 695,000 professional contract soldiers, he said, without explaining where the additional recruits would be found. 
The commitment to spare no expense on the war will be a strain on government finances as the proceeds from energy exports come under pressure from price restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. While Russia is running a record current-account surplus this year, the flow of money is expected to weaken in 2023 as sales of gas to Europe plunge and Group of Seven sanctions curb Russia’s oil revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States are considering staging their first large-scale joint live-fire demonstration in six years in 2023 amid North Korea's growing military threats, Seoul's defence ministry said on Thursday.
The drills have been floated as South Korea and the United States discuss preparations for the 70th anniversary of their alliance next year, ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha-gyu said.
"Marking that occasion, we are exploring various ways to showcase our military's presence and the alliance's overwhelming deterrence capabilities against North Korea," Jeon told a regular briefing.
"A combined joint live-fire demonstration can be one of the options."
The demonstration would be another joint display of force to be resumed following a years-long hiatus under new South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who pledged to bolster military capabilities and readiness to deter North Korea's weapons development.
On Tuesday, the United States flew its F-22 Raptor stealth fighters for joint drills with South Korea for the first time since 2018, hours after North Korea criticised both countries and vowed more missile tests.
In September, the allies staged their first exercises with a U.S. aircraft carrier since 2018.
Such exercises were halted under Yoon's predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who had prioritised engagement with the North, which denounced them as a rehearsal for invasion.
North Korea has tested an unprecedented number of missiles this year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) designed to strike the U.S. mainland. It has also completed preparations for what would be its first nuclear test since 2017, Seoul and Washington officials said.

NATO-supplied artillery was reportedly used in a deadly strike on a hotel in Donetsk 
One person has died and several were wounded after three projectiles struck a hotel on the south side of Donetsk on Wednesday evening. 
Among the wounded were former Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin and Deputy Prime Minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Vitaly Khotsenko. 
 “I was wounded in the back. Will survive. Shrapnel got within a centimeter from the spine,” Rogozin told RT from the hospital. “I will stay in Donetsk with my wounded comrades.”

WNU Editor: When I first started this blog I got into a few arguments with Dmitry Rogozin in the comments section. He was a regular reader of the blog, followed WNU on Twitter, and he was always disagreeing with me on my views on what political/economic/and foreign policy direction Russia should take. 
I always enjoyed our discussions, but when he was appointed by Putin to be Russia's ambassador to NATO and later Deputy Prime Minister he had to stop making his views public. 
He is a hardcore Russian nationalist, who I believe fell out of favor with Putin a few months ago. The fact that he is in Ukraine does not surprise me, nor the fact that Ukraine wants him dead.]]></summary>

WNU Editor: Here are my impressons on today's visit by Ukraine President Zelensky to Washington DC. 
1) Any doubts that the US is now completely committed to this war can now be put to rest. 
2) Zelensky arrived alone. Usually when a world leader arrives to meet the US President at the White House there is an entourage. Not in this case. 
3) President Biden's prepared opening statement at the press conference was the most hostile (and threatening) that I have ever hea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Zelensky's call for arms: Ukraine leader presents President Biden with his country's Merit Award during Oval Office sit-down - as he prepares to ask Congress for MORE weapons to defeat Putin 
* Zelensky gets red carpet welcome, military honor guard at White House 
* 'I'm delighted you could make the trip,' Biden said  
* U.S will give Ukraine more money and advanced weapons      * Some Republicans unhappy with additional support  
* Putin vowed retaliation for U.S. giving Ukraine Patriot missiles 
* Zelensky gave Biden a medal from a Ukrainian soldier  
Volodymyr Zelensky presented Joe Biden with a medal from a Ukrainian soldier during his visit to the White House on Wednesday as he prepares to make his pitch for more military aid to defeat Vladimir Putin. 
Zelensky arrived dressed for battle, wearing green military clothing and combat boots - a stark visual contrast to President Biden's suit. 
He and Biden sat before a cozy fire in the Oval Office with portraits of past American presidents looking down on them.

Zelensky's visit to Washington -- much like Churchill's in December 1941 -- comes with his country under relentless attack and international aid essential to its ability to fight on.
"Where Winston Churchill stood generations ago, so too will President Zelensky stand here today, not just as a president, but also as an ambassador of freedom itself," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the Ukrainian leader's address on Wednesday evening.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recalled that her father was a lawmaker when the British leader made his famous address to Congress.

— CNN International (@cnni) December 21, 2022
   Stephen Collinson, CNN: Why Zelensky’s surprise US visit is so hugely significant  
President Volodymyr Zelensky’s White House visit Wednesday will symbolically bolster America’s role as the arsenal of democracy in the bitter war for Ukraine’s survival and send a stunning public rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
The trip – Zelensky’s first outside Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February – also highlights President Joe Biden’s historic role in reviving the Western alliance that kept the Soviet Union at bay and is now countering new expansionism by Moscow in an effective proxy war between nuclear superpowers. 
Zelensky’s arrival will draw poignant echoes of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s arrival in Washington, 81 years ago on Thursday, days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That Christmas visit cemented the alliance that would win World War II and built the post-war democratic world.

Zelensky is reportedly arriving to Washington D.C. aboard a US Air Force plane, according to US officials cited in CNN, after taking a high risk train ride into Poland. White House national security communications coordinator John Kirby said of the impending visit with President Biden, "The President really believes that as we approach winter, as we enter … a new phase in this war, of Mr. Putin’s aggression, that this is a good time for the two leaders to sit down face to face and talk." But this is how Reuters somewhat cynically previewed the visit:        
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy headed to Washington on Wednesday to meet President Joe Biden, address Congress and seek "weapons, weapons and more weapons" in his first overseas trip since Russia invaded Ukraine 300 days ago.

RT: Defense minister announces major expansion of Russian army  
Sergey Shoigu says the nation’s military should amount to 1.5 million servicemen  
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has announced the need to make a number of structural changes to the country’s armed forces in light of NATO’s attempts to bolster its presence on Russia’s border and expand its membership to Finland and Sweden. 
During a Russian Defense Ministry meeting on Wednesday, Shoigu proposed a number of measures to strengthen the security of the Russian Federation, including creating a special grouping of troops on the country’s northwestern border and expanding Russia’s armed forces to amount to 1.5 million servicemen in total, with some 695,000 of them being contract soldiers.

On a side note. It is not in the news yet. But a Chinese source that I have known for a long time and who I trust just gave me a heads-up that China is going to make a similar announcement soon. A massive increase in manpower for its Army and other services.]]></summary>

Washington Post: No conclusive evidence Russia is behind Nord Stream attack 
After explosions in late September severely damaged undersea pipelines built to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe, world leaders quickly blamed Moscow for a brazen and dangerous act of sabotage. With winter approaching, it appeared the Kremlin intended to strangle the flow of energy to millions across the continent, an act of “blackmail,” some leaders said, designed to threaten countries into withdrawing their financial and military support for Ukraine. 
But now, after months of investigation, numerous officials privately say that Russia may not be to blame after all for the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. 
 “There is no evidence at this point that Russia was behind the sabotage,” said one European official, echoing the assessment of 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine countries interviewed in recent weeks.

WNU Editor: Russian media is playing up this Washington Post story .... No evidence Russia is behind Nord Stream blasts – WaPo (RT). More here .... No evidence of Russia behind Nord Stream attack — newspaper (TASS). 
As to what is my take.
Russia's Gazprom spent 10 years and $23 billion dollars to build these pipelines with the expectation that almost $1 trillion will be earned over the course of the lifetime of these pipelines. So yes. I will admit that I have trouble understanding the logic from those who say that Russia is the one who is responsible for blowing up their own gas pipelines. I mean .... they could have simply closed the taps.]]></summary>

Multiple officials familiar with the effort told CNN the administration has authorized a task force to investigate the potential violations of stiff export control restrictions and sanctions intended to prevent Iran from obtaining those materials, whose presence in the drones was confirmed by UK-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research.
That group examined several drones downed in Ukraine and determined that 82 percent of their components were manufactured by U.S.-based companies, including processors built by Texas Instruments and an engine built by an Austrian firm owned by Canada’s Bombardier Recreational Products.
Both companies have condemned the use of their technology for illicit purposes.]]></summary>

Six of the deaths were recorded in Apurimac, as Boluarte's own took a firm stand against her, marching in large numbers to demand fresh elections for a new president and Castillo's release despite a rash of corruption allegations.

The visit will "underscore the United States' steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes," White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
It will be Zelensky's first trip outside Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February, when they planned for a rapid takeover of Kyiv and much of the country.

Following widespread protests, the country of 1.4 billion people this month began dismantling its "zero-COVID" regime of lockdowns and testing that had largely kept the virus away for three years - at great economic and psychological costs.
The abrupt change of policy has caught the country's fragile health system unprepared, with hospitals scrambling for beds and blood, pharmacies for drugs, and authorities racing to build special clinics. Experts now predict China could face more than a million COV…]]></summary>

MEXICO CITY/LIMA (Reuters) -Peru declared Mexico's ambassador to Lima "persona non grata" and ordered him to leave the country on Tuesday, Peru's foreign minister announced, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two nations after Peru ousted Pedro Castillo as president.
The abrupt order, a severe measure in the world of diplomacy, gives Mexico's envoy to the South American country just 72 hours to exit.
The Peruvian government's decision came hours after Mexico's top diplomat announced that his country had granted asylum to the family of Castillo, who faces rebellion charges from behind bars after attempting what critics have labeled a coup on Dec. 7.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fiji's parliament has delayed its first sitting, where it had been expected a new prime minister would be sworn in to the Pacific islands nation for the first time in 16 years.
People's Alliance leader Sitiveni Rabuka is expected to become prime minister, after three parties signed a coalition agreement on Tuesday after a hung election. The deal would dislodge Fiji First's Frank Bainimarama, who has led Fiji since a 2006 coup.
The constitution requires lawmakers to elect the prime minister from the parliament floor if no one party has won more than 50% of seats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Taliban authorities on Tuesday ordered a nationwide ban on university education for females, as the hardline Islamists continue to crush Afghan women’s right to education and freedom.
Despite promising a softer rule when they seized power last year, the Taliban have ratcheted up restrictions on all aspects of women’s lives, ignoring international outrage.
"You all are informed to immediately implement the mentioned order of suspending education of females until further notice," said a letter issued to all government and private universities, signed by the Minister for Higher Education, Neda Mohammad Nadeem.
The spokesman for the ministry, Ziaullah Hashimi, who tweeted the letter, confirmed the order in a text message to AFP.
