        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky News correspondent Annelise Nielsen says Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have “sat out” a number of the main events held across the Platinum Jubilee weekend, including the Party at the Palace concert.

“I think that was pretty deliberate – that they didn’t want to be drawing attention away from anything,” Ms Nielsen said, 

“When speaking to people here – the diehard royal fans – a lot of them say that they are disappointed in how Harry and Meghan have conducted their step back from royal life, that they don’t agree with many of their criticisms of the Royal Family. 

“But they do say … he is the Queen’s grandson and so there should be respect for the monarch and in that instance it does mean her heirs as well.”]]></summary>

CNN: Biden's meeting with Saudi crown prince pushed back to July 
(CNN)A meeting between President Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is now expected to happen next month, according to an administration official. 
CNN reported earlier this week that Biden and the crown prince were planning to meet at the end of June as part of a broader summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which Saudi Arabia currently presides over. 
Biden is still expected to travel later this month to Germany and Spain for the G7 and NATO summits respectively. 
Officials determined that two separate trips -- one to Europe and one to the Middle East -- would allow for more time to plan and set a schedule and agenda.

TEL AVIV, Israel—The ongoing war between Israel and Iran across the Middle East came out of the shadows and into the open long ago. 
But now, on the back of several suspected Israeli attacks inside Iran itself, the deadly contest threatens to escalate—possibly beyond the region.
Last week, several quadcopter drones smashed into a suspected Iranian nuclear research and drone facility at Parchin, killing one engineer. Mere days before, two assassins on motorbikes shot dead an Iranian military colonel in the heart of Tehran. In February, several drones hit an Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base in the west of the country at Kermanshah. Although never officially taking responsibility, various unsubtle hints by Israeli officials and media reports have left little doubt as to the provenance of these attacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — President Biden was briefly evacuated Saturday from his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after a small private plane accidentally flew into restricted airspace, according to White House and Secret Service officials.
Mr. Biden arrived in Rehoboth Beach on Thursday evening and is expected to return to the White House on Sunday.  Officials said the president was not in danger during the incident.
A White House official told reporters that Mr. Biden and the first lady were briefly evacuated and then returned to their residence.
“A small private plane entered restricted airspace, all indications are incorrect and precautionary measures have been taken,” the official said.  “There was no threat against the president or his family.”

        <updated>2022-06-04T22:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data from the app showed that in 2021, users hosted more than 3,600 bachelorette parties in Scottsdale, compared to about 13,000 in Nashville, said Mike Petrakis, 31, founder and chief executive of Bach.  This year, its data shows that more than 11,600 parties are planned in Scottsdale, compared to 30,000 in Nashville.  If that rate of growth continues in Scottsdale, Mr. Petrakis said, it has the potential to overtake Nashville in terms of bookings.  And on a recent weekend in May, more than one bachelor party attendee said Scottsdale was “the new Nashville.”
Robert Mayer, 35, owner of Arizona Party Bike, said his Scottsdale location began booking a record number of bachelorette parties in the summer of 2020. Brides were looking for a place to celebrate without restrictions pandemics, he added.  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, never enacted a statewide mask mandate and reopened restaurants for indoor dining in May 2020. In Maricopa County , which includes Scottsdale, about 1,200 new Covid cases are currently reported per day.
Mr. Mayer’s company, which features on Bach, runs tours of the Old Town on cart-sized cranksets, charging up to $499 (plus the cost of alcohol) for two-hour private tours for up to 15 people.  His clientele is currently 75% female, with a median age of 28, he said.  Local outfitters of hot air balloons and desert jeep tours are also teeming with groups of women in their twenties singing Katy Perry songs and only occasionally throwing up.
It is perhaps unsurprising that the influx has already caused unrest.  One Saturday in May at the Arizona Party Bike depot in Old Town, Lacy Gray, 27, a company guide, had to explain the rules of the road to a South Dakota bachelor party after her members, sporting candy-colored wigs, took their seats at a neon-pink pedal bar.
An instruction?  No playback requests “‘WAP’, specifically,” Ms. Gray said.  (The song was proactively banned, Mr. Mayer added, after attracting stares from “disgruntled” pedestrians.)

In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston Celtics reserve guard Payton Pritchard drove into the paint against Miami Heat’s Tyler Herro and take a little jump.  Pritchard then put a hand close to the ground, a common NBA taunt to signify that a defender is too small to guard the taunter.
Pritchard is just over six feet tall and is, in almost every situation in the NBA, the shortest player on the court.  Herro is four inches taller than him.
“The game is competitive, so, I mean there will always be a bit of bickering here and there.“, Pritchard remained impassive in a recent interview.
Usually Pritchard is the recipient of these jeers.
“If you give it, you also have to take it,” he said.

And according to police reports, he was arrested in 2019 on two counts of criminal mischief for incidents the previous year in which, while jogging, Barber approached two cars different and hit and damaged them.  He pleaded no contest and his sentence included 12 months probation.
Last year, former Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant posted a video of Barber’s plays on Twitter and wrote that “he’s down…we’re just a stat and moments for Most people”.
On Monday, Bryant wrote on Twitter: “Too much to digest, so much to say… This is real life, it can be any one of us. We need each other, we need unity.
Marion Sylvester Barber III was born on June 10, 1983 in Plymouth, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis.  Like his father, Barber played at the University of Minnesota, where he was part of a powerful backfield with Laurence Maroney. Barber rushed for 1,196 yards and 1,269 yards in 2003 and 2004.
The Cowboys selected him in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft.
Football was a family affair for barbers.  In addition to his father, Barber’s brothers, Thomas and Dominique, also played for the University of Minnesota Gophers.  Dominique was a defensive back with the Houston Texans of the NFL.
In a statement Thursday, PJ Fleck, head coach of the Gophers, said, “Marion was one of the best to ever play in Minnesota, and he’s a big reason a lot of people are Gopher fans today.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Bollywood-style dance to henna tattoo workshops, celebrations for Queen Elizabeth’s record-breaking 70-year reign in the northwestern English city of Preston had a multicultural flavour on Saturday. With a population of 140,000 and close to Manchester, Preston is home to a large community with South Asian ancestry, and this year combined its annual festival of subcontinental arts, culture, tradition and heritage with celebrations for the queen’s Platinum Jubilee. To mark the royal landmark, the Preston City Mela, a showcase for all things South Asian since 1997, broadened its scope to include culture from the 54 Commonwealth countries.  “Of course we live in this country and we do love our queen, but it’s nice to have our culture in the spotlight for a change, and all the Commonwealth cultures as well,” Hanifa, a Preston resident of Indonesian origin, told Agence France-Presse. “The atmosphere is so nice and to have all those influences, all these cultures, makes it even nicer,” said the 60-year-old, who was enjoying the day with friends. She said she watched on television as the royal celebrations got under way in central London on Thursday with the Trooping of the Colour military parade, and found it “moving” to see the queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family. Gulab Singh, organiser of the Preston mela, said this year’s curators had tried to align with the jubilee “as much as we can”. “With the Mela, it’s always South Asian art, but we’ve broadened it up to reflect the Commonwealth perspective,” he explained. “This year, we have a cake-cutting ceremony … Cake cutting is sooo British,” added fellow organiser Shreya Ghodke. The Commonwealth is a grouping of mainly former British colonies headed by the queen, who is also head of state in 14 of these countries or realms in addition to the UK. Australia, New Zealand hail Queen Elizabeth as republic question returns Sitting in the sun, 58-year-old Amit Chauhan was getting into the festive mood, eating vegetable samosas and nodding to the music…]]></summary>

Swiatek, an avid reader and excellent student during her high school years, is a particularly thoughtful and committed young champion.  Gauff, the prodigy from Delray Beach, Florida, is a particularly thoughtful and committed finalist, ready to use her athletic success to speak out on social issues, like gun violence in the United States, which she did after her semi-final victory over Martina Trevisan on Thursday.
Just four years ago, they both competed in the French Open women’s tournament, with Gauff winning the title and Swiatek losing in the semi-finals.  But Swiatek, Gauff’s eldest by nearly three years, has since taken center stage on the women’s stage with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1980, Fred Wilpon would buy the team, adding another layer of connective tissue: Wilpon attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn with Dodgers Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax and was a rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fan.  It was under his leadership that Citi Field opened in 2009 with so many Dodgers-related touches — including the enormous Jackie Robinson Rotunda — that some Mets fans complained there were no more winks. in Brooklyn than at the Mets.
The connections would only continue, with Mike Piazza’s Hall of Fame career spanning the franchises and Justin Turner, a crucial member of the current Dodgers squad, having started his career in orange and blue.
Now Steven A. Cohen, who tried to buy the Dodgers in 2012, is calling the Mets shots.  In his first public remarks after buying the Mets, he cited the Dodgers as a model of what he hoped the Mets would become.  He backed that up by pushing the Mets payroll near the top of the sport.
“They’re going to separate themselves from the pack,” said Valentine, who, in keeping with the connective tissue theme, was once married to a daughter of Ralph Branca, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  “Kind of like the Dodgers tried to do when they left town, and the Yankees always have.”
Two of Hodges’ adult children — Gil Jr., 72, and Irene, 71 — plan to be at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, along with two of Irene’s granddaughters and a cousin.  And as the videos roll and the lights flash, the iron steel cable that spans decades and miles will remain as strong as ever.
“Without a doubt, the 1969 World Series was amazing,” says Irene Hodges of her favorite memory.  “Everyone was just thrilled.  All of Brooklyn was crazy.  It was a wonderful moment.  My dad, I think, was a little scared to manage in New York.  He knew how good the fans were here, how much they loved him, and he just wanted to do the right thing for them.  He wanted to have a successful team.  And he did.”

Swiatek, Poland’s No. 1 seed, cemented her status as the dominant player of the match by beating Coco Gauff of the United States, 6-1, 6-3, in Saturday’s women’s final in just over one o’clock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, June 3, South Korea’s Financial Surveillance Service (FSS) began a survey of payment gateway services that work with digital assets.  The FSS is South Korea’s financial regulatory body that operates under the aegis of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), both of which are government institutions.
As local news outlet Money Today Co. reported, the FSS had recently demanded reports from 157 payment gateways on any crypto-related service, their plans for the future, and disclosure of digital assets.  But an FSS report said only 6 held digital assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON – Police evacuated crowds and cordoned off Trafalgar Square on Saturday morning, rocking the British capital on the third day of Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth.
The The Metropolitan Police did not say what prompted the evacuation, but said in a tweet that officers were currently at the scene in the square, which is at the opposite end of the mall from Buckingham Palace, where a major concert is scheduled for Saturday night.
A few minutes later, the police tweeted that “the incident is now over” and that they would reopen the place “in due course”.  No further details on the nature of the incident were immediately available Saturday morning.

Above all, they supported it because deep down they know it will work.  They know, at least, that it might create the illusion of an alternate set of facts.  They also know that a lot of the heavy lifting will be done by prejudice, by those who would point out, arch, that this seems to happen a huge amount to Liverpool fans or England fans or just football fans as a whole.
They know that while social media has allowed all of these images, videos and first-hand accounts to surface and spread, citizen journalism is a far less powerful force online than deep-rooted partisanship.  They know that the latter will dominate the former at some point, at least enough to muddy the waters, to obscure not only that specific truth but also the idea of ​​truth, to ensure that some blame is distributed elsewhere.
Many, certainly, have taken the opportunity to assume that Liverpool fans, or English fans, or even a certain swath of football fans as a whole must be at fault.  Many decided that this must be the first time someone had tried to gain access to an event using a fake ticket, not considering whether perhaps some of these people were victims, rather than perpetrators, of a crime. , not wondering if maybe that’s the kind of thing the authorities should be prepared to deal with.
And yet, the temptation to side with the authorities, in the aftermath of an event like this, rather than with those who are different from you only in the team they support is dangerous.

But that’s not breaking news, is it?
Exactly.
News consumers have long complained that cable news outlets, especially CNN, are overusing the breaking news chart – for stories that simply aren’t breaking news – in a desperate attempt to maintain ratings.
Fortunately, CNN takes a personal view.
In A memo to staffers on Thursday, CNN’s new president Chris Licht said:

I’ve heard people inside and outside the organization complain that we’re abusing the “Breaking News” banner.  I agree.

She poked a finger through a hole in it.
“It looks like an entry,” said Dr. Fortun, who is one of only two medical examiners in the Philippines.  “So an apparent gunshot wound to the head for this one.”
Since July 2021, Dr. Fortun, 60, has been quietly examining these bones at the request of a Catholic priest, the Reverend Flaviano Villanueva, and the families of the victims.


What Dr. Fortun discovered made headlines across the country.

(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a major rewrite of the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Early versions of the text, which is still being finalized, show how the administration’s priorities are shifting in response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and the burgeoning partnership between Beijing and Moscow. 
The document’s publication, originally slated for this past January, was delayed after US officials came to believe that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was likely. 
It is now being substantially rewritten to reflect the ways the world has changed since the war began, the people said. It’s not yet clear when it will be published, and one of the people emphasized it may still undergo changes.

WNU Editor: The world has certainly changed a lot in the past two years. So this rewrite of America's National Security Strategy should surprise no one. But my gut tells me that we are going to see even more change in the coming months that will make this rewrite obsolete. We are definitely living in interesting times.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After leaving high school at age 15, Gilberto took a job as a pharmacy clerk.  Very quickly manager, he opened his own store at the age of 25.  Along the way, he became involved in Cali’s underworld, joining a gang of kidnappers and getting into the drug trade.
In the 1970s, he and his brother helped organize a loose confederation of drug gangs into what became known as the Cali Cartel.  Less authoritarian than Mr. Escobar’s Medellín Cartel, the Cali Confederacy cooperated on processing, shipping and distribution but otherwise gave its member gangs significant autonomy.
Yet, as the most successful members, the Rodríguez brothers were first among equals.  Miguel acted as a sort of general manager for the cartel, overseeing day-to-day operations, while Gilberto was the strategic visionary.  They also set the tone for the organization: no flashy parties, no flamboyant displays of wealth, and above all no unnecessary violence.
Mr. Rodríguez was also responsible for managing the cartel’s legitimate business interests.  He owned a chain of 400 pharmacies, a pharmaceutical laboratory, ranches, a radio network and America, a football club in Cali;  Mr. Rodríguez has served on banking boards and mingled with Colombia’s financial elite.
At first, he and Mr. Escobar got along well;  Jorge Ochoa Vázquez, a chef from Medellín, accompanied Mr. Rodríguez on a trip to Europe in 1984, where they sought to open up new markets.  (They were arrested in Spain for trafficking and extradited to Colombia, but Mr. Rodríguez was found not guilty.)
Soon, however, the relationship between the two cartels soured.  Apart from rivalries in North American markets, they disagreed on how to fight back when, in the late 1980s, the Colombian government launched a campaign to stamp out drug trafficking.
Mr. Escobar preferred war and, over a period of five years, killed hundreds of police officers, politicians, lawyers and journalists.  Mr. Rodríguez hesitated, preferring to watch his two main threats tear apart from the sidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RENO, Nev. — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on several U.S. cities to have sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.
Mr. Zelensky, who addressed the gathering of mayors right after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago;  Jacksonville, Florida;  Portland, Oregon;  San Diego and San Jose, California for maintaining sister city ties in Russia.  He said those relationships should be severed.
“What do these links bring you?  Probably nothing,” Mr. Zelensky said.  “But they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.”
Chicago announced earlier this year that it was to suspendbut not ending permanently, its sister city relationship with Moscowwhich had been in place since 1997. Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister city relationship with Yekaterinburg, Russia.  Since Friday, the websites of the programs of the sister cities of Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.


Many U.S. municipalities have sister city relationships in multiple countries.  Although partnerships can include commercial and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local non-profit organizations.
But Mr Zelensky, who spoke to mayors 100 days after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia any extra credibility.
” Do not apologize ;  don’t have relations with Russia,” said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech was applauded by mayors and city workers who had gathered in Reno, Nevada.  “And please don’t let those who have become murderers call your cities their sister cities.  ”
Portland officials referenced a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners.  Officials from other U.S. cities named by Mr. Zelensky did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Ukrainians
We have three important pieces of news. First, the European Union is gradually moving towards the implementation of the sixth sanctions package. Frankly, achieving this is very difficult. Because this sanctions package is primarily about oil.
Finally, the world is giving up Russian oil.
...
The second piece of news is that the United States has confirmed at various levels that modern HIMARS are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land.
I am grateful to President Biden, all our American friends, and the people of the United States for their support. We are looking forward to it.

The three brothers Ahmad, Iyad and Bassam Alaa Aldin decided to relocate the company in 2013 to escape the violence that has since rocked their hometown, Idlib.  With their wives and children, they crossed the border and opened a gleaming new bakery in the southern Turkish town of Hatay, in a neighborhood now teeming with Syrians and reminiscent of pre-war Damascus.  Their 25 employees are also Syrian refugees.

RT: Russia not to blame for global food crisis – Putin  
Moscow is ready to aid in transporting Ukrainian grain, but Western sanctions make it impossible, the Russian president has said  
The restrictions imposed by the US and its allies against Russia and Belarus will only exacerbate the looming global food crisis by affecting the fertilizer trade and sending food prices even higher, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.
In a special TV interview on Friday evening following a meeting with African Union head Macky Sall in Sochi, Putin accused Western leaders of trying "to shift the responsibility for what is happening in the world food market."

France 24: African Union head Sall 'reassured' after talks with Putin on food shortages  
African Union head Macky Sall said on Friday he was "reassured" after talks in Russia with President Vladimir Putin on food shortages caused by Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. 
Putin hosted the Senegalese president, who chairs the African Union, at his Black Sea residence in Sochi on the 100th day of Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. Global food shortages and grain supplies stuck in Ukrainian ports were high on the agenda.
"I found Vladimir Putin committed and aware that the crisis and sanctions create serious problems for weak economies, such as African economies," Sall told journalists, adding that he was leaving Russia "very reassured and very happy with our exchanges".

Russia is making gains in the Donbas through a grinding and indiscriminate war. 
 One hundred days into the war in Ukraine, Russia has turned its siege tactics on Sievierodonetsk, the last major city in Luhansk still outside its control.
Ukraine is still gripping the city, as Russia seeks to take it by leveling it to nothing. Almost 90 percent of Sievierodonetsk’s buildings, and all of its critical infrastructure, have been destroyed, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A few th…]]></summary>

Oil rose higher on Friday, supported by expectations that OPEC’s decision to increase production targets by slightly more than planned won’t much affect tight global supply and by rising demand as China eases Covid restrictions. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on Thursday agreed to boost output by 648,000 barrels per day (bpd) a month in July and August rather than 432,000 bpd as previously agreed.  Brent crude rose $1.80, or 1.5%, to $119.41 a barrel. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude advanced $1.80, or 1.5%, to $118.67.

As Russia's military operation in Ukraine is entering its 100-day anniversary, life in Moscow and St. Petersburg remains largely normal, even as many Western retailers have left Russia   
Daily Mail: Inside Russia's 'ghost town' shopping malls where Western brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Zara have shut in protest over war in Ukraine 
* Dozens of foreign and international companies have withdrawn from Russia since Putin invaded Ukraine 
* Popular brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Zara, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Starbucks sit empty on high streets 
* The changes have been prompted by Western sanctions and unprecedented pullout of Western businesses 
Western brands have pulled out of Russia leaving shopping malls in Moscow and St Petersburg to become 'ghost towns' with high street locations sitting empty. 
Brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Zara have shut in protest over war in Ukraine which began on February 24. 
The changes have been prompted by Western sanctions and a massive, unprecedented pullout of Western businesses that had become entrenched in the landscape of Russia's daily life over three decades.

CNN: The world may be careening toward a 1970s-style energy crisis -- or worse 
New York (CNN Business)The world is grappling with gravity-defying energy price spikes on everything from gasoline and natural gas to coal. Some fear this may just be the beginning.
Current and former energy officials tell CNN they worry that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the wake of years of underinvestment in the energy sector have sent the world careening into a crisis that will rival or even exceed the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s. 
Unlike those infamous episodes, this one is not contained to oil. 
"Now we have an oil crisis, a gas crisis and an electricity crisis at the same time," Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency watchdog group, told Der Spiegel in an interview published this week. "This energy crisis is much bigger than the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s. And it will probably last longer."
