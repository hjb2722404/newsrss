        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mermaid Inn, a perennially popular restaurant at 570 Amsterdam Ave.  for 15 years, will close on October 16.  Owners Danny Abrams and Cindy Smith said they had mutually agreed with the building’s new owners, a local partnership, to terminate their lease on the soon-to-expire New England-style seafood spot.
“We’re both very sad,” Smith said of her and Abrams after breaking the news to 90 employees.
Their new owner has unknown plans for the building and, “We didn’t want to have a restaurant surrounded by scaffolding,” Smith said.
But mermaid lovers can also expect a new location nearby, Abrams said. 
“We’re looking at two or three places to move to on the Upper West Side, and hope to be one by late spring or early summer,” he said.
Meanwhile, the duo are set to open a mammoth new Mermaid Inn at 127 W. 43rd Street near Times Square, the former site of HB Burger, where they partnered with Alicart Restaurant Group CEO Jeffrey Bank.
Abrams and Smith said Amsterdam Avenue employees would be offered jobs at the Times Square site.  Only about half of the planned 550 seats will open this fall, with the rest to follow early next year. 
The New England-style seafood spot will seek a new home on the Upper West Side, the owners said.James Keivom
“We haven’t built it yet,” Abrams explained.
This will be their fifth and biggest mermaid.  The oldest, at 96 Second Ave.  city ​​center, only reopened after two-year pandemic.  The others are in Greenwich Village (where it’s called the Mermaid Oyster Bar) and Chelsea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin got a “brush back” from Chinese President Xi Jinping and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the Ukraine war in recent weeks, former US ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker says. 

“I think Putin was counting on some political and moral support if nothing more from Xi and perhaps Modi, or at least opportunistic behaviour from them,” Mr Volker told Sky News Australia. 

“He got quite the opposite – he got a brush back from both Xi and he had to acknowledge that Xi raised concerns about the war in Ukraine and from Modi. 

“And I would add also from Erdogan.”]]></summary>

Newsweek: How Russia's Reserve Forces Compare to U.S. Counterparts 
After Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization earlier this week, calling up 300,000 members of the Russian Army reserves to fight in Ukraine, the Pentagon pointed out on Thursday that Russia's reserves are different from U.S. reserves. 
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder said Putin's mobilization "would primarily be reservists or members of the Russian military that had retired."  Ryder said these Russian reserves were not like U.S. reserve formations. 
He said that in the U.S., reserve troops are fully trained and ready to deploy "in hours, days or weeks, as needed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hilaria Baldwin has given birth to her seventh child with husband Alec Baldwin, she shared a post on instagram Saturday afternoon.  The girl, named Ilaria Catalina Irena, was born on Thursday.
“She’s here! We’re so excited to introduce you to our little dream come true,” she wrote.
Hilaria added that both she and the baby are healthy and happy.

“Her Baldwinito brothers are spending the day bonding and welcoming her into our home,” she wrote.  “Much love to you all. We are so happy to celebrate this wonderful news with you.”


The yoga instructor and actress announced    that she was pregnant in March, calling it a “big surprise”.
“After many ups and downs over the past few years, we have an exciting one and a big surprise: another Baldwinito is coming this fall,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.  “We were sure that our family was complete and we are very happy with this surprise.”


In 2020, the couple welcome  a boy named Edward.  Then, six months later, they announced  the birth of their sixth child via surrogacy, a daughter named Lucia.  Hilaria had already opened up on social media about suffering two miscarriages.
Alec also has a 26-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger.
Hilaria was on a social media break for several weeks before announcing her pregnancy.  She had already moved away from social media last fall, when Alec was holding a gun that dispensed  on the set of the movie “Rust”, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is again signaling an affinity with believers in the QAnon conspiracies – on Thursday night he reposted a video originally shared by a QAnon follower containing catchphrases and which integrated Trump into images affiliated with the QAnon. conspiratorial movement.
The video includes edited footage of Trump that makes it look like he is holding a playing card with a “Q” and holding an American flag surrounded by the letter Q. There is also a slide with the QAnon slogan “WWG1WGA”, an acronym for “where let’s go one, let’s all go” and a man wearing Trump’s red tie with a “Q” pin in his lapel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Saturday criticised a U.S. move to make exceptions to sanctions in order to help provide internet to Iranians during nationwide protests, state media reported.
It said this was in line with Washington's hostile stance towards Tehran.
"By reducing the severity of a number of communications sanctions - while maintaining maximum pressure - the U.S. is seeking to advance its goals against Iran," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying.

		The brass lettering on the stone reads "George VI 1895-1952 / Elizabeth 1900-2002" on the top two lines, followed by a garter star and then "Elizabeth II 1926-2022 / Philip 1921-2021" on the bottom two lines.
	

		Queen Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, is also interred at the chapel, at Windsor Castle west of London.
	

		Elizabeth died on Sept. 8 at Balmoral Castle, her summer home in the Scottish highlands, after 70 years on the throne. Her son Charles has become king.

Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), called it a "heart-wrenching tragedy".
At least 14 people rescued were recovering in hospitals in Syria while six others were discharged, as search efforts continued, with several people still missing since the boat sank on Thursday.
"There are 89 victims, while 14 people are receiving treatment at Al-Basel Hospital, two of whom are in intensive care," Syria's official news agency SANA reported, quoting Iskandar Ammar, a hospital official.

The Kurdish woman was pronounced dead after spending three days in a coma following her arrest by Iran's feared morality police for wearing the hijab headscarf in an "improper" way.

"Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction," Putin said, adding: "This is not a bluff."
However analysts aren't convinced the Russian president is willing to be the first to unleash nuclear weapons since the US bombed Japan in 1945.

The CIA launched its first episode of its new podcast 'The Langley Files' on Thursday 
CIA Director William Burns called Russia a "declining" power in the first episode of the intelligence agency's new podcast, while warning that China is a "central geopolitical challenge" for the U.S. 
The CIA's podcast, "The Langley Files," launched Thursday and featured Burns as its first guest. 
The podcast comes during the CIA’s 75th anniversary — a time, Burns said, for the agency to "reflect on how we need to organize ourselves to navigate successfully what is an incredibly complicated international terrain." 
Burns warned that terrain features a "major power competition with rising powers like China," which he referred to as a "central geopolitical challenge."

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told her nation that power blackouts are possible if Russia kicks the Baltic states from the joint power grid, as she announced a snap defense readiness exercise. 
“We must also be prepared for Russia might disconnect Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from their electricity grid”, she said in a televised address on Thursday evening, according to the government website. 
“It would be wise to be prepared for possible power outages – that includes public authorities, companies, and every individual”, she added, describing any disruptions as “temporary.”

Reuters: EU's von der Leyen delivers veiled warning to Italy's right wing 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has warned Italy of consequences should it veer away from democratic principles, issuing a barely veiled threat ahead of Sunday's election that a rightist bloc led by Giorgia Meloni is expected to win. 
The comments highlighted concern in some European capitals over the forthcoming election and suggested that relations between Brussels and Rome could get turbulent if Meloni and her partners secure victory. 
"My approach is that whatever democratic government is willing to work with us, we're working together," von der Leyen said at Princeton University in the United States on Thursday, responding to a question on whether there were any concerns with regard to the upcoming elections in Italy. 
"If things go in a difficult direction, I've spoken about Hungary and Poland, we have tools," she added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had downed four Iranian-made "kamikaze" unmanned aerial vehicles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain Tehran was harming Ukrainian sovereignty and its citizens.
	

		Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied.
	

		"Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran," said a statement on the foreign ministry's website.
	

		"In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv."
	

		The message was handed to the acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
	

		Military authorities in southern Ukraine said in a statement they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the port of Odesa.
	

		Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets.

Packed rally in Rome closes campaign for group forecast for landslide victory in polls on Sunday 
A conservative coalition forecast to glide into power in the Italian general election on Sunday has wrapped up its campaign to a packed square in central Rome, filled with supporters old and new, young and not so young, a smattering of anti-abortion activists and a descendant of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. 
The trio – led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, and including Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia – has experienced loud and robust support over the past months and remained relatively close-knit, in stark contrast to a campaign by its main rival, the centre-left Democratic party, that has been so lacklustre it managed to breathe new life into the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) in southern Italy.

New York (CNN)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi "had a direct and honest exchange on matters related to Taiwan" Friday, a US senior administration official said. 
The two diplomats met for nearly 90 minutes in New York, and their conversation primarily focused on Taiwan, the official said. 
The meeting was held amid a period of heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing and capped a busy week of diplomacy for Blinken at the UN General Assembly, where he met with a series of fellow diplomats from around the world and delivered remarks rebuking Russia's war in Ukraine at a UN Security Council meeting Thursday. 
It also came as Blinken grieves an immense personal loss -- his father, Donald Blinken, died Thursday evening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who has fled his home country of Russia this week delivered a scathing portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership in an interview with The Atlantic.
The man in question, a 38-year-old IT manager named Anton Shalaev, escaped from Russia this week to the Armenian capitol of Yerevan, which is one of the few places that will still allow Russians into the country.
When asked specifically about Putin's decision making during the war, Shalaev did not hesitate to slam the man who has led his homeland for more than two decades.
"A few old men and an army of zombies are leading us to hell," he said. "I say that because people around me in Russia behaved as if they had been bitten by a zombie, dragging my entire country into a dreadful war. All I saw was Russian loser husbands beating their wives, while the entire rotting house of the state system has turned my people into an army of the dead."
IN OTHER NEWS: Insiders fear Letitia James is set to inflict 'the biggest political damage' to Trump with GOP voters: report
To put a fine point on it, Shalaev added, "They are my enemies."
Shalaev also had some unkind words for Russian state media operations.
"Russian propaganda is a weapon, and the bastards working there are war criminals," he said. "The greatest guilt in this entire tragedy belongs to a small bunch of old men at the top: KGB officers."
Various media outlets have reported that many Russian men of military age have been trying to escape the country even since Putin called for a mobilization earlier this week to rescue his war in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One viral video on Twitter says it all about Iranian protesters’ defiance of the “morality police”: a young woman throws her veil into a bonfire and dances.


	The official death toll from popular unrest in Iran shot up to 17 on Thursday as Raisi vowed that Amini’s death would be investigated. She died in a Tehran hospital on September 16 after falling into a coma following her arrest by the “morality police” which enforces the wearing of the veil.


Women are compelled to cover their hair in public in Iran, which as a Shiite theocratic state follows a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The morality police – officially known as the Gasht-e Ershad; or “guidance patrol” – are responsible for enforcing this dress code.
But the law does not precisely define the “correct” way to wear the veil…]]></summary>

Vladimir Putin wants the restoration of the USSR, and people are only expendable material for him, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with famous French actor Alain Delon, shown on the air of the telethon. 
"He [Putin] understands perfectly well what he is doing. He knows how many people are dying. But for him this is an integral part of the plan," Zelensky said. 
At the same time, he believes that Putin has made the majority of the nation believe in what he is doing. 
"There are social networks. We understand how people react. Many have been brainwashed by the information war, dirty information. Many have gone crazy and rejoice when they kill us. It looks scary," Zelensky said.

WNU Editor: Unfortunately you have to click on the above video to go to Youtube to watch it. It is also in French, and there is no close-captions or translation. 
Fortunately I speak French, and while it is a repeat of what he has been saying for the past few weeks, Zelensky did mention 2 important points. One .... he was "shocked" at Israel’s lack of support, and (2) he remarked that Ukraine is losing 50 soldiers a day. 
This is a hard to believe number, especially when Zelensky himself admitted a few months ago that Ukraine was losing 60 - 100 soldiers a day .... President Zelensky Says 60-100 Ukrainian Soldiers Are Being Killed Per Day And Around 500 Wounded (June 1, 2022), and his top aid admitted losses between 100 - 200 soldiers a day .... Senior Aide to President Zelensky Says Ukraine Is Losing 100 - 200 Soldiers Each Day (June 10, 2-22). My sources in Ukraine tell me that the number runs in the hundreds per day.]]></summary>

The demonstrations followed the strongest warning from the authorities yet when the army told Iranians it would confront "the enemies" behind the unrest - a move that could signal the kind of crackdown that has crushed protests in the past.
Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as "Israel's soldiers", live state television coverage showed. They also shouted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel", common slogans the country's clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

"We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel, and our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald," 4th Estate Books said.
"This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work," it added, providing no other details.
Mantel won the Booker Prize for "Wolf Hall" (2009) and "Bring Up the Bodies" (2012) and had been tipped to win again in 2020 with "The Mirror & The Light," the third in the trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian rescuers battled Friday to refloat the last surviving pilot whales from a mass stranding that killed nearly 200 of the animals on a surf-battered beach in Tasmania.
Fewer than 10 of the shiny black mammals are still alive on Ocean Beach, in remote western Tasmania, state wildlife services said.
About 30 of the animals were released into the ocean on Thursday, but some had beached themselves again, said Brendon Clark, incident controller with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.
Under cool drizzle, marine wildlife experts began to wrap up a complex days-long rescue operation that started with a large pod of the animals, which are part of the dolphin family, stranding on the beach mid-week.
Three pilot whales had yet to be reached because of their remote location on the shore …]]></summary>

With Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing coalition tipped to win the country’s general election on Sunday, there are fears the same policies could be replicated at the national level. 
When Silvia* was taken off the pill on medical grounds, her doctor did not mention the possibility of using other contraceptive methods. When she ended up with an unwanted pregnancy months later, the same doctor chose to ignore her request for an abortion.

Amini, 22, died after her arrest by the Islamic republic's feared morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab headscarf in an "improper" way, and news of her death sparked widespread outrage.
The official death toll rose to at least 17 on Thursday, including five security personnel, but the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said its sources put the figure much higher.
"On the 7th day of #IranProtest, officials admit to at least 17 deaths w/ independent sources say 36," the CHRI said in a Twitter post.

Rupert Murdoch's eldest son -- who is also chief executive of Fox News parent Fox Corporation -- is suing Crikey over an opinion piece that linked his family's media empire to the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
The media scion's lawyers claimed their client was defamed over a dozen times in the article, which accused "the Murdochs and their slew of poisonous Fox News commentators" of being "unindicted co-conspirators" in the Capitol riot.

		The United States will have an option to buy up to an additional 400 million shots for the program after this year.
	

		The drugmaker said it would have sufficient supply to deliver the full billion doses under the U.S. commitment, but "we are seeing reduced demand in some low- and lower-middle-income countries due to barriers in administration and vaccine hesitancy."
	

		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.
	

		Pfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.
	

		The vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world's poorer countries.
	

		The program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.
	

		COVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.

Nuclear threat

		The integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.
	

		After the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use "all means" to protect its territory.
	

		Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included "strategic nuclear weapons". He predicted the voting regions "will integrate into Russia".
	

		For most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.
	

		The referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.
	

		Election officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.]]></summary>

The Bermuda Weather Service said the center of Fiona was forecast to pass more than 110 miles (180 kilometers) to the west of the British territory on Friday morning at around 5:00 am (0700 GMT), but with a storm of that strength and size, residents were taking no chances.
"This storm is going to be worse than the last one," Richard Hartley, owner of the Torwood Home store in the capital, Hamilton, told AFP as he and his wife covered the shop's cedar-lined windows with metal sheets.
