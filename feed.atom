BAKHMUT, Ukraine — For almost an hour, the stream of Ukrainian casualties in the eastern city of Bakhmut seemed unending: Ambulances, an armored personnel carrier and private vehicles all screamed to a halt, one after another, and disgorged the wounded in front of the city’s only military hospital. 
A soldier propped up by his comrades, his face a mass of mangled flesh, walked in the main gate. The dark green stretcher that awaited him was one of several still covered in blood.  By around noon on Friday, doctors had counted 50 wounded, many of them soldiers. 
The day before was even worse: 240 people had come through the hospital’s doors with everything from gunshot wounds to shrapnel injuries and concussions.  “They came in batches — 10, 10, five, 10,” said Parus, one of the Ukrainian medics at the hospital, as artillery screeched overhead and the chatter of machine-gun fire echoed off the surrounding buildings. “In the last couple of days the Russians have tried to advance more intensely.”

Update #1: Ukraine locked in trench warfare as Russian push for Bakhmut continues (NYPost)   
Update #2: Fighting in east Ukraine descends into trench warfare as Russia seeks breakthrough (The Guardian)   
WNU Editor: The battle for this Ukrainian city has now been ongoing for four months. What has changed recently is that Russian military forces are now getting involved in this battle, not the Russian mercenary Wagnar group that has waged much of the battle. Bottom line. It looks like this city will fall in the coming weeks.]]></summary>

VOA/Reuters: Russia Postpones Cairo Talks With US Under New START Nuclear Treaty 
Russia postponed nuclear weapons talks with the United States set to take place this week in Cairo, the U.S. State Department said on Monday, with neither side giving a reason for the postponement. 
Officials from the two countries were scheduled to meet in the Egyptian capital from Nov. 29 to Dec. 6 to discuss resuming inspections under the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty, which had been suspended in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
"The Russian side informed the United States that Russia has unilaterally postponed the meeting and stated that it would propose new dates," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

Belarus' foreign minister, Vladimir Makei — a longtime associate of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko — has died suddenly, aged 64. 
Belarusian authorities did not name the cause of death and Mr Makei was not known to suffer from any chronic illness.
 Prior to becoming foreign minister in 2012, Mr Makei served as Mr Lukashenko's chief of staff and, earlier, had worked as presidential adviser. 
Mr Lukashenko offered his condolences to Mr Makei's family, according to the presidential office.

Update #1: Belarus’ top diplomat, ally to president, dies at 64 (AP)  
Update #2: Belarus Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei dies at 64, officials say (CNN)   
WNU Editor: Some Western sources are speculating that he was assassinated on orders from the Kremlin .... Belarus minister who acted as secret go-between with the West 'WAS killed by Kremlin assassins' and 'shaken' dictator Lukashenko now fears for his life, reports claim (Daily Mail). 
I see no evidence to indicate that he was murdered. In Belarus he was always regarded as a close ally to Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, and a friend to Moscow.]]></summary>

A drugs 'super-cartel' that controlled a third of Europe's cocaine trade has been busted by police, with 49 arrests in countries including France and Dubai.

Spanish police said the leader of the organisation is a 'British national' who fled his former base on the Costa del Sol for Dubai, where the Kinahan organised crime group are based, after a kidnap attempt. He was later arrested in Dubai.

Ukrayinska Pravda: Mayor does not rule out evacuation of some of Kyivs population: "Toughest winter since World War II" 
Vitalii Klychko, the Mayor of Kyiv, is not ruling out that some residents of the Ukrainian capital may have to be evacuated if the electricity supply situation gets even worse and temperatures plummet.   
Source: Klychko, in an interview with German news agency Bild   
Details: Due to Russia's missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure facilities and the need to save electricity, the mayor said that "the worst winter since the Second World War" awaits the citizens, because the Ukrainian capital has not experienced such a "terrible winter" since then. 
Municipal services are being forced to turn off the electricity in certain areas every few hours, otherwise the power system will be overloaded, and a total blackout may follow.

CNN: Russia backtracks on threat to cut gas supply to Moldova via Ukraine  
Russian state gas producer Gazprom withdrew a threat to reduce gas supplies to Moldova from Monday but said it reserved the right to lower or halt flows in future if Moldova failed to make agreed payments. 
Last week, Gazprom accused Ukraine of withholding gas supplies which pass through the country on the way to Moldova — something Kyiv denied — and said it could start reducing those flows from Monday. 
In its latest statement, Gazprom said that Moldovan natural gas company Moldovagaz had paid for gas deliveries in November, adding that it had received payment for what it called gas destined for Moldovan customers but which remained in Ukraine.

   Washington Post: Pressure builds to step up weapons tracking in Ukraine 
Emboldened by their success in the midterm elections, House Republicans, who will hold a slim majority in the next Congress, have warned the Biden administration to expect far tougher oversight of the extensive military assistance it has provided Ukraine. 
The administration, anticipating such demands as the commitment of military aid under President Biden fast approaches $20 billion, has worked in recent weeks to publicize its efforts to track weapons shipments.

Reuters: Exclusive: U.S. weighs sending 100-mile strike weapon to Ukraine - sources 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted onto abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines as the West struggles to meet demand for more arms. 
U.S. and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing's proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America's Eastern European allies, industry sources said. 
GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in U.S. inventories.

Ukrainian soldiers are firing thousands of shells daily, forcing the U.S. to replace gun barrels across the border in Poland. | TYLER HICKS / THE NEW YORK TIMES 
DNYUZ/New York Times: Artillery is breaking in Ukraine. It’s becoming a problem for the Pentagon. 
WASHINGTON — Ukrainian troops fire thousands of explosive shells at Russian targets every day, using high-tech cannons supplied by the United States and its allies. But those weapons are burning out after months of overuse, or being damaged or destroyed in combat, and dozens have been taken off the battlefield for repairs, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. 
A third of the roughly 350 Western-made howitzers donated to Kyiv are out of action at any given time, according to U.S. defense officials and others familiar with Ukraine’s defense needs. 
 Swapping out a howitzer’s barrel, which can be 20 feet long and weigh thousands of pounds, is beyond the capability of soldiers in the field and has become a priority for the Pentagon’s European Command, which has set up a repair facility in Poland.

WNU Editor: The New York Times admits that the facilities that can repair these howitzers are not available in Ukraine. That they must be repaired outside in places like Poland. But to ship these weapons the trains must be used .... hence Russia's targeting of the electrical grid and crippling Ukraine's train network.
This war is primarily being conducted by artillery. If Ukraine cannot solve this equipment failure, this war of attrition will eventually end very badly for Ukraine.

* Chevron received an expanded U.S. license allowing it to resume production in Venezuela and to import the South American country’s crude into the U.S. 
* The decision allows Chevron to revive existing oil projects in the U.S.-sanctioned country and bring new oil supplies to refiners in the U.S. 
* The deal restricts cash payments to Venezuela, however, which could reduce the amount of oil available to Chevron. 
 Chevron on Saturday received an expanded U.S. license allowing the second-largest U.S. oil company to resume production in Venezuela and to import the South American country’s crude into the United States. 
The decision allows Chevron to revive existing oil projects in the U.S.-sanctioned country and bring new oil supplies to refiners in the United States. However, it restricts cash payments to Venezuela, which could reduce the amount of oil available to Chevron. 
License terms are designed to prevent Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA from receiving proceeds from Chevron’s Venezuelan petroleum sales, U.S. officials said. The license lasts for six months and will be automatically renewed monthly thereafter, according to the U.S. Treasury.

CGTN: China's likely inclusion in Astana Format will spur Syria's reconstruction process 
A new momentum is building for China to play a more productive role in the Syrian reconciliation process and the reconstruction of the war-torn country through Beijing's participation in the Astana Format peace dialogue.  
The Astana Format was initiated in 2017 by Russia, Turkey and Iran in a bid to restore peace and stability in Syria, ravaged by a civil war between President Bashar al-Assad's government and opposition-led protesters. Under the Astana Format, Russia, Turkey and Iran are the three key guarantors of the peace settlement between the Syrian government and opposition factions.

EU officials attack Joe Biden over sky-high gas prices, weapons sales and trade as Vladimir Putin’s war threatens to destroy Western unity. 
Nine months after invading Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is beginning to fracture the West.  
Top European officials are furious with Joe Biden’s administration and now accuse the Americans of making a fortune from the war, while EU countries suffer.  
“The fact is, if you look at it soberly, the country that is most profiting from this war is the U.S. because they are selling more gas and at higher prices, and because they are selling more weapons,” one senior official told POLITICO.

   VOA/AFP: China Willing to Work with North Korea for 'World Peace,' State Media Says 
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Chinese President Xi Jinping told North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that Beijing was willing to work with Pyongyang for world peace, North Korean state media said Saturday. 
The message from Xi came days after North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in one of its most powerful tests yet, declaring it would meet perceived U.S. nuclear threats with nukes of its own. 
North Korea has conducted a record-breaking blitz of missile launches in recent weeks, and fears have grown that it is building up to a seventh nuclear test, its first since 2017.

WNU Editor: No official announcement from Beijing that President Xi communicated with Kim Jong Un. But the Chinese ambassador to the UN says China supports detente on the Korean peninsula .... China supports using detente to address Korean Peninsula issues (China Daily).

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says his country's ultimate goal is to possess the world's most powerful nuclear force at the launch of his country's largest ballistic missile.

He said building the nuclear force was for reliably protecting the dignity and sovereignty of the state and its people.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.
"We do not have any information on her exact current location or her final destination," they added.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.

"While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.
