A Christian leader has blasted the Biden administration for “creating an atmosphere of lawlessness” by ignoring attacks on churches and houses of worship nationwide, which have nearly tripled over the last four years, according to a startling new report. 
These assaults ranged from deadly to defacing, covered every region of the country and denominational background, and often sprang from pro-abortion domestic terrorism or other forms of left-wing enmity against biblical morality. 
Offenders committed at least 420 acts of hostility against 397 separate churches in the United States between January 2018 and September 2022. These cases include everything from arson and gun-related violence to vandalism and bomb threats, the copiously documented, 84-page report specifies.

WNU Editor: The White House has responded to some church attacks .... White House condemns church arson, vandalism as violence soars following Dobbs decision (FOX News). But this is an exception and not the rule. Most attacks Like this one are ignored by the press and politicians .... Church Attacks Continue (Dr. James Dobson). 
The fire-bombing of the Historic St. John’s Church near the White House in June 2020 is what sticks out for me (link here).

Henry Kissinger, The Spectator: How to avoid another world war 
The first world war was a kind of cultural suicide that destroyed Europe’s eminence. Europe’s leaders sleepwalked – in the phrase of historian Christopher Clark – into a conflict which none of them would have entered had they foreseen the world at war’s end in 1918. In the previous decades, they had expressed their rivalries by creating two sets of alliances whose strategies had become linked by their respective schedules for mobilisation. As a result, in 1914, the murder of the Austrian Crown Prince in Sarajevo, Bosnia by a Serb nationalist was allowed to escalate into a general war that began when Germany executed its all-purpose plan to defeat France by attacking neutral Belgium at the other end of Europe.

Slovakia's parliament voted to topple the country's self-proclaimed anti-corruption, reformist government yesterday after two-and-a-half years in office. 
What happens next and how did it come to this?   Slovakia's government, which was lead by the OLANO party (ORDINARY PEOPLE and Independent Personalities) and Prime Minister Eduard Heger, was brought down yesterday when 78 of the 120 MPs present in parliament backed a motion of no confidence in the government. 
The result came despite several rounds of protracted negotiations that sought to avert a negative outcome for the government. Heger's cabinet had been hoping to survive the vote right up until the end. Finance Minister Igor Matovic even offered to resign if the opposition withdrew its no-confidence motion.
MPs met in the chamber of the National Council at 5 p.m. (CET) ready to cast their votes, but discussions dragged on for another 90 minutes.

Washington Free Beacon: Peace Between Jordan and Israel Unraveling, Report Says 
Israel’s decades-long peace with Jordan is unraveling, a development that threatens to upset a fragile regional stability that is being challenged by countries like Iran, Russia, and China, a think tank report warns.
"Since 2020, if not before then, the Jordanian peace has turned decidedly cold," according to Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism finance analyst at the Treasury Department who now works at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. While the relationship has been breaking down behind the scenes for some time, Jordan also began to publicly war with Israel in recent years, by refusing to sign the Abraham Accords peace agreements, attacking incoming prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and threatening to fully abrogate the peace deal it signed with Israel in 1994.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Kyiv   
Daily Mail: Rishi Sunak 'orders Goldman Sachs-style audit of how UK supplies are used in Ukraine war' amid fears he will be overly-cautious during crucial phase of fight against Putin's Russia 
* Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has reportedly ordered an audit into the Ukraine war 
* It will review the costs and benefits of Britain arming Ukraine in the invasion  
* The UK has been one of the biggest military suppliers to the country this year  
Rishi Sunak has reportedly asked for a 'Goldman Sachs-style' audit of progress in the war in Ukraine, sparking fears he is moving towards a more cautious approach to Vladimir Putin's invasion.  
Senior government figures are said be concerned the Prime Minister could change the UK's stance on the conflict as it enters a crucial phase.   
A source in Whitehall compared the move to a 'Goldman Sachs dashboard' review of the invasion and Britain's supply lines to Ukraine.    
Read more ....   
Update: Rishi Sunak orders audit of Ukraine war progress, source says (BBC)   
WNU Editor: This is not a real audit. This is a normal British government mandated report and review on the actual military realities in the Russia - Ukraine war. I do not expect this report will ever be made public. I also expect zero change in policy when this report is finalized. 
But what is interesting about this story is how the British media has responded to this leak.  A leak (according to the BBC) from Whitehall. You would think that a thorough examination by the government on the progress of the war would be overwhelmingly supported by the media. Instead, it seems the British media are not only critical that this report is being done (parroting what the Whitehall leaker has said), but they are also deeply concerned that this report may result in a lessening of support for Ukraine.
When did Whitehall (i.e. the bureaucracy) decide what UK policy was to be? It looks like the UK has its own "deep state".]]></summary>

LIMA, Peru — The political crisis roiling Peru deepened Saturday, as President Dina Boluarte’s new government edged toward collapse and protesters across the country refused to back down despite the military enforcing a state of emergency. 
A total of 20 demonstrators are reported to have been killed in clashes with security forces, including eight allegedly shot Thursday by soldiers using live ammunition in the southern mountain region of Ayacucho. 
Protesters have stormed several regional airports, looted businesses and blocked roads, primarily in the impoverished mountain regions of the Andean nation. 
Last year, those areas voted heavily for Pedro Castillo, a rural schoolteacher and former wildcat-strike leader, who was impeached as president last week after he attempted to dissolve Congress and restructure the judiciary.

RT: Putin holds top brass meeting on Ukraine  
The Russian president heard proposals on immediate and medium-term plans for the conflict  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sat down with the country’s top military commanders to discuss the Ukraine conflict, the Kremlin revealed on Saturday. The agenda revolved around Moscow’s actions in the short and medium term.
According to the Kremlin’s readout of the meeting, “throughout Friday, the president worked at the joint headquarters of the military branches involved in the special military operation.” It did not provide details on where the meeting took place.

Update #1: Putin Meets Top Military Brass to Discuss Ukraine Strategy: Kremlin (Moscow Times)  
Update #2: Putin sounds out military commanders on Ukraine (CNBC/Reuters) 
WNU Editor: The New York Times is correct. This is a rare visit by Putin to the Ukraine War Room .... Putin Makes Rare Visit to Ukraine War Headquarters (DNYUZ/New York Times). 
What this meeting signals to me is that the Generals have developed a plan, and they are briefing President Putin on what they want to do. Putin himself said that he had come to listen to his commanders’ proposals about the Russian military’s “short- and medium-term movements.” 
One more point. And I believe it is an important one. 
At the conclusion of this meeting I did not get the impression that Russia is preparing a large-scale ground offensive operation anytime soon.]]></summary>

The video, which was recorded in English, is meant to be an “appeal for peace,” Ukraine’s presidential office said in a written statement to CNN on Saturday. 
“Qatar supported the President’s initiative, but FIFA blocked the initiative and will not allow the video address of the president to be shown before the final game,” the statement said.

Putin is 'planning for a long war' and the West must continue to send arms to Ukraine until Russia 'cannot win on the battlefield', a NATO chief has said.

Update: Putin 'planning for a long war' in Ukraine: NATO chief (France 24)   
WNU Editor: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is saying what this blog has been saying since September. The Kremlin made the decision (probably in August when the decision to call-up reserves was made) that this war is going to last a few years.
The question that should be asked is on NATO's commitment to send weapons and monies in the billions of dollars to Ukraine every month that may last for 2, 3 or more years.
Is the public willing to accept this commitment and sacrifice (i.e. high energy prices/inflation/shortages/etc.), and will the political still be there in 2024 or beyond? You tell me.]]></summary>

Former President Pedro Castillo is in jail. That’s nothing new in Peruvian politics.
 Peru’s former president Pedro Castillo is in prison, at least 20 people are dead, hundreds of tourists are stranded, and the nation is in crisis after Castillo was ousted from his position on December 7. Dina Boluarte, the South American nation’s sixth president in seven years, is now struggling to maintain control in a political environment where chaos and corruption are the norm.
Castillo’s leadership came to an end after he attempted to dissolve Congress earlier this month prior to a planned impeachment vote following corruption charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC/Reuters: New Covid model predicts over 1 million deaths in China through 2023 
* China’s national health authority has not reported any official Covid deaths since the lifting of Covid restrictions. The last official deaths were reported on Dec. 3. Total pandemic fatalities stand at 5,235. 
* Other experts expect some 60% of China’s population will eventually be infected, with a peak expected in January, hitting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, the hardest. 
* Key concerns include China’s large pool of susceptible individuals, the use of less effective vaccines and low vaccine coverage among those 80 and older, who are at greatest risk of severe disease. 
China’s abrupt lifting of stringent Covid-19 restrictions could result in an explosion of cases and over a million deaths through 2023, according to new projections from the U.S.-based Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
According to the group’s projections, cases in China would peak around April 1, when deaths would reach 322,000. About a third of China’s population will have been infected by then, IHME Director Christopher Murray said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The DOE announced Friday it will purchase 3 million barrels of oil to replenish the supply it depleted from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to lower gas prices   
Daily Mail: Biden buys 3 million barrels of oil to stock up the emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve after withdrawing 180 million to try and bring down gas prices 
* The department said it will purchase the oil for less than the $96 per barrel it sold its supply for 
* Three million barrels, only 15 percent of daily U.S. demand, is a drop in the bucket of the 180 million DOE has depleted the reserve of since March 
* At the same time the department will tap 1.8 million barrels from the reserve in an emergency exchange after a shutdown of the Keystone pipeline 
The Department of Energy (DOE) announced Friday it will purchase 3 million barrels of oil to replenish the supply it depleted from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to lower gas prices.  
The department said it will purchase the oil for less than the $96 per barrel it sold its supply for. 
Three million barrels, only 15 percent of daily U.S. demand, is a drop in the bucket of the 180 million DOE has depleted the reserve of since March.  
The deal is part of a fixed-price plan that allows refiners to sell oil to the SPR at a stable rate and avoid selling at the volatile oil market's rate on any given day.

   Antiwar.com: Serbia Seeks Troop Deployment in Kosovo  
Belgrade formally asked NATO if its troops could return to northern Kosovo, a request unlikely to be granted  
Serbia has formally asked NATO if it can deploy up to 1,000 troops into northern Kosovo, where Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic says ethnic Serbs are being “terrorized” by the Kosovo government based in Pristina. 
Vucic made the request to the commander of NATO forces in Kosovo, known as KFOR. Serbian officials say that a UN resolution that formally ended the Kosovo war allows for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian troops into Kosovo, but Vucic still doesn’t expect the request to be granted. 
“The request says that a certain number of (Serbian troops), from one hundred to up to 1,000, return to Kosovo,” he said.

WNU Editor: The UN resolution that formally ended the Kosovo war allows for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian troops into Kosovo. But it looks like NATO is going to break this agreement and not permit this deployment.If agreements are not going to be honored, the usual outcome is conflict and in the case of the Balkans, war.
 Update: This is not going to happen .... Kosovo submits formal request to join the EU, Serbia angry (AP).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington Post: 'Massive' wave of missiles strike Ukraine; civilian and infrastructure targets hit 
A wave of explosions and missile strikes was reported across Ukraine Friday — from the capital, Kyiv, to Kharkiv and Sumy in the northeast and Poltava in central Ukraine. 
Critical infrastructure across seven cities took another wave of hits.    Reporters with The Washington Post heard blasts in Kyiv and the central city of Dnipro. Kyiv officials said the city had experienced “one of the biggest missile attacks” since the beginning of the war. 
A Ukraine air force spokesman said that Russia had launched more than 60 missiles at the country in the latest barrage.  At least three people were killed and 13 injured when a residential building was hit in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, local officials said. 
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy operator, said emergency shutdowns were taking place in all regions of Ukraine as a result of the strikes.

Already watching over Ukraine, Leidos’ ARTEMIS is part of the service’s growing fleet of contractor-owned intelligence aircraft.

Debt as a share of gross domestic product plunged by the most in seven decades in 2021, but policymakers still face challenges because borrowing remains above pre-Covid-19 levels, the International Monetary Fund said. 
While total public and private debt hit a record $235 trillion last year, it plummeted when expressed as a percentage of economic output, which rebounded last year after the steep Covid-19 recession of 2020, the fund said Monday in a blog accompanying the latest update of its Global Debt Database. 
Total debt fell to 247% of global gross domestic product last year, IMF data showed. That’s 10 percentage points less than in 2020, but is still the second-highest reading in history.

WNU Editor: These numbers are already out of date. Interest rates are rising, and I would say that in the past 6 months individuals/businesses/and governments are taking in even more debt.

Reuters: Thousands protest in Turkey over Istanbul mayor's conviction 
ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Thousands of people rallied in Turkey on Thursday to oppose the conviction and political ban of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, chanting slogans criticising President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party before elections next year.
A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced Imamoglu, a popular rival to Erdogan, to two years and seven months in prison, which like the ban must be confirmed by an appeals court.
The verdict drew wide criticism at home and abroad as an abuse of democracy. 
Late on Thursday, media reports said the prosecutor in the case had launched a legal challenge to the verdict, seeking a longer jail sentence for Imamoglu. No further details were immediately available.

Some of the indigenous protesters, who had come from the Peruvian Amazon jungle, were carrying bows and arrows, which police said they confiscated.
They are among the thousands of protesters demanding not only Castillo's release but also the resignation of his successor Dina Boluarte, the dissolution of Congress and new elections.
"I came to take part in a protest march. My country is very ill ... we want to bring forward elections and close Congress, which does not represent us," Sanchez, 57, told AFP.

"Spinning together a counternarrative for tens of millions of viewers, Russian propagandists plucked clips from American cable news, right-wing social media and Chinese officials.

Now Eleusis -- known to Greeks as Elefsina -- aims to resurrect its flagging fortunes by becoming European capital of culture next year.
Roman emperors including Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus -- of "Gladiator" fame -- were among the glitterati of antiquity who came to be initiated into its secret death-defying cult based around Persephone, the queen of the netherworld.
But Eleusis long ago lost its glamour.
Its grim factories, steelmills, refineries and ship and breaker yards drew thousands fleeing the poverty of rural Greece over the last century.

Up to 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are holding a one-day stoppage from 0800 to 2000 GMT after rejecting a government pay offer.
Ameera, a senior nurse in London, told AFP that "we have not chosen industrial action lightly". The strike is the first in the Royal College of Nursing union's 106-year history.
"We're tired. We're fed up," added the nurse, who asked that her last name not be reported. "We need a pay rise now to make a living."
The UK is currently grappling with a cost-of-living crisis as spiraling inflation outstrips wage growth.

Harry, 38, and his wife Meghan, 41, have lifted the lid on their experiences in the institution in the new series, risking a further rift with his family.
As young boys, the brothers provided the enduring image from their mother Princess Diana's funeral, walking behind her coffin.
But they are reportedly now no longer on speaking terms since Harry and Meghan -- also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- left for North America, settling in California.
In the final three episodes of "Harry & Meghan", Harry recalled a family summit in January 2020 over their plans to move abroad.

(Reuters) -Tesla boss Elon Musk disclosed another $3.6 billion in stock sales on Wednesday, taking his total near $40 billion this year and frustrating investors as the company's shares wallow at two-year lows.
A U.S securities filing showed he unloaded 22 million shares in the world's most valuable carmaker over three days from Monday to Wednesday.
The sale is the second big chunk of stock he has cashed out since his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October. It isn't clear if the sales are related to the Twitter acquisition, but they are annoying investors who are upset by a perception he is diverting his focus and resources to Twitter ahead of Tesla.

The apparent leak, which was visible in NASA's live video feed and appeared as a torrent of snowflake-like particles spraying from the rear section of the Soyuz MS-22 capsule, seemed to be liquid escaping from the spacecraft, possibly coolant, a NASA commentator said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the FBI arrested Alexey Brayman, a resident of Merrimack, New Hampshire who was using his Etsy craft store as a front to run a weapons-smuggling ring to the Kremlin.
Speaking to CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) emphasized that this operation is a sign of how dire a toll the global sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine is taking on their ability to procure weapons for their military.
"So, congressman, I do want to ask you about ... this Russian smuggling, Russian weapons smuggling ring here in the United States," said Burnett. "What does this tell you about Putin? I mean, why he would even be doing this, that he's going to such lengths to do something like this?"
"First, I would say that this is not unusual," said Himes. "For decades — for generations — we've been facing Chinese, Russian, other efforts to get our equipment. Your correspondent is exactly right that this is a sign of desperation, this is stuff that could ordinarily be bought on the open market by the Russian government. But it cannot be bought by the Russian government now that, of course, sanctions and prohibitions are in place."

Additionally, said Himes, "the FBI is exactly right. Obviously a guy with a trunk full of rounds, that's a guy who can assist in the creation of an awful lot of mayhem."
"But at the end of the day, there is no way in the world that you can restock, rearm, and refurbish the Russian military by guys driving cars across the border of Estonia," added Himes. "So, we need to continue to take this stuff really, really seriously. But it is a sign of desperation."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -A former Twitter Inc manager convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia by sharing user data several years ago and potentially exposing users to persecution was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison on Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors said.
Ahmad Abouammo had been found guilty by a jury in August following a trial in federal court in San Francisco.
Prosecutors had sought a prison term of just over seven years, saying they wanted a "sentence strong enough to deter others in the technology and social media industry from selling out the data of vulnerable users." Abouammo faced a maximum penalty of decades in prison.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Many of the hundreds of migrants who crossed the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez into El Paso this week were part of a group kidnapped in Mexico as they made their way to the United States, according to nine migrants interviewed by Reuters.
Testimony from the nine migrants suggests there were multiple kidnappings across several days in the northern state of Durango, with people taken to at least two main locations and held against their will while ransoms were demanded.
The kidnappings are a stark reminder of the dangers faced by migrants as they travel across Mexico, crisscrossing areas rife with drug violence and weak rule of law.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru's defense minister announced a nationwide state of emergency on Wednesday, which will take effect in the next few hours and allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public safety after a week of fiery protests and road blockades.
The protests were sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo on Dec. 7 in an impeachment vote. Castillo, a leftist elected in 2021, was arrested after illegally trying to dissolve the Andean nation's Congress, the latest in a series of political crises the world's second-largest copper producer has faced in recent years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday Russian athletes should face "complete isolation" and not be welcomed back at the 2024 Olympic Games.
Zelensky told International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach that he strongly opposed moves by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Paris Games provided they do not participate under their countries' colors or flags.
US officials said Monday there was "unanimous interest" among delegates to an IOC summit to come up with a pathway that would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to competition.
Russia and Belarus have been isolated from international sport ever since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.
However, Zelensky blasted the American moves, claiming that "since February, 184 Ukrainian athletes have died as a result of Russia's actions".
Zelensky told Bach he was disappointed with the presence of the president of the Russian Olympic Committee at the IOC summit on November 9
"One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored," he said in a statement.
Zelensky added that the only response is "the complete isolation of the terrorist state on the international stage. In particular, this applies to international sports events."
At this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country's Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.
However many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.

Eight countries voted against and 16 abstained. A simple majority was needed to adopt the move, which had been proposed by the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine has announced that another American has been freed as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that a retired U.S. Air Force veteran Suedi Murekezi was captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine earlier this year, his family said. He has now been freed. 
"Another exchange of prisoners," tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. "We continue to return ours. 64 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, are going home. It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people - Murekez Suedi. The bodies of the 4 dead were also returned."
His brother said that Murekezi said in a call that he was being held in the Donetsk People’s Republic with two other American nationals. 
The Post report explained that a prisoner swap in September included two U.S. veterans. The latest swap adds up to 1,456 prisoners that have been released by Russia since the start of their invasion. 
"One prisoner of war told The Post he was beaten so badly that his ribs were broken and his kidneys were badly injured," the piece said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgraced crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried is being held in a jail in the Bahamas that's known for its poor conditions -- so poor that a warden described it as “not fit for humanity," the New York Post reports. 
Bankman-Fried is being held in Fox Hill Prison after failing to get bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. The prison is the only correctional facility in the region. As the Post points out, the prison was the focus of a report last year by the US Department of State which looked into possible human rights violations, including violence and abuse by staff.
“Inmates removed human waste by bucket,” the government report noted. 
“Some inmates developed bedsores from lying on bare ground,” the report said, adding that conditions included “overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care.”
“Sanitation was a general problem, and cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” the report noted. 
Bankman-Fried faces criminal charges in the United States, including securities fraud, campaign finance violations and money laundering, over the collapse of his FTX crypto exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A judge in Peru on Wednesday postponed by 24 hours a hearing to decide whether ex-president Pedro Castillo will be released from detention on charges of rebellion and conspiracy.
Castillo's arrest last week after he tried to dissolve parliament and rule by decree has sparked days of nationwide protests in which seven people have been killed.
Last week, a judge ordered Castillo to be held for seven days, and he was meant to be released on Wednesday.
However, prosecutors filed a request late Tuesday to hold him in pre-trial detention for 18 months.
Judge Juan Checkley on Wednesday postponed a hearing on the new request until Thursday after defense attorneys argued they had not received all documents from the public prosecutor.
He also ordered Castillo to remain in detention for another 48 hours.
Castillo, a leftist former school teacher, was in power for only 17 months in the South American nation that is prone to political instability and is now on its sixth president in six years.
His short period in office was marked by a power struggle with the opposition-dominated Congress, and six investigations into him and his family, mainly for corruption.
He was facing his third impeachment bid when, last Wednesday, he announced he was dissolving Congress and would rule by decree.
But lawmakers went ahead and voted to sack him and he was quickly arrested while trying to flee to the Mexican embassy and seek asylum.
Castillo's vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in as his successor, but has failed to calm tensions that have led to violent clashes between police and protestors in several parts of the country.

The Paris offices of US consulting giant McKinsey were also searched on Tuesday, the National Financial Prosecutors' Office said, confirming a report in Le Parisien newspaper.
The use of consultants by Macron's governments came under the spotlight in March after a French Senate inquiry concluded that public spending on them had more than doubled from 2018 to 2021, during Macron's first term.
"It's normal for the judiciary to investigate freely and independently to shed all the light on this subject," a Renaissance spokesman, Loic Signor, told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A BBC commentator lashed out at the U.S., calling it an “extraordinarily racist country” ahead of it co-hosting the 2026 World Cup, HuffPost reports. 
Former soccer player-turned-commentator Gary Lineker has been covering the World Cup in Qatar and spoke to the  “News Agents” podcast and discussed why Qatar was allowed to host the World Cup. 
“We pointed facts out at the beginning of the tournament; those facts remain. So, lots of people were killed doing the stadiums. Yes, the stadiums are extraordinary, but at a great price. Homophobia is an issue here, women’s rights are a little bit of an issue here," he said. 
“For me, it was always really more about the corruption side of it because, as I said previously, I think pretty much every country, including our own, has got issues,” he continued. “And we’re off to America in four years’ time, with Canada and Mexico, but obviously America’s an extraordinarily racist country.”

The writer, a 64-year-old French-Swiss citizen now living in the western Swiss city of Lausanne, was sentenced in April by the regional attorney general to three months behind bars for "defamation, discrimination and incitement to hatred."
That ruling came after Alain Soral -- a pen name for the controversial writer whose real name is Alain Bonnet -- appeared in an online video attacking Swiss journalist Cathy Macherel of the Tribune de Geneve newspaper, who had written an article about him in 2021.
Macherel had filed a complaint over the video, where Soral described her as a "fat lesbian activist …]]></summary>

The executions in the past week of Mohsen Shekari and Majidreza Rahnavard, both 23 and the first people put to death over the protests, sparked an outcry, especially as Rahnavard was hanged from a crane in public rather than in prison.
But campaigners warn that more executions will inevitably follow without tougher international action, with a dozen more people already sentenced to death over the protests and a similar number charged with crimes that could see them hanged.
"Unless the political cost of the executions is increased significantly, we will be facing mass executions," said Mahmood Amiry…]]></summary>

At its ultra-modern flagship building in Billund, a visit to the offices where the design work is done is out of the question -- the company is fiercely protective of its trade secrets.
But Tacchi, a 34-year-old Frenchman, lifts the veil a smidgen on the creative process, standing at a display featuring some of the brand's colourful toy kits.
"I always start with a little sketch on paper about what I have in mind", says Tacchi, who designs for the Lego Technic series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong police's decision to ban a Tiananmen vigil last year was unlawful, a court ruled on Wednesday, as it overturned the conviction of jailed democracy activist Chow Hang-tung.
The ruling is a rare rebuke of authorities in a city where the public commemoration of Beijing's deadly 1989 crackdown has been virtually wiped out in recent years.
Chow, a 37-year-old lawyer and one of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy activists, led a now-disbanded group that used to organize the city's annual candlelight vigils to mourn those killed in Tiananmen Square when China sent troops to crush democracy protests.
Police have banned the last three vigils citing the coronavirus and security fears and the courts have already jailed multiple activists who defied those bans, including Chow.
