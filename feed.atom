One of the German diplomats who snickered when then-President Donald Trump said Germany would “become totally dependent on Russian energy” didn’t respond to a question on whether his views have changed as rising energy costs amidst the war in Ukraine seem to prove Trump right. 
Trump made the remarks during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Sept. 2018. Trump said during the same speech: “Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation.”   
Read more ....   
WNU editor: The whole German delegation was launging at Trump, but it was Heiko Maas, was then serving as the country’s foreign minister under then-prime minister Angela Merkel, who led the laughter. He later told reporters that Trump’s claim regarding the pipeline “does not correspond to reality,” saying that “Germany is not dependent on Russia, especially not on energy issues.”
So where is Heiko Maas right now? 
Not surprising. He is still in the government as a member of the Bundestag.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Energy bills will be frozen at £2,500 for TWO YEARS: Liz Truss unveils 'extraordinary' £150bn plan to counter Putin and subsidise household costs while businesses get 'equivalent' support for six months - as she backs fracking and using North Sea reserves 
* Liz Truss is set to ease the pain of energy bills for households by freezing them at a typical level of £2,500 
* New PM insisted that failing to take action on the scale of the Covid response would damage the economy 
* But Ms Truss also warned that major changes are needed to shore up Britain's long-term energy supplies 
Liz Truss rolled the dice on her premiership today unveiling a £150billion plan to freeze energy bills for two years and counter Vladimir Putin's blackmail. 
Admitting her action is 'extraordinary', the PM told MPs the government is committed to keeping costs for households at £2,500 a year until October 2024 - less than half the level many feared they would hit. 
Including a £400 handout most people should see little change from existing bills this year.

WNU Editor: This is not going to solve the UK's energy crisis. And who wants to invest or be in the energy business if you are forced to sell your product below your costs? My guess is that the UK government is going to bail out the utilities to keep this "House of Cards" from collapsing. And as for the future in UK ....  expect more inflation and the energy crisis continuing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Biden national security advisor Jake Sullivan warns China invading Taiwan is still a 'distinct threat' - as yet ANOTHER delegation of US lawmakers visits Taipei 
* White House national security advisor told Bloomberg TV that there were no current plans for President Biden and President Xi to meet at the G20 summit 
* Sullivan accused China of being inconsistent in its position on Taiwan 
* 'The American position has remained steadfast and consistent,' he said 
* Meanwhile a bipartisan delegation of members of the House of Representatives is arrived in Taiwan Wednesday and is leaving on Friday 
* That group is being led by Florida Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy 
The possibility of China invading Taiwan continues to be a 'distinct threat' to the global order, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday. 
His warning comes just a day after a top Beijing official issued a blunt warning discouraging 'stubborn' calls for the island's independence. 
 Sullivan told Bloomberg TV that the United States would 'push back' against any efforts to topple the existing world order while also reaffirming the nation's longstanding support for the One China Policy.

Times of Israel: Nuclear deal with Iran off the table for time being, US has indicated to Israel  
Message conveyed to PM Lapid in recent conversations with Biden and other US officials; Iranian demands to halt IAEA probes appear to have derailed talks 
A new nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is off the table and will not be signed in the foreseeable future, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister site Zman Yisrael has learned. 
This is the message that was conveyed to Prime Minister Yair Lapid in his recent conversations with US President Joe Biden and other administration officials. 
This emerging outcome of the nuclear negotiations, which would have major international implications, is likely to be touted by Lapid in the coming election campaign, particularly against opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly attacked the premier on the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022–09–08. Nederlands Dagblad is a national news outlet with Christian roots in the Netherlands, writing about Protestant and Catholic news. But in the Netherlands, there is also an evangelical group of Christians – about 200,000 of them – with no media outlet focussing on this group. ND saw an opportunity, and jumped right in: in the fall of 2021 it started to create content about and for Dutch evangelicals.

Bloomberg: F-35 Deliveries Halted Over a Chinese Alloy, Pentagon Says 
(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon has halted deliveries of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 after finding an alloy used in magnets for pumps on the fighter jet was made in China. 
The F-35 program office “temporarily paused the acceptance of new F-35 aircraft to ensure the F-35 program’s compliance” with defense regulations “pertaining to specialty metals,” Defense Department spokesman Russell Goemaere said in an email. 
He said the pause won’t interfere with operations of F-35s already delivered to the US military and partners abroad because “the magnet does not transmit information or harm the integrity of the aircraft and there are no performance, quality, safety or security risks associated with this issue.”

As understood by the absolute majority of military experts and analysts today, the large-scale war unleashed by the Russian Federation against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, has long been beyond the concept of a local conflict of medium intensity. This applies to the spatial indicators, the number of forces involved, and the convincing list of weaponry and other high-tech equipment inherent in this military confrontation.

The Ukrainian 'counteroffensive' in the southern Kherson region has made little progress and binds a lot of Ukrainian resources and available units.

WNU Editor: I am skeptical of the above report. The U.S. is the country that is supplying the most weapons, actionable intelligence, and funds to Ukraine. Not the U.K. or anyone else. I am sure the U.S. has a lot of strings to this aid, and taking their advice and recommendations is one of them. 
So is the Pentagon against this second counter-offensive? Maybe. But in this case my gut is telling me that it is the US State Department and the White House that is pushing this new front, and they outrank the Pentagon.]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is down for the year, but it’s also important to compare its price action with other assets.  Oil prices are currently down 23.5% since July, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is down 36.4% in 30 days and Moderna (MRNA), a pharmaceutical and biotech company, is down 30.4 % over the same period.

Risky assets have come under selling pressure in recent days as investors fear the Federal Reserve will continue its aggressive tightening policy.

In recent Gazette coverage of the annual Town/Robe Breakfast, the Chancellor was quoted, comparing UMass Amherst to other college towns, in terms of the number of students each school provides housing for, for show that UMass has a large percentage of students on campus, and therefore they are not responsible for the imbalances this causes in Amherst, with outside investors buying several houses, which then prevents families from moving here.
Amherst has a population of 40,000, more than half of whom are students.  That means we’re a city of 20,000 year-round residents.
And half of the homes in Amherst are rentals, most of which are student rentals, many of which are overcrowded, overpriced and poorly maintained.  I recently received another call from a telemarketer, hoping to persuade me to sell my house to a certain investment company.
Chancellor compared Amherst to the college towns of Bloomington, Indiana (population 84,691), College Station, Texas (population 115,802) and St Paul/Minneapolis (population 730,413).
    This is clearly a false equivalence.  We are the second smallest city in the nation to house a flagship state university.  That’s great for the city in many ways, but there are other repercussions that UMass shouldn’t sweep under the rug.
I urge the leaders of city and university government to have the robust and urgent conversations needed to resolve the issue fairly and effectively.  It’s one of those “if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem” thing.

A medieval-inspired luxury home in New York’s Tony Hamptons – one that looks like it’s straight out of the HBO animated series”Dragon House— caught the attention of deep-pocketed show fans wanting to make it their own, according to Jam Press.
The outlet notes that they believe they have made offers to buy it, but the owner won’t budge.
That owner is Sir Ivan Wilzig – the music producer, reality TV star, banking heir and philanthropist – who moved into “the Castle” in 1997. (Wilzig and his brother, Alan, created the broadcast after buying 5 acres of land from Water Mill for less than $1 million in 1995.)
Ana Prado, a luxury real estate agent, told Jam Press that the 13,000 square foot property is not officiall…]]></summary>

Bill Clinton promised to close the base in 1996. But plans for more construction and a heightened focus on the Pacific put the islands and their unique biodiversity at risk indefinitely. 
One April afternoon in Tokyo, the U.S. president made a welcome promise to reduce his military’s presence in Okinawa. Three U.S. service members had raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl the previous September, and enraged locals had spent months protesting the Japanese prefecture’s dense network of U.S. bases. 
“When the Prime Minister asked us to consider the concerns of the people of Okinawa and I became acquainted with them, as a result of some of the unfortunate incidents that you know well about,” said President Bill Clinton, standing side by side with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in the April 1996 speech, “it bothered me that these matters had not been resolved before now, before this time.” His administration agreed to close the Futenma Air Station, a major Marine Corps base in the populous Okinawan city of Ginowan, within five to seven years.

* An Army general warns that young Americans are either too fat or criminal to join the armed services, as recruitment numbers run to historic lows 
* Lt. Gen Xavier Brunson said young people are unqualified to enlist due to obesity or pre-existing medical conditions 
* Only 23 percent of people of age to serve are physically eligible to enroll 
* The Army won't meet its 2022 recruitment goal of 485,000 - falling short by a staggering 20,000 recruits 
* Smaller recruitment numbers come after the Army announced all soldiers must receive the COVID-19 vaccine 
Recruitment numbers for the Army are at historic lows as Americans are either too fat or criminal to join the defend the country, an Army general warned. 
 Lt. Gen Xavier Brunson, the commander of Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, theorized as to why recruitment is so low following a July statement from the Army that announced it wouldn't meet its 485,000 recruitment goal for 2022, falling short by a staggering 20,000 recruits. 
Officers across the country are failing to meet recruitment numbers as fewer youth are qualified to serve, which some blame on the COVID-19 pandemic.

The U.S. military will test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on September 7, the Pentagon says, adding that Russia has been notified. 
A Pentagon spokesman described the test as routine and said it was meant to demonstrate the readiness of the U.S. military's nuclear forces and "provide confidence in the security and effectiveness of the nation's nuclear deterrent." 
It will be the second test launch of the country's nuclear defenses in less than a month. The last occurred on August 16 and tested a Minuteman III ICBM that carried a test reentry vehicle, which in a strategic conflict could be armed with a nuclear warhead. The vehicle traveled about 6,760 kilometers to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific.

Bloomberg: Xi, Putin to Meet for First Time Since War at Summit in Uzbekistan 
(Bloomberg) -- Xi Jinping will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in-person for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Tass reported, as the two authoritarian leaders push back against rising geopolitical pressure from the US. 
Xi will sit down with Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit that runs from Sept. 15-16 in Uzbekistan, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrey Denisov said Wednesday, according to the state-run news agency. 
“We are planning a serious, full-fledged meeting of our leaders with a detailed agenda, which we are now, in fact, working on with our Chinese partners,” Denisov told reporters, according to the report.  Xi is also expected to travel to neighboring Kazakhstan on Sept. 14 for a state visit. Beijing has not confirmed either trip.

Reuters: Russia says United States is behind Europe's gas supply crisis 
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the United States had fomented Europe's gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the "suicidal" step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. 
Europe is facing its worst gas supply crisis ever, with energy prices soaring and German importers even discussing possible rationing in the European Union's biggest economy after Russia reduced gas flows westwards. 
When asked what needed to happen for Nord Stream 1 to begin pumping again, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters: "Listen, you are asking me questions that even children know the answer to: those who started this need to finish this."

European households should brace for an expensive winter owing to the continent’s deepening energy crisis that will likely send electricity and heating bills soaring. 
Energy affordability in Europe is reaching a “tipping point” that could peak next year, with total spending on bills across the continent growing by 2 trillion euros ($2 trillion), a Goldman Sachs research team, led by Alberto Gandolfi and Mafalda Pombeiro, said in a note published Sunday.

WNU Editor: To prevent massive social unrest EU governments are going to impose a price cap on prices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new lease for Shinhan Bank of South Korea brought occupancy to 91% at 750 Seventh Ave.  The 15,279 square foot deal takes up the entire 26th floor.
The 36-story tower recently underwent major capital improvements by owner FosterLane Management, including two floors of tenant-only amenities.
CBRE’s Howard Fiddle, Brett Shannon, Arkady Smolyansky, Evan Fiddle and Jacob Rosenthal replaced the owner.  Howard Fiddle praised the building as “one of the best locations in Manhattan”.  Upper floors feature floor-to-ceiling windows, 13-foot ceiling heights, and panoramic views.  
Matthias Li and Cole Chartash of Cushman & Wakefield replaced Shinhan.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and United States have ramped up buying key industrial metals from Russia, data showed, despite logistical problems spurred by the war in Ukraine and tough talk about starving Moscow of foreign exchange revenue. 
The metal shipments highlight the West's difficulty in pressuring Russia's economy, which has performed better than expected and seen its rouble currency surge as buoyant oil revenue has helped offset the impact of sanctions. 
EU and U.S. imports of Russia's main base metal products aluminium and nickel during March-June increased by as much as 70%, official trade data compiled by Reuters from the United Nations Comtrade database show. 
The total value of EU and U.S. imports of the two metals from March to June were $1.98 billion, the data showed. 
The West has imposed repeated waves of sanctions on a wide range of Russian products, people and institutions, but has largely spared the industrial metals sector.
