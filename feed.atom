Defense One: China Could Overtake US in Space Without ‘Urgent Action,’ Warns New Pentagon Report 
America needs a long-term goal in space to be able to compete with Beijing, Pentagon industrial-base group writes. 
The United States could be eclipsed by China in orbit unless it unites around a common goal for space, as it did during the race to the Moon a half-century ago, according to a report released Wednesday. 
 China is working to become the world’s dominant space power “economically, diplomatically, and militarily” by 2045, according to the State of the Space Industrial Base report for 2022, which was written by officials from the Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit, Air Force, and Air Force Research Laboratory. 
They argue that the United States must quickly act to maintain its advantage over Beijing, including using more commercial technology and setting long-term, bipartisan policy goals.

Politico: U.S. reacts to Iranian comments on draft nuclear deal 
Negotiations appear to be inching toward the finish line. 
VIENNA — The U.S. and Iran are closing in on an agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal after almost 17 months of negotiations. 
The United States relayed to the EU on Wednesday its much-awaited response to Iran’s comments on the draft proposal to restore the nuclear deal, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told POLITICO. 
The spokesperson of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani confirmed that it had received the U.S. response via EU senior official Enrique Mora, who acts as a mediator and coordinator of the talks. 
Iran still refuses to talk directly with the U.S. “Iran has started reviewing the US comments, and after the review Tehran will submit its views to the coordinator,” Kanaani said.

Newsweek: What Is Russia's Anti-Putin 'National Republican Army'? 
Darya Dugina, daughter of an influential ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was killed in a suspected car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow organized by the so-called National Republican Army (NRA), according to a former member of Russia's Duma who is now living in exile. 
Former Russian state deputy Ilya Ponomarev, in an appearance on his Russian-language opposition TV channel "Utro Fevralya" in Kyiv, alleged that Dugina, 30, was killed by Russian partisans from the NRA. He said both Dugin and his daughter were targets. 
Dugina was the daughter of Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, who has been credited with being a key architect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Fake news about Kim Jong-Un gets wall-to-wall coverage but citizens of a key ally opposing a joint military exercise goes largely unnoticed.
In America these days, almost any information about North Korea, be it rumor, fake news, or just plain silly, becomes fodder for the mainstream media. From TMZ to The Guardian, reporters know there is an insatiable appetite for anything that puts Kim and his regime in a bad or crazy light. 
But when it comes to South Korea, which hosts 28,500 American ground troops and the Pentagon’s largest military base outside of North America, U.S. media coverage is, shall we say, highly selective.

BBC: India sacks officers for accidentally firing missile into Pakistan 
India's government has sacked three air force officers for the "accidental firing of a missile" into Pakistan in March. 
The incident had escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations.  Delhi had blamed the "deeply regrettable" incident on a "technical malfunction" during routine maintenance. 
Islamabad warned Delhi to "be mindful of the unpleasant consequences of such negligence" and to avoid a repeat. 
The officers responsible for the 9 March incident have been terminated from service, the Indian Air Force said in a statement on Tuesday.

Reuters: Russian Defence Minister Shoigu: Military Campaign in Ukraine 'Deliberately' Slowed to Reduce Civilian Casualties 
LONDON (Reuters) - Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Wednesday that the slowing pace of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine was deliberate, and driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. 
Speaking at a meeting of defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Uzbekistan, Shoigu said: "Everything is being done to avoid casualties among civilians. Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but we are doing this deliberately."

Reuters: Just over half of Americans say U.S. should back Ukraine until Russia withdraws - Reuters/Ipsos poll 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After half a year of war in Ukraine, a slim majority of Americans agree that the United States should continue to support Kyiv until Russia withdraws all its forces, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday. 
The polling suggests continued support for President Joe Biden's policy of backing Ukraine, despite economic worries and domestic political developments grabbing Americans' attention in recent months. 
The Biden administration has provided weapons and ammunition for Ukraine's bid to repel Russian forces and is expected to announce a new security assistance package of about $3 billion, a U.S. official said, as Ukraine's marks its Independence Day on Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Biden orders airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria following attacks near base holding US troops last week 
(CNN)President Joe Biden ordered airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria on Tuesday, a little over a week after a number of rockets struck near a military base in northeastern Syria housing US troops. 
The airstrikes conducted by the US military targeted Iranian-backed groups in Deir ez-Zor Syria, US Central Command said in a statement. The strikes targeted "infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps," Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for CENTCOM, said in the statement. 
"At President Biden's direction, US military forces conducted precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor Syria today. These precision strikes are intended to defend and protect US forces from attacks like the ones on August 15 against US personnel by Iran-backed groups," he said, referring to last week's attacks on the Green Village base near the Iraqi border. The incident did not result in damage or injuries.

360   News 360: Turkey claims that several NATO member countries want the Ukraine-Russia war to continue 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Tuesday that several member countries of the Atlantic Alliance, not just the United States, want the war between Russia and Ukraine to continue.
"There are those who wanted to sabotage the grain deal. But it is not the United States. The contribution (of Washington) has been the removal of restrictions on export of Russian fertilizers, unblocking of ports, (removal of restrictions) on banking operations," he stressed. 
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry also explained, during an interview with the Haber Global channel, that 33 ships have already left Ukraine thanks to the protection agreement signed last month in Istanbul between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations.

Two new models have emerged that could give us clues to the appearance of China’s secretive new long-range bomber.  
The saga of China’s H-20 next-generation bomber may have taken a very interesting new turn, with the appearance of at least two models showing a new aircraft design, or at least a concept, that seems to have strong similarities to how the H-20 is expected to look. That last point is crucial, since we have not, so far, seen any official renderings of the H-20 beyond depictions that are highly obscured, and which may not actually bear much of a relationship to the final design. However, with recent hints of an imminent first flight dropped by China’s state-run media, there seems to be momentum gathering behind the long-awaited bomber, suggesting its official unveiling — or a state-approved leaking — may not be far off.

The claims could affect legal proceedings between Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who have sued each other. 

According to Mr Musk’s lawyers, Mr Zatko has already been subpoenaed.

Ms Lei has now been detained by Chinese authorities for two years following her arrest for leaking state secrets, and there have been serious concerns for her health and safety following her detainment. 

The new images that have been obtained have revealed what her apartment looked like when she was arrested, according to Sky News host James Morrow.

“They took her passport, her computer ... we get a sense of what it was like,” Mr Morrow told Sky News Australia. 

In the Daily Telegraph's new film ‘Disappeared – The Cheng Lei Story’, the photos are just one revelation. 

Ms Lei's family and friend’s plea to the Chinese government has been for it to show some compassion and let her return home to Australia.

Mr Morrow believes there is hope that after the Chinese national party congress later this year, there may be some softening of this relationship.]]></summary>

The US house speaker's husband was driving home from a dinner party when he recorded an “0.82 per cent blood alcohol level or higher”.

Officers on the scene of the accident said they "observed objective signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication," according to the documents. 

Mr Pelosi pleaded guilty to one count of DUI on Tuesday and was sentenced to three years probation and five days of jail time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newsweek: NATO Chief Urges More Weapons for Ukraine—'Winter Is Coming' 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has urged Western nations to provide more weapons more quickly to help Ukraine retake territory occupied by Russia, including the peninsula of Crimea occupied since 2014. 
Speaking at Tuesday's Crimea Platform summit, Stoltenberg also warned that a harsh winter lies ahead for Ukraine and its NATO supporters, necessitating continued backing for Kyiv despite the costs. 
"NATO is part of the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group to mobilize support, and I actively engage with leaders to urge them to provide more weapons, and more ammunition, more quickly," Stoltenberg said. 
"Winter is coming, and it will be hard," Stoltenberg said. "What we see now is a grinding war of attrition. This is a battle of wills and a battle of logistics. Therefore, we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term, so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation."

Daily Mail: Biden to give Ukraine $3billion - the largest weapons package since Putin invaded in February - bringing the total in US assistance to $13billion amid fears Russia will start attacking more civilian centers 
* As the war drags on with no end in sight, U.S. officials are reportedly shifting their strategy toward a longer-term campaign 
* The money will fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two 
* Earlier shipments, most of them done under Presidential Drawdown Authority, have focused on Ukraine's more immediate needs 
* With the added $3 billion, the Biden administration will have offered a total of near $14 billion over the course of 19 aid packages since February 
The Biden administration is preparing another $3 billion arms package for Ukraine to mark the six month anniversary of the Russian invasion. 
As the war drags on with no end in sight, U.S. officials are reportedly shifting their strategy toward a longer-term campaign, offering the funds to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers for years to come. 
The Biden administration is expected to announce the package on Wednesday - exactly six months after the invasion on Feb. 24.

RT: More Russians are disillusioned with Western values – poll 
Western democracy and culture are destructive, every fourth Russian says 
The number of Russians who believe Western values to be beneficial to the country has fallen drastically in the last 20 years, according to a poll conducted earlier this month by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM) and published on Tuesday.

WNU Editor: I would not use the word "disillusioned". I would use the word contempt. And this is a radical change from just 20 years ago. 
When Russians look at the West today they see homeless camps in the cities. No go zones for police. Urban teenagers graduating high school who are illiterate. Promoting social values that many do not identify with. Many struggling to afford the basics. And forget about making enough to afford a home. The only other thing that I can add is that most Americans agree .... 74% Of Americans Say The U.S. Is On The Wrong Track In A New NBC News Poll (August 21, 2022).]]></summary>

Chancellor Scholz and Prime Minister Trudeau were set to travel to Newfoundland, the future home of a green hydrogen plant, to sign the agreement. German energy companies have already agreed to import Canadian hydrogen. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were set to attend an economic conference in Toronto on Tuesday. They were expected to travel to Newfoundland to sign deals for Germany to import green hydrogen from Canada. 
The trip to Canada, Scholz's first as chancellor, comes as Germany looks for ways to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. 
At a press briefing in Toronto Tuesday, Scholz said Canada was the partner of choice, as Germany moves away from Russian energy imports at "warp speed."   
Read more ....   
Update #1: Sending Canadian LNG to Germany is ‘doable,’ Trudeau says (Politico)  
Update #2: German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas (The Guardian)   
WNU Editor: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's trip to Canada was a waste of time. He wants Canadian natural gas but there are no surplus pipelines to carry the natural gas that Germany needs from Canada's energy rich western provinces to Canada's eastern ports. 
And as for this hydrogen deal. 
Nothing but talk and vague promises that maybe in a couple of years it will be feasible to ship Canadian hydrogen to Germany. My prediction. Another green program for the Canadian government to pump money that it does not have on the hope that it will replace fossil fuels.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Pentagon DENIES DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's second plea for the National Guard to be deployed to deal with huge influx of migrants into the city 
* The Pentagon has rejected a second request from Washington, D.C.'s mayor 
* Muriel Bowser has asked for help to deal with migrants arriving in the city by bus 
* Pentagon said it 'would not be appropriate' to use the DC National Guard and that the Defense Department 'cannot fulfill your request' 
* Bowser had initially requested DC National Guard support in late-July when she said the city had reached a 'tipping point' with the number of migrants 
* More than 7,500 have now arrived since April in the capital     * Governors of Texas and Arizona began busing migrants from the southern border to the capital starting in April to protest Biden's immigration policy 
* Texas is now bussing immigrants to the Big Apple on a regular basis 
The Pentagon has denied a second request by Washington DC's mayor to help receive migrants arriving from Republican-led states Texas and Arizona. 
Mayor Muriel Bowser in July called for the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard to help with migrants describing it as a 'humanitarian crisis'. 
Bowser asked for 90-day deployment and for a review at the end of that period, but the request was denied by the U.S. military.

Reuters: Chinese military ship leaves Sri Lanka after controversial visit 
COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Chinese military survey ship that docked at Sri Lanka's Chinese-built port of Hambantota despite opposition from neighbouring India left on Monday after a week-long stay, the port company told Reuters. 
Analysts say the Yuan Wang 5 is among a group of Chinese ships that monitor satellite, rocket and intercontinental ballistic missile launches. 
India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbour, fears China could use the port as a military base.  Sri Lanka, facing its worst economic crisis in decades and in need of financial support from both China and India, had delayed the ship's arrival after India raised its concerns but gave in to Chinese demands later.

A Russian politics expert explains how much is still unknown about the murder of Darya Dugina.
 Over the weekend, a car exploded along a Moscow highway. Inside was Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultranationalist ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Dugina, though lower profile than her father Aleksandr Dugin, espoused many similar nationalist and pro-war beliefs and had been sanctioned by the United States for running a disinformation website. Russia is blaming Ukraine for Dugina’s death, and it’s already prompting recriminations between the two countries…]]></summary>

19FortyFive: A Military Expert Listed Out the Massive Amount of Military Gear America Is Giving Ukraine 
You may be surprised to read the list of military weapons America is giving to Ukraine. It looks like a mini arsenal.  With the Ukrainian counteroffensive on the southern front gaining traction, the U.S. has committed to sending more weapon systems to Ukraine. 
The latest (and 19th in total) package of security assistance to Ukraine includes drones, ammunition for a crucial weapon system, several howitzers, and thousands of anti-tank weapons, among other weapon systems.

Gordon Chang, 19FortyFive: China Is Preparing To Go To War 
China expert Gordon Chang makes the case that China is preparing for armed conflict – and could happen quite soon.  Last month, a Chinese entrepreneur making medical equipment for consumers told me that local officials had demanded he convert his production lines in China so that they could turn out items for the military. Communist Party cadres, he said, were issuing similar orders to other manufacturers. 
Moreover, Chinese academics privately say the ongoing expulsion of foreign colleagues from China’s universities appears to be a preparation for hostilities. 
The People’s Republic of China is preparing to go to war, and it is not trying to hide its efforts. Amendments to the National Defense Law, effective the first day of last year, transfer powers from civilian to military officials.

President Biden will wrap up a two-week vacation at his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., Wednesday as one unofficial count indicates he has spent more time away from the White House than his three immediate predecessors at the same point in their terms. 
The president and his family, including disgraced first son Hunter Biden, left Washington for their latest getaway on Aug. 10, spending almost a week at a $20 million mansion on South Carolina’s exclusive Kiawah Island.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, the founder of recruitment firm CryptoRecruit, Neil Dundon, said that while security auditing services have long been in demand, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has opened up auditors the ability to review potentially vulnerable smart contracts:

“There has always been a demand for security auditors […] But ever since DeFi apps have been around, there has been a pretty big increase in demand for security audits across the space, as one small vulnerability in the protocol can potentially lead to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.

This is not a good time to be a Ukrainian soldier on the frontlines facing off against the Russians. I want to show you two videos where you can see how two different Russian weapons are employed on the battlefied–the Zala Drones and the TOS 1A Heavy Flamethrower. For those who say this is just Russian propaganda, I would note in passing that Ukraine is not posting comparable videos showing it wreaking havoc on Russian positions. That is another case of the dog not barking.

* The "suffering" rate has climbed for both Democrats and Republicans
* The percentage of adults classified as "thriving" has dropped again, to 51.2% 
* Daily stress and worry remain steady and near pre-pandemic levels 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The percentage of Americans who evaluate their lives poorly enough to be considered "suffering" on Gallup's Life Evaluation Index was 5.6% in July, the highest since the index's inception in 2008. This exceeds the previous high of 4.8% measured in April and is statistically higher than all prior estimates in the COVID-19 era. Across extensive measurement since January 2008, the suffering percentage has reached 4.5% or higher on a handful of occasions. 
The most recent results, obtained July 26 to Aug. 2, 2022, are based on web surveys of 3,649 U.S. adults as a part of the Gallup Panel, a probability-based, non-opt-in panel of about 115,000 adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Reuters: Exclusive-U.S. commits to Afghan asset talks despite frustration with Taliban - sources 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will press ahead with talks on releasing billions of dollars in Afghanistan's foreign-held assets despite the late al Qaeda leader's presence in Kabul and foot-dragging by the Taliban and Afghan central bank, according to three sources with knowledge of the situation. 
The decision to pursue the initiative to help stabilize Afghanistan's collapsed economy underscores growing concern in Washington over a humanitarian crisis as the United Nations warns that nearly half the country's 40 million people face "acute hunger" as winter approaches. 
At the core of the U.S.-led effort, as Reuters reported last month, is a plan to transfer billions in foreign-held Afghan central bank assets into a proposed Swiss-based trust fund. Disbursements would be made with the help of an international board and bypass the Taliban, many of whose leaders are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.

Oz appeared on Hannity repeatedly with the host’s support before and after Oz won the GOP primary, likely thanks in part to his appearances on the show.  He also called Hannity a “true friend” who has he gave him “behind the scenes” campaign tips.

OPEC stands ready to cut output to correct a recent oil price decline driven by poor futures market liquidity and macro-economic fears, which has ignored extremely tight physical crude supply, OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia said on Monday. 
Saudi state news agency SPA cited Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as telling Bloomberg OPEC+ has the means and flexibility to deal with challenges. 
Oil prices have dropped in recent weeks to around $95 per barrel from as high as $120 on fears of a Chinese economic slowdown and a recession in the West.

    I read with disappointment Ellen Miller-Mack’s letter, “Reflections on the Sheriff’s Race”, (August 20) in which she found that none of us were a satisfactory choice, but I singled out for his criticism. 
I wish Mrs. Miller-Mack had reached out for a chat;  I would have appreciated the opportunity to clarify, and I’m certainly not hard to find.  My comment on the fact that 70% of those in police custody are on remand was raised because of concern about their specific lack of legal guarantee to education and treatment services and noting that I will guarantee that access when I’m sheriff. 
My comment about seeking to hire more women in corrections echoed comments also made by the other two candidates, but was attributed to me only.  Still, I stand by the comment: Hiring more women in corrections will improve the culture and climate for everyone, and the research backs that up.  Women think differently about the use of force, doing it rarely but very effectively. 
We need to change the field of corrections and start changing the makeup of those who work in it is a step in the right direction.  Not only do we need more women in corrections, but we need more bilingual staff and people who reflect non-dominant cultures, who are disproportionately represented in custody. 
I am committed to these goals and would welcome Ms Miller-Mack’s participation on my Citizens’ Advisory Council to bring transparency and accountability to the Hampshire Sheriff’s Office when elected.

Hampshire County Sheriff

The judge who issued the warrant for Mar-a-Lago has signaled that he is likely to release a redacted version of the supporting affidavit.  But the warrant itself suggests the answer is probably no – the FBI had no legal cause for the raid.
The warrant authorized the FBI to seize “all physical documents and records constituting evidence, contraband, proceeds of crime, or other illegally possessed in violation of 18 USC §§793, 2071, or 1519” (emphasis added).  These three criminal statutes all deal with the possession and handling of documents containing national security information, public records, or documents relevant to an investigation or other matters before a federal agency or the courts.

    Electric vehicles are more environmentally friendly than thermal engine vehicles 

I would like to offer some counterpoints to recent letters from the Gazette (“Nothing Green About the Green New Deal”, July 29, and “How We Can Tackle the Climate Crisis”, August 10), which asserted that electric vehicles consume excessive energy. energy in their production, rely primarily on fossil fuel-derived electricity sources and incorporate toxic materials.

But in the near future, decentralized social media – or Web3 – will likely end this old model by putting the power back in the hands of users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to local media 36kr.com, Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent recently received a new patent for a blockchain-based missing persons poster.  The patent took nearly three years to issue from the date of its first submission in December 2019.
The paten consists of a request to generate data when the user submits that a person has disappeared.  The proposal is then unveiled publicly on the blockchain for verification.  Once a consensus has been reached regarding the request, it is then stored in the public ledger and transmitted to the nodes for dissemination to a wider audience.  Tencent said in the patent application that the design aims to improve the efficiency of finding missing persons.
Tencent was an early adopter of blockchain technology among big tech companies, particularly when it came to exploring possibilities for integration with payment technology;  though his efforts have been hampered somewhat by China’s strict crypto regulations.  Yet his “FISCO BCOS” coinless blockchain jointly developed with Chinese telecom giant Huawei from 2018 for building decentralized applications remains active to this day. 
Early July, Tencent close one of its non-fungible token platforms after the Chinese government clarified that it does not allow users to conduct private transactions after purchase, as well as a drop in sales.
China is currently embarking on a centralized approach to blockchain technology, with a policy significantly favoring its central bank digital currency in digital yuan (e-CNY) instead of digital tokens developed by private companies.  Last week, the country rolled out its first-ever e-CNY-enabled social security card, which allows social assistance to be directly deposited into the recipient’s digital yuan account and used for expenses.

The latest episode of CNN Reliable sources aired Sunday, ending a 30-year run as a fixture on the network.  The show was canceled last weekwith his host Brian Steelerwho for many has become the face of the cable news network over the past year of the jeff zucker time.
But outside of our cabal of media-obsessed nerds (like me!), Stelter’s departure has made some waves in the pond of public attention, suggesting the decision of CNN’s new boss. Chris Licht canceling the show – and firing its host – was a savvy move.
It’s also the clearest sign yet of what Licht’s CNN aims to look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gregg Schwartz in his August 17 guest column‘Northampton’s Endless Mask Mandate’, complains that forcing pupils to mask up during school hours is their night, and the Northampton School Board’s continued caution is ‘shocking’ given the news CDC recommendations and the general trend toward easing COVID restrictions.
He goes on to conclude, “We owe it to our children, each of us, to see beyond our own emotions and fears, and to have the courage to follow the clear, indisputable science of our best doctors and researchers and the CDC. .  This hard science absolutely says that masks, unless we are in “red”, are unjustified and harmful to our children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pop icon Janet Jackson has sold her posh Manhattan apartment – and certainly not for a song.

The legendary singer, 56, has parted ways with her roughly 2,100 square foot home – and nearly 25-year home – Central Park West for $8.8million, the Wall Street Journal first reported.  It’s just a little less than the $8.99 million she was looking for when it hit the market in April.
The ‘Together Again’ star had owned the condo since 1998 when she bought it for $2.8 million — or $5.13 million in current inflation-adjusted figures — through a legal entity named Puffy Trust , noted the Journal.  The new owner is a limited liability company named Nanyang Real Estate Holding.
