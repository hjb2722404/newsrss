Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yielded to pressure over allegations China interfered in Canada’s elections, appointing a special investigator to study the matter. 
“Upholding confidence in our democratic process in our elections, in our institutions, is of utmost importance,” the prime minister told reporters Monday evening in Ottawa. 
The “independent special rapporteur” will have a wide mandate and make recommendations on fighting foreign meddling, he added. 
The issue will also be studied by a group of lawmakers cleared to see top-secret intelligence, Trudeau said.

WNU Editor: This is my take also .... Trudeau goes from standstill to 'panic mode' on Chinese interference (Don Martin, CTV News). According to all polls three-quarters of Canadians want answers, including this blogger who is also a Canadian.    
Update: All of this news first started from an intelligence leak. Not surprising, the Trudeau government, deeply embarrassed by all of these revelations, want to know who the leaker is .... RCMP investigating leaks alleging foreign election interference (CTV News).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US News and World Report/Reuters: Syria Says Israeli Strike Puts Aleppo Airport Out of Service 
BEIRUT (Reuters) -An Israeli air strike knocked Aleppo airport out of service on Tuesday and forced the Syrian authorities to reroute flights carrying aid for people affected by last month's earthquake, Syrian state media reported. 
The Israeli military declined to comment.  Israel has for years been carrying out attacks against what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria, where Tehran's influence has grown since it began supporting President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war that began in 2011. 
In the second attack on Aleppo airport in six months, Syrian air defences intercepted missiles launched from the Mediterranean, west of the coastal city of Latakia, at 2:07 a.m. (2307 GMT), state news agency SANA reported, citing a military source.

China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned Tuesday that “conflict and confrontation” with the United States is inevitable if Washington does not change course, delivering a stern and wide-ranging rebuke of US policies for his first press conference in the new role. 
Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the US, built up a reputation for being careful and accomplished diplomat while overseas. 
But he struck a far more combative tone in his first appearance as foreign minister at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, warning of the “catastrophic consequences” of what he described as a “reckless gamble” by Washington in how it treats its fellow superpower.

Reuters: US House Speaker McCarthy plans to meet Taiwan's president in the US -sources 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy plans to meet Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in the U.S. in coming weeks, two sources told Reuters on Monday, a move that could replace the Republican Speaker's anticipated but sensitive trip to the democratically governed island claimed by China. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tsai had been invited to speak at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library during a transit through California on a planned visit to Central America, and that McCarthy was likely to meet her in the United States. 
One of the sources said should the U.S. meeting go forward - likely in April - it did not necessarily rule out McCarthy visiting Taiwan in the future.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin‘s war in Ukraine continues to rage, United States commanders and military observers are sounding the alarm about the activity of Russia’s submarine fleet thousands of miles away, off the U.S. coast. 
Throughout the war, which began when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine last February, there has been a buildup of Russian Navy forces in the Black Sea. 
There has also been an increasing presence of Russian submarines off of U.S. coasts and in the Mediterranean, according to officials.

   Warzone/The Drive: Rolls-Royce Offers Peek At The B-52’s New Engines Undergoing Testing  
The B-52 re-engining saga goes back many decades, but it’s finally happening in the form of Rolls-Royce’s TF130 turbofan. 
  Now that testing has begun, Rolls-Royce has provided first looks at the F130 turbofan engines in their dual-pod configuration that will replace the outdated TF33 engines currently equipping the U.S. Air Force’s B-52H Stratofortress fleet. Rolls-Royce has offered this imagery as part of an update on the years-long effort to re-engine and modernize the service’s bombers. 
In fact, the fight to get the B-52 new engines is a saga that dates back decades.  A Rolls-Royce press release explains that testing of the F130 engines under the Air Force’s B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP) is being carried out at the company’s outdoor test facility at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The current round of testing will focus primarily on both crosswind aerodynamic flow and confirming that the engine’s digital controls system can operate as intended.

Defense News: Lockheed Martin resumes F-35 flights with engine vibration fix in hand 
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin on Monday morning resumed conducting acceptance flights of newly built F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, nearly three months after an engine problem grounded new jets and halted deliveries.
Lockheed announced Monday that the first flight took off from Fort Worth, Texas, where it builds the majority of F-35 fighters. 
“We resumed F-35 production flight operations today following an F135 engine mitigation action,” Lockheed Martin said in its statement.  Lockheed stopped acceptance flights after a Dec. 15 mishap involving an F-35B fighter that was undergoing a quality check flight. 
A video showed the fighter bouncing on the ground, tipping forward and spinning before the pilot safely ejected. 
The investigation that ensued found signs of a problem with the fighter’s Pratt & Whitney-made F135 engine, and engine deliveries were halted in late December. Further investigation found the engine had vibration issues.

   Business Insider: 'I can't get my money out': Billionaire investor Mark Mobius says China is restricting flows of capital out of the country 
* Emerging markets investing veteran Mark Mobius says China is restricting capital outflows. 
* He told Fox Business' "Mornings with Maria' that he couldn't pull investment funds from his account in Shanghai.
* Mobius said he's been unable to get an explanation about the "crazy" restriction. 
Mark Mobius, a pioneer in emerging markets investing, said China is restricting investment outflows from the country, a move that would be taking place as the world's second-largest economy is trying to shake off pressure from COVID-19 lockdowns. 
"I'm personally affected because I have an account with HSBC in Shanghai. I can't get my money out. 
The government is restricting the flow of money out of the country," Mobius said on Thursday on the Fox Business show "Mornings with Maria". 
"So I would be very, very careful investing in China," the founder of Mobius Capital Partners said.

* Half of Americans say China is the United States’ greatest enemy 
* Since the pandemic, China has held the top spot as the greatest enemy 
* Democrats and Republicans have different views on who is the top enemy 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- For the third year in a row, Americans are most likely to mention China as the United States’ greatest enemy in the world today. When asked the open-ended question, 50% of Americans say China is their nation’s greatest enemy, with most of the rest, 32%, naming Russia. North Korea, which was viewed as the greatest enemy in 2018, is now a distant third at 7%. 
The latest results are from Gallup’s Feb. 1-23 World Affairs survey, coinciding with widespread reporting of China’s balloon-carried surveillance device being shot down over U.S. waters. There has also been growing concern in the U.S. about China’s alleged backing of Russia in the Ukraine conflict and its association with the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

VOA/AFP: Syria Condemns US Top General's Visit to Kurdish-Held Northeast  
Damascus, Syria — Syria's foreign ministry Sunday condemned a surprise visit by the United States' top military officer to an army base in the Kurdish-held northeast, dubbing it "illegal," state media said. 
In his snap visit Saturday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met U.S. troops stationed in areas of war-torn Syria under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 
About 900 U.S. troops are deployed in several bases and posts across northeastern Syria as part of the fight against Islamic State group remnants. 
The official news agency SANA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying, "Syria strongly condemns the illegal visit of the American chairman of the chiefs of staff to an illegal American military base in northeast Syria."

CSM: US-China conundrum: Can hotline diplomacy work if trust isn’t a goal? 
Shortly after the U.S. Air Force shot down a Chinese balloon that had traversed the continental United States for several days last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin placed a call to his counterpart in Beijing. 
At his disposal: a special hotline intended to help the two increasingly competitive global powers to prevent sudden tensions from deteriorating into full-blown crises. 
The call went unanswered. 
The Pentagon later lamented the lost opportunity for the two sides to talk out the balloon flare-up before it devolved, as it soon did, into a diplomatic imbroglio. 
For its part, China’s Defense Ministry confirmed that its chief, Wei Fenghe, had declined to take the call because the U.S. by its action had “failed to create a proper atmosphere” for a bilateral dialogue.

"Secretary Austin will talk about, with each partner, the tremendous opportunities that we have because of cutting-edge innovation, emerging technology, shared assessments of what the threats are facing our partners in the region, [and] that now is the time to improve collective and shared defense," the official said.

We Are The Mighty: The CIA says Xi Jinping ordered the Chinese military to invade Taiwan within four years 
When the latest delegation from the House of Representatives returned from Taiwan, they had one message for the rest of Congress: Taiwan needs weapons and training, now. The U.S., they believe, needs to speed up the number and power of armaments it promised to Taipei. 
The United States currently has a backlog of $19 billion in undelivered weapons.   The U.S. might have a little more time to deliver the weapons, but only a little. CIA director William Burns told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan in four years. And that’s not a full four years Taiwan has to prepare. Even after the weapons are delivered, the Taiwanese will still need to train with them.

Update: China increases military spending, CIA warns of invasion (News Nation)   
WNU Editor: Quoting CIA Director Burns .... 
.... “We do know, as has been made public, that President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan, but that doesn’t mean that he’s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well,” Burns said.  
Being able to invade Taiwan is one thing. A final decision to invade is another. But if I was Taiwan, I would definitely be preparing my defenses ASAP.]]></summary>

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called the wave of suspected poisonings of schoolgirls in recent months an "unforgivable crime". 
"If there are any people involved in the matter, and there certainly are... the perpetrators must be given the most severe of punishments," he warned. 
More than 1,000 girls at dozens of schools have been affected by unexplained illnesses since November. 
Incidents were reported in at least 15 cities and towns on Sunday alone. 
Authorities have released very little information about their investigations and announced no arrests, but they have accused Iran's "enemies" of using the suspected poisonings to undermine the clerical establishment.

Bloomberg: Polish-German Tensions Expose Crack in Unified Ukraine Front 
(Bloomberg) -- As NATO allies make a show of unity in support of Ukraine, a rift between Germany and Poland risks undermining a joint effort to supply Kyiv’s forces. 
Quarreling in Warsaw and Berlin over missiles, tanks and spare parts has reached a new level, even as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy calls on western backers to “hurry up” in delivering armaments before any spring offensive gets underway. 
Polish leaders are now losing no opportunity to take aim at Berlin, a familiar target. Recently the accusations have focused on foot-dragging on sending battle tanks to the front — which triggered a threat to send German-made armor without Berlin’s approval.

— tim anderson (@timand2037) March 5, 2023
   WNU Editor: I saw first hand how US diplomacy worked at an ICAO General Assembly in the early 1990s.

I was working for ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in Montreal at the time, and the main point of this particular General Assembly was to standardize all equipment used by airports around the world. 
Tens of billions of dollars were involved, and I saw first hand the US delegation pulling all the stops and whistles to make sure US companies were going to be selected to provide these standardized systems.The Japanese and a collection of European countries were offering what IMHO was an excellent alternative to what the US was offering, but I could tell at the time the US were more active behind the scenes (i.e. more banquets, parties, open bars, etc.) 
Yup. The arm twisting, threats, bribes, etc., that happened during this particular Assembly was quite an education for me.
Needless to say when the votes finally came in, the US delegation got everything that they wanted.]]></summary>

Her Reform party secured 31% against far-right’s 15% but Kallas must now form a coalition to govern 
The Reform party of Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, secured first place in Sunday’s parliamentary election, a result that should ensure Tallinn remains one of Europe’s most staunchly pro-Ukraine governments. 
Results with 98% ballots counted showed the far-right EKRE party in second place, with 16.1% versus 31.5% for Kallas’ liberal group, reflecting concerns among some voters over the rising cost of living in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Estonian PM Kallas' liberal Reform Party won 37 out of 101 seats — three more than the last election in 2019 — after results were announced in the early hours of Monday morning.
The right-wing nationalist EKRE party came in second with 17 seats, down two seats compared to the last election. 
Meanwhile, the Center Party, traditionally favored by Estonia’s sizable ethnic-Russian minority, came in third with 16 seats.

HAZEL GREEN, Ky. — As he claimed the first spot in a mile-long line for free food in the Appalachian foothills, Danny Blair vividly recalled receiving the letter announcing that his pandemic-era benefit to help buy groceries was about to be slashed. 
Kentucky lawmakers had voted to end the state’s health emergency last spring, by default cutting food stamp benefits created to help vulnerable Americans like Blair weather the worst of covid-19. Instead of $200 a month, he would get just $30.
 He crumpled up the letter and threw it on the floor of his camper.  “I thought, ‘Wow, the government is trying to kill us now,’” said Blair, 63, who survives on his Social Security disability check and lives in a mobile home with his wife after their house burned down five years ago. “They are going to starve us out.” 
Blair and his wife hop into their truck twice a month at 4 a.m. to ensure they get a few staples at the Hazel Green Food Project’s giveaway. On a recent Friday, they waited nine hours until local prisoners on work duty started loading bags of meat and vegetables, potato chips and cookies into vehicles in one of the nation’s most impoverished communities.

WNU Editor: The US is not alone. Food insecurity is becoming a bigger and more pressing crisis for almost every country in the world. There are many reasons for this, but IMHO inflation is creating a life affordability crisis for the globe, and with most governments facing debt levels that only keep growing, limiting their options to help.
On a side note. For me it is strange to watch people spending hours waiting in line for food in large pick-up trucks.]]></summary>

First lady Jill Biden pushed back on concerns about President Joe Biden’s age and dismissed a proposal by Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley for politicians over age 75 to take a mental competency test. 
“Ridiculous,” the first lady said, responding to Haley’s proposal during an interview with CNN, which will air as part of “CNN Primetime: Jill Biden Abroad” at 9 p.m. ET on Monday. 
Asked if her husband, who would be 82 at his inauguration if he’s reelected, would consider taking such a test, Jill Biden said, “We would never even discuss something like that.”

Times of Israel: Netanyahu slams IAEA chief for saying attacks on nuclear facilities ‘outlawed’  
PM says remarks ‘unworthy’ of Rafael Grossi, vows Israel will protect itself against ‘oppressors’ like Purim villain Haman 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday slammed International Atomic Energy Association chief Rafael Grossi for comments he made against a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, calling them “unworthy.” 
Grossi, who had just returned from a visit to Tehran, said on Saturday that “any military attack on a nuclear facility is outlawed, is out of the normative structures that we all abide by,” when asked by a reporter about threats from the United States and Israel to attack Iran if negotiations to curb its nuclear program are unsuccessful.

Daily Mail: China increases its military budget by 7.1% - $230BN – to ’boost combat preparedness’ for ‘major tasks’ amid fears it will launch an invasion of Taiwan 
* China plunges $230bn into its military budget to 'boost combat preparedness' 
* It reverses a two-decade trend where China has prioritized growth over defense 
* Concerns are mounting that China is set to launch an invasion of Taiwan 
China announced it will boost its military budget by nearly $230 billion this year amid concerns it will launch an invasion of Taiwan. 
The money is set to 'boost combat preparedness and enhance military capabilities,' claimed Premier Li Keqiang ahead of a draft budget presented to the National People's Congress in Beijing. 
It means China's military spending will grow at its fastest pace in four years and take up a larger share of its economy, marking the reversal of a two-decade trend which has seen the nation prioritize growth over its military capabilities.

France will significantly reduce its military presence in Africa, where its bases will be ‘co-administered’ with local army forces, the president said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Monday for his country to build “a new, balanced relationship” with Africa, as the former colonial power seeks to reduce its military presence on the continent. 
“The objective of this new era is to deploy our security presence in a partnership-based approach,” Macron said in a speech in Paris, ahead of a tour that will take him to Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Congo later this week. 
In the future, French military bases on the continent will be “co-administered” with local personnel, the French president said, while there will be a “visible decrease” in the number of French troops stationed in Africa over the next few months.

   Reuters: Russia's Wagner chief warns of frontline collapse if forced to retreat from Bakhmut 
(Reuters) - The founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said his troops now tightening their grip on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut were being deprived of ammunition and if they were forced to retreat the entire front would collapse. 
"If Wagner retreats from Bakhmut now, the whole front will collapse," Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video published over the weekend. "The situation will not be sweet for all military formations protecting Russian interests." 
Reuters could not independently verify when and where the video was recorded. The footage was published on a Telegram channel that has been disseminating Prigozhin news and has associated itself with the Wagner Group. The video was not published on Prigozhin's usual press service channel. 
Prigozhin on Friday said that his units had "practically surrounded Bakhmut," where fighting has intensified in the past week with Russian forces attacking from nearly all sides.  But on Sunday he complained that most of the ammunition that his forces were promised by Moscow in February had not yet been shipped.

European Commission chief von der Leyen says the EU has seen ‘no evidence’ that China is considering sending arms to Russia. 
MESEBERG, Germany — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday said China had declared it won’t supply Russia with weapons for its war against Ukraine, suggesting that Berlin has received bilateral assurances from Beijing on the issue. 
 Scholz was speaking at a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told reporters that the EU has received “no evidence” so far from the U.S. that Beijing is considering supplying lethal support to Moscow. 
Senior U.S. officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have expressed deep concern in recent weeks that China could provide weapons such as kamikaze drones to Russia, which in turn triggered warnings to Beijing from EU politicians. Scholz himself urged Beijing last week to refrain from such actions and instead use its influence to convince Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself against a possible nuclear attack from Iran during a Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday.

Netanyahu was responding to remarks from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi after the IAEA and Iran reached agreement on Saturday on inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.
"International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi just said in Tehran that an Israeli attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities is against the law," Netanyahu said. "Against which law?"
He noted that Iran openly called for the destruction of Israel and said that it was clear that Israel was allowed to defend itself.
"I say this because nothing will deter us from defending our country and preventing our enemies from eliminating the state of the Jews," Netanyahu said.
On Saturday, the IAEA and Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI) announced that experts from the UN's nuclear watchdog would be permitted to carry out closer inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.
The IAEA's cameras would also to be put back into operation, after they and other monitoring equipment were dismantled last year, Grossi said.
Since the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal that restricted uranium enrichment, Iran has enriched uranium to a purity level of 60%, raising international concerns that it was close to being able to build a nuclear weapon.
Israel is convinced that Iran is working to develop a nuclear weapon and sees its existence as threatened. Israeli leaders have repeatedly said they will not allow Iran to become a nuclear power and have refused to rule out a preventive strike.]]></summary>

DNYUZ/New York Times: They’re Exporting Billions in Arms. Just Not to Ukraine. 
CHANGWON, South Korea — A year after Russia invaded Ukraine, the war has spurred a global effort to produce more missiles, tanks, artillery shells and other munitions. And few countries have moved as quickly as South Korea to increase output.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong women's rights group cancelled a demonstration at the last minute on Saturday after police said violent groups might want to join the protest.
The Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association was originally granted permission by Hong Kong police to hold a rare public protest on Sunday ahead of International Women's Day, calling for labour rights, women’s rights and gender equality.
But the association said on its Facebook page late on Saturday it had regrettably decided to cancel the march without giving a reason. It could not immediately be reached for further comment.
This would have been the first major civil rights protest to be approved by police in the city for several years.

The announcement came a month after the province of British Columbia launched an experimental decriminalization process meant to address an opioid overdose crisis that has killed thousands.
The province decriminalized the possession -- but not sale -- of small amounts of cocaine and other hard drugs, under a three-year pilot project, with the aim of removing the stigma associated with drug use that keeps people from seeking help.

Marine biologists were alerted to the find by beach walkers who stumbled upon the grim sight last week in Gansbaai, a small fishing port 150 kilometers (93 miles) south east of Cape Town.
"The dead sharks are torn open at the pelvic girdle, they have Orca teeth marks known as rake marks on their pectoral fins and their liver is missing," said Alison Towner, 37, a shark scientist with the Dyer Island Conservation Trust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Olive oil, fragrant rose and orange blossom: the special "chrism" or holy anointing oil for the coronation of Britain's King Charles III has been blessed in Jerusalem's Old City.
Friday's ceremony was carried out at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe Jesus was buried.
"The chrism oil which will be used to anoint His Majesty The King on May 6 2023 has been consecrated in Jerusalem," Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
The unique mix was "perfumed with essential oils", and also included extracts of sesame, jasmine and cinnamon, it added.
Based on the same ingredients as the oil used at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, it is based on a formula "which has been used for hundreds of years", the palace said Friday.
The oil, which will also be used to anoint Queen Consort Camilla, the wife of King Charles III, was consecrated in a special by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, and the Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum.
Now stored in an ornate silver flask, the oil came from the Mount of Olives, the ridge overlooking the walled Old City.
The olives were harvested from two groves, the Monastery of the Ascension and the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, where Charles III's grandmother is buried, Princess Alice of Greece.
The olives were pressed just outside the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican church, said the coronation oil reflects Charles III's "personal family connection with the Holy Land", the palace statement added.
Welby, who will carry out the coronation service, said the oil signified the "deep historic link between the coronation, the Bible and the Holy Land".
"From ancient kings through to the present day, monarchs have been anointed with oil from this sacred place," he said.

Russia and its ally Belarus have been sidelined from most Olympic sports since Russian forces invaded Ukraine last February.
However, in January the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was seeking a "pathway" for Russians to take part in the Games.
Following that announcement, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) offered athletes from both countries the chance to compete in this year's Asian Games.
That was a significant move because they could gain qualifying marks in competition in Asia to allow them to compete in Paris.
Africa has now followed suit.

Researchers believe they have found the earliest evidence of horseback riding, by the ancient Yamnaya people in Europe some 5,000 years ago.
Their conclusions, based on an analysis of human skeletal remains found in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, were published on Friday in the journal Science Advances.
Domestication of horses for milk is widely accepted to have begun around 3500 BC to 3000 BC, the study said, but the "origins of horseback riding remain elusive."
The researchers from the University of Helsinki and other European institutions date the earliest horsemanship to 3000 BC to 2500 BC among members of the Yamnaya culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rafael Vinoly, a Uruguayan-born and New York-based architect known for designing landmark buildings around the world, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Friday.
Vinoly's death Thursday was announced by his son Roman on the website of the family firm, Rafael Vinoly Architects.
"He was a visionary who will be missed by all those whose lives he touched through his work," the son's statement said.
Vinoly's sometimes controversial work features more than 600 structures around the world, including office and residential buildings, hotels, concert halls, stadiums and airports.
One of his better known works is the so-called Walkie Talkie building in London -- an almost cartoonish skyscraper that is broader at the top than the bottom and looks like it is sagging. 
Britain's Manchester City football team, for which Vinoly designed its training ground, called City Football Academy, expressed its condolences on Twitter.
Some of Vinoly's projects have drawn criticism.
One is 432 Park Avenue, an 85-floor residential building in Manhattan, some of whose multi-millionaire tenants have sued over what they say are banging and creaking noises and vibrations coming from the building.
In London, the Walkie Talkie building at 20 Fenchurch Street raised eyebrows in 2013 because sunlight reflected off its mirrored concave side melted various parts on a Jaguar car parked nearby.
"He leaves a rich legacy of distinctive and timeless designs that manifested in some of the world's most recognizable and iconic structures," Roman Vinoly wrote.

But while those have largely fallen by the wayside, with one nomination each, "All Quiet" has emerged from the crowded trenches of awards season hopefuls as an Oscars frontrunner, with nine nods, including for much-coveted best picture honors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann has resolved to remove any remaining terms from the Nazi era from the statute books.
In a letter to his departmental colleagues, he recently pointed out "that there are still laws and ordinances that use terminology from the Nazi era or in which the 'Reich' is mentioned," the lawyer told Sunday's edition of Die Welt newspaper in comments seen in advance by dpa.
The linguistic remnants appear in laws ranging from those on banking to practitioners of alternative medicine, he said.
"My goal is to eliminate these pre-constitutional remnants," the politician from the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) continued. For example, he said, there are still formulations in the criminal code for the offences of murder and manslaughter that go back to a "National Socialist theory of types of perpetrators."
"In general, I have set myself the goal this year of bringing the entire special section of the criminal code up to date," the justice said.
In the end, it is always up to the legislators to decide. However, he sees "a great openness" in the ruling coalition in which his party is the junior partner with the Greens and the Social Democrats (SPD).]]></summary>

MALATYA, Turkey (Reuters) - The Trend Garden Residence, an upscale serviced apartment building in the Turkish city of Malatya, boasted a gym, freshly-furnished rooms and a roof-top cafeteria.
But when a powerful earthquake jolted the city in the early hours of Feb. 6, the seven-floored building disintegrated, killing 29 people, according to two government officials. It was as if the structure had “liquefied,” one survivor said.
Beneath its colourful facade, the building had been extensively remodelled a few years ago without the necessary permits, but was later registered thanks to a 2018 zoning amnesty promulgated by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to a Reuters review of municipal and amnesty documents, architects drawings an…]]></summary>

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At around 11 a.m. on Feb 14, some 20 Indian tax officials and police burst into the BBC's offices in New Delhi, shouting at staff to step away from their computers and hand over their mobile phones, according to two people present.
At the company's bureau in India's financial capital, Mumbai, tax officials launched a second raid. The government said the BBC had failed to respond to repeated requests to clarify its tax affairs related to the profits and remittances from its Indian operations.
The BBC has said it is cooperating fully with tax authorities and hopes to resolve matters quickly, adding its journalists would continue to report "without fear or favour". It declined to comment for this story.

Eight people including a nephew of Morrisseau were arrested this week and face a total of 40 charges including forgery of artworks and of paperwork that purported to authenticate them.
"Over 1,000 allegedly fraudulent paintings have been seized. The total number produced and sold is unknown," Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Kari Dart told a news conference.
Some of the paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars to unsuspecting buyers across Canada and internationally.
Detective Kevin Veilleux said the forgery ring began in 1996 with a single individual, David Voss, 51, allegedly …]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
