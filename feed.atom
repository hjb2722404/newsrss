        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says he thinks Israel’s war strategy is going to change from a “large scale term of operation to a smaller scale”. 

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come as US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is travelling to Israel to push for Israeli leaders to “scale back” the war. 

International support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza continues to wane as calls for a ceasefire grow. 

“The question continues to be number one, will Israel be able to neutralise Hamas permanently,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“And number two, will this dispute – will this war – spread over into other geographic areas.”]]></summary>

Trump addressed the rising number of immigrants entering the country.

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come after the Israel Defence Forces uncovered a large tunnel designed to carry Hamas fighters from Gaza to the Israel border. 

The IDF aims to decommission the hundreds of kilometres of underground passages and bunkers in an attempt to thwart Hamas manoeuvrability. 

“Keep in mind, think about how much money it costs to do what those videos show,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“Gaza doesn’t have a lot of money – Gaza gets most of its money from overseas aid.”]]></summary>

With Kid Rock and Dana White by his side, Donald Trump electrified the scene, engaging fans before the welterweight showdown between Leon Edwards and Colby Covington.

Trump earlier that day had slammed President Joe Biden at a New Hampshire rally, warning against the possibility of World War III and condemning Biden's leadership.

"We will not have World War III. We will keep you out of it. And we will keep you out of it because of strength," Trump said during the Durham, New Hampshire rally.

"Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual; he is truly the worst, most incompetent, most corrupt President in the history of our country."]]></summary>

President Joe Biden has been under increasing political pressure – especially from the left of the Democrat Party – to pull back on support for Israel. 

The Biden administration has remained firmly pro-Israel in supporting its military campaign against Hamas, but increasingly, the progressive left of the United States has been highly pro-Palestine and critical of the US’ stance on the war. 

This is starting to become an issue for President Biden as he seeks re-election in 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  ●    The recently announced Vocational Professionals Admission Scheme (VPAS) targets secondary school graduates from Mainland China and around the world. ●    Non-local students who complete their studies in the designated full-time Higher Diploma (HD) programmes, offered by the Vocational Training Council (VTC) and in five sectors selected by the Government, are eligible to apply for the scheme.  To alleviate the shortage of skilled labour in key local sectors, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) unveiled the introduction of VPAS, a scheme tied to employment for the admission of talent, during his 2023 Policy Address.   The VTC has been assigned by the Government to advance VPAS on the Mainland and other countries/areas. The Council will also coordinate with relevant industries and Government Bureaux/Departments to prepare for the pilot launch of the scheme in the 2024/25 and 2025/26 academic years.   Recent developments have paved the way for the introduction of VPAS, says Alaina Shum, Deputy Executive Director of VTC. The Government will raise the admission quotas for non-local students in Government-funded post-secondary institutions from 20 percent to 40 percent starting from the 2024/25 academic year.Additionally, work has been underway for a mutual recognition system of cross-border sub-degree qualifications. According to the Policy Address, Hong Kong will collaborate with the relevant Mainland authorities to take forward the mutual recognition of sub-degree level qualification, including the Higher Diploma qualification, and try out such arrangements on a pilot basis.  Therefore, an increase is expected in the enrolment of non-local students in Hong Kong’s vocational and professional education and training (VPET) programmes, she says. VTC is one of the city’s largest providers of VPET programmes.   Non-local students who have successfully completed their studies in one of the 27…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrayinska Pravda: ISW analyses Russia's war plan up to 2026, published by Bild 
The German publication Bild, referring to intelligence data and sources, has reported that Russia plans to occupy Ukrainian territory beyond the borders of the four illegally annexed Ukrainian oblasts during 2024-2026. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has noted that these targets coincide with the ongoing local offensive operations by the Russians.

 
Details: Bild said Russia plans to occupy the entire territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and up to the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast by the end of 2024. 
ISW noted that these targets overlap with Russia's ongoing local offensive operations in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv oblasts. 
 Bild noted that Russia also plans to occupy a large part of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts, including the city of Kharkiv, if possible, in 2025 and 2026.

WNU Editor: I have doubts that the German publication BILD and the sources it uses has Russia's war plans up to 2026. But I do not have any doubts that this war still has a long way to go before it ends, and that Russia has prepared itself for a very long conflict.]]></summary>

Dr. Itai Pessach (whose team at Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv, interviewed and examined many of them) describes to CBS News' Lesley Stahl the harrowing physical and psychological abuses he says Hamas perpetrated upon its captives, from branding to rape, as well as the traumas that people on both sides of the border war are experiencing.

The Telegraph: Defence deal with Finland will give US access to 15 military bases on Russian border 
The US will gain access to 15 military bases along the border with Russia under a defence deal to be signed with Finland next week.

The treaty must be approved by Finland’s parliament.

Daily Mail:  U.S. enters 2024 with its smallest military in over 80 years as active-duty troop numbers sink to less than 1.3 million and all branches except Space Force MISS recruiting goals and Pentagon issue 'national call of service' to Gen Z 
* Pentagon officials say recruitment is more difficult than it used to be 
* Military says a 'national call to service' is needed 
* Active-duty numbers have not been so low since 1941 
The United States is set to enter 2024 with its smallest military in more than eight decades and faces one of its 'greatest challenges' as it tries to boost recruiting from Gen Z, Pentagon officials said. 
Under the $886 billion annual defense bill passed by Congress this week total active-duty troop numbers will fall to 1,284,500 next year. 
That is the lowest total since before the U.S. entered the Second World War in 1941 and officials said there should be a 'national call to service'.

Moscow Times: In Photos: FSB Veterans' Group Releases Hyper-Militarized, Pro-War 2024 Calendar 
As Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears the two-year mark, an unofficial calendar for the Federal Security Service (FSB) offers an extreme vision for 2024. 
From President Vladimir Putin's biceps rippling under a tight black T-shirt to a Russian soldier storming the U.S. Capitol, limits to this calendar's imagination do not exist. 
In its other images, which heavily romanticize the Russian military, soldiers can be seen holding children, women and Cheburashka. 
The calendar's content offers a glimpse into the hyper-militarized, pro-war imagery that has shaped many Russians' outlooks, and comes amid historic lows in relations with the West over the war in Ukraine.

Politico:  US weighs strike options to deter Houthis from more Red Sea attacks 
The Biden administration has been reluctant to respond militarily against the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in recent weeks for fear of provoking Iran. 
Top Biden administration officials are actively weighing options to strike back at Houthis in Yemen after the Iran-backed group launched new attacks on naval and commercial ships in the Red Sea on Saturday, according to two U.S. officials. 
The Pentagon has in recent days moved the Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group from the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Yemen, to support a potential U.S. response to attacks, said one of the officials, both of whom were granted anonymity to speak about sensitive plans. The military has also provided options to commanders to strike the Houthis, the official said.

The world's largest shipping group, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), has announced it is diverting its ships away from the Red Sea because of an increased threat of attacks. 
French company CMA CGM took a similar step a day after Danish shipping giant Maersk and German transport company Hapag-Lloyd suspended Red Sea journeys.

The decision comes after attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

They say they are targeting ships traveling to Israel.

The increased deployments of ships and Houthi attacks come as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is slated to travel to the Middle East next week. 
American and British warships shot down over a dozen drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Saturday, the latest onslaught against naval vessels and commercial shipping in the Red Sea by the Iranian-led group. 
The Carney, a U.S. destroyer, intercepted 14 “one-way attack drones” according to the U.S. Central Command while the British destroyer HMS Diamond, newly arrived in the region to bolster protection of commercial shipping, also shot down a Houthi drone.

CNN: Analysis: Ukraine has had a terrible week. Blame the US and the EU 
Ukraine is developing a “drowning not waving” problem. It is struggling to say clearly how badly the war is going.

Giving a candid public assessment of how poorly a conflict is going can be an unwise move as it can result in morale and support draining. After Obama boosted troops in Afghanistan, public support declined over the years, in part because of a lack of realism about how the war was going. 
Ukraine’s acutely bad presentation of its troubles is mostly due to the myopia of its allies. 
The lack of understanding in parts of US Congress is breathtaking. A congressman this week suggested Ukraine should name a finite price tag and a specific, simple goal. It’s staggering after two American wars of choice in two decades, costing trillions of dollars, that congressional memories are so short, and comprehension so limited.

How many casualties has Ukraine suffered?

How many causalities has Russia suffered? 

 
Estimates of Ukrainians killed in action (KIA) range from a low of just over 30,000 to a high of over 400,000. 
Obviously, these two estimates can’t be reconciled. And it really, really matters to the people of Ukraine which one is closer to the truth. While 30,000 deaths is tragic, anything approaching 400,000 KIA and the accompanying hundreds of thousands of causalities is a humanitarian catastrophe that makes talks of continuing offensive operations next year, or even believing in a stalemate, wishful thinking that will result in even more fruitless Ukrainian deaths.

The tactical advantages that various U.S. precision munitions brought to Ukraine have been eroded by enemy jamming, the U.S. Army commander in charge of those efforts said Tuesday. 
Jamming of some of “our more precise capabilities is a challenge,” said Lt. Gen. Antonio Aguto, speaking via video link from Europe at an event organized by the Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical. 
Since December 2022, Aguto has led Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, the umbrella organization for coordinating allied military aid to Ukraine.

Bullrich said four security forces—the Federal Police, the Gendarmerie, the Naval Prefecture, and the Airport Security Police—will work together to stop protests that block streets and suggested the protocol is aimed only at ensuring "that people can live in peace" without demonstrators blocking traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French actor Gerard Depardieu's Legion d'Honneur medal is under review following a string of allegations about sexual aggression and a TV documentary in which he was heard making lewd comments about women. 
French Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak said on France 5 television she had asked the "grande chancellerie" committee in charge of the Legion d'Honneur - France's highest decoration - to start a disciplinary procedure to review whether the medal should be suspended or withdrawn.
Abdul Malak said she was "disgusted" by comments made by Depardieu, one of France's most famous actors, during a 2018 trip to North Korea and broadcast in a "Complement d'Enquete" TV documentary on France 2 earlier this month.
"Shocking comments ... bringing shame on France," she said. Depardieu has been the focus of a string of accusations of sexism and sexual violence in recent years.
In March 2022, a Paris court ruled it would press ahead with an investigation into Depardieu after an actress accused him of rape. Charlotte Arnould had revealed that she was the woman behind the accusation, saying that she could not bear to remain silent any longer. Since then, more than 10 women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence.
Depardieu, through his lawyer, has previously "firmly rejected" the accusations.
In an Oct. 2 letter published in French daily Le Figaro, Depardieu denied all blame.
"Never, absolutely never, have I abused a woman," he wrote. Depardieu has starred in scores of French-language movies, rising to prominence in 1974 with "Going Places", and gaining international recognition with a starring role in the 1990 English-language comedy "Green Card". He won a Golden Globe best actor award for that role.
His performance in the French-language "Cyrano de Bergerac" that same year won him the award for best male performance at the Cannes film festival, and a nomination in the best leading actor category at the 1990 Academy Awards.

Angelo Becciu, 75, a former advisor to Pope Francis who was once considered a papal contender himself, is the most senior clergyman in the Catholic Church to face a Vatican criminal court.
He and nine other defendants, including financiers, lawyers and ex-Vatican employees, are facing a string of accusations, from fraud, embezzlement and money laundering to extortion, corruption and abuse of office.
They all deny the charges.
At the heart of the trial is the 350-million-euro ($380-million) purchase of a luxury property in London, as part of an investment that began in 2014 and ended up cos…]]></summary>

The decision is one in a number of legal cases brought by Harry against British media, with which the Duke of Sussex has long had a turbulent relationship.
High Court Justice Timothy Fancourt ruled in favour of Harry in 15 of the 33 sample articles that the prince submitted as evidence in his lawsuit against MGN, which publishes the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People.
He concluded that the newspapers carried out "extensive" phone hacking of celebrities between 2006 and 2011, even when a public inquiry into the conduct of the British press was ongoing.

Axios: U.S. warns Houthis to stop attacks in Red Sea 
The Biden administration has sent messages to the Houthi rebels in Yemen via several channels recently warning them to stop their attacks on ships in the Red Sea and against Israel, two U.S. officials said.

 
Why it matters: The Houthi attacks have created tensions in the region and are posing a growing threat to ships navigating one of the region's main commercial shipping routes.

 
Driving the news: Since the Israel-Hamas war started, the Houthis have launched more than 70 drones and ballistic missiles towards Israel, which is more than 1,000 miles away from Yemen, the IDF said.

Daily Mail:  Trump will be BLOCKED from pulling U.S. out of NATO in second term after Congress passes bill to stop any future president leaving key military alliance without Senate approval 
* A provision in the National Defense Authorization Act would bar former President Donald Trump from pulling the U.S. out of NATO 
* Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine tucked the language into the just-passed $886 billion defense bill 
* Trump has discussed, if reelected next year, pulling the U.S. out of NATO because he believes allies aren't ponying up enough defense dollars 
A provision tucked in the National Defense Authorization Act would bar former President Donald Trump from unilaterally pulling the U.S. out of NATO, should he be reelected next fall. 
A bipartisan team of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine inserted the provision in the $886 billion defense bill, which passed the House of Representatives on Thursday. 
The Senate passed its version Wednesday evening and President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report from CNN, U.S. intelligence officials are searching for a missing file containing highly sensitive information about Russia as well as information about Russian interference in the 2016 election.
As the report notes, the fact that the file, also containing intel compiled by NATO allies can't be found and was last seen in the possession of former president Donald Trump. That has both senior U.S. intel officials and European allies concerned.
According to CNN, "The intelligence was so sensitive that lawmakers and congressional aides with top-secret security clearances were able to review the material only at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, where their work scrutinizing it was itself kept in a locked safe."
"The binder was last seen at the White House during Trump’s final days in office. The former president had ordered it brought there so he could declassify a host of documents related to the FBI’s Russia investigation," CNN is reporting. "Under the care of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, the binder was scoured by Republican aides working to redact the most sensitive information so it could be declassified and released publicly."
According to the report, just before Joe Biden was to be inaugurated, Meadows took a redacted copy back to the Justice Department, but since then, the unredacted files have been missing.
"US officials repeatedly declined to discuss any government efforts to locate the binder or confirm that any intelligence was missing," CNN is reporting. "The binder was not among the classified items found in last year’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a US official familiar with the matter, who said the FBI was not looking specifically for intelligence related to Russia when it obtained a search warrant for the former president’s residence last year."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
