        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANU Political Scientist Dr Charles Miller says it is “imperative” for the US Republican Party to unite as they remain divided over Kevin McCarthy’s bid for House speaker amid his tenth ballot loss.

“The Republican party is divided between individuals like Mr McCarthy who try and talk the Trumpist populist talk, versus people like Boebert or Gatez who at least appear to be true believers in the Trumpist creed,” Dr Miller told Sky News Australia.

“If the Republicans keep behaving like this, then it will hurt them with the election, they do appear chaotic and unable to do the most basic things when they are in power.

“If things continue in this vein we could be in for a bumpy ride, especially when we’re talking about things that matter for the rest of the world.”]]></summary>

Joe Biden and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz have agreed to send infantry fighting vehicles to help Ukraine fight Russia, a day after France said it would supply its own armoured vehicles to Kyiv in an attempt to create a breakthrough in the 10-month war. 
The joint announcement followed a phone call between Biden and Scholz and amounts to a step change in western military support for Ukraine, which has asked for up to 700 armoured vehicles to help force the Russians out.

Grey Zone Ethics: A Practitioners Guide to Making Ethically Difficult Decisions
A new book from Small Wars Journal contributor, Dan Pace.  It is a followup to his journal article "A House Divided: A Look at SOF Values"
The special operations community has an ethics problem. While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn't preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community's treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set.  Grey Zone Ethics provides an accessible and realistic solution to this problem.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to impose a 36-hour ceasefire on the Ukrainian frontline, beginning on Friday. 
The ceasefire, scheduled to start at 12:00 Moscow time (09:00 GMT), will coincide with the Russian Orthodox Christmas. 
Mr Putin asked Ukraine to reciprocate, but Kyiv quickly rejected the request. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the truce was an attempt to stop his country's military advances. 
The Kremlin statement appeared to stress that President Putin ordered his troops to stop fighting not because he was de-escalating - Putin never de-escalates - but because he had listened to an appeal from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
Patriarch Kirill had, earlier in the day, called for a Christmas truce to allow believers to attend church services for Orthodox Christmas.

WNU Editor: Cannot say that I am surprised by this rejection from the Ukraine government. In a way this ceasefire call was a trap. The optics of rejecting a Christmas truce is never good.

Politico:  Why China’s new foreign minister could be a problem for Biden 
Qin Gang’s cooperation could decide the outcome of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s looming China trip. 
The Biden administration shut out outgoing Chinese ambassador Qin Gang for much of his more than 500-day tenure in Washington, D.C.  But that all changed last week when Chinese leader Xi Jinping appointed Qin as the country’s new foreign minister, creating a headache for the administration at a time of high tension between Washington and Beijing. 
The problems will be front and center in the coming weeks when Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits China as the countries clash over trade, Chinese military intimidation of Taiwan and access to technology.

WNU Editor: How Chinese ambassador Qin Gang was treated by the West does not surprise me. I have seen this type of treatment directed at Chinese officials and diplomats by Western officials and politicians for decades.

The Washington DC elite should be kicking themselves. They lost a golden opportunity.]]></summary>

Taiwan News: Swiss firm sends Taiwan's 'carrier killer' devices to China for repairs 
Concerns arise after theodolites used with Hsiung Feng III were sent to China for repairs by Leica Geosystems 
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Concerns have been voiced by Taiwanese media that information could have been leaked after devices used with Taiwan's "Carrier Killer" missiles were sent to China for repairs. 
Amid growing Chinese military threat, Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) has developed the Hsiung-Feng III (雄風三型) anti-ship missile, which has been nicknamed the "Carrier Killer" due to its supersonic speed, range of up to 400 km, and 225 kg warhead. However, Mirror Media on Wednesday (Jan. 4), cited sources as saying theodolites used to calibrate the missiles were sent by a Swiss company to China to make repairs due to malfunctions, potentially exposing sensitive data from missile tests and endangering Taiwan's national security.

(Bloomberg) -- Germany is open to using billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild as long as legal issues can be resolved and allies follow suit. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government supports Ukraine’s demand for war reparations but hasn’t yet taken an official position on seizing assets from the Russian state. The issue is complex and some parts of the ruling coalition are more ardent than others, according to people familiar with the discussions. 
The internal tensions reflect the international community’s broader struggle to forge a common position. If Berlin can resolve its own issues, it could provide fresh momentum for discussions in the European Union and put pressure on the US to seize assets, such as central bank reserves, that have been frozen in retaliation over Russia’s invasion.

The Diplomat:  Philippines, China Agree on Measures to Manage Maritime Disputes 
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Xi Jinping agreed to restart joint oil and gas exploration and set up a direct channel of communication on South China Sea issues. 
China is ready to manage its maritime issues with the Philippines “cordially,” China President Xi Jinping reportedly said yesterday, after meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Beijing. 
Citing Chinese state media, Reuters reported today that Xi also told Marcos that China is willing to resume negotiations over the joint exploration of oil and gas resources in non-disputed areas of the South China Sea, cooperate with the Philippines on solar and wind energy, and increase imports of Philippine fishery products.

WNU Editor: This summit is producing some surprising results. For example. I did not expect both sides to come to an agreement where they will work together on joint oil and gas exploration projects in the South China Sea. 
But like everything else when it comes to China. What they say and what they do can sometimes be two different things.

All the dumb Russians are dead.” So said Ukrainian officials in July 2022 as they sought to explain why the Russian army had abandoned the overambitious strategy and amateurish tactics that defined its conduct in the early weeks of the war. It was probably too early to make this quip. The Russians continued to do many dumb things and indeed still do. But broadly speaking, the Ukrainians’ intuition in the summer now appears correct: when it comes to overall military strategy, Moscow seems to have gotten smarter.

Reuters: Ukraine to get more armoured vehicles but presses for tanks to fight Russia 
KYIV (Reuters) -Western allies moved toward supplying armoured battle vehicles to Ukraine but not the heavier tanks it has requested to fight Russia, while Washington predicted intense combat would continue for months on the eastern frontline. 
French President Emmanuel Macron told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help its war effort, a French official said on Wednesday after a phone call between them. 
While the official said these would be the first Western armoured vehicles delivered to Ukraine, Australia said in October that it had given Kyiv 90 of its Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles, an armoured unit that is hardened against landmines, small arms fire and other threats.

   Newsweek: Belarus Sign Calls For 'All Male Citizens' To Attend Enlistment Office 
A video of an electronic announcement at a bus terminal in Belarus calling for males of military age to go to an enlistment center has led to speculation over whether mobilization could take place in the country whose leader is Vladimir Putin's close ally. 
The appeal appears on digital signage hanging on the first-floor balcony of the waiting room at the transport hub in the city of Barysau (Barysaw), located in the Minsk region, around 45 miles northeast of the capital city.

Update: WATCH: Belarusian citizens reportedly being called to military enlistment offices after Russian aircraft spotted leaving Belarus (Euroweekly)   
WNU Editor: Belarus has been undergoing a number of exercises in the past few months. They have also been telling all males to register at a recruitment office on where they live, how they can be contacted, etc.. I think (and hope) this is what this message is all about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: World Health Organization warns XBB.1.5 is the 'most transmissible' Covid variant yet — as figures show strain makes up 70% of cases in Northeast US 
* But there are no signs XBB.1.5 is more deadly than previously dominant variants 
* Strain is behind four in 10 infections nationally in US - up from 4% a month ago 
* WHO said today: 'We are concerned about its growth advantage in particular' 
A Covid strain spreading rapidly in the US is the 'most transmissible subvariant that has been detected yet', according to the World Health Organization. 
But XBB.1.5 appears to be just as mild as its ancestor Omicron strains, with hotspots in Northeast America yet to record an uptick in hospital admissions. 
The new subvariant - another spinoff of Omicron -  is behind roughly 70 percent of new infections in the worst affected parts of the US and four in 10 nationally.

Quartz: This chart explains why the US is running low on missiles  
American defense contractors can't keep pace as Ukraine drains stockpile. 
 It’s boom times for US defense contractors—and they can’t keep up with demand.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and China’s military build-up have US lawmakers shelling out billions to buy new missiles, aircraft, tanks and helicopters to support allies and prepare for future conflict. Including the most recent tranche of funding passed in December, Congress has enacted about $110 billion in aid to Ukraine, about $40 billion of which will go toward weapons transfers and purchases. 
That’s putting stress on the makers of modern weaponry. Consider that some 1,600 Stinger missiles, used by individual soldiers to attack aircraft, were sent to Ukraine from American stockpiles, but the US stopped making them in 2003. Raytheon, its manufacturer, has restarted production, but doesn’t expect to deliver the weapons in large numbers for a year or more.

DW: North Korean arms development puts Asia on edge in 2023 
The regime in Pyongyang has started 2023 by threatening South Korea and announcing plans for more capable ballistic missiles and a larger nuclear arsenal. 
North Korea has begun 2023 with a series of missile launches and leader Kim Jong Un vowing to increase production of nuclear weapons and develop improved intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), according to statements carried by state-run news agency KCNA. 
Kim has also declared that South Korea is the North's "undoubted enemy" and "hell-bent on an impudent and dangerous arms build-up." 
South Korea has lived in the shadow of aggression from its northern neighbor since the 1950s. However, analysts have said the current threats and provocations emerging from Pyongyang should be a cause for deep concern.

Reuters: Poland says Germany refused talks on World War Two reparations 
WARSAW (Reuters) -Germany has rebuffed the latest push by Poland's nationalist government for vast reparations over World War Two, saying in response to a diplomatic note that the issue was closed, the foreign ministry in Warsaw said on Tuesday. 
A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said it had responded to a letter sent by Poland on the subject in October and did not comment on the contents of diplomatic correspondence. 
Poland estimates its World War Two losses caused by Germany at 6.2 trillion zlotys ($1.4 trillion) and has demanded reparations, but Berlin has repeatedly said all financial claims related to the war have been settled.

A 97-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has filed an appeal against the guilty verdict she was given for her role in the deaths that took place at her place of work during World War II.
The appeal means that Germany's highest criminal court, the Federal Court of Justice, has to examine whether a procedural error was made.
"The verdict is thus not legally binding," the lower court in Itzehoe in northern Germany said on Wednesday.
Identified only as Irmgard F under German privacy laws, she was found guilty on December 20 of complicity in more than 10,500 cases of murder and given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in northern Germany.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is "very sick", his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis' announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden "worsening" of his health.
"I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church," Francis said in Wednesday's surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.

Its promoters reckon it is revolutionizing human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.
Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
The European Union is likely to pass legislation next year -- the AI Act -- aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
Looming large in the debates has been China's use of biometric data, facial recognition and other technology to build a powerful system of control.

Uruguay, a country where horses are not considered food but companions, has seen a rise in equine meat exports, prompting efforts to rescue horses destined for slaughter.
In 2020, the small South American nation was the seventh-largest exporter of horse meat, according to the OEC economic data site, with Belgium, Russia, France and Japan among the top importers.
Most of Uruguay's tens of thousands of race, sports and work horses end up on someone's plate somewhere else in the world after they become injured, old, or their owners simply cannot care for them anymore.

Yellow-band disease -- named for the colour it turns corals before destroying them -- was first spotted decades ago and has caused widespread damage to reefs in the Caribbean. There is no known cure.
But it was detected for the first time off Thailand's eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's inauguration will be secured by "100 percent" of the capital district's police force, an official said Tuesday amid widespread fears of violence.
Over the weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly placing explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia's airport, hoping to sow "chaos" ahead of the inauguration Sunday.
The suspect was a supporter of Brazil's outgoing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and told authorities he wanted to "prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil" under leftist Lula.
The device did not explode.
On Sunday "there will be a mobilization of 100 percent of the police forces of the Federal District (of Brasilia) to ensure the safety not only of the president, but also of foreign delegations and the public," Lula's future security minister Flavio Dino told reporters.
Lula backers have expressed fear on social media of riots or attacks on inauguration day, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend events in Brasilia.
But Dino sought to give assurances the event will be "safe" and "peaceful," encouraging Brazilians to turn out to celebrate.
He added there had been "no change" to plans for the ceremony, in response to speculation that Lula might do his inauguration parade in a closed car instead of the traditional vintage convertible.
After Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9 percent of the vote in a runoff election in October, supporters of the vanquished president blocked roads and demonstrated outside military barracks demanding the armed forces prevent Lula's inauguration.
On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators clashed with the police and set fire to buses and cars in Brasilia.
"Small terrorist and extremist groups will not put the institutions of Brazilian democracy up against a wall," said Dino.
Bolsonaro, who has limited his public appearances after the defeat, has not confirmed that he will follow the tradition of handing over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday's ceremony.

Co-founded by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) cyber chief Yaron Rosen, Toka "sells technologies that allow clients to locate security cameras or even webcams within a given perimeter, hack into them, watch their live feed, and even alter it—and past recordings," Haaretzreported, citing internal documents it obtained and reviewed with a technical expert.

The death of the UK’s Queen Elizabeth II spelled the end of an era, and a brave new protest movement emerged in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini. FRANCE 24 takes a look at the top news stories of 2022.'
Russia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe 
Early in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion. But Russia meets a tougher resistance than expected. And after a failed attempt to take the capital Kyiv, the Russian …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. 
A friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov's death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have "consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles."
Antov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. 
From the BBC: "Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war."

Kuleba suggested the summit could be mediated by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, a vocal advocate of diplomatic talks to end an invasion that has killed thousands of civilians, devastated Ukraine's infrastructure, and sparked a massive humanitarian crisis.

More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago -- they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 -- before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding program, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as "vulnerable", with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild -- with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand's wild wetlands.

Ron DeSantis
Will Donald Trump's former apprentice, popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis, turn on his one-time mentor by challenging him for the Republican nomination for president?
Trump is already gearing up for a potential battle with his MAGA (Make America Great Again) disciple, whose stock has soared among Republicans.
DeSantis won a landslide re-election in November's midterms, in which Trump loyalists fared badly. The property mogul has coined a nickname for the self-styled anti-woke warrior: "Ron de Sanctimonious".

When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia's threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine.
"We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis" in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.
And on the year that humanity welcomed its eighth billion member, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the planet was on a "highway to climate hell."

The 100-million-euro ($106,000-million) "Genesis" project hopes to have a product ready by 2030.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Monday that the company is now close to having 100 active Starlinks, the firm's satellite internet service, in Iran, three months after he tweeted he would activate the service there amid protests around the Islamic country.
Musk said, "approaching 100 starlinks active in Iran", in a tweet on Monday.
The billionaire had said in September that he would activate Starlink in Iran as part of a U.S.-backed effort "to advance internet freedom and the free flow of information" to Iranians.
The satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the government's restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms amid protests around the country.
The Islamic Republic has been engulfed in protests that erupted after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for wearing "unsuitable attire".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.
Following his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.
"The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset," parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.
Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel's history.
While the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Both live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.
Netanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.
However, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.
His incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.

China's management of COVID-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.
Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China's economy, fuelling last month the mainland's biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
