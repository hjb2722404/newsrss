Reuters: Lockheed Martin Profits More From War Than Any Other Company on Earth 
With such horrifying images from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any winners, but there are those who profit from the war, specifically military contractors. U.S. military aid for Ukraine and nearby countries has reached $3.75 billion. Almost all U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are from our stockpiles and will have to be replaced. This means a huge check to companies making military hardware and software. Lockheed Martin Corp is the largest U.S. defense contractor and the domestic company that profits the most from war. 
The financial opportunity for Lockheed Martin and other large contractors is vast. America’s defense budget will be over $800 billion this year. (Here’s how Ukraine’s newly bolstered tank army compares to Russia’s.) 
Lockheed Martin employs 116,000 people. The company reported a total of $66 billion in revenue in 2022 and a profit of $5.7 billion. It has a backlog of orders that stands at $150 billion. Last year, it was No. 55 on the Fortune 500.

Stamford is the only school in Hong Kong to offer students a comprehensive industry mentorship experience linked to portfolio-building projects to guide students through their final years of secondary education. Whether graduating from Stamford through the IBDP pathway or other diploma options, students leave Stamford as graduates who have already made a mark in the world.    Here are three of the most popular choices from the current 11 Cornerstones Program project options, with more to come in the 2023/2024 academic year.  University Level Engineering As a school focusing heavily on STEMinn (science, technology, engineering, math, and innovation), it is no surprise that one of the most popular offerings is Hong Kong's own TramPlus. Although the iconic "Ding Ding" has a long history, the company is heavily focused on the future, allowing students to get a taste of professional engineering to create the next generation of tram cars. Senior HKUST engineering students and EdTEch and Gifted Education expert Joseph Lin lead the program, which offers high school students a scaled-down version of the HKUST foundation program for first-year engineering. Before embarking on critical Grade 11 and Grade 12 course selections, students experience life as engineers by using the design process and building on existing STEMinn knowledge to ideate and construct prototypes, develop alternatives, select a solution, and refine until the final presentation.

Politico: EU looks to dedicate €1B to howitzer shells for Ukraine 
Europe wants to ensure its funds are specifically channeled to the artillery rounds that Ukraine desperately needs to fight Russia. 
BRUSSELS — In a new blueprint for military support to Ukraine, the European Union will propose that €1 billion should be specifically dedicated to ammunition, particularly 155mm artillery shells, according to a document seen by POLITICO. 
The EU is helping supply Ukraine with arms through an off-budget, inter-governmental cash pot called the European Peace Facility, which is used to reimburse countries that export arms to Ukraine. So far, the facility has disbursed €3.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine, with member countries deciding last December to increase its funding by €2 billion in 2023.

WNU Editor: The expectation is that this plan to ramp up artillery production will be approved during a summit in Brussels on March 23-24.

The Intercept: Pentagon Developed Contingency Plan for War With Iran 
In January, the U.S. and Israel conducted the largest joint military exercise in history. 
The U.S. military allocated spending for secret contingency operations pertaining to an Iran war plan, according to a classified Pentagon budget manual listing emergency and special programs reviewed by The Intercept. 
The contingency plan, code-named “Support Sentry,” was funded in 2018 and 2019, according to the manual, which was produced for the 2019 fiscal year. It classifies Support Sentry as an Iran “CONPLAN,” or concept plan, a broad contingency plan for war which the Pentagon develops in anticipation of a potential crisis.

Update #1: US Established ‘Contingency Plan’ for War With Iran, New Report Finds (Sputnik)  
Update #2: US funded ‘Iran war plan’ in support of Israel’s anti-Iran saber-rattling: Report (Press TV)   
WNU Editor: Can't say that I am surprised that the Pentagon has a contingency plan to wage war against Iran. Many countries around the world have plans to wage war against countries that are perceived as enemies, the U.S. included. But what is surprising about this plan is that the Intercept was able to obtain this classified Pentagon budget manual listing these emergency and special programs.]]></summary>

Sputnik: Medvedev: Delivery of NATO Aircraft to Kiev Will Mean Alliance's War Against Russia 
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The delivery of NATO aircraft to Ukraine and their maintenance on the territory of the alliance will be a direct entry of NATO into the war against Russia, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday. 
Since the 1920s, there has been an understanding that a country can be recognized as a participant in hostilities if, in addition to supplying weapons, it trains personnel to use them, Medvedev recalled. 
"This is how it is happening today: Canadian and German instructors in the EU are already teaching Ukrainian killers how to handle Leopards," Medvedev said on Telegram.

   Zero Hedge: NBC Reporter Goes To Crimea, Shocks Viewers By Telling The Truth 
Mainstream media correspondents for major US networks rarely, if ever, report from inside Crimea and certainly are nowhere near Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine. However, this week NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons went to Sevastopol, surrounded by a significant Russian military presence given it is home to the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet, and in a live segment admitted that it's not at all realistic Zelensky and Ukrainian forces can ever hope to take Crimea. 
This is especially as the "the people there... view themselves as Russian." Simmons noted that "This is the closest that any US news crew has got to the Russian Black Sea Fleet in many many years." He explained that "Vladimir Putin will be determined to defend that port - to not have it take it away from him - he may well do pretty much anything to try to achieve that."

WNU Editor:I have been to Crimea many times. I have friends in Crimea. Once even thought that Crimea would be a great place to retire (after Odessa). NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons' observations are spot on. The NBC report is here .... A view from Crimea, the Russian-annexed territory Ukraine is hoping to seize back (NBC).]]></summary>

New policies expand transgender procedures to the service academies, allow gender transitions while on-duty, and mandate group shower facility use by both biological sexes if certain administrative requirements are met. Oh, and military commanders are responsible to “not accommodate biases against transgender individuals” 
As RealClear Defense recently reported, on December 20, 2022 the Department of Defense issued an update to DOD Instruction 1300.28, entitled “In-Service Transition for Transgender Service Members,” which “expanded woke transgender mandates in significant ways.”
The article compares the original instruction, issued in the waning days of the Obama administration in October 2016, to the current expansion, with the aide of a study and summary compiled by the Center for Military Readiness (CMR).
Significantly, the CMR study and summary explain the significance of  the changes, which fall into six major areas, and which were issued  “without public debate”:

B92: No manpower, no weapons... And Berlin would fall  
New German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Monday that Germany's military is not ready to defend the country if it is attacked.  
"We do not have armed forces capable of defending the country against a brutal offensive and an aggressive war," he said, during a meeting with members of his Social Democratic Party (SPD). 
According to him, Germany's Bundeswehr armed forces are undermanned thanks to decades of neglect by the federal government. Therefore, he believes that Germany will have to invest much more in defense in order to reach NATO standards. 
The highest-ranking officer of the Bundeswehr, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, confirmed Pistorius's words in fact, when he declared that even the 100 billion euros earmarked for the German army by Chancellor Olaf Scholz will not be enough for the Bundeswehr to be capable of waging war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources. 
The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions.

WNU Editor: The EU economy is still reeling from the sanctions they imposed on Russian resources. EU sanctions on China will create the perfect storm to not only to create shortages in many finished products that families need, but also the inflationary impact that it will have.

Global Times: PLA Navy holds 1st amphibious assault ship far sea drills in West Pacific 
The Hainan, the first Type 075 amphibious assault ship of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, recently joined a flotilla and conducted a far sea exercise in the West Pacific, marking the first time that China has held an expeditionary voyage with a warship of this type. 
Such drills displayed the vessel's high level of combat readiness and the PLA Navy's amphibious landing capabilities in carrying out traditional security missions as well as non-traditional ones like anti-terrorism and humanitarian aid, analysts said on Thursday. 
The far sea joint training flotilla under the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy recently returned to base after successfully carrying out a combat training mission in the South China Sea and the West Pacific over 30 days and across more than 9,000 nautical miles, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Thursday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Exclusive: US Air Force fires leaders for failing nuclear safety inspection 
Two US Air Force commanders and four of their subordinates at a key nuclear base in North Dakota were relieved of duty this week after their units failed an inspection designed to ensure that the nuclear weapons stockpile is safe and secure at all times, two defense officials told CNN. 
The removals occurred at Minot Air Force Base, which is the only Air Force installation that houses two legs of the “nuclear triad” – ballistic missile silos and strategic bombers. 
The officials told CNN that the six service members were relieved of duty following the failed nuclear surety inspection at the base.  The nuclear surety inspection is a pass/fail test and the results are classified. 
There is no indication that the failed inspection was related to the handling of a nuclear weapon itself. Another defense official said the failure was for “non-compliance vehicle and equipment safety inspections.”

 Update #1: Six leaders fired from Air Force nuclear base in North Dakota (Air Force Times)  
Update #2: Air Force relieves 2 commanders, 4 leaders at North Dakota nuclear bomber, missile base (FOX News).   
WNU Editor: The way these firings were handled makes me wonder if there is some psychological vetting happening within the US Air Force right now??]]></summary>

Reuters: Iran can make fissile material for a bomb 'in about 12 days' - U.S. official 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran could make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in "about 12 days," a top U.S. Defense Department official said on Tuesday, down from the estimated one year it would have taken while the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was in effect. 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl made the comment to a House of Representatives hearing when pressed by a Republican lawmaker why the Biden administration had sought to revive the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 

 "Because Iran's nuclear progress since we left the JCPOA has been remarkable. Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one bomb's worth of fissile material. Now it would take about 12 days," Kahl, the third ranking Defense Department official, told lawmakers.

Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says Ukraine will become a member of the alliance in the "long-term", but for now it needs to remain independent in the face of Russia's invasion. 
Ukraine has sought to join the US-led military alliance for years. 
After Russia's invasion of the country, President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for that request to be fast-tracked. 
Ukraine also applied for EU membership days after Russia invaded, and gained candidate status in June. 
"Nato allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective," Mr Stoltenberg told reporters during a visit to Finland's capital, Helsinki.

WNU Editor: In one statement Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg does two things. For one .... he pokes the "bear", and the Kremlin has responded .... NATO a 'distant prospect' for Ukraine – Stoltenberg (RT). And two, Ukraine continues to be strung alone with the carrot of one day becoming a NATO member, even being invited to the next NATO summit .... Stoltenberg invites Zelensky to NATO Summit in Vilnius (Ukrinform).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real Clear Politics: Sen. Chris Murphy: Reaching Critical Point Where Sending Too Many Weapons To Ukraine Could Compromise The Security Of NATO 
Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told NBC News on Tuesday that the U.S. needs to be careful not to send too much military hardware to Ukraine or it could risk compromising the security of other countries that depend on the U.S. for protection.      
NBC NEWS HOST: President Zelensky has called for F-16 fighter jets, but President Biden says he's not sending them right now. A lot of your colleagues on Capitol Hill say that is the wrong move. They say the administration is giving President Zelensky enough aid to stay in the war but not to win the war. What say you? Should the Biden administration provide the F-16 fighter jets?

WNU Editor: Bottom line. Ukraine will not get any F-16s, and maybe other weapons will be limited.

Reuters: Zelenskiy Fires a Top Ukrainian Military Commander, No Reason Given 
(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday fired a senior military commander helping lead the fight against Russian troops in the country's embattled east but gave no reason for the move. 
In a one-line decree, Zelenskiy announced the dismissal of Eduard Moskalyov as commander of the joint forces of Ukraine, which are engaged in battles in the Donbas region. 
Zelenskiy mentioned Moskalyov in a daily address on Friday when listing the military commanders he had spoken to. 
Moskalyov had been in the post since March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine.  Neither the joint forces' Facebook nor Twitter accounts made any mention of the dismissal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lack of women nominees was a talking point on Friday at the Cesar Awards, France's answer to the Oscars, despite the top prize going to a film focusing on femicide.
Best Film went to "The Night of the 12th", a thriller based on the true story of a young woman's murder. 
There was a spot of Hollywood glitz thanks to a surprise cameo by Brad Pitt, presenting David Fincher (who directed him in "Fight Club" and "Seven") with a lifetime achievement award. 
But there was a lot of focus on the lack of female nominees, with no women up for best director -- indeed, none have won the award since 2000 (Tonie Marshall for "Venus Beauty Institute").
The only woman filmmaker whose movie was in the running for best film was Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, sister of France's former first lady and singer Carla…]]></summary>

It was the first commemoration of the uprising since Marcos Jr took office in June 2022. He has praised his father's 20-year regime, which critics describe as a dark period of human rights abuses and corruption that left the country impoverished.
As leftist rock music blared over a loudspeaker, hundreds of protesters, including survivors of the elder Marcos's martial law crackdown that led to the killing, torture and imprisonment of thousands of political foes and critics, marched on the "People Power" monument in Manila in memory of the brutal era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US First Lady Jill Biden arrived in Kenya on Friday, kicking off a visit aimed at focusing attention on the worst drought to hit the Horn of Africa in decades.
Five straight seasons of poor rainfall have killed millions of livestock, destroyed crops and left some 22 million people at risk of hunger in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, with a sixth season also forecast to fail.
Biden travelled to Kenya from Namibia, part of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent, which has become a renewed diplomatic battleground following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.
The first senior White House official to travel to the region since her husband President Joe Biden came to power, the 71-year-old community college professor's visit will also focus on the empowerment of women and youth.

The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Biden said his country was "all in" on the hotly courted continent.
During her visit to Namibia, Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies.
"We're committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners," Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek on Thursday.
This is Biden's first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

But, as Nigerians head to the polls for Saturday's presidential election, although the aroma of spices and the cacophony of hawkers selling their wares still filled the air, there is barely a customer in sight.
"There's no business at the market. We've all just been sitting here since the morning," said market trader Ishola as she sat outside her stall selling beads and jewelry. "There's no people. Do you see anybody around? Nobody."
Across the street, another trader, named Kabiru, sat looking forlorn behind a case of unsold watches.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Friday to do everything to defeat Russia this year, as the first Leopard tanks arrived in Ukraine on the anniversary of the start of Europe's largest conflict since World War II.
Street protests against the Russian invasion were held in many European capitals to mark the anniversary, and fresh Western sanctions targeted Russia's banks, military industry and semiconductor access.
Meanwhile, the Group of Seven industrialised nations threatened embargo busters with "severe costs".

Wilson is a scathing critic of the MAGA movement, and the affinity that so many MAGA Republicans have for Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of the reasons why he holds Trumpism in such low regard.
It was a year ago, on February 24, 2022, that Russian forces acting on orders from Putin launched a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. That war has brought the worst fighting in Europe since World War 2, yet Putin's admirers in the MAGA movement haven…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan's military said it alerted aviation authorities after spotting a balloon floating in its airspace Friday, one week after the self-ruled island found remnants of what was believed to be a crashed Chinese meteorological instrument.
According to its initial analysis, the air force said the object in "northern airspace" on Friday afternoon was for meteorological and scientific research purposes.
"As it could affect aviation safety, we have notified the aviation control units to remind air planes to beware," the air force statement said.
"We will continue to monitor until the target disappears."
The statement did not say where the balloon came from or provide a more detailed location.
The sighting comes after an order by President Joe Biden to shoot down what the United States has since called a "sophisticated high-altitude spying vehicle" that sparked the latest row between Washington and Beijing.
US officials said it was part of a fleet allegedly floating around the globe, while China has said the balloon was an errant weather observation aircraft with no military purpose. Both sides have since accused each other of espionage.
Taiwan, a self-governed democracy claimed by China, said last week that it had found the remains of a suspected Chinese meteorological balloon and would increase patrols at military facilities.
Taiwan's defence ministry revealed on February 14 that Chinese balloons have previously flown over the island, without providing details on the number or frequency.
At that time, the ministry said it would shoot down any targets that pose a "high level of threat", but added that it had not encountered any such threats.
Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure in recent years on Taiwan, which China has vowed to seize one day, by force if necessary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential term, provisional data showed Friday.
Surveillance satellites had detected 209 square kilometers (80.6 square miles) of forest destroyed,, according to the INPE space research institute's DETER monitoring system.
This is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.
The INPE report included data only up to February 17, but was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.
Last month, Amazon deforestation was down 61 percent from a year earlier, according to the same source.
But experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a "reversal" of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.
The February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.
Over Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade.
Bolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.
Having previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula took office on January 1 this year with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro.
He has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.
In order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Villagers in Cramant in France's Champagne are being treated to a rare sight: little pigs grubbing around the vines that produce the region's famed bubbly, an alternative to chemical or mechanical means of fighting weeds and pests.
Originally from New Zealand, the "kunekune" pigs -- a Maori word meaning "round and fat" -- snuffle through the earth supporting neatly planted rows of grapevines.
Their "thorough" and "precise" work can fight weeds as well as mildew and other fungi and aerate the soil, says wine industry consultant Olivier Zebic.
First tested last year in the Bordeaux wine-growing region, the pigs may be a better choice than the other eco-friendly solution, sheep -- who "just trim" unwanted plants, Zebic adds.
By contrast, the kunekune turn over "every clod of grass and even ea…]]></summary>

Here, they call it "yage" and consume it for health and wisdom.
"God once lived here on this planet", recounts Isidro Lucitante, the patriarch and shaman of nine Indigenous Cofan Avie families spread over 55,000 hectares of river and jungle along the border with Colombia.
This god "pulled out one of his hairs and planted it on the Earth. Thus was born the yage, source of knowledge and wisdom," the 63-year-old, his face painted in striking animal motifs, told AFP.
Extracted from the "Banisteriopsis caapi" vine that has grown in the Amazon for thousands of years, ayahuasca has also gained a reputation in the outside world.

The celebrated director's first foray into opera started out as a look back at a painful chapter in her country's history through Khaled Hosseini's story of two women whose lives are marked by the Taliban's brutal and repressive rule in the 1990s.
But the surge back to power of the hardline Islamists in August 2021 brought the story roaring back to the present for Afghan women.
And it added new weight to the production, as the Taliban again placed an ever-tightening vice on women's liberties, despite vowing a departure from their infamous first reign.

Critics said the award showed Macron really was "the president of the rich" as he is regularly labelled by members of the opposition.
Macron's office on Friday confirmed a press report from a day earlier, saying Bezos had been given the Legion d'Honneur (Legion of Honour), the French republic's highest award, in a small ceremony.
The event's took place on February 16, the same day hundreds of thousands of people joined strikes and protests against Macron's plan to reform the French pension system.

Three candidates, two women and a Muslim man, are vying for the position following the shock resignation of Sturgeon, the long-serving Scottish National Party (SNP) chief.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, a 32-year-old rising star in the SNP, caused controversy this week after revealing that she would have voted against same-sex marriage, had she been a member of the Scottish Parliament when the reform passed in 2014.
While she defended the stance as a matter of personal conscience, it puts Forbes strongly out of line with the SNP's centre-left base, and four high-profile supporters immediately wit…]]></summary>

The first exhibition in Saudi Arabia for the Pop Art giant is a tribute to the late artist's obsession with celebrity, and his seeming ability to predict the rise of contemporary influencer culture.
At the same time, organisers have tried to draw a connection between the world Warhol embodied –- New York City half a century ago -– and Saudi Arabia today.
"Warhol grew up through a time of radical change in America in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of a completely new vibrant youth culture, and he recorded that and reflected that," said Sumantro Ghose, arts programming director in AlUla, the Saudi town hosting the e…]]></summary>

"Otherwise it will happen next time and next time and next time." 
Popov, 42, spoke with AFP in between rehearsals ahead of Friday's concert of "Remembrance and Hope," which is cosponsored by the Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the United Nations and Lincoln Center.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko has spoken of a "tragic and psychologically exhausting" year, on the anniversary of the start of Russia's war against Ukraine.
"But we are fighting, we believe in ourselves and in our country. That is why we will overcome everything and win," he wrote on his Telegram channel on Friday, alongside a video message.
While many Ukrainians had not believed there would be a "barbaric war" by Russia, the capital had been preparing for a possible attack, he said.
"Volunteers who joined the territorial defence and our military helped to protect and hold the capital."
Russian troops advanced into the suburbs of Kiev after the war began on February 24, but did not get far.
"Kiev is the heart of Ukraine, Kiev was and remains a target of Russia, of the Russians and of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin," Klitschko told dpa in an interview on Wednesday.
At the same time, he said he did not believe Russia could succeed in a new attack on the capital. "I don't think Russia will win."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - The United States has transferred two brothers from the Guantanamo Bay U.S. detention facility in Cuba to Pakistan, bringing the total number of people held at Guantanamo down to 32, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
The Guantanamo camp was established by Republican President George W. Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.
It came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. "war on terror" because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.
There were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.
On Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.
Both were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon's website.
"The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility," the Pentagon said in a statement.
A total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.

The decision inevitably reopens questions about the future of the company’s newspapers, particularly once Rupert Murdoch is gone.

The company’s chief executive officer, Robert Thomson, said  a surge in interest rates and inflation caused the earnings decline, and that these effects were “more ephemeral than eternal”.
However, structural complications in the corporation suggest these “ephemeral” factors are only part of the problem.
“Eternal” factors – such an interesting word where Murdoch is concerned – include the performance of the tabloid newspapers that have played a pivotal role in the development of the organisation. It casts…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French police on Thursday detained for questioning the husband of a woman whose dismembered body was found in plastic bags at different locations in a popular Paris park, a source close to the investigation told AFP.
The body parts of the woman had been discovered in the Buttes-Chaumont park in the north of the French capital earlier this month.
Prosecutors told AFP that an individual had been detained in the case but warned that no further information would be made public for now.
The discovery shocked residents of the capital where the park is hugely popular with joggers and families due to its unusually hilly landscaping.
The woman, 46, had been reported missing by her husband on February 6. The pair lived in the Seine-Saint-Denis department northeast of Paris, prosecutors said.
The Le Parisien daily, which first reported his detention, said that the couple had three children and the husband had only reported her disappearance a week after she vanished.
Police investigating the disappearance had not turned up any leads until now.
Park workers found the lower torso of a woman in a plastic bag hidden under leaves and further remains, including the head, were found during a thorough search of the park by police a day later.
French channel BFMTV had reported last week that the husband had come under suspicion in the investigation after giving contradictory evidence.
Prosecutors then launched another investigation into how this information had been leaked to the channel.
Built during the major relandscaping of the French capital under Napoleon III in the 19th century, the park most recently starred as the setting for a romantic picnic in the third series of "Emily in Paris".
It has also been a popular setting for classic French films ranging from Eric Rohmer's "The Aviator's Wife" to Gaspar Noe's more recent film "Love."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Lady Jill Biden said the United States was committed to helping African nations get a louder voice at the UN and other international bodies, as she visited Namibia on Thursday.
Biden arrived in the southern African country on Wednesday in the first stop of a two-nation tour aimed at deepening ties with the continent.
"We're committed to making sure that African countries not only have a voice in organisations like the UN Security Council and G20, but that those voices are valued as equal partners," Biden said at a luncheon in Windhoek.
In the capital the 71-year-old community college professor met with President Hage Geingob and First Lady Monica Geingos. 
Africa has become a renewed diplomatic battleground, with countries aggressively courted by Russia, China and the West. 
Biden's trip is to focus on hunger in the Horn of Africa and the empowerment of women and youth.
On Friday, she will head to Kenya where she is to draw attention to the Horn of Africa's worst drought in decades, which has left more than 20 million people with acute food shortages.
The tour aims to build on the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington late last year where President Joe Biden said his country was "all in" on the hotly courted continent. 
This is Biden's first trip to Africa as the first lady of the United States.

Legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso, whose death will be commemorated for the 50th time on April 8, is the focus of this year's Madrid Contemporary Art Fair ARCO. Ricardo Rubio/EUROPA PRESS/dpa
The legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year's ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.
The 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.
A hyper-realistic replica of Picasso's "corpse," wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.
Spanish artist Eugenio Merino's sensational sculpture, entitled "Aquí murió Picasso" (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso's native city of Málaga.
Long queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.
Many visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.
Alongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.
There is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is "The Mediterranean: A Round Sea."
A total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.]]></summary>

TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is Chinese, has faced increasing Western scrutiny in recent months over fears about how much access Beijing has to user data.
The new ban also means European Commission staff cannot use the video-sharing app on personal devices including phones that have official EU communication apps installed.
Employees must remove the app as soon as possible and should do so by March 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A six-decade archive charting pop icon David Bowie's career will open in London in 2025, providing a "new source book for the Bowies of tomorrow", a museum director said Wednesday.
Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Tristram Hunt said the "incredible" collection had more than 80,000 items of Bowie memorabilia.
They range from hand-written lyrics and letters to sheet music, original costumes, photography and album artwork.
A number of instruments owned by Bowie as well as music videos, set designs and awards are also due to go on display.
Bowie, originally from south London, died in 2016 at the age of 69.
The collection will be housed at the Bowie Centre for the Study of Performing Arts, a new outpost of London's Victoria and Albert Museum.
The museum was delighted to be become "custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public", said Hunt.
"Bowie's radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style -– from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monae to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons," he added.
Bowie enjoyed an extraordinary career generating around 140 million record sales and taking in styles from glam rock to jazz, as well as stage personas such as Ziggy Stardust.
The new centre will be located at the V&A East Storehouse venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.
The museum said this had been made possible through a £10 million (around $12 million) joint donation by the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.
Bowie's estate sold the publishing rights to his "entire body of work" to Warner last year.
The centre meant his life's work was now taking its "rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses", said a spokesperson from the David Bowie Estate.
The behind-the-scenes access the new venue offers "will mean David's work can be shared with the public in ways that haven't been possible before".

Iran has been rocked by citizen outrage since the September 16 death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini following her arrest for an alleged breach of dress rules for women.

"People have also shared Instagram footage of the protests with international media outlets, many of whom can't report directly from Iran."
Protests triggered by Amini's death resulted in authorities clamping down on speech and freedom of assembly, and limiting the use of the internet and…]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
