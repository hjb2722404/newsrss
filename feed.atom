Free West Media: Polish general warns that Zelensky has nuclear weapon  
Apparently it's no longer just about tanks and fighter jets for Ukraine: According to Polish General Waldemar Skrzyptzak (67), the government in Kiev is said to have nuclear weapons once again. Other experts believe that even if they do not have such a weapon now, they'll have one soon. 
Warsaw: In an interview, one of Poland’s best-known military officers gave an analysis of where Europe might be headed in the war in Ukraine: General Waldemar Skrzyptzak said in an interview with radio station Wnet that President Zelensky’s government probably already has nuclear weapons. 
This was not absurd, explained the general: “Ukraine has officially had no nuclear weapons since the early 1990s, when it agreed to hand them over to Russia under international agreements. Now the reality could be very different.”

Bloomberg: EU Urged to Make Banks Report Size of Frozen Russian Assets 
(Bloomberg) -- The European Union should consider requiring banks to report details on the value of frozen Russian central bank assets if it wants to use sanctioned funds to help pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction, according to the bloc’s lawyers. 
The EU’s legal service said the bloc’s laws would permit it to invest the frozen assets and use the proceeds to help Kyiv, but officials must first get a handle on the scale of central bank and other sanctioned state-backed assets that have been immobilized, according to a document shared this week with member states as leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Brussels. 
 Officials have estimated that some $258 billion could be located, based on information the Bank of Russia gave in a 2022 report on its foreign exchange and gold asset management, according to the document. So far, EU nations have reported about €33.8 billion ($36.4 billion) of Russian central bank assets that have been frozen, but that figure is still being assessed.

Update #1: Where is the Russian money in Europe? (Modern Diplomacy)  
Update #2: EU has no clue about whereabouts of 86% of frozen Russian central bank assets — Bloomberg (TASS).   
WNU editor: From TASS .... Of $258 billion that were seized, not more than $36.4 billion has been located, the report said. 
Sighhhh .... this is why foreign governments and companies have lost confidence in the U.S. and the EU when it comes to money and reserve currencies.]]></summary>

Anti-government hackers interrupted televised speech by president Ebrahim Raisi, who appealed to the ‘deceived youth’ to repent 
Iran marked the 44th anniversary its revolution on Saturday with state-organised rallies, as anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by the president, Ebrahim Raisi.  Raisi, whose hardline government faces one of the boldest challenges from young protesters, appealed to the “deceived youth” to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran’s supreme leader.
His live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, with a logo appearing on the screen of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers that goes by the name of Edaalate Ali (Justice of Ali). A voice shouted: “Death to the Islamic Republic.”

CNBC: U.S. sanctions six Chinese tech companies for supporting spy balloon programs 
* A new round of U.S. sanctions will target six Chinese aerospace companies identified as supporting the nation’s military’s reconnaissance balloon program, the Commerce Department announced Friday. 
* The sanctions were imposed just hours after an American military F-22 shot down the second “high altitude object” to enter U.S. airspace in the past week.

WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department announced a new round of sanctions Friday targeting six Chinese aerospace companies that it identified as supporting the nation’s military’s reconnaissance balloon program.
The firms will join a growing list of companies based in China that the U.S. says pose serious threats to national security.  The sanctions announcement came just hours after an American military F-22 shot down the second “high altitude object” to enter U.S. airspace in the past week.
“The PRC’s use of high-altitude balloons violates our sovereignty and threatens U.S. national security,” said Alan Estevez, undersecretary of commerce for industry and security, using the acronym for the People’s Republic of China.

US News and World Report: U.S. Test Launches ICBM Into Pacific as Part of Nuclear ‘Deterrence Mission’ 
Military officials said the test launch of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile serves as a reminder that the U.S. can ‘deter twenty-first century threats.’ 
The U.S. Air Force test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean neighborhood of its adversaries in China and North Korea late Thursday at a time of growing international concern that brewing tensions among nuclear powers could escalate into a new arms race. 
Air Force Global Strike Command described the launch of the Minuteman III missile, which was unarmed, as “routine” and designed to reassure allies. But it also seemed to acknowledge the growing bellicose language from American adversaries in recent weeks.

Eleventh-hour negotiations between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have failed to unlock $1.1bn in crucial funds aimed at preventing the country from going bankrupt. 
A deepening economic crisis has all but emptied Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, leaving it barely enough dollars to cover a month of imports and it is struggling to service sky-high levels of foreign debt. 
The IMF team, which leaves Islamabad on Friday, said "considerable progress" had been made after 10 days of talks. 
"Virtual discussions will continue in the coming days," the head of the IMF mission Nathan Porter said in a statement.

President Biden will travel to Poland Feb. 20-22, the White House announced Friday, ahead of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The president is expected to deliver remarks ahead of the Feb. 24 anniversary of Russia’s “brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. 
Jean-Pierre said Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda to “discuss our bilateral cooperation, as well as our collective efforts to support Ukraine and bolster NATO’s deterrence.” He will also meet with leaders of the Bucharest Nine, a group of nations including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Estonia, that was created after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. With those leaders, Biden will “reaffirm the United States’ unwavering support for the security of the alliance,” Jean-Pierre said.

 Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe declined calls from his American counterpart after an Air Force-22 downed a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday, creating a “really dangerous” situation, U.S. defense officials said Thursday. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tried to contact Fenghe via a special crisis line, hoping to discuss the situation and hopefully ease tensions, according to the Associated Press. 
Fenghe declined to take the call after the U.S. Air Force shot balloon down on Feb. 4, the Pentagon said following the incident.  A spokesperson for China’s defense ministry said in a statement Thursday that the minister refused the call because the U.S. had “not created the proper atmosphere,” for the two parties to dialogue and had “seriously violated international norms and set a pernicious precedent,” AP reported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Former top US general: Jets could seal quick Ukraine victory 
The former commanding US general in Europe, Ben Hodges, has told DW that the West should provide Kyiv with fighter jets. He said that providing Ukraine with the planes could lead to a victory for Kyiv within the year. 
The former commanding general of the United States Army in Europe, Ben Hodges, said that Ukraine could achieve a quick victory if the West provided swift help with fighter jets. 
 He predicted that the defeat of Russia could otherwise take three to five years, given the current level of Western support.

WNU Editor: Former commander of US forces in Europe Ben Hodges is under-estimating Russia's military forces, and over-estimating Ukraine's army. And I completely disagree with his analysis that if the West provides arms for the next three to five years, Ukraine will win the war. Russia has far more manpower, firepower, and resources committed to this war, and fighting to the last Ukrainian soldier makes no sense to me. 
Ben Hodges' support to provide Ukraine with fighter jets in a war zone that is heavily saturated with air defenses is also not going to change the dynamics in this conflict. There is also the problem on where does Ukraine land these jets. All of Ukraine's airfields have been bombed. If there are F-16s at any of these bases, it is a guarantee that these sites will be obliterated by Russian missiles within a day, if not sooner.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Washington Post: Pentagon looks to restart top-secret programs in Ukraine 
The Pentagon is urging Congress to resume funding a pair of top-secret programs in Ukraine suspended ahead of Russia’s invasion last year, according to current and former U.S. officials. If approved, the move would allow American Special Operations troops to employ Ukrainian operatives to observe Russian military movements and counter disinformation. 
A determination is unlikely before the fall. Defense officials are preparing a proposal for lawmakers’ consideration in the coming months, when work begins on next year’s Pentagon policy and funding bill. If successful, these programs could resume as soon as 2024, though it remains unclear if the Biden administration would allow U.S. commandos back into Ukraine to oversee them or if the military would seek to do that from a neighboring country. No American military personnel are known to have operated there since the war began, beyond a small number tasked to the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.

WNU Editor: Funding what will be essentially para-military units to operate in Ukraine while being answerable to the US is not going to be lost on the Russians on what this means. Basically .... the Pentagon hiring mercenaries to target Russian forces. And not surprising, Russian media has been covering this story extensively today .... Pentagon seeking to resume top-secret programs in Ukraine – WaPo (RT). More here .... Pentagon Proposes Resuming Covert Ukrainian Intelligence Programs, Media Reports (Spuntik).]]></summary>

RT: Kiev sounds alarm over ammo  
Top Ukrainian official Igor Zhovkva told Bloomberg the country’s stocks are “almost zero”  
Intense fighting in Ukraine has caused its military to almost run out of ammunition, with stocks not being replenished in time, Igor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s office, has told media. The official also called on the West to provide Kiev with long-range artillery systems, tanks and fighter jets. 
In an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Zhovkva lamented that “now we are having like almost zero ammunition,” a situation that makes it harder for the Ukrainian military to respond to Russian shelling.  “We are running [out] of the ammunition very quickly because the fighting is intensive,” he explained, adding that Russian forces boast more firepower.

YouTube channels like the Military Summary Channel have been reporting Ukraine military withdrawals in the past week from areas that are easy to defend. The assessment has been that they were forced to withdraw because they ran out of ammunition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The above NBC reporter claims that the battle of Bakhmut is just an advertising campaign for the Wagnar mercenary group. But it is more than that. Ukraine has committed tens of thousands of its soldiers to this battle, and it has become the biggest battle of the war by far. 
For the Russian military this has become a golden opportunity to use their superior firepower to target such a large concentration of forces. And even though US military officials in the past few weeks have pleaded with Ukrainian officials to withdraw from the region, reports from Ukraine are that President Zelensky is determined to hold the city at all costs. 
But the battle may be coming to an end. The above second video is from Defense Politics Asia, and it gives a very sobering situation report on the battle. It looks like up to 15,000+ Ukrainian soldiers are about to be encircled in the coming days. And according to Russia's TASS, all roads leading in and out of Bakhmut are now under Russian fire control .... All roads in Artyomovsk area under Russia’s fire control, DPR official says (TASS).]]></summary>

Russian operations and troop movements around key areas of eastern Ukraine have accelerated sharply as the U.S. warns of an impending surge in fighting.

Late last month, mysterious green laser beams were spotted from Hawaii's tallest peak. 
Experts initially said the burst of laser beams was emitted by a NASA spacecraft though that was proven incorrect this week -- with evidence pointing to a Chinese satellite. 
Space experts at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) initially tweeted on Jan. 30 that the Subaru-Asahi Star Camera "captured green laser lights in the cloudy sky over Maunakea, Hawai'i. The lights are thought to be from a remote-sensing altimeter satellite ICESAT-2/43613."

Biden administration officials disclosed new information Thursday about the capabilities of the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that traversed the United States last week and what they are learning as the FBI begins analyzing the parts recovered after the balloon was shot down Saturday. 
US officials also detailed what they’ve discovered about the broader spying operation they say the Chinese government has undertaken using a fleet of high-altitude surveillance balloons across the globe. 
But senior Biden officials faced pointed questions on Capitol Hill from lawmakers in public hearings and classified briefings as Congress is demanding more information about why the balloon wasn’t shot down sooner.

   Breitbart: Poll: Donald Trump Double Digits Ahead of Potential GOP Challengers 
Former President Donald Trump is ahead of his potential 2024 Republican challengers by double digits, a Tuesday Morning Consult survey found. 
The survey showed Trump leading his closest potential challenger, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), by 18 percent, garnering 49 percent support compared to the governor’s 31 percent. 
No other potential challenger comes close, as former Vice President Mike Pence falls to third place with just seven percent support. Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is reportedly slated to announce a presidential bid this month, comes in fourth place with three percent support, followed by former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) with two percent and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) with two percent. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) saw one percent support, and Virginia Gov.

   Space.com: Mysterious Russian satellite breaks up in orbit, generating cloud of debris 
Kosmos 2499 broke apart in early January, according to the U.S. Space Force. 
A mysterious Russian satellite broke apart early last month, creating a cloud of debris that could linger in Earth orbit for a while. 
The Kosmos 2499 spacecraft disintegrated on the night of Jan. 3, according to the U.S. Space Force's 18th Space Defense Squadron (18th SDS), which tracks human-made objects in orbit. 
The breakup event generated at least 85 pieces of trackable debris, 18th SDS said via Twitter on Monday (opens in new tab) (Feb. 6). 
That cloud of space junk is orbiting 726 miles (1,169 kilometers) above Earth — so high that it'll likely take a century or more (opens in new tab) for atmosphere drag to bring it down.

WNU Editor: At an altitude of 1169 km that debris is going to stay in earth orbit for a very long time.

Despite growing Western alarm over the Islamic Republic's drone shipments to Russia, the Iranian official said 90 countries were "queuing up" for purchases of the same products. 
A senior Iran Intelligence Ministry official said China was among 90 countries "queuing up" to buy Iran-made drones, according to a report by the moderate Entekhab news agency on Wednesday. 
The top adviser, whose name remained undisclosed apparently for security reasons, made the comments during a book-unveiling ceremony at the international Imam Khomeini University in the city of Qazvin.

China now wants its busted suspected spy balloon returned after the United States military shot down the device over the coast of South Carolina and fished pieces of it out of the Atlantic Ocean. 
When a reporter asked on Tuesday whether China has called on the US to give back the debris of the downed balloon, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, "The airship does not belong to the US. It belongs to China."

VOA: Beijing Pushes Back After Biden Frames Relations as 'Competition' 
State Department — China says it was “smeared” in U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, in which he called for bipartisan unity to push back against Beijing. 
Days after a Chinese surveillance balloon drifted across American airspace, Biden said he remains open to working with Beijing, "where it can advance American interests and benefit the world." 
"But make no mistake about it," he said. "As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country, and we did."

President Biden pulled back the curtain on one of his telephone conversations with General Secretary Xi Jinping, saying in an interview that he highlighted the massive U.S. corporate withdrawal from Russia as something that might be in China’s future. 
Biden spoke yesterday with PBS’s Judy Woodruff following his Tuesday State of the Union address. When Woodruff asked if U.S.–China relations have taken a big hit as a result of the Chinese espionage balloon that floated over the U.S. and Washington’s response, Biden simply said, “No.” Pressed on this by Woodruff, he said that his previous conversations with Xi have convinced him that the incident hasn’t materially worsened relations and that he had not spoken with Xi while the balloon was in U.S. airspace.

WNU Editor: President Biden talks about China at the 12:25 mark in the above interview. 
According to US President Biden, this is what he said to the Chinese President last year .... 
 .... And I said, You’ve told me all along that the reason why you need a relationship with the United States in Europe is so they invest in China. So who’s going to invest in China if you engage in the same kind of deal? You notice there’s not been much going on there. 
If true, this explains why China in the past six months has accelerated its economic decoupling from the US, and intensified its military operations and exercises around Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the Western Pacific.]]></summary>

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic's presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society's political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination," Murangira said.
"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB."
"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime."
Rwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children's hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the "toxicity" of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, "and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes", Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was "now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire", Cumming said.
"So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!"
The queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London's West End, the city's theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a "telescopic urinal" when he became trapped, police said.
"We're sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene," Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
"Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration," said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence," added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a "quagmire."
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
"The victim publicized (the) Iranian government's human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution," Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, "highly dangerous" and a "propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology".
"You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you," Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS," he wrote. "SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!"
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES," Trump said. "Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!"
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a "genius" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved its Doomsday Clock forward to 90 seconds before midnight.
The clock has been maintained since 1947 and is used as a metaphor for the likelihood that we'll blow ourselves up. Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, "It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age."
In 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. Today it's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hundreds of campaign groups on Thursday condemned the appointment of an oil boss to lead UN climate talks in the United Arab Emirate, saying it threatened the meeting's "legitimacy".
The UAE named Sultan Al Jaber, chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), to head the crucial COP28 climate meeting in November, sparking an outcry from activists.
He is the first CEO to take the role at the UN summit.
NGOs and civil society organisations from around the world said in an open letter Thursday the "decision threatens the legitimacy and efficacy of COP28.
"This is no cause for celebration," it added in the letter to UN chief Antonio Guterres and Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), under which all climate nego…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
"Before encountering Earth, the asteroid's orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth's orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun," NASA said in a statement. "After its encounter, the asteroid's orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth's and Mars' orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days."
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Egypt unveiled Thursday a gold-laced mummy and four tombs, including of an ancient king's "secret keeper", discovered in the Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.
The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, "decorated with scenes of daily life," belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.
It was found in the pyramid complex of Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty, who reigned some 4,30…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Danish government's plan to abolish a public holiday to help fund the defense budget amid the war in Ukraine is putting Denmark's cherished welfare model at risk, the country's biggest trade union warned.
"It's a big threat to the Danish model", said Lizette Risgaard, the head of the FH union which has 1.3 million members in a country of 5.9 million inhabitants.
"Politicians should stay out of labour market issues. If they go through with this they'll be imposing their will and violate our agreements", she thundered in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.
The left-right government coalition in power since December, headed by Social Democratic Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, plans to scrap the religious holiday known as "Great Prayer Day", observed since the 17th century.
