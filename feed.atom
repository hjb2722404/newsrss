— Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) June 18, 2023
  
First Post: 'Iron General': Putin hints that Ukraine's top general may be abroad 
In a report by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency last month, citing a security source, it was claimed that Zaluzhny had suffered severe injuries in a Russian missile strike near Kherson in early May 
During a meeting with Russian military correspondents and bloggers, President Vladimir Putin suggested that General Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of Kiev’s armed forces, could be outside of Ukraine. 
Speculation about Zaluzhny’s whereabouts arose after he missed a high-profile NATO meeting and reports claimed he was gravely wounded in a Russian missile strike. 
While the Ukrainian Defense Ministry denies these allegations, Putin stated that he believes Zaluzhny is abroad, although he admitted that he could be mistaken.

WNU Editor: You do not miss critical NATO meetings if you are head of the Ukraine military. But General Zaluzhny has. My gut now tells me that he has not been wounded, he has been fired, especially since it was known that he was been against the counteroffensive in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Ukraine says eight villages retaken from Russian forces in two weeks 
KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine said on Monday it had driven Russian forces from an eighth village in its two-week-old counteroffensive, a settlement on a heavily fortified part of the front line near the most direct route to the country's Azov Sea coast. 
A Russian-installed official said on Sunday that Ukraine had taken control of the village, Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. He later said Moscow had pushed them out and on Monday morning he said Ukraine was attacking again. 
Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had not only retaken Piatykhatky but had advanced by up to seven km (4.3 miles) into Russian lines in two weeks, capturing 113 square km (44 square miles) of land.

Israeli military vehicle hit by roadside bomb, gunfire; helicopter gunship fires missiles at gunmen to allow evacuation of wounded troops; 91 Palestinians said hurt
Five Palestinians were killed as heavy clashes broke out between gunmen and Israeli troops in the city of Jenin on Monday morning. 
An Israeli helicopter gunship carried out rare strikes, the first in the West Bank in some two decades, in order for seven wounded soldiers to be evacuated from the battle zone after a vehicle was hit by an explosive device, the military and local officials said.
In a brief joint statement, the Israel Defense Forces and Border Police said forces entered the northern West Bank city in the early morning hours to detain two wanted Palestinians.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Here is my take on US Secretary Of State Antony Blinken's visit to China. 
1) The only positive thing that can be said of this trip is that President Xi decided to spend a brief time (and it was very brief) with the US Secretary. 
2) The readout from the meeting that US Secretary Blinken had with the Chinese foreign minister was harsh and brutal. It was basically China telling the U.S. to "wise up". 
3) Economic decoupling was rejected by both sides. 
4) There is a great divide between the two countries on Ukraine, Taiwan, and the West's rule based international order. 
5) No plans for Biden and Xi to meet in the future. 
 6) No Chinese "apology" for buzzing US ships and planes in Asia. 
7) U.S. statements by its leaders in the past few months that war is coming against China is another issue that the Chinese are not happy hearing. All that I can say is that if the US wants better relations with China, talking about war is not going to help. 
8) China is asserting its role as an equal to the U.S..]]></summary>

China rejected a U.S. offer to set up a direct military line of communication between Washington and Beijing that is a priority goal for the Biden administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday. 
Blinken’s remarks came at a press conference shortly after he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a rare exception to diplomatic protocol that signals the seriousness with which Beijing took Blinken’s visit and the relationship. 
But Blinken said that while he “repeatedly” raised the need for the U.S. and Chinese militaries to have a crisis communication line to quickly tamp down tensions and walk back confrontations, “at this moment, China has not agreed to move forward with that.”

(South Korea Defense Ministry via AP) 
EurAsian Times: ATACMS For Ukraine! After Abrams & F-16s, US Defense Bill OKs HIMARS-Fired Army Tactical Missile System For Kyiv 
The US could finally deliver Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) to Ukraine as the draft defense bill allocates $80 million to purchase the weapon for Kyiv’s military. 
It will, however, be at least a year until the weapon reaches Ukraine, given the ensuing procedural and industrial process, because the missile will not be dispatched from US military stockpiles. It will be ordered from the industry, which will take time to manufacture. 
Thus after main battle tanks and F-16 fighters, this becomes the third weapon system the US approved after a year of initially declining sending them to Ukraine.

WNU Editor: Michael Rubin is insane. Giving U.S. nuclear weapons to a regime that Moscow regards is run by Neo-Nazis will result in World War 3.

VOA/Reuters: Russian Attack Cannot Be Ruled Out, Says Swedish Parliamentary Report – SVT 
Stockholm — A Swedish parliament defense committee report said a Russian military attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out, Swedish public service broadcaster SVT said on Sunday, citing sources. 
Sweden has been scrambling to bolster its defenses and applied to join NATO last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sweden was invited to apply but Turkey and Hungary are yet to ratify the application. 
The parliamentary report, due to be published on Monday, said that although Russian ground forces were tied up in Ukraine, other types of military attacks against Sweden could not be ruled out, SVT said, citing sources who worked on the report.

The Cradle: Taliban, China discuss banking cooperation

 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021 
The Taliban’s governor of the Afghan central bank Hidayatullah Badri met with Chinese envoy Wang Yu this week to discuss banking ties and business, the bank’s spokesperson informed Reuters on 16 June. 
“In this meeting, economy, banking relations, business and some related topics were discussed,” said Badri. 
Although Beijing does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, China is among the few countries that have maintained a diplomatic presence in Kabul since the Taliban took back the country following the US’ disastrous withdrawal in 2021. 
Following the withdrawal, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Italian news outlet La Repubblica that China would be its principal partner in rebuilding Afghanistan after a 20-year US occupation.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held "candid" talks with his Chinese counterpart at the start of two days of meetings with officials in China, the US state department says.

His trip is the first by a top US diplomat to China in almost five years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Post: Afghanistan declares Aug 31 as national holiday to commemorate US troop withdrawal 
Afghanistan has announced that the country will observe August 31, the day US soldier departed from the country as a National Holiday. 
As stated on the Taliban government’s website, the withdrawal of foreign troops will be celebrated annually on August 31. 
The inaugural festivities were organized last year, with the authorities and supporters of the Taliban marking the first anniversary of the withdrawal. Taliban fighters held a rally on Massoud Square in Kabul, located outside the former US embassy.
On August 31, 2021, just before the withdrawal deadline expired, the final American soldier, US Army Major General Chris Donahue, boarded a military transport plane. This marked the conclusion of a challenging 20-year military campaign that incurred significant costs and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives.

RT: IEA warns of possible oil shortage

 
Global demand will rise by 6% between 2022 and 2028, according to the energy watchdog  
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has raised its outlook for world oil demand to a record high of 102.3 million barrels a day this year, saying it will be powered by faster-growing economies in the developing world. 
In its latest medium-term market report released this week, the IEA projects global oil demand to grow 6% between 2022 and 2028 to reach 105.7 million barrels per day (bpd), up 5.9 million bpd compared to 2022 levels. 
That growth will be supported by strong demand from the petrochemical and aviation sectors, it said.

New York Times/DNYUZ: U.S. National Debt Tops $32 Trillion for First Time 
The gross national debt exceeded $32 trillion for the first time on Friday, underscoring the country’s unsettling fiscal trajectory as Washington gears up for another fight over government spending. 
A Treasury Department report noted the milestone weeks after Congress agreed to suspend the nation’s statutory debt limit, ending a monthslong standoff. 
The $32 trillion mark arrived nine years sooner than prepandemic forecasts had projected, reflecting the trillions of dollars of emergency spending to address Covid-19’s impact along with a run of sluggish economic growth.

The Intercept:  Pentagon’s Secret Service Trawls Social Media for Mean Tweets About Generals

 
A document shows the Protective Services Battalion uses sophisticated surveillance tools that can pinpoint anyone’s location.  
When the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley enters into his scheduled retirement later this year, one of the perks will include a personal security detail to protect him from threats — including “embarrassment.” 
The U.S. Army Protective Services Battalion, the Pentagon’s little-known Secret Service equivalent, is tasked with safeguarding top military brass. The unit protects current as well as former high-ranking military officers from “assassination, kidnapping, injury or embarrassment,” according to Army records. 
Protective Services’s mandate has expanded to include monitoring social media for “direct, indirect, and veiled” threats and identifying “negative sentiment” regarding its wards, according to an Army procurement document dated September 1, 2022, and reviewed by The Intercept. The expansion of the Protective Services Battalion’s purview has not been previously reported.

The Telegraph: Prepare for Ukraine's counter-offensive to falter 
Nato needs to brace itself for the prospect of Ukraine’s counteroffensive failing to achieve major success. Indeed, so far, Kyiv has attained only limited gains. But those who expected a lightning breakthrough were always going to be disappointed. This is not German panzers against Polish horse cavalry, nor is it American shock and awe against demoralised Iraqi forces in antiquated tanks with no air cover. 
Instead, we are seeing something closer to an attritional style of warfare, with attacking forces battering against heavily fortified defences. Current operations are at the stage of reconnaissance-in-force along four separate axes of advance, with Ukrainian units probing Russian positions to identify weak spots that can then be softened up with artillery and exploited by armoured reserve forces. Commandos and partisans are said to be working behind enemy lines to create confusion and disrupt command and control centres. Long range strikes are being used to hit headquarters.

Insider: Attack helicopters are giving Russia the edge in the skies over southern Ukraine, says UK intel

WNU Editor: According to the sources that I trust there was heavy fighting along the entire front today. Apparently the Ukraine Army made the decision to throw everything into the assault, and while some gains were made, the consensus that I am reading is that the casualties that Ukraine experienced today makes it the bloodiest day for the Ukraine military since the start of the war. 
Apparently what worked against the Ukraine army in today's assault was that the skies were clear, perfect conditions for Russian drones and attack helicopters to go into action. 
I hope all of these reports are false. And this is nothing but "fog of war". But if this disaster did happen today, expect a lot of videos being posted by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the next day or two.]]></summary>

BEIJING — Antony Blinken became the first secretary of state to visit China in five years on Sunday as he arrived in the country for two days of high-stakes meetings aimed at stabilizing a relationship under historic stress. 
His hosts previewed the tense visit with multiple rebukes of the United States, accusing Washington of engaging in “irresponsible bullying” and living under the “illusion” it could deal with China from a “position of strength.” 
China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Blinken that he should “show respect” during a pre-trip phone call, and made clear his view that Washington alone was responsible for the abysmal state of relations.

Kampala, Uganda CNN  — Armed rebels attacked a school in western Uganda, killing at least 41 people, mostly students, and abducting six others, Ugandan officials have said. 
Some were hacked to death with machetes while others died when their dormitories were set on fire, military spokesman Felix Kulayigye told CNN. 
About 20 members of the ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group attacked the Lhubirira secondary school late on Friday, according to Uganda’s military. 
The school is situated along Uganda’s border with Congo in the town of Kasese, and educates children between the ages of 13 and 18. Of the dead, 39 were students and two were from the local community, local officials said.

* Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt made the remarks at a DoD Pride event in Washington DC 
* Said state laws hostile to LGBTQ rights are impacting transfers and promotions 
* Family circumstances could make transfers to some states a problem, she said 
A high-ranking Space Force officer has spoken out slamming a slew of recent anti-LGBTQ state laws, saying they have a negative impact on military families and force readiness. 
Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt made the remarks in a fiery speech at the 12th Annual DoD LGBTQ+ Pride Event in Washington DC, saying that the laws sometimes forced her to choose 'less qualified' candidates for postings in those states. 
'Since January of this year, more than 400 anti-LGBTQ+ laws have been introduced at the state level,' said Burt, the Space Force's deputy chief of space operations.

Kyiv Independent: FT: US senators to propose bill to seize and transfer Russian assets to Ukraine 
U.S. senators with bipartisan backing are reportedly planning to propose a bill that would allow President Joe Biden to seize and transfer Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on June 15. 
Western countries have frozen around $300 billion of Russia's Central Bank assets since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The bill's proponents argue that since Russia bears the blame for the destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, it should also bear the financial costs of reparations. 
They also likely aim to alleviate the burden of Ukraine's support from U.S. taxpayers and allies.

"There's probably around 20 to 30 hectares behind me, it is easily eaten in a day," cattle farmer Kari Pekonen tells AFP.
In Finland's eastern Karelia region, home to boreal forests and wetlands, climate change is pushing local farmers into conflict with wildlife.
"Many farmers in this region have completely lost faith in the fairness of society," Pekonen says.
Two decades ago, few Barnacle geese stopped in Finland to feed during their migration north across the Arctic, where they nest, from their wintering areas in the Netherlands, Germany and beyond.

He and his three siblings walk at least a mile (1.6 kilometres) and wait, sometimes for hours, hoping to fill their jerry cans and make it back in time for school.
"My arms and my back hurt from the load I carry every day," Mohammad told AFP from the family's makeshift apartment, a former grocery store, in the city of Taez.
"We wake up in the early morning and leave home with our father, sometimes even at night, to collect water," he said.
The teenager's plight is common in Yemen, which had ranked among the world's most water-stressed countries even before conflict broke out in 2015 between Iran-backed Huthi rebels and…]]></summary>

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Flags flew lowered in the Canadian province of Manitoba on Friday following a deadly crash between a bus carrying mostly elderly passengers and a truck, as investigators identified the injured and reviewed video footage from a camera mounted on the truck.
Fifteen people were killed and another 11 people were injured in the fiery collision on Thursday between a bus headed to a casino and a tractor-trailer truck at a highway junction near the town of Carberry, 170 km (105 miles) west of Winnipeg.
It was one of Canada's worst recent road crashes.

According to an analysis of Cid's seized cell phone, a federal police report said he had "gathered documents with the aim of obtaining 'legal and judicial' support for the execution of a coup d'état."
Cid's lawyer Bernardo Fenelon said in a statement that his client would only defend himself to investigators.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of demonizing billionaire investor George Soros as a sinister liberal bogeyman, the Hungarian government and its allied media are taking aim at a fresh target -- his son Alexander.
Monday's announcement that the elder Soros will hand over control of his philanthropic empire to 37-year-old Alexander, who goes by the name of Alex, prompted an object lesson in the workings of media loyal to nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The 92-year-old Soros has become a bête noire of the international far right because of the activities of his Open Society Foundations (OSF).
In Hungary, the government accuses him of wanting to "flood Europe" with migrants because of the OSF's support for refugee rights advocates.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's Supreme Court on Friday upheld an asylum-seeker pact between Canada and the United States.
Under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement, which came into effect in 2004, asylum seekers who cross the land border between the two countries are turned around and sent back on the grounds that they should apply for asylum in the first "safe" country they arrived in.
Built-in safety valves mean the agreement does not violate asylum seekers' right to life, liberty and security of the person, the Supreme Court ruled. But it sent the case back to federal court for a ruling on whether the agreement breaches asylum seekers' right to equal treatment under the law.
The two countries amended the agreement earlier this year, making it apply to the l…]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.
