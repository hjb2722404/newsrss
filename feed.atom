Bloomberg: China Tensions High on Agenda as G-7 Diplomats Meet in Japan 
(Bloomberg) -- Tensions over China will be high on the agenda as top diplomats from Group of Seven nations meet over the next two days in Japan, according to a senior State Department official. 
Geopolitical challenges in Asia are set to come into greater focus now that Japan holds the rotating G-7 presidency, the official told reporters ahead of the foreign ministers’ meeting, which comes about a month before US President Joe Biden and other leaders will head to Hiroshima for the annual leaders summit. 
Tensions over Taiwan in particular are demanding attention after China again held military drills around the island following President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 
Around the same time, French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Union should avoid being dragged into a dispute with China by the US, highlighting divisions within the bloc.

Reuters: 'Zero capacity to save': Argentines buckle as inflation tops 104% 
BUENOS AIRES, April 14 (Reuters) - Argentina's annual inflation rate soared to 104.3% in March, the official statistics agency said on Friday, one of the highest rates in the world, straining people's wallets and stoking a cost-of-living crisis that has pushed up poverty. 
The inflation reading for the month came in at 7.7%, well above analyst forecasts of 7.1%, marking the fastest monthly rise since 2002 and piling pressure on the government which is contending with angry voters ahead of elections in October. 
 "I try to think that someday we're going to be better off. But the inflation we're living with today in Argentina is terrible. It feels like never before," said Claudia Hernansaez, a publishing company employee.

"In my case, I have zero capacity to save."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's army appeared to gain the upper hand on Sunday in a bloody power struggle with rival paramilitary forces after blasting its bases with air strikes, witnesses said, and at least 59 civilians were killed including three U.N. workers. 
The fighting erupted on Saturday between army units loyal to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of Sudan's transitional governing Sovereign Council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is deputy head of the council.

Documents among those shared by alleged leaker raise questions over island’s military readiness 
China would probably establish air superiority very rapidly in any attack on Taiwan, according to leaked US intelligence assessments that raise disturbing questions about the self-ruled island’s military readiness. 
The documents, part of a series allegedly leaked by the US air national guardsman Jack Teixeira, emerged as G7 foreign ministers met to discuss a common China strategy and Beijing briefly halted flights over part of the East China Sea on Sunday. 
The classified documents seen by the Washington Post reveal that Taiwan’s military leaders doubt their air defences can “accurately detect missile launches” and that only about half of the island’s aircraft are capable of effectively engaging the enemy.

Nikkei Asia: U.S. defense industry plans first Taiwan trip in four years

 
Contractors to explore co-production of drones and ammunition 
WASHINGTON -- Around 25 U.S. defense contractors plan to send representatives to Taiwan in early May to discuss joint production of drones and ammunition, US Taiwan Business Council President Rupert Hammond-Chambers told Nikkei, as Washington explores various options to help bolster the island's defenses. 
The delegation will be led by Steven Rudder, the retired commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific. This would be the first large group of envoys focused specifically on the defense industry to visit Taiwan from the U.S. since 2019. 
In addition to talks with representatives from the Taiwanese defense industry, it is looking to meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.

CNBC: Surprise oil output cuts from OPEC+ could hurt consumers and derail the economic recovery, IEA warns 
* In its latest monthly oil market report, the IEA said the energy alliance’s self-described “precautionary move” was likely to spell bad news for consumers at a time of heightened economic uncertainty. 
* “Consumers confronted by inflated prices for basic necessities will now have to spread their budgets even more thinly,” the IEA said. “This augurs badly for the economic recovery and growth.” 
* Several OPEC+ members announced on April 2 that they were set to tighten global production by an additional 1.16 million barrels per day until the end of the year. 
The International Energy Agency on Friday warned surprise oil output cuts from the OPEC+ producer group risk exacerbating a projected supply deficit and could scupper an economic recovery.
In its latest monthly oil market report, the IEA said the energy alliance’s self-described “precautionary move” was likely to spell bad news for consumers at a time of heightened economic uncertainty.

Reuters: Poland, Hungary ban grain and food imports from Ukraine; Kyiv unhappy 
WARSAW/BUDAPEST - Poland and Hungary have decided to ban imports of grain and other food from neighbouring Ukraine to protect the local agricultural sector, the two governments said on Saturday, after a flood of supply depressed prices across the region. 
Ukraine expressed regret about the Polish decision, saying that “resolving various issues by unilateral drastic actions will not accelerate a positive resolution of the situation”. 
After Russia’s invasion blocked some Black Sea ports, large quantities of Ukrainian grain, which is cheaper than that produced in the European Union, ended up staying in Central European states due to logistical bottlenecks, hitting prices and sales for local farmers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Ukraine reports unprecedentedly bloody fighting in Bakhmut 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Ukrainian and Russian armed forces are fighting extraordinarily bloody battles in the smashed eastern city of Bakhmut, but pro-Kyiv forces are still holding on, Ukraine's military said on Saturday. 
Russia's defence ministry said earlier in the day that fighters from the Wagner mercenary group had captured two more areas of Bakhmut, the main target of Moscow's offensive in eastern Ukraine. 
Wagner has spearheaded Russia's attempt to take Bakhmut since last summer in what has been the longest and deadliest battle of the war for both sides. 
"Bloody battles unprecedented in recent decades are taking place in the middle of the city's urban area," said Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern military command.

WNU Editor: I just finished reading a Ukrainian blogger's report that the Ukraine Army is trying to pour even more soldiers into the 20% of Bakhmut that they still control. I understand Ukraine President Zelensky's concern that should Bakhmut fall the entire Donbas front-line may collapse. But sending hundreds if not thousands of more soldiers to certain death to only prevent the inevitable makes no sense to me.

Seymour Hersh: Trading With The Enemy 
Amid rampant corruption in Kiev and as US troops gather at the Ukrainian border, does the Biden administration have an endgame to the conflict? 
The Ukraine government, headed by Volodymyr Zelensky, has been using American taxpayers’ funds to pay dearly for the vitally needed diesel fuel that is keeping the Ukrainian army on the move in its war with Russia. It is unknown how much the Zelensky government is paying per gallon for the fuel, but the Pentagon was paying as much as $400 per gallon to transport gasoline from a port in Pakistan, via truck or parachute, into Afghanistan during the decades-long American…]]></summary>

Germany has given its permission for formerly East German MiG fighter jets to be sent on to Ukraine. The swift approval comes just hours after Berlin said that it had received the application. 
Poland's formal request to Germany for permission to send five Cold War-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine has been given the green light, the German Defense Ministry confirmed on Thursday. 
According to German rules, the weapons that it sells require approval from Berlin if the receiving country wants to send them on to a third country. 
"I welcome the fact that we in the federal government have reached this decision together," Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said after the decision was made in Berlin. "This shows Germany can be relied on!"

The U.S. Department of Defense is reviewing the lists of people with permission to see sensitive information after the leak attributed to the young Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira 
How is it possible that a 21-year-old recruit had access to classified military information that was reserved, in theory, only for the highest command? And how is it possible that he was able to copy and distribute those documents for months without the Pentagon noticing? These are some of the questions raised by the arrest of Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who is suspected of being behind the largest — and most embarrassing — leak of official secrets in the US since WikiLeaks in 2010. To answer these questions, it is necessary to revisit the attacks of September 11, 2001. 
Teixeira joined the National Guard, an auxiliary military corps whose main mission is to defend the United States in the event of war, immediately after graduating from high school three years ago. Following a background check, required for entry into jobs related to national security, he received clearance for access to high-level classified information. His assignment to an intelligence unit, in which he had to ensure that communications flowed properly as an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks, gave him access to restricted areas.

Moscow Times/AFP: Finland Unveils First Section of Russian Border Fence 
Finland's border guard on Friday unveiled the first section of a 200-kilometer border fence with Russia being built after Moscow invaded Ukraine last year. 
Finland joined NATO just a week ago and its 1,300-kilometer border has also doubled the frontier between the U.S.-led military alliance and Russia. 
Three meters tall and topped with barbed wire, it will cost around 380 million euros ($417 million) and is due to be completed by 2026.
 Officials showed the construction site of the first three-kilometer section near the Imatra border crossing point in southeastern Finland.

 * Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued the challenge a day after a meeting with Xi Jinping, where they urged more countries to play a constructive role 
* While Lula also said the US and EU need to start talking about peace, he told China’s state broadcaster that he still wanted better relations with Washington 
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva concluded his visit to China on Saturday by urging the United States to stop “encouraging” war in Ukraine.

“The United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace. 
The European Union needs to start talking about peace,” Lula told reporters in Beijing.

In that way, the international community will be able to “convince” Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky that “peace is in the interest of the whole world”, he said. 
A joint statement by China and Brazil on Friday called on more countries to play a constructive role in promoting a political resolution to the Ukraine crisis, and said both countries will maintain communication on this issue.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -Sudan's main paramilitary group and the regular armed forces exchanged gunfire in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country on Saturday in an apparent struggle for control. 
The army rejected assertions by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that they had seized the presidential palace, the army chief's residence and airports in Khartoum and the northern city of Merowe. 
Army chief General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan told Al Jazeera TV: "We think if they are wise they will turn back their troops that came into Khartoum. But if it continues we will have to deploy troops into Khartoum from other areas."

Three sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the onetime leader of the Sinaloa Cartel now imprisoned in the United States, were among those charged in what authorities called one of the most ambitious responses to date to a drug epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in the past eight years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A strong 7.0-magnitude earthquake was recorded in the sea north of the main Indonesian island of Java, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said on Friday, with no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
The quake struck at 4:55 pm local time (0955 GMT), the USGS said, with Indonesia's geological agency ruling out a tsunami after the epicenter was detected at a depth of 594 kilometers (370 miles).
Indonesia experiences frequent quakes due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
Friday's quake hit roughly 160 kilometers northwest of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-most populous city that is home to more than two million people.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea announced on Friday it had tested a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a development set to "radically promote" its forces, which experts said would facilitate missile launches with little warning.
Leader Kim Jong Un guided Thursday's test, and warned it would make enemies "experience a clearer security crisis, and constantly strike extreme uneasiness and horror into them by taking fatal and offensive counter-actions until they abandon their senseless thinking and reckless acts", North Korean state media said.
Analysts said it was the North's first use of solid propellants in an intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile, a key task to deploying missiles faster during a war.

A green light from the heavily guarded institution would pave the way for the head of state to sign the changes into law and ensure they are implemented by year-end.
Experts believe the most likely scenario is that the nine-member body will censure some non-essential parts of the legislation but approve the core element of raising the retirement age to 64 from 62.
"The council will likely follow the course it always had -- not to counter big social or societal reforms," constitutional expert Laureline Fontaine told AFP.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea says it has tested a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its first known use of the propellant in a longer-range projectile, as it seeks the capability to launch with little preparation.
Here are some characteristics of solid-fuel technology, and how it can help the North improve its missile systems.
WHAT IS SOLID-FUEL TECHNOLOGY?
Solid propellants are a mixture of fuel and oxidiser. Metallic powders such as aluminium often serve as the fuel, and ammonium perchlorate, which is the salt of perchloric acid and ammonia, is the most common oxidiser.
The fuel and oxidiser are bound together by a hard rubbery material and packed into a metal casing.
When solid propellant burns, oxygen from the ammonium perchlorate combines with …]]></summary>

In a country that prides itself on being a champion of feminism and gender equality, the association of retired women is calling for an increase in pensions for women, who are penalised by a system that favours people with high salaries who work well into their sixties.

Quant went down in the history books for the mini-skirt and making women's clothes fun and affordable.
Whether she actually invented the iconic fashion item has been the subject of a long and bitter dispute with late French designer Andre Courreges, among others.

The announcement came after Taiwan's transport ministry said Wednesday that Beijing planned to impose a no-fly zone north of the island due to "space activities".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired a missile on Thursday, South Korea and Japan said, prompting a warning for some Japanese residents to take cover.
The Japanese government warned residents of the northernmost main island of Hokkaido to take immediate cover, saying a missile was likely to fall near the island around 8 a.m. Japan time (2300 GMT).
The ballistic missile was launched off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
The launch comes two days after North Korean state media KCNA reported that leader Kim Jong Un called for strengthening the country's war deterrence in a "more practical and offensive" manner to counter what it called moves of aggression by the United States.
North Korea has criticized the recent series of joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea as escalating tensions, stepping up its weapons tests in recent months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Raphael Satter
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Instant messaging platform Discord said on Wednesday it was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement's investigation into a leak of secret U.S. documents that has grabbed attention around the world.
The statement comes as questions continue to swirl over who leaked the documents, whether they are genuine and whether the intelligence assessments in them are reliable. The documents, which carry markings suggesting that they are highly classified, have led to a string of stories about the war in Ukraine, protests in Israel and how the U.S. surveils friend and foe alike.
The source of the documents is not publicly known, but reporting by the open-source investigative site Bellingcat has traced their earliest appearance to Discord, a communications platform popular with gamers.
Discord's statement suggested it was already in touch with investigators.
"In regards to the apparent breach of classified material, we are cooperating with law enforcement," the statement said. "As this remains an active investigation, we cannot provide further comment at this time."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
Although the documents only began drawing attention recently, Bellingcat said it found evidence that at least some of the files had been floating around on social media as far back as March or even January.
Bellingcat cited Discord users who it said gave similar accounts of the documents' provenance but cautioned that it was unable to independently verify all the information they shared.
Reuters could not immediately corroborate Bellingcat's reporting; attempts to reach former members of the server via the social media site Reddit and other servers on Discord were not immediately successful.

The situation with the Marburg virus entered uncharted territory on March 21, when Tanzania announced an outbreak of the disease in addition to the one in Equatorial Guinea, on the other side of the African continent.
Five people have died out of eight confirmed cases as of April 6, according to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), which issued a health alert warning that doctors in the US should “be aware of the potential for imported cases”, even if the risk of the disease reaching the US is low.

The announcement follows weeks of uncertainty over the presence of Harry and Meghan, who have launched a barrage of criticism of the British royal family since announcing they were quitting royal duties in early 2020.
"Buckingham Palace is pleased to confirm that the Duke of Sussex will attend the coronation service at Westminster Abbey on 6th May," a palace statement said, using Harry's official title.
"The Duchess of Sussex will remain in California with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet."

The 74-year-old actor, long a star in France before 1990 film "Green Card" made him a Hollywood celebrity, has through his lawyers categorically denied any wrongdoing.
Contacted by AFP, the prosecutor's office on Wednesday said it had not received any new complaints, but that their investigation into 2018 accusations he had raped young French actress Charlotte Arnould was ongoing.
Mediapart said Tuesday that 13 other women had also come forward to accuse Depardieu of molesting them on the set of 11 films or series that came out between 2004 and 2022 or in other locations off set.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
