        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defence Minister Richard Marles has held a breakthrough meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore.

Mr Marles met with General Wei Fenghe for more than hour on the sideline of the Shangri-La Defence Dialogue, marking the first time in three years the defence ministers of the two countries have met.

Lowy Institute Senior Fellow Richard McGregor says the meeting was “very interesting” as both Australia and China were willing to have a conversation.

He said before Mr Marles went to Singapore he said there was no meeting arranged so the occurrence of one shows both countries “decided it was about time to end the stand-off”.

“It’s important to remember though there’s no change in all the fundamental problems in the relationship, all that’s happening now is we’re talking about them,” he told Sky News Australia.

“In the case of the military that’s a good thing because it means we might be able to avoid the kind of incidents we had in the South China Sea a few months ago.”]]></summary>

During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said she would worry about the 2024 election after this November's midterm elections.

“First of all, I’m focused on winning this majority right now and preserving a majority this year in 2022,” she said.

“I believe that the president has been doing a very good job so far. And should he run again, I think that we will take a look at it.”​

Reports in the Israeli media suggest that IAF F-35s have been enhanced to hit Iranian targets unrefueled and carry at least one new weapon. 
Recent reports in the Israeli media claim that the country has developed a means of extending the range of its F-35I Adir stealth jets, allegedly providing them with enough reach to hit targets in Iran without needing aerial refueling. The development has been announced together with the integration of a new, locally developed smart bomb for internal carriage in the F-35. These apparent upgrades to the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities come as the Israeli leadership announces a harder line against Tehran’s nuclear program, while the air force conducts exercises widely thought to be dress rehearsals for potential raids against Iran.

It was 1977, and Feld, a top choreographer, had an epiphany: not about how to escape, but about how he could discover underdeveloped dancers among children like these. .  The following year, he joined the New York City Department of Education to start a dance training program for public school students, which eventually grew into a school for students in grades four through the eighth year: Ballet technique.
This oft-told story was told again Thursday at the Joyce Theater, which Feld also helped found, with the return of Kids Dance, Ballet Tech’s performance troupe, in a recital for paying (and even critical) audiences.  He came in Feld’s recorded voice as part of “Eureka!”, a new work …]]></summary>

There was a lot to see: the electric chair from his 1974 black comedy, “Female Trouble,” in the hallway.  A birth certificate for Divine, the 300-pound transvestite who played the “dirtiest person alive” in “Pink Flamingos,” hangs in a basement room filled with memories.

She was 65 years old.
Her husband, Edward Grinnan, said the cause was suicide.  He said she had battled depression as well as lupus.
Ms. Cruise was building a career on Broadway in the early 1980s when chance struck: she met the composer Angelo Badalamenti when they were working on a show together.


“I was in this country and western musical in the East Village,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1990. “I was a chorus girl with a big skirt and a big wig, singing way too loud. Angelo was doing the music for the show and we became fr…]]></summary>

The pair met in a hotel room in London, Knight said in a recent interview, and chatted for three hours about the show, which was based on the real Shelby family who operated in Birmingham, central London. England, in the shadow of the First World War.  “Peaky” reminded the rapper of how he got involved in gang culture in Los Angeles, Knight said.
“How the connection occurs between 1920s Birmingham and South Central, I don’t know,” said Knight, 62.  “I think you just get lucky with certain projects and that resonates with people.”

Two-time Oscar nominee Fassbender will make that dream come true by lining up on the grid at Le Mans this weekend, driving a Porsche 911 RSR -19.
Fassbender will race for the Proton Competition team in the GTE-Am class, designed for grand touring cars that include at least one enthusiast in their lineup.  It will be Fassbender, who will share driving duties with Zacharie Robichon from Canada and Porsche works driver Matt Campbell from Australia.

There’s a lot to like for a discerning parent: the material is hypoallergenic, antifungal, odor resistant and has natural UV protection.  Items come in thousands of patterns and designs, which the company releases weekly.  Instead of offering all of these options on the company’s website like most retailers do, Little Sleepies “drops” these baby pajamas at some point.

Americans are facing more expensive food, fuel and housing, and some are seeking answers on what is causing the price spike, how long it could last and what can be done to fix it.
There are few easy answers or painless fixes when it comes to inflation, which has surged around the world as supply shortages collide with strong consumer demand.  It’s hard to predict how long today’s price spike will last, and the main tool to combat it is rising interest rates, which dampen inflation by slowing the economy – potentially sharply.

"Russian-American political dialogue is at an unprecedented low level. Trust is undermined, cooperation is collapsing even on issues of obvious mutual interest. Communication between the parties is limited today," Antonov said on the air of the Bolshaya Igra ("Big Game") show on Channel One, adding that the dialogue is "limited to the discussion of technical issues," Sputnik reported. 
The diplomat also said that the sides currently do not conduct a dialogue on the strategic stability and called the situation "wrong" as the "world expects concrete actions" from the US and Russia. 
Antonov added that he is "unaware" of any unofficial dialogue between Moscow and Washington.

WASHINGTON — Even before the start of the war in Ukraine, an international alliance to rally the world against a Russian invasion came together so quickly that President Biden later marveled at the “purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.” 
Now, with the conflict in its fourth month, U.S. officials are facing the disappointing reality that the powerful coalition of nations — stretching from North America across Europe and into East Asia — may not be enough to break the looming stalemate in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HOUSTON — Gasoline prices hit an ominous milestone on Saturday, as the national average for regular gasoline hit $5 a gallon.
Summer gasoline is almost always more expensive as fuel demand takes off around Memorial Day weekend.  But this year, oil and refined fuel prices have risen to their highest levels in 14 years, largely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions, and a rebound in energy consumption as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
The national average gasoline price on Saturday was $5.00, up 60 cents from a month ago.  A year ago gasoline was selling for $3.08, according to the AAA automobile club.  The national average is at its highest level since March, when it topped his previous record set in July 2008, when oil was trading at over $133…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: 'To say our country was on the right track would flagrantly depart from reality': Top Democrats say Biden should NOT run for re-election in 2024 
* Fifty top Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times said Joe Biden  should not run for re-election in 2024 president 
* Many were pessimistic about Biden's leaderships, which is marred with failures 
* Biden failed to pass his $1.8 trillion Build Back Better agenda and voting rights expansion bill, and faced backlash over the chaotic exit from Afghanistan 
* The administration continues to face challenges from record high gas prices and soaring inflation, and a possible end to the federal abortion rights 
* Many Democratic leaders also worry about the presidents age, who was the oldest man appointed to office at 78 last January 
* Democrats are also at a loss of who should take control of the party as Republicans are expected to rack up major victories in the coming midterms 
Top Democrats across the country said President Joe Biden should not run for re-election in 2024 as they expressed worries over his current leadership and age. 
Nearly all 50 Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times feared a Biden re-election campaign would not help their party against Republicans, who are expected to make sweeping victories in the coming midterms. 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) member Steve Simeonidis, of Miami, said he was generally pessimistic about his party's leadership and called on Biden, 79, to let someone new take over in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With 44 million Medicare beneficiaries and an annual test costing around $1,000 a year, plus expensive scans and biopsies for those who test positive, the price could be substantial.
He and other critics warn the risks of triggering the tests are substantial.  As paradoxical as it may seem, finding cancers earlier could mean as many deaths, at the same time, as without early diagnosis.  Indeed, at least with current treatments, cancers meant to kill are not necessarily cured if caught early.
And there are other risks.  For example, some will test positive, but doctors will be unable to locate the cancer.  Others will be aggressively treated with surgery or chemotherapy for cancers that, if left alone, would not have grown and spread and may even be gone.
Dr. Beer acknowledges that a blood test for cancer “is not without risk or cost, and will not detect all cancers”.
But, he said, “I think there’s the promise of real impact.”
Other experts are worried.
Dr. Barnett Kramer, a member of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine and former director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, worries that testing will go mainstream without ever showing it’s beneficial .  Once that happens, he said, “it’s hard to ring the bell.”
“Hopefully we’re not halfway to a nightmare,” Dr. Kramer said.
Damocles syndrome
When Susan Iorio Bell, 73, a nurse who lives in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, saw an ad on Facebook recruiting women her age for a cancer blood test study, she immediately signed up.  This aligned with his advocacy of preventive medicine and his belief in clinical trials.

The Russian federal space company, Roscosmos, announced his death.  Dmitry Rogozin, the company’s director, called Mr Ryumin’s death an “irreparable loss”, but did not say where he died or name the cause.
Mr Ryumin’s first mission, on Soyuz 25, was supposed to last 90 days, but ended after just two when the vehicle failed to dock with the Salyut 6 orbital space station.


During his next two missions, Mr. Ryumin and his teammates set space endurance records: 175 days with Vladimir Lyakhov on Soyuz 32 in 1979 and 185 days with Leonid Popov on Soyu…]]></summary>

It’s the final leg of a journey of thousands of miles, as the butterflies travel from their North American breeding grounds to their winter colonies, where they cover the fir trees.  Visitors who time their trips correctly may find the air so laden with monarchs that they can hear the flapping wings of butterflies.
“It’s a to-do list,” said Andrew Davis, an ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens.  “Imagine being surrounded by billions of butterflies. It’s a magical experience.

BEIJING — China’s two largest cities are tightening some Covid measures again, just days after loosening them as the virus appeared under control. 
Shanghai, which emerged from a two-month lockdown early this month, said Thursday that seven of its 16 districts would conduct mass testing this weekend, according to state media. 
Those areas included financial and downtown districts.  During the testing period, residents in affected areas will need to stay home until the testing is over, the city said in the comments section of an official release.

The analysis, based on government health surveys conducted from 2017 to 2020, estimated that 1.4% of 13-17 year olds and 1.3% of 18-24 year olds were transgender, compared to around 0.5 % of all adults.  .
These figures show a significant increase since researchers previous report in 2017, although the analyzes used different methods.

The Abraham Accords could enable Israel to share missile defense technology with Arab Gulf countries in a joint defensive architecture against Iran.

(CNN)Senior US officials have conveyed to Saudi Arabia that the US is prepared to move forward with a "reset" of the relationship, and effectively move on from the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in order to repair ties with the key Middle East ally, senior US officials tell CNN. 
The planning for a reset is a dramatic about-face for President Joe Biden, who came into office vowing to make Saudi Arabia a "pariah" over Khashoggi's murder. 
His administration also released an intelligence report last year that directly accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of orchestrating Khashoggi's killing.

The decision was met with joy in the travel industry,  who for months has been lobbying the administration to get rid of the testing rule.

Algeria said its decision was due to Spain's "unjustifiable turnaround" over the Western Sahara region. Earlier this year, Spain recognized Morocco's plans for the disputed territory, sparking tensions with Algeria. 
Algeria has suspended its 20-year-old cooperation treaty with Spain, the country's presidency announced Wednesday. 
The decision came after Madrid reversed its long-standing policy of neutrality on the Western Sahara conflict in March by backing Morocco's position.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Game 3, the Celtics reclaimed that advantage.
“We had to do it,” Smart said of the physicality with which Boston outplayed Golden State.  “Match 2, they brought us the heat.  For us, it left a bad taste in our mouths because what we hang our hats on is defensive effort and being a physical team.
Golden State couldn’t match it, not long enough anyway.
Golden State outscored Boston by 43 points in the third quarter of this series and took the lead in Game 3, 83-82, on a 3-pointer from Curry.  This basket had followed a rapid sequence of 7 points without Boston taking possession.  Curry was fouled shooting a 3-pointer, and since the foul was flagrant, Golden State recovered the ball and scored another 3.
But late in the quarter, Golden State’s grip on the game slipped.
“Take the hits, keep fighting,” Williams said was the message in the group after the third quarter.  “Obviously they’re a great team that do runs, lots of runs, but just take the hit.”
Golden State couldn’t get through the defense or stop the Celtics from getting a second chance.  Hustle games usually went to Boston.
At one point in the fourth quarter, several players got tangled up on a loose ball, and Smart found it before Draymond Green pushed it.  It was Green’s sixth foul, and the crowd laughed at him after spending the night shouting curses at him.
Golden State’s Klay Thompson complained about fans swearing at “kids in the crowd.”
“Really classy.  Good job, Boston,” he said.

Newsweek: Ukraine's At Risk of Losing War With Russia: Military Official 
Russia's attack on Ukraine has become a war of artillery, and Ukraine is at risk of losing, according to the deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence. 
Vadym Skibitsky told The Guardian in an interview published Friday that Ukraine is now heavily reliant on weapons provided by the West in its counteroffensive against Russia.
Russia, meanwhile, currently outranks Ukraine in terms of artillery supplies, according to the official. 
"Everything now depends on what [the West] gives us," Skibitsky said. "Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our Western partners have given us about 10 percent of what they have."

Reuters: Sri Lanka Risks Full-Blown Humanitarian Emergency, UN Agency Says 
GENEVA (Reuters) - Sri Lanka is at risk of tipping into a full-blown humanitarian crisis as the country's economy suffers its biggest shock in decades, the U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said on Friday. 
Sri Lanka's 22 million people are suffering the country's most serious financial turmoil in seven decades, with severe shortages of fuel, medicines and other essentials amid record inflation and a devaluation of its currency. 
"Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. We are concerned that this could develop into a full-blown humanitarian emergency," OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told a regular U.N. news conference in Geneva.

A senior Chinese economist at a U.S.-China forum proposed that Beijing take over Taiwan and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) if Washington sanctions Beijing as it has Moscow.
 “If the United States and the West impose destructive sanctions on China as they treat Russia, we must recover Taiwan,” said China’s economist Chen Wenling on May 30 at a forum hosted by the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, according to state outlets. 
“Especially in the reconstruction of industry and supply chains, we must seize TSMC, a firm that inherently belongs to China.”

* Soaring food and energy prices drove the increase, with groceries up 11.9% and gasoline rising 48.7% 
* But core inflation, excluding food and energy, was also higher than expected at 6% annual rate 
* It is the strongest signal yet that inflation has not yet peaked, as Biden previously claimed 
* On Friday Biden plans to speak at the Port of Los Angeles to highlight supply chain initiatives

“Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” said Skibitsky. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.”
