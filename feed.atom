        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive in the country's south-east, hoping to re-take the strategically important city of Kherson.
 
It comes as United Nations inspectors head to the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia over concerns the facility has been damaged. 

“Anyone want to know what our plans are, you won’t hear specifics from any truly responsible person because this is war, and this is how it is during the war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

“But the occupiers should know we will push them to the border.” 

Russian shelling at the nuclear plant has forced some Ukrainians to flee and start camping miles away, with one person saying it’s “scary, very scary” and that even men were “afraid”.]]></summary>

“One of the four engines on the new space launch system rocket failed to cool down sufficiently, and they need to do that because when they fire the engines, it blasts through super cold fluid,” Mr Nagle told Sky News Australia. 

“So, you don’t want to shock the engine, and they just couldn’t quite get that fourth engine down to the temperature they wanted to.”]]></summary>

Daily Mail: France warns it may have to RATION energy this winter

France has warned companies they may have to ration energy this winter as Russia continues to squeeze its supply to Europe, causing record-high prices. 
France's Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Monday company urged bosses to take steps to reduce their energy consumption.
'If we act collectively then we can overcome the risk of shortages, but unless everyone takes part and if all the bad-case scenarios come together then we could be forced to impose reductions on consumers,' she told the Medef business group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Commander in charge of Afghanistan withdrawal says he warned Biden NOT to take out all troops and keep a small force of 2,500 and blames Joe and Trump for the chaos in Kabul 
* Gen. Frank McKenzie has retired since overseeing the Afghanistan withdrawal 
* In an interview Sunday to mark the anniversary, he said he advised against exit 
* He said the U.S. should have left a small force to prop up Kabul government 
* And he said the departure was a rare source of agreement for Biden and Trump 
* 'So we had a continuity of objective across two administrations that really allowed the events that occurred to occur in the manner that they did,' he said 
Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander who oversaw the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, on Sunday laid the blame for the Taliban takeover with Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden and their mistaken decision to remove all troops from the country.
Tuesday marks the first anniversary of the last American soldier flying out of Kabul, at the end of a chaotic evacuation. 
'I advised against withdrawing,' said McKenzie in an interview with Fox News to mark the event.

One of Iraq's most powerful figures, who has been at the centre of a long crisis over forming a government, says he is retiring from political life. 
Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand Shia cleric with millions of followers, announced his decision on Twitter. 
Several people were reported killed in clashes after his supporters stormed the presidential palace. 
Hundreds have been camped outside parliament for weeks after previously storming it in protest at the deadlock. 
Mr Sadr's announcement comes two days after he called for all parties and figures involved in political life following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq to quit.

Insider: Satellite images show holes in the roof of a building at the Ukrainian nuclear power plant Russian troops have been using as a shield 
* New satellite images show damage to the roof of a building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. 
* The plant in southern Ukraine, which is Europe's biggest, has been occupied by Russia for months. 
* It has also been the site of recent fighting, which has led watchdog agencies to voice concern. 
Satellite images published on Monday show local fires and damage to a building at southern Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which occupying Russian troops have been using as a shield. 
One image captured by Maxar Technologies and obtained by Insider shows a handful of holes in the roof of a building at the power plant, which has suffered damage from fires and explosions amid ongoing fighting and shelling in the area. 
A few of the holes appear to have darkened scorch marks around them, but it is unclear exactly what caused them.

The master bedroom also has a balcony overlooking the pool and surrounding rolling lawn. 
The estate begins with a gated driveway which leads to two separate paths – one goes to the front of the house and the other leads to a detached three car garage.

An inspection team from the UN nuclear watchdog is on its way to Ukraine's embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the organisation's head said. 
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the team was expected to arrive at the plant later this week. 
"We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine's and Europe's biggest nuclear facility," he tweeted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Odessa Jornal: Turkey, for the first time in 39 years, will raise the fee for passage through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Five times more 
Turkey will five times increase the cost of passage through the Black Sea Straits in October, the Sabah newspaper reports, citing sources in the Turkish Ministry of Transport. 
The increase in fees for the lighthouse, medical care, and evacuation of merchant ships is provided for by the Montreux Convention, which regulates navigation in the straits.  According to the media, Turkey has abolished the payment system for collecting fees for passage through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which was introduced in 1983. 
Turkey calculates the toll in French francs. In 1983, the franc was set at $0.8. Due to inflation and the rise in the price of gold, fees have practically depreciated. From October 7, 2022, the franc exchange rate will be set at four dollars.

* NASA scrubbed the Artemis I mission at 8:35am ET due to a leaking engine on the $22.2B rocket 
* The issue was not tested in the last dress rehearsal, so engineers need more time to formulate a fix 
* NASA is now eyeing Friday, September 2 at 12:48pm ET for the second attempt of the Artemis I launch 
* The Artemis I mission is a vital first step if US space agency is to land humans on the moon in three years' time 
* It has been 50 years since people last walked on the lunar surface, when Apollo 17 landed in December 1972 
NASA was forced to postpone its highly anticipated Artemis I mission Monday following a leak in engine 3 that was not detected in the last wet dress rehearsal due to testing being cut short because of a separate hydrogen leak. 
The issue was identified around 7:30am ET and the launch was officially scrubbed at 8:35am ET. Now the hundreds of thousands of people who attended the event are heading home without seeing the first stage of the epic moon mission kick off.

Faced with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Scholz urged the EU's 27 members to "close ranks, resolve old conflicts and find new solutions", setting out his vision for the future of Europe in a speech at the Charles University in Prague. 
"Our Europe is united in peace and freedom and is open to all European nations who share our values," he said.  Germany had undergone a "fundamental change of heart" in recent months on its military support for Ukraine, he said.

Ethnic Estonians and Russian-speakers differ over the war in Ukraine, prompting government fears over integration.

After the US Federal Reserve stepped up hawkish comments on the inflation outlook, risky assets were sold across the board and crypto is still reeling.
A fairly non-volatile weekend did little to improve the mood, and BTC price action returned to focus on areas below $20,000.
In doing so, several weeks of upside have effectively disappeared and, in turn, traders and analysts expect a retest of the macro lows seen in June this year.
While all is now quiet on the Fed front until September’s rate hike decision, there is still plenty of room for upheaval as geopolitical uncertainty and inflation linger, the latter continuing to rise. increase in Europe.

When North Carolina redrew the state’s legislative districts after the 2010 census, it was still under the “preclearance” regime created by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, meaning the new map has been reviewed and approved by the US Department of Justice.

    This column will discuss some federal government policies that impact our economy.  Policies have different consequences for different people.  However, the column is not about Economics 101. Instead, I hope to raise some ethical questions.  If more people benefit than lose from a policy, are we supporting what is best for the majority?  What if the majority gains a little but the minority loses a lot?
Is saving an existing job by limiting imports more important than creating new jobs through increased exports?  What should we do to ensure that the highly visible inflation rate does not blind us to the less visible unemployment rate?  Often, the consequences of policies are uncertain.

Radio Free Asia: Letter says Chinese Communist Party is too powerful, warns against personality cult 
While CCP leader Xi Jinping isn't named, the letter appears as he gears up to seek a third term in office.  As ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping prepares to seek an unprecedented third term in office, three veteran party members have spoken out against the ongoing centralization of power and signs of a personality cult around the general secretary. 
 An open letter jointly penned by CCP elders Dong Hongyi, Ma Guiquan and Tian Qizhuang calls on the party to amend its charter, deleting the phrase "the party will lead in everything," which it criticizes as granting "unlimited power" to the ruling party.  "This phrase first appeared during the Cultural Revolution on Mao Zedong's instructions so as to restore order as soon as possible ... but has no wider meaning," the letter, posted by the rights website Weiquanwang, said.

Modified: 08/28/2022 16:00:41



    My name is Keith Pontbriand.  I was held in the Hampshire County Jail, so I know the three candidates for the position of sheriff very well. 
I choose to endorse Mrs. Yvonne Gittelson for sheriff.  She’s the best candidate because of what I saw her do while I was incarcerated.  She was a highly respected person among staff and the prison population because of her passion for her work, the respect she showed us and the trust she had in us, as well as the challenges she gave us. 
I’ve seen her with hard-core criminals with no security personnel, just cameras, and she’s never scared, which makes the inmates and staff respect her.  She is dedicated to charting a positive course for everyone she works with. 
I sincerely believe that Mrs. Yvonne is the answer to the change that must be brought to the prison.  I saw her pushing for inmate education when she had little help.  She helped me get my Hi-SET (GED) while I was there, and I’m proud to show my son that I finally got there. 
She wanted remand inmates to be able to get an education instead of sitting around doing nothing.  I’ve been sober for over 24 months today and it’s thanks to the pills she gave us.  The addiction programs offered on the tablet have helped me a lot. 
The things she accomplished were nothing short of a miracle with many inmates.  I hope everyone takes the time to get to know this woman like I do.  We need a nurturing but firm female sheriff, and that’s Mrs. Yvonne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 and one of the goals of Artemis is to put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface.


		The name Artemis was chosen to echo that of the Apollo program.


		Here is an overview of the Artemis program:

Artemis 1: test flight


		Blastoff is scheduled for 8:33 am (1233 GMT) on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.


		Orion will orbit the Moon before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis 2: first crew


		The four members of the crew will be named before the end of the year. A Canadian is expected to be among them.

Artemis 3: Moon landing


		NASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.


		Artemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.


SpaceX Moon lander


		SpaceX's Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.

Gateway space station


		The launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.


		Astronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.

Destination Mars

		The ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the "next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars."


		The goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.


		While a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.]]></summary>

The State Department said a 'peaceful' Arctic region is of 'critical strategic importance' to the United States 
The Biden administration has announced plans to establish a new ambassador-at-large position to represent the Arctic region amid growing geopolitical tensions with two other large players in the area, China and Russia. 
"To further American interests and cooperation with Allies and partners in the Arctic, and after extensive consultations with Members of Congress, local and federal government officials, and external stakeholders, the President plans to elevate the Arctic Coordinator position by appointing an Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate," the State Department wrote in a press release on Friday.

CNN  — At least 23 people have died and 140 been injured in violent clashes between rival Libyan militias across the country’s capital of Tripoli, the Libyan Ministry of Health said Saturday. 
Intense fighting erupted in the capital overnight as rival factions exchanged intense gunfire and several loud explosions resounded across the city. 
Pictures and videos circulating on social media show the extent of the clashes with dozens of buildings, including residential ones, destroyed and several cars smashed and burned. 
Libya has been split between warring factions since 2014, following the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Moammar Gadhafi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States plans to name an ambassador at large for the Arctic, reflecting the region's growing strategic and commercial importance as its shrinking opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the region, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, a day after visiting the Arctic, saying Russian capabilities there pose a strategic challenge to the 30-nation alliance.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a "special military operation," has heightened Western concerns about Russian ambitions around the world.
China, which describes itself as a "near-Arctic" state, also has ambitions in the region and has said it intended to build a "Polar Silk Road." China has its eye on mineral resources and new shipping routes as ice caps recede with rising temperatures.
In a statement on Friday, the U.S. State Department said President Joe Biden planned elevate the area's importance within the U.S. government by nominating an ambassador-at-large for the Arctic region, subject to the Senate's advise and consent.
It did not say who would be nominated.
"An Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative is of critical strategic importance to the United States," the Department said.
"As one of eight Arctic nations, the United States has long been committed to protecting our national security and economic interests in the region, combating climate change, fostering sustainable development and investment, and promoting cooperation with Arctic States, Allies, and partners," it said.
The eight Arctic nations are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.

Francis has raised the possibility of retiring due to his declining health, a path taken by his predecessor Benedict XVI. If he were to do so, a conclave involving all cardinals aged under 80 would be called to pick a successor.
Sixteen of the 20 cardinals created Saturday would be eligible for that conclave based on their ages.
The ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica is the 85-year-old pope's eighth since being elected in 2013 and includes clergy known for their pastoral work and, in some cases, progressive views.
All parts of the globe are represented, including new cardinals from Brazil and Nigeria, Singapore and East Timor, am…]]></summary>

Investment in nuclear power declined after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, as fears over its safety increased and governments ran scared.
But following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, the subsequent squeeze on energy supplies and Europe's push to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, the tide is now turning back in favour of nuclear.
Governments face difficult decisions with rising gas and electricity bills and scarce resources threatening to cause widespread suffering this winter.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Russia's capabilities in the North are a strategic challenge for NATO, its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, welcoming Canada's recently announced investments in North American defense systems after making his first visit to the Canadian arctic.
"The importance of the high North is increasing for NATO and for Canada because we see a significant Russian military buildup," Stoltenberg said, standing alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Cold Lake, Alberta.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the arctic, using the region to test new weapons systems, Stoltenberg said. He also warned that Russia and China were forming a strategic arctic partnership that challenged NATO's values and inter…]]></summary>

LIMA (Reuters) - LGBT activists in Peru held a protest on Friday questioning how their government handled the death of a Peruvian transgender man in Indonesia earlier this month who was detained at the airport upon arriving to celebrate his honeymoon.
Rodrigo Ventosilla, a Peruvian graduate student at Harvard University and transgender rights activist, died on the tourist island of Bali of "bodily failure" days after being detained for alleged cannabis possession.
Peru's foreign ministry issued a statement this week calling Ventosilla's alleged drug possession a serious crime in Indonesia and that transphobia had not been a factor in his arrest, but did not acknowledge he had later died while in custody.
"We reject and condemn the foreign ministry's statement," said LGBT activist Luz Manriquez at a small protest in Lima.
Manriquez said the government's statement was biased because it adopted Indonesia's position and did not demand an investigation.
"It lacks empathy because it does not recognize that a Peruvian has died in the hands of police from another country," Manriquez added.
Brenda Alvarez, a lawyer for Ventosilla's family, told reporters on Friday the foreign ministry had agreed to apologize over the statement and launch an investigation.
Peru's foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
Alvarez added there is no date for when Ventosilla's body will arrive in Lima.
The Indonesian police told Reuters this week the case is closed and that no violence was involved in Ventosilla's death.
"Even if you are detained in another country, it is unreal and painful that (the Peruvian government) can leave you like this," said Arturo Davila, a member of Diversidades Trans Masculinas, a trans rights organization that Ventosilla founded seven years ago in Peru.

        <updated>2022-08-26T17:19:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argentine authorities seized 1.6 tons of cocaine hidden in animal feed destined for Dubai and detained 12 people, police said on Friday.
The seizure, which took place overnight from Thursday to Friday in the central city of Rosario, highlights the role played by Argentine ports in trafficking South American drugs internationally.
The cocaine "is worth approximately $60 million," said Mariano Giuffra, head of the dangerous drugs department in the federal police.
The arrests took place at various sites around the country.
"They are all Argentines and some of them are known drug traffickers," added Giuffra.
Several firearms, sports cars and a large amount of cash were also seized.
Rosario, located 310 kilometers (190 miles) from Buenos Aires, is Argentina's third-largest city and the main port for agricultural exports to the Atlantic.
It is also the most violent city in Argentina, with a murder rate three times the national average.
The cocaine had been hidden in bags of corn fodder that was about to be loaded onto a container destined for Dubai.
Police said the cocaine probably originated in Colombia, the world's largest producer of the drug.
While most cocaine is produced by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia -- where growing coca leaf, which is the main ingredient in the white powder, is legal -- experts say Argentina has increasingly taken on an important role in trafficking the drug.
Argentina has several major ports, has a large supply of quality chemicals needed to turn coca leaf into cocaine, and provides ample opportunities for money laundering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant occupied by Moscow's troops came back online on Friday afternoon, the state operator said, after Kyiv claimed it was cut from the national power grid by Russian shelling.
The plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- was severed from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its history on Thursday due to "actions of the invaders", Energoatom said.
In an update, the operator said that as of 2:04 pm (1104 GMT) the plant "is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine" once again.
French President Emmanuel Macron warned "civil nuclear power must be fully protected".
"War in any case must not undermine the nuclear safety of the country, the region and all of us," he said during a visit to Algeria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Umit Bektas
MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Actors in a heavily bombarded city in southern Ukraine have returned to the stage, putting on their first performance since Russia's invasion in an underground shelter converted into a tiny theatre.
A few dozen theatre-goers descended steep concrete steps into the subterranean venue on Thursday for the opening night of a show put on by the Mykolaiv Art Drama Theatre. Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.
"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller," said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.
Theatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as "art-therapy", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.
Ievhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.
"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun'," he said. "There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six weeks after the Vél d’Hiv roundup in Paris, the Vichy regime committed another unspeakable crime by arresting some 6,000 Jews in the non-occupied zone on August 26, 1942 – an event that remains little-known in France, 80 years on.
As a Resistance fighter in Lyon, rescuing Jews was at the core of René Nodot’s mission. But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.
“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Family members of 10 miners who have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for three weeks said on Thursday they rejected a government plan to find the miners that they said officials described as lasting from six to 11 months.
Three miners had been rescued and hospitalized, the Security and Citizen Protection Ministry said in an update on the rescue efforts at the mine in the Sabinas municipality of the northern state of Coahuila.
Television footage showed family members outside the mine clamoring for information on the missing men.
"I hope we find them safe," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier on Twitter. Lopez Obrador had said nine miners were likely to be trapped, but authorities revised the number later.
Some 92 soldiers were working at the scene, as well as specialists and rescue dogs, the president said.
The Labor Ministry said it had not received any complaints about safety at the mine, which began operations in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia on Friday tapped a former high court judge to investigate ex-prime minister Scott Morrison's decision to secretly appoint himself to several key ministerial portfolios.
Incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the creation of the inquiry, saying the country's system of "parliamentary democracy" had been tested.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, conservative leader Morrison appointed himself to the ministries of health, treasury, finance, resources and home affairs without telling colleagues or the public.
Albanese said the inquiry was essential "to ensure that this can never happen again".
The probe will be led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and will report by November 25.
"We need to have a quick and appropriate inquiry," said Albanese, adding this is "not about the politics, but how this happened, why this happened and who knew about it."

He did not rule out Morrison or other former government ministers from being compelled to give evidence if necessary.
Morrison has insisted he was right to take "emergency powers" during the tumult of the pandemic.
"I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest," he said in a defiant first public appearance after the scandal broke, dismissing critics who were "standing on the shore after the fact".
Three of Morrison's fellow conservative prime ministers have also criticized the former premier's behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an opening night like no other at Mykolaiv's theatre, with the audience ushered down into an underground shelter this week for the first performance since war broke out.
"We need this place to fight on the cultural front too," says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.
The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides "a form of 'art therapy'" for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.
Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.

But this year's crop is devastated, another casualty of a blistering heatwave that has engulfed southern China in the country's hottest summer on record and subsumed half its land in drought.
"This is absolutely the first time in my life encountering such a disaster," he tells AFP.
"This year is a very miserable one.
"We should be harvesting fruits right now, but it's all gone, dead from the scorching sun."
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, forcing power cuts that have hit agricultural workers hard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A two-week negotiating session on a treaty to protect the high seas wraps up Friday, with UN observers holding their breath that the long-stalled deal can cross the finish line.
After 15 years, including four prior formal sessions, negotiators have yet to reach a legally binding agreement to address the growing environmental and economic challenges involving the high seas, also known as international waters -- a zone which encompasses almost half the planet.
Many had hoped that this fifth session, which began on August 15 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, would be the last and yield a final text on "the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction," or BBNJ for short.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a radiation disaster as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine's Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut.
Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia's military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe's largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and keep the plant safe.
"If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident," he said in an evening address. "Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes slammed Republicans for a history of giving favorable treatment to CEOs and other wealthy people.
During an appearance on Real America's Voice, Cortes said that Democrats were "smart" to forgive student loans for many borrowers.
"Privileged people, many of whom chose to go and pursue worthless degrees are getting a handout from Joe Biden," he told podcast host Steve Bannon. "In terms of political payoffs, and that's what this is, a crass political payoff, at least the Democrats are smart enough to payoff American voters."
"Establishment Republicans, they pay off CEOs and defense contractors," Cortes continued. "This about that contrast. If you're going to do power politics and you're going to do crass payoffs, at least the Democrats know where their bread is buttered and they're going to pay off voters."
The ex-Trump adviser added: "What Mitch McConnell does and establishment Republicans do is they reward the CEOs of places like Northrop Grumman and therein lies one of the key reasons why in America, as you often talk about, the Republicans have won election after election for decades while we are losing our country."
As president, former President Donald Trump signed a tax cut law that reportedly helps billionaires pay less in taxes than the working class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.
Roizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.
The court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.
Roizman denies all the charges.
On Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words "war" and "invasion" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
State news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.
Roizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.
Russia's defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.
"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine," Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.
"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families."
Brown said the human toll of the attack was "just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine."
She cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.
"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain," she said.
