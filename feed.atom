Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online website Ukrayinska Pravda that the Russian president was targeted shortly after his nation invaded its neighbour. 

He went on to say the Russian leader was attacked by representatives from the Caucasus region, which sits between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.

“This is non-public information. (An) Absolutely unsuccessful attempt, but it really took place … it was about two months ago,” Mr Budanov said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles says it is “important” that America has presence in east Asia, following President Joe Biden’s recent remarks about the United States’ willingness to defend Taiwan militarily against China. 

Mr Biden was asked whether the US would be willing to get its military involved to defend Taiwan during a press briefing before the Quad meeting on Monday, to which he responded: "Yes - it's a commitment we made".

When questioned if Australia would respond in the same way if China invaded Taiwan, Mr Marles said the Americans have made an “important statement”, however, he doesn’t think it’s wise to start “commenting on hypotheticals”. 

“It is important that the Americans have made the statement that they have because what it represents is an American presence in the region which is something which is very much in our national interest,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That’s what we want to encourage and that’s why the Quad is important and that’s why it was so important that Anthony Albanese attends the Quad so shortly after the election. 

“We work very closely with the United States. I think it’s important to not walk down hypothetical paths but it’s also very important to make clear that we stand with the United States, and that we have a very close alliance with the United States.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany says Joe Biden's gaffes are "alarming" and "weird to watch" after the White House was forced to clarify another remark made by the president.

President Biden had confirmed the United States would come to the defence of Taiwan if China were to invade the territory.

Mr Biden was asked whether the US would be willing to get its military involved to defend Taiwan during a press briefing on Monday, to which he responded: “Yes – it’s a commitment we made”.

The White House has since released a statement confirming Mr Biden’s comments do not reflect a change in US policy.

"It's always an unnamed, anonymous White House official that cleans up the blunder," Ms McEnany said. 

"These gaffes are alarming. They're weird to watch."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yahoo: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been 'slow and unsuccessful,' Pentagon says 
WASHINGTON — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to be hampered by consistent military assistance to Ukraine from allies in Europe and elsewhere, U.S. military leaders said on Monday after a meeting with allies who made new pledges of weaponry as the war in Eastern Europe is on the cusp of entering its fourth month. 
“We remain committed, resolved and united in our assistance to Ukraine,” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley said at a Pentagon briefing after a second meeting of the Ukraine Contact Group, a consortium that now includes nearly 50 nations, most of them in Europe, committed to defending Ukraine against the invasion that the Kremlin launched in late February.

WNU Editor: I understand the Pentagon needs to paint an optimistic picture on the war in order to maintain public support, but in the month of May I have been seeing consistent and critical Russian military successes on the battlefield. 
It was only last week that thousands of Ukraine's best fighters surrendered en-masse at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, and there are now reports that thousands of Ukrainian fighters are about to be surrounded (if not already) at a key city in the Donbas .... Here’s how Russia is zeroing in on key Ukrainian stronghold Severodonetsk (The Print). And then there is this sobering on the ground report from Euronews on how dire the situation is becoming in eastern Ukraine (see video below). 
If this is slow and unsuccessful, then why the rush to send tens of billions in arms? Why escalate a greater involvement in this conflict? 
My gut tells me that the Pentagon leadership are very worried on the military situation that is unfolding right now, and are trying their best to assist the Ukrainians as best as they could to contain the Russian military and their offensive in the Donbas. But will it be enough? I have my doubts.]]></summary>

For this reason, Russia should rely entirely on its own resources, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council underscored 
MOSCOW, May 20. /TASS/. The sanctions imposed on Russia will apparently stay in effect for a very long time, possibly, decades, and the special military operation in Ukraine is not the reason, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said at a meeting of the inter-departmental commission for creating a national system of protection from new infections in Moscow on Friday. 
"We are well aware that the introduced sanctions will apparently stay in effect for a very long time. And this is not connected with Russia’s special operation in Ukraine. Obviously, these sanctions will last long, the way it was in the past, including the Soviet era. In other words, for decades," he stated.   Read more ....   
Update #1: Medvedev urged to prepare for decades of sanctions – Hindustan News/The Moscow Times  
Update #2: Russian Security Council V.C. Medvedev names the duration of anti-Russian sanctions - Pravda   
WNU Editor: Iran has been experiencing sanctions for decades, and they have adjusted. In the case of Russia the population will adjust also. 
As for when sanctions will be removed? 
It will not happen with Putin in power. It will also not happen if one of the Western demands is Russia gives-up Crimea. This is non-negotiable not only to the Kremlin, but also to almost every Russian citizen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al Jazeera/Bloomberg: Ruble surges as Russia considers looser capital controls  
The ruble’s rebound has left it more than 30 percent stronger against the dollar than it was before Russia invaded Ukraine. 
The ruble’s blistering rebound picked up pace on Monday, ratcheting up pressure on Russia to ease a key capital-flow control that’s underpinned the currency’s recovery. 
With the gains now threatening to hurt budget revenue and exporters, a decision to cut the share of hard-currency earnings that exporters convert into rubles could come as early as this week, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The mandated proportion could be reduced to 50% from 80% currently, the people said, who requested anonymity because the details of the plan aren’t public.

Update #1: Russian rouble leaps to near 7-year high vs euro (Reuters)  
Update #2: How Russia made its ruble the world’s top-performing currency (Quartz)   
WNU Editor: My friends/family/and contacts in Russia are telling me that the worse of the economic crisis has passed. That prices have stabilized and there are no shortages in the stores. Many foreign firms have left, but everyone is telling me that the economy has adjusted, and Western goods that are blacklisted are still entering the country from other countries like China. 
I am also reading reports that the Russian Central Bank is buying foreign currencies to halt the rise of the Russian ruble. I do not know who is buying rubles (my gut tells me that it is China), but it is a clear violation of Western sanctions. 
Bottom line. 
The upward trajectory of the Russian ruble was certainly not expected, and worse, the perception now is that Europe is facing dire economic consequences because of it. And while Ukraine President Zelensky is calling for more sanctions, I think some European leaders are beginning to understand that these measures are not working.]]></summary>

Biden hasn’t discarded longtime policy toward Taiwan, but it sounds like he has.
 President Joe Biden had sought to make his first Asia tour about forging a new economic framework for the region, deepening relations with the heads of state of Japan and South Korea, and advancing diplomacy among countries in the Indo-Pacific. But one off-script comment derailed those goals. 
On Monday at a news conference in Tokyo, Biden was asked by a journalist: “Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?” 
“Yes,” said Biden. “That’s the commitment we made.”
Biden’s remark might be a big deal. US policy t…]]></summary>

RFE: France's European Minister: A Ukraine EU Bid Would Take At Least 15-20 Years  
France’s European affairs minister said that any bid for Ukraine to join the European Union would take at least 15 to 20 years to complete, putting a damper on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's hopes of gaining a quick entry into the bloc. 
"We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying," Clement Beaune told France’s Radio J on May 22. 
"It's probably in 15 or 20 years -- it takes a long time."  "I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies," he added.

CNBC: IMF says global economy faces ‘confluence of calamities’ in biggest test since World War II 
* In a blog post ahead of this week’s World Economic Forum, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its “biggest test since the Second World War.” 
* In combining the Russia-Ukraine war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the spike in volatility in financial markets and persistent threat from climate change, the IMF said the world faces a “potential confluence of calamities.” 
The International Monetary Fund has warned against “geoeconomic fragmentation” as policymakers and business leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
In a blog post ahead of this week’s event, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its “biggest test since the Second World War,” with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine compounding the residual economic effects of Covid-19 crisis, dragging down growth and driving inflation to multi-decade highs.

Inter RAO, which was the only importer of electricity from Russia to Lithuania, confirmed the suspension of deliveries. Earlier this month, Inter RAO’s Nordic branch also stopped supplying electricity to Finland.

   CNN: Biden admin considering sending US special operations forces to protect US embassy in Kyiv 
(CNN)The Biden administration is in the early stages of discussions about sending special operations forces into Ukraine to help guard the US Embassy in Kyiv, several US officials tell CNN. 
The discussions are in very preliminary stages and a proposal has not been presented to President Joe Biden for a decision, the sources added. 
For now, the embassy and its limited number of personnel are protected by State Department diplomatic security officials. 
The discussion centers around whether an increase in security is needed if the number of personnel increase, and whether special operations forces are best equipped to fulfill those requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The key part from yesterday's interview is this ....  .... Tom Cotton: It’s important that we support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this war of aggression by Vladimir Putin. So, first off I do understand the reservations some people had about the legislation. And there was some excessive or unnecessary measures. But a lot of that money went to support our own military and our own troops to replenish the stockpiles of our weapons that those troops need to defend themselves and protect our country. And not just support our allies in Europe but in the Western Pacific, Taiwan in particular. Second, I think it is important that we help the Ukrainians fight their own war. This is much like what Ronald Reagan did in Afghanistan… And finally, I think our main adversary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party is watching very carefully what is happening in Europe. If they see the United States and our allies falter in our resolve to support Ukraine in defending itself against an invasion by Russia, then I think Xi Jinping would believe that there is no way we would come to the aid of Taiwan.  
As to what is my take. 
China is watching closely the West's response to the Russia - Ukraine war. But when it comes to Taiwan Beijing will act according to what is their national security interests, and if they feel threatened they will act irregardless on how the West will respond.]]></summary>

Insider: Sen. Mitt Romney suggests 'NATO could engage' in Ukraine, 'potentially obliterating Russia's struggling military' if Putin used nuclear weapons 
* Sen. Mitt Romney warned a "cornered and delusional" Putin could use nuclear weapons. 
* In a New York Times op-ed, Romney suggested strategies to face Putin in such a scenario. 
* Romney said continued support of Ukraine was necessary to avoid the subjugation of other countries. 
Republican Sen. Mitt Romney suggested in a New York Times essay that "NATO could engage" in Ukraine, "potentially obliterating Russia's struggling military" as an option against Russian President Vladimir Putin were he to deploy nuclear weapons. 
The Utah senator also suggested that the West confront China and other Russian-allied nations with an ultimatum. 
"You are either with us, or you are with Russia — you cannot be with both," Romney wrote. 
"Russia's use of a nuclear weapon would unarguably be a redefining, reorienting geopolitical event," Romney continued. "Any nation that chose to retain ties with Russia after such an outrage would itself also become a global pariah."

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia initiated payment on two of its external bonds on Friday in an attempt to stave off a looming sovereign default ahead of a key U.S. licence allowing such transfers expiring next week. 
The finance ministry said it channelled $71.25 million on coupon payout for dollar-denominated Eurobonds maturing in 2026 and 26.5 million euros ($28 million) on papers due in 2036. 
Russia has faced the prospect of sovereign default since Western capitals imposed sweeping sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 as well as Moscow introducing counter-measures. The country has been all but severed from the global financial fabric.

 * Female news presenters in Afghanistan are being made to cover their face on TV 
 * It comes after an order from the Taliban's Ministry of Vice and Virtue last week 
 * Women who resisted the rule were threatened with being sacked from their job 
 * It's the latest in a series of restrictions put on women in the central Asian country 
Female TV presenters in Afghanistan have appeared on air with their faces covered after the Taliban ordered them to do so or face punishment. 
Some broadcasters had refused to follow the new rules when they came into force yesterday, but did so today under pressure from the country's government. 
Women on TV in Afghanistan have presented programmes wearing hijabs, but a new edict ruling that all women must wear a face veil in public or risk punishment was extended to TV presenters from Saturday, meaning they now have to cover their mouths and nose as well.

WNU Editor: I would not be surprised if they are removed completely from the air in the coming months (or sooner).

This month, another threat emerged.  The weakening of the euro has raised expectations that it could reach parity with the US dollar.
Europe faces “a steady stream of bad news,” said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Credit Agricole.  “The euro is a pressure valve for all these concerns, all these fears.”
The currency, which is shared by 19 countries, has not fallen at or below a one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar in two decades.  At the time, in the early 2000s, the weak exchange rate undermine confidence in the new currency, which was introduced in 1999 to help bring unity, prosperity and stability to the region.

Other potential victims of such a ban would be things close to his heart: his populist campaign promises and financial sauce for culture warriors in Europe and the United States.
Both were fueled by Hungary’s profits on Russian crude.  Bursting with cash from cheap supplies of Russian oil and gas, Hungarian energy conglomerate MOL – one of central Europe’s largest and most profitable companies – announced last month that it would pay dividends of $652 million to its shareholders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese consumers “are pissed off, they’re worried about the future,” Dunne said.  “It’s a double whammy that Tesla faces in China.”
Tesla shares are reacting in part to the same forces rocking stock markets around the world: the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, the threat of recession, supply chain chaos and soaring coronavirus. ‘inflation.  But Tesla shares have fallen far more than other Silicon Valley giants like Apple or Alphabet, the company that owns Google.
Tesla accounted for three-quarters of electric cars sold in the United States last year.  The company is several years ahead of its competitors in battery and software technology.  But two models — the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle — accounted for 95% of Tesla’s sales.  Its next consumer vehicle, a pickup truck, has been repeatedly delayed and isn’t expected until next year at the earliest.
It’s an axiom in the automotive industry that new models drive sales.  And competition from Hyundai, Ford and Volkswagen is growing, giving drivers a lot more choice.
Jesse Toprak, an auto industry veteran who is a chief analyst at Autonomy, a company that offers electric cars by subscription, said Tesla’s market share will fall below 40% by the end of 2023. , although its sales will continue to grow as the overall market expands.
“They’ll have a smaller slice of a bigger pot,” Toprak said.  “But their virtual monopoly on U.S. EV sales will slowly diminish.”
Tesla already faces stiff competition in Europe, where electric vehicles account for 13% of new car sales.  This foreshadows what could happen in the United States, where battery car sales are just starting to take off.  Volkswagen, which has invested heavily in electric vehicles, sold 56,000 battery cars in Western Europe in the first three months of the year, second only to Tesla, which sold 58,000, according to figures compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research in Berlin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But determining when and in whom the mutations first appeared requires many more virus samples from farm workers, local residents and mink, collected before and after the outbreak.  “That data doesn’t exist,” said Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.
Throughout 2020, testing has been difficult for Americans to access, and few patient samples have been sequenced.  Surveillance in animals was even worse; until this springfederal officials have explicitly recommended against routinely testing animals for the virus.
“Large-scale testing was not available and then there was a shortage of some supplies,” Dr Behravesh said.  “So we didn’t want there to be, you know, a mad rush to test animals.”
Without more samples, it’s impossible to rule out the possibility that the variant originated in humans, who then spread it to mink, the scientists said.
A bigger puzzle is how the taxidermist and his wife got it.  The most likely possibility, according to several experts, is that the variant was circulating more widely in the human population than previously known, and that the couple caught it from another infected person.
Another possibility, more speculative, is that they have recovered the variant from another animal species.  “Taxisdermists deal with other dead animals,” said Linda Saif, a virologist and immunologist at Ohio State University.
But because the cases were detected “weeks to months” after the two fell ill, testing every animal they might have come into contact with “was not feasible or not indicated”, he said. said Lynn Sutfin, Michigan DHHS spokeswoman.

The spacecraft was built for NASA to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station.  But before it can do that, it has to perform a test flight without astronauts to show that all of its systems are working properly.
“Today we feel really good and have great confidence in the vehicle,” Mark Nappi, vice president and commercial crew program manager at Boeing, said at a press conference hours after the launch. launch.
Two thrusters failed during a maneuver to place Starliner in a stable orbit, but the spacecraft was able to self-adjust with its remaining thrusters, and it continued on its way.  Engineers are investigating what went wrong.

        <link href="https://www.newsrust.com/2022/05/my-new-favorite-tofu-new-york-times.html"/>
        <updated>2022-05-22T12:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are very few people in this world who can make tofu such an exciting subject as Samin Nosrat.  I felt that very strongly this week when I was able to discuss vegetarian cooking with Samin and Tejal Rao, our California food critic and author of The Veggie Newsletter, during a virtual New York Times Cooking event, in which tofu was a very hot topic.  (You can watch it here.) 
Samin described one of them favorite tofu cooking methodsin which semi-firm tofu is doused with liquid amino acids (a seasoning adjacent to soy sauce) and pan-fried in coconut oil, in terms so evocative and appetizing that I wanted to run downstairs and the prepare for lunch.
The next day I made Kay Chun’s latest tofu recipe, which is my new favorite, sautéed in a rich black pepper and ginger sauce and tossed with spring vegetables.  That and four other recipes for the week are below.  As always, tell me what you think of dearemily@nytimes.com.  I love hearing from you. 


1. Tofu and asparagus sautéed with black pepper
This stir-fry from Kay Chun nicely pairs the spongy tofu with the grassy crunch of asparagus and snow peas.  The best part, though, is the ginger-garlic pepper sauce, which could taste a piece of cardboard. 


4. Penne With Brussels Sprouts, Chili And Pancetta
You can buy pre-sliced ​​brussels for this five-star Melissa Clark pasta recipe, which I immediately fell in love with.  But really the best part is how Melissa unashamedly combines bold flavors as pancetta, garlic, chili peppers and rosemary work their way into the pan.  Forget the pancetta and this becomes a great vegetarian dinner. 
See this recipe.

When play ended on Saturday night, Pereira, who is 27 and competing in only his second major golf championship, had confidently, if not daringly, reclaimed the top spot in the standings.  After a third-round 69, he will enter Sunday’s final round with a three-stroke lead over England’s Zalatoris and Matthew Fitzpatrick.
Pereira, after a mid-round stumble, passed the other third-round contenders with back-to-back birdies on the 13th and 14th holes.  Then, with a crowded 18th green stand cheering him on, he capped off his day with a 27-foot birdie putt to move to nine under for the tournament.
Although Pereira, who is ranked 100th in the world, is not a household name in professional golf, he has three top-20 finishes on the PGA Tour this year and is a three-time winner of the Korn Ferry Tour, the world’s top tour. circuit minor leagues.
Zalatoris had a bumpy start on Saturday, shooting a four-of-39 on the front nine, but stabilized by healing some of his hitting issues to shoot a rocky 73.
After bugging his first two holes, Fitzpatrick was within five under for the rest of his round to shoot 67.
Young, whose father is David Young, the longtime golf professional at Sleepy Hollow Country Club in suburban New York, made a late charge when he hit the 296-yard par-4 17th hole while driving the green and making a short putt.  With four birdies in his round, Young shot 67 and was in fourth place at five under.
