He said there is a claim put forward by the Republican Party that Alphabet, Google and Gmail are “deliberately” sending their fundraising messages “off to the spam folder”. 

“Send them off into the trash file,” Mr Murray said. 

“This means that they believe that literally millions of people have not been getting the message to donate to Republicans or what the issues were or the endless failures of the mainstream media, to tell the truth about the economy under Joe Biden.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Heaven help those who go against the main stream media narrative. But Colombia Profesor Jeffrey Sachs is correct that all the people that he talks to around the world are convinced that the US is responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline attacks. I am getting the same response from all of my friends and contacts outside of Canada and the U.S.. After-all .... who benefits the most from this attack? And when you add in earlier promises made by President Biden and State Department official Victoria Nuland that the US would stop the Nord Stream pipelines if Russia invades Ukraine, the evidence is building. 
A prediction. We will eventually find out in the future on who was responsible for this attack. I give it two or three years when the truth comes out.
 Update: Yup. If you go against the narrative, you must be influenced by the Kremlin .... U.S. podcasters spread Kremlin narratives on Nord Stream sabotage (Brookings).]]></summary>

The Federation Council has approved agreements with four former Ukrainian regions on accepting them as new Russian territories 
The Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, has ratified unification treaties with Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. 
The treaties were signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the heads of the four former Ukrainian regions on Friday last week. 
They were certified as lawful by the Constitutional Court over the weekend and ratified by the State Duma, the lower house of the Parliament, on Monday.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The next step to finalize these treaties is Putin's signature.   Once Putin signs these documents, Russia will look at Ukraine control in these four regions as occupational forces, and will proceed from there. I expect the dynamics of this war will then be changing, even though Ukraine is racking up the victories right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.
Lead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.
Gahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.
"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil," he said of their 19th tour.
The band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words "Berlin 4.10.22".
Credited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, "Spirit", in 2017. "Memento Mori" will be their 15th studio record.
Depeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.
The band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as "Personal Jesus", "People Are People" and "Enjoy the Silence".
The group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

The Hill: Biden speaks with Zelensky, unveils $625 million weapons package to Ukraine 
President Biden and Vice President Harris spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday and unveiled a $625 million security assistance package to Ukraine amid Russia’s annexation of regions in the eastern and southern parts of the country. 
Biden and Harris underscored that the U.S. “will never recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory,” according to a White House readout of the conversation. 
 “President Biden pledged to continue supporting Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian aggression for as long as it takes, including the provision today of a new $625 million security assistance package that includes additional weapons and equipment, including [High Mobility Rocket Artillery Systems], artillery systems and ammunition, and armored vehicles,” the readout continued.

That is no mean feat, given that the Ethereum blockchain was burning through about as much electricity as New Zealand.
Sceptics had expected glitches with the upgrade, known as "the merge", but it ended up being a "rather boring event", according to Alex de Vries of the Free University in Amsterdam.
De Vries, whose Digiconomist website models the energy use of Bitcoin and Ethereum, said consumption had indeed plummeted by more than 99 percent on Ethereum.

Charles has fled China and several of his activist friends are in jail.
"After 2015, the whole of civil society began to collapse and become fragmented," he told AFP, using a pseudonym for safety reasons.

NYPost: Zelensky signs law that rules out Ukraine peace talks with Putin as ‘impossible’  
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seemingly shut the door on the prospect of having any peace talks with Vladimir Putin — but not with Russia under a different leadership. 
Zelensky signed a decree on Tuesday formally declaring negotiations with the Kremlin autocrat to be “impossible.” 
The decree formalized comments made by Zelensky on Friday after Putin proclaimed four partially occupied regions of Ukraine to be a part of Russia “forever,” in what Kyiv and the West dismissed as an illegitimate farce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia listed a small wallaby and the grey snake among 15 new threatened species on Tuesday as it launched a zero-extinction plan for its unique wildlife.
Many of Australia's species are clinging to existence, their habitats shrinking from human activity and extreme events such as the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires, wildlife groups say.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government announced a new 10-year scheme to try and halt the slide into extinction of 110 "priority species" and shield 20 "priority places" from further degradation.
It aims to prevent any new extinctions of plants and animals while conserving at least 30 percent of Australia's land mass.
Wildlife groups blame Australia's poor record in protecting its unique species largely on habitat destruction, accelerated by glob…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia was chosen on Tuesday to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games at a $500 billion futuristic megacity in the desert that planners say will feature a year-round winter sports complex.
"The deserts and mountains of Saudi Arabia will soon be a playground for winter sports," the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said in a statement on the decision made during its general assembly meeting in Phnom Penh.
The Saudi bid was "unanimously approved", the statement said, noting that the megacity known as NEOM will be the first West Asian city to host the event.
First announced in 2017, NEOM has consistently raised eyebrows for proposed flourishes like flying taxis and robot maids, even as architects and economists have questioned its feasibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for "experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science", the award-giving body said on Tuesday.
The more than century-old prize, worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($902,315), is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week after Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday.
The prestigious prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in the will of Alfred Nobel, who made a fortune from his invention of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 with a some interruptions, primarily the two world wars.
The physics prize has often taken centre stage among the awards, featuring household names of science such as Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie, and rewarding breakthroughs that have reshaped how we see the world.
Last year, scientists Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi shared the physics prize for their work on
complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate, key in understanding global warming.
Announced over consecutive weekdays in early October, the physics prize announcement will be followed by awards for chemistry, literature, peace and economics, the latter added in 1969 to the original line-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nuclear-armed North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years on Tuesday, prompting a warning for residents to take cover and a temporary suspension of train operations in northern Japan.
The Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific Ocean.
It was the first North Korean missile to follow such a trajectory since 2017, and Tokyo said its 4,600 km (2,850 miles) range may have been the longest distance travelled for a North Korean test flight, which are more often "lofted" higher into space to avoid flying over neighboring countries.
The latest launch was Pyongyang's fifth in 10 days, amid military muscle-flexing by the United States, South Korea, and Japa…]]></summary>

The agency that manages Ecuador's prisons, SNAI, gave the death toll in a statement which also said 21 people were injured in the clashes between inmates.
It had earlier announced that tactical units conducted operations to regain control of the facility, located in the Ecuadoran city of Latacunga.
The prison houses about 4,300 prisoners and is one of the largest in the country.
Violence in Ecuador's prisons, where drug gangs vie for power, is often carried out with knives and sometimes involves beheadings. The violence has left more than 400 prisoners dead since February 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Economy, inflation top of mind for midterm voters, giving GOP slight edge in new Monmouth poll 
* The poll found 47% of voters want or prefer Republicans to control Congress compared with 44% who want or prefer Democrats. 
* Overall, 82% of Americans ranked inflation as an extremely or very important issue, compared with 56% who ranked abortion as a top worry and 32% who said the coronavirus pandemic was a big concern. 
* Independents in particular are more than twice as likely to give preference to economic issues over threats to human rights and democracy, 61% to 29%. 
Economic issues like inflation are of top mind for midterm voters a month out from Election Day, giving Republicans a slight edge over Democrats in a new poll released Monday by Monmouth University. 
For the first time since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion, a majority of voters polled by Monmouth say they think Republicans should take back control of Congress. 
The poll found 47% of voters want or prefer Republicans to control Congress compared with 44% who want or prefer Democrats. 
It’s a 4 percentage point gain for Republicans, up from 43% in August, and a 6 percentage point loss for Democrats, down from 50%.  The poll was conducted from Sept. 21 to 25 and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

Update: GOP tops Democrats on generic congressional ballot as economic issues dominate: poll (The Hill)    
Update #2: Poll shows big shift in party preference for US midterms (RT)   
WNU editor: This is the opposite of a poll from last week that showed Democrats leading in a generic congressional ballot .... Democrats lead generic congressional ballot by 4 points: poll (The Hill). 
The Monmouth University poll is here .... Economic Issues Outweigh Concerns About Rights in Midterm Vote (Monmouth University).]]></summary>

While Biden allies have said he will seek a second term, the president has shied away from making a declaration. 
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden told the Rev. Al Sharpton that he will seek a second term in a private conversation at the White House last month, Sharpton informed his National Action Network staff in Washington later that day. 
“I’m going to do it again,” Biden said as he posed for a photograph in the Roosevelt Room with Sharpton, who is also an MSNBC host, according to an official of Sharpton’s National Action Network who recounted Sharpton’s description. “I’m going.” 
While Biden allies have said he will seek re-election, he has shied away from declaring it unequivocally, at least in part to avoid triggering campaign finance reporting laws. His remarks to Sharpton at the tail end of a meeting with the leaders of several of the country's most prominent civil rights organizations represent a stronger assertion that he will be on the ballot again.

Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Kremlin via REUTERS   
Daily Mail: NATO 'warns Putin may test a NUKE on Ukraine's borders' as Kremlin 'insiders' claim he 'is preparing to make decisions about launching a tactical nuclear strike while hidden in a bunker outside Moscow' 
* Putin is in a bunker outside Moscow mulling over nuclear decisions: report 
* He has list of 'necessary minimum' of Russian officials and family to save 
* Former President Dmitri Medvedev and love child Luiza Rozova fail to make cut 
* The dictator will be 70 on Friday amid ongoing rumours about his poor health 
Vladimir Putin could have decided to detonate a nuke on Ukraine's borders, NATO is believed to have warned its members, in an escalation designed to terrify the West. 
The warning comes as Putin was reportedly 'preparing to make key decisions about launching a tactical nuclear strike from a bunker' a long way outside Moscow. 
The Kremlin has been attempting to signal to its NATO adversaries that it was willing to brandish its one remaining trump card lately even as the Russian army suffers defeat after defeat at the hands of the Ukrainian army.

* North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile over Japan early Tuesday 
* Japanese government has warned citizens to evacuate inside or underground 
* The launch was part of a record-breaking streak of weapons tests by Pyongyang 
* It comes as South Korea ramps up military drills with the US 
North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years, prompting a warning for residents to take cover and a temporary suspension of train operations in the northern part of the country. 
Tuesday's launch was Pyongyang's fifth in 10 days, amid military muscle-flexing by the United States and South Korea, which staged trilateral anti-submarine exercises last week with Japanese naval forces. 
The Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific Ocean.

“The work they do to keep Australians safe and to forward our national interest more broadly needs to be done not on the front page,” she told Sky News Australia.

UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng admitted the Tories' tax-cutting agenda caused some turbulence in financial markets but ultimately doubled down on the rest of the economic plan.

"We will get Britain moving, we will deliver lower taxes for you and your family and we will grow our economy," Mr Kwarteng said.

UK Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says “it’s a recognition of political reality”.

“The overwhelming reaction had been unsympathetic and governments have to deal with political reality – that governments can’t march into too strong a headwind,” Mr Rees-Mogg said.]]></summary>

"I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime, as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad," the supreme leader said.
Amini, 22, was pronounced dead on September 16, days after the notorious morality police detained the Kurdish Iranian for allegedly breaching rules forcing women to wear hijab headscarves and modest clothes.

        <updated>2022-10-03T15:58:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Orlene made landfall on Monday on Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and a risk of flooding and landslides, forecasters said.
Orlene came ashore south of the beachside city of Mazatlan in Sinaloa state as a Category One hurricane -- the weakest on a scale of five.
At 1500 GMT, the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour and moving inland toward the northeast, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Boats had been brought ashore in Mazatlan ahead of Orlene's arrival, and businesses boarded up windows and laid down sandbags in case of flooding.
Orlene had strengthened to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on Sunday in the Pacific, prompting warnings for inhabitants of at-risk areas to take refuge in temporary shelters.
But the storm gradually lost strength as it approached the coast and was expected to quickly lose its hurricane force after making landfall.
"Rapid weakening is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours as Orlene moves inland," the NHC said.
"Orlene is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by this afternoon, and dissipate tonight or early Tuesday," it added.
Tropical cyclones hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts, usually between May and November.
In October 1997, Hurricane Paulina hit Mexico's Pacific coast as a Category 4 storm, leaving more than 200 dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain on Monday scrapped plans to axe its top income tax rate just 10 days after a debt-driven budget sparked turmoil on markets and fierce criticism during a cost-of-living crisis.
On the second day of the ruling Conservative Party's annual conference, finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted he was "not proceeding" with the removal of the top 45-percent income tax rate, adding it had become a "distraction".
The announcement also marked the first major policy U-turn under British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office less than one month ago.
"It is clear that the abolition of the 45p tax rate has become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our country. As a result, I'm announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the ... rate.
"We get it, and we have listened."
The announcement also came after former cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Michael Gove voiced opposition over unfunded tax cuts unveiled by Kwarteng in his controversial mini-budget on September 23.
Kwarteng had proposed to remove the 45-percent rate applied to Britons earning more than £150,000 ($167,400) per year.
The so-called mini budget had sent the pound plunging to a record dollar low and sent bond yields spiking on fears of a borrowing splurge.
The budget included a costly freeze on energy bills for individuals and businesses, in an attempt to cushion fallout from key gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brazil’s presidential race will need to go to an October 30th second round after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fell short of the 50%+1 he needed to avoid a run-off with extremist incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.
Brazilians voted Sunday in a historic presidential election, with leftist front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led in the pre-election polls, winning but still short of the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff election.

There are fears the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will not accept a defeat after he warned that he will only leave office if he's "killed, jailed, or victorious" and has called on his base to "go to war" if the vote is "stolen."
Bolsonaro took an early lead as results started coming in but in 2014, when Lula's leftist party last won a presidential election, it only took the lead after two hours of vote counting. Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.
Lula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.

With 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:

With 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:


Lula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.
To win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.
Polls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.

It is the first of this year's batch of prizes. The Award committee officially gave Paabo the prize for "discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stock market movements over the next few weeks will be key in determining whether we are heading into a short-term or long-term recession, according to forex trader and crypto analyst Alessio Rastani.
During the period October-December 2022, the analyst expects to see the S&P recover.  “If this bounces back or the rally fails and comes back down, then most likely we are entering a long-term recession and something very close to similar to 2008,” Rastani said in the latest Cointelegraph interview. 
According to the analyst, such a recession could last until 2024 and would inevitably negatively impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC). 
Speaking about the latest pound crisis, Rastani believed that its main cause is the rally in the US dollar, which is putting pressure on most other fiat currencies, including the yen and the euro.  However, according to Rastani, the US dollar is approaching the top. 
“Once we see a clear break, a sustained break of the 111.5 and 110 levels on the dollar index, then I think the dollar is at the top. And then I’m looking for a multi-month decline in the dollar at 104 at the 100 level on the dollar index,” he explained.

“Just tell the truth that the President is and has been for a long time a cognitive wreck and that our country is facing crises on multiple fronts as a result, although, according to the left, [President Joe] Biden cannot be held responsible for any disaster,” Hannity said on her show Wednesday.  “According to them, every crisis is caused by climate change.  Naturally this week, they once again politicized even the weather.  We’ve had hurricanes throughout our history, but this one of course needs to be politicized.
