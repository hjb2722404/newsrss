President Biden received the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor at a ceremony in Jerusalem with Israel's President Isaac Herzog on Thursday.

Unfortunately, at the end of the ceremony, it seemed President Biden was momentarily disorientated.

The incident was widely mocked by conservatives online, who claimed the incident demonstrated President Biden’s cognitive decline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham says China’s “inaction” to condemn Russia's aggression has provided a certain “tacit acknowledgement pathway” for Moscow. 

“It would have been far preferable for China to strongly condemn and join the rest of the world in strongly condemning Russia’s actions,” he told Sky News Australia.  

“The fact that China also does appear to have filled a void, created by some of the economic sanctions that much of the rest of the world have imposed upon Russia, by picking up demand for Russian wheat and the like has not only been a failure to participate in those sanctions but has been an undermining of elements of those sanctions.”]]></summary>

“The central government there is hoping and expecting that the economy will grow by four per cent for the year,” Mr Greenwood said. 

“But the real problem is now that China is struggling, the United States is struggling. 

“That leads really, if you like, to some of this conversation about having to really at some point down the track cut interest rates to support these economies that really right now look as though they’re teetering on the edge of recession.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Biden has signed a joint declaration with Israel’s Yair Lapid to never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.

The pledge comes during Mr Biden’s first visit to the Middle East as president.

“The United States and Israel reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our two countries,” the statement said.

“The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel’s capability to deter its enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination of threats.

“The United States stresses that integral to this pledge is the commitment never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that it is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome.”

The statement went on to reaffirm the US’ commitment to work with other partners to “confront” Iran’s aggression and “destabilising activates”.

“The United States and Israel affirm that they will continue to work together to combat all efforts to boycott or de-legitimise Israel, to deny its right to self-defence, or to unfairly single it out in any forum, including at the United Nations or the International Criminal Court,” the declaration said. 

President Biden also spoke about his trip as an opportunity to reassert America’s influence in the Middle East.]]></summary>

Middle East Monitor: BRICS expects Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to join group soon  
The president of the BRICS International Forum expects Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to join the group "very soon". In an interview with Russia's Izvestia, Purnima Anand said that China, Russia and India discussed this issue during the 14th BRICS Summit, which was held online last month. 
"All these countries have shown an interest in joining and are preparing to apply for membership. I think this is a good step, because expansion is always perceived positively; this will clearly increase the influence of BRICS in the world," explained Anand. "I hope that the accession of countries to BRICS will happen very quickly, because now all representatives of the core of the association are interested in expanding the organisation, so it will be very soon." 
She stressed that the accession of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey may not take place at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNYUZ/New York Times: With Few Able and Fewer Willing, U.S. Military Can’t Find Recruits 
FOUNTAIN, Colo. — The local Army recruiting station was empty. The normally reliable recruiting grounds at the nearby Walmart were a bust. With the Army still thousands of soldiers short of its recruiting goal, the station commander, Sgt. First Class James Pulliam, dressed head to toe in camouflage, scanned a strip-mall parking lot for targets. 
He spotted a young woman getting out of a car, and put on his best salesman smile. 
“Hey, how’d you know I was going to be here today!” the sergeant said with an affable Carolina drawl, as if greeting an old friend. “I’m going to help put you in the Army!” 
These are tough times for military recruiting. Almost across the board, the armed forces are experiencing large shortfalls in enlistments this year — a deficit of thousands of entry-level troops that is on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War. It threatens to throw a wrench into the military’s machinery, leaving critical jobs unfilled and some platoons with too few people to function.

A majority of Swiss people now favour 'drawing closer' to NATO in one of the clearest signs yet of the seismic impact that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had on Europe.

Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do "whatever is necessary to restore order" after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. 
Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. 
But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go.  Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. 
Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem.

* Covid death and case figures are starting to sharply rise once again as the BA.5 variant takes hold in the United States 
* America is averaging 649 deaths from the virus every day, a 97% increase over the past week that broke over a month of stagnant figures 
* Cases are creeping upwards as well, jumping 24% over the past week to 136,000 per day after weeks of sitting in the low 100,000s 
* On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci warned of an upcoming surge and recommended that Americans start masking-up in indoor public places 
Daily Covid infections and deaths are beginning to surge in the U.S. after over a month of little movement - signaling that a summer surge fueled by the BA.5 variant could now be under way. 
America is averaging 649 daily deaths from Covid, a 97 percent increase over the past week. It is the largest seven day increase in deaths since early December. 
Recorded infections have made a leap as well, to 136,903 per day. It is a 24 percent increase over seven days and the largest daily case average since February - when America was coming down off of the largest Covid surge of the pandemic.

MSF says corpses line only road into isolated area of Cite-Soleil, Haiti, which rival gangs have turned into a ‘battlefield’. 
Thousands of people are trapped without access to food, drinking water and medical care in an isolated part of the Haitian capital, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) has said, as clashes between rival gangs in Port-au-Prince’s Cite-Soleil neighbourhood escalate. 
In a statement, the humanitarian aid group said residents have been unable to leave an area in Cite-Soleil known as Brooklyn, while trucks that bring drinking water into the neighbourhood have been unable to enter.

UN hails ‘critical step forward’ after meetings in Istanbul as Turkey says deal will be signed next week 
Turkey has announced a deal with Ukraine, Russia and the UN aimed at resuming Ukrainian grain exports blocked by Russia, raising prospects for an end to a standoff that has exposed millions to the risk of starvation. 
Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said on Wednesday that the deal would be signed when the parties meet again next week and would include joint controls for checking grains in ports and Turkey ensuring the safety of Black Sea export routes for Ukrainian grain.

WNU Editor: The deal is suppose to be signed next week. A lot can happen between now and then. 
And as for solving the global food crisis. Even if Ukraine resumes grain exports via through the Black Sea the food crisis will continue. One of the biggest obstacles to alleviating the global food crisis are current Western sanctions on Belarus and Russian fertilizer exports. Sanctions that the West have said repeatedly will not be lifted.

He said Russia wants to “destroy” Ukraine’s sovereignty, and it “will not stop”. 

“This is not about the territory – this is about the Ukrainian people,” he told Sky News Australia.

   DW: Gazprom will not guarantee functioning of Nord Stream pipeline 
The Russian energy giant said it did not know if a turbine engine would be returned from Canada. Moscow announced earlier that the pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, was shut down for repairs. 
Gazprom, Russia's energy giant, said Wednesday that the functioning of Nord Stream could not be guaranteed even when a "critical" turbine for the pipeline returns from Canada where it is being repaired. 
In a statement, the Russian state energy company said, "Gazprom does not have a single document to allow Siemens to take out of Canada the gas turbine engine currently being repaired there."

WNU Editor: The turbine that Gazprom needs for its natural gas pipeline network is still stuck in Canada. I do not see how this turbine can be shipped and transported to Russia and installed by the July 22 date when this pipeline is suppose to be re-opened .... Is July 22 'Doomsday' For Europe?

Bloomberg: Russia Earns More Despite Lower Oil Exports in June, IEA Says 
(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s oil exports rose back above $20 billion in June despite lower shipments abroad because of a rally in energy prices, according to the International Energy Agency. 
That was an increase by $700 million from a month earlier, even as Russia’s daily exports of crude-oil and products fell by 250,000 barrels to 7.4 million barrels, the lowest since August, the IEA estimated in its monthly report published on Wednesday. 
Benchmark Brent averaged more than $117 a barrel last month as the global oil market remained tight. High international prices helped to partially offset the discount for Urals crude, which deepened amid the European Union’s preparations to gradually phase out seaborne oil imports from Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Business Insider: Oil prices could jump to $140 per barrel if Russian crude doesn't get a price cap, US Treasury official says 
* Crude prices could jump 40% to about $140 if a Russian price cap isn't implemented, a US Treasury official said, per Reuters. 
* On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks with Japanese officials on the price cap proposal. 
* In June, G7 leaders discussed a price cap on Russian crude of about $40 to $60 to slow down Moscow's funding of its war machine. 
Oil prices could jump about 40% to $140 a barrel if Russian crude doesn't get hit with a proposed price cap, a senior US Treasury official said Tuesday, according to a Reuters report. 
On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks over the price cap proposal with Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki. 
Japanese officials have shown hesitance to adopt a price cap set too low, but have not yet rejected the idea.

WNU Editor: This US push to put a cap on Russian oil does not make sense. If Russia does not get the price that it wants for its oil, it will simply not produce it. And if that happens you do not get $140 per barrel oil, you will get $200 per barrel (or more).

USNI News: U.S. Destroyer Performs South China Sea FONOP; China Says it Expelled Warship 
A U.S. guided-missile destroyer passed near a South China Sea island chain claimed by China as part of a Freedom of Navigation operation and drew complaints from Beijing. 
USS Benfold (DDG-65) sailed near the Paracel Islands early Wednesday local time in a FONOP and was monitored by the People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate Xianning (500), according to the Chinese Ministry of Defense. 
“This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam and also by challenging PRC’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands,” reads a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ayeshea Perera, BBC News: Sri Lanka: Why is the country in an economic crisis? 
A state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka, and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country. 
His departure follows months of mass protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel.  The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and it has already missed debt interest payments.    
Read more ....   
Update: Sri Lanka in crisis: What, why and how? (Al Jazeera)   
WNU Editor: There are many reasons why Sri Lanka has collapsed. Government mismanagement starting with the printing of massive amounts of money. Insane fiscal and green policies that banned the imports of fertilizer that crippled Sri Lanka's agriculture sector. Too much debt. 
And while the Western narrative is to blame China for Sri Lanka's unsustainable debt levels that has led to the current crisis, the truth is that it is the Western countries that are the main creditors (see below): 

Sri Lanka owes 81% of its external debt to US and European financial institutions and Western allies Japan and India.
China owns just 10%.
But Washington blames imaginary "Chinese debt traps" for the nation's crisis, as it negotiates a 17th IMF bailout.https://t.co/Tk49cuLvNS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Europe faces huge surge in migration from Middle East and Africa due to food crisis created by war in Ukraine, EU warns 
* Around 20million tonnes of grain are currently blocked in Ukrainian ports 
* Food prices have rocketed which could fuel a migration wave towards Europe 
* Putin has been accused of deliberately weaponizing food supplies 
Europe is facing a huge migration wave from the Middle East and Africa because of the food crisis aggravated by the war in Ukraine, the EU has warned. 
Ukraine is one of the biggest grain exporters in the world but production and dispatch have been severely affected by Putin's barbaric invasion. 
Around 20million tonnes of grain from last year's harvest are blocked in Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. 

Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The EU is fixated on exporting Ukraine grain to alleviate the global food crisis. But many are predicting that Ukraine itself is going to face serious food shortages this winter because of the war. IMHO this is the wrong time for Ukraine to export its food stocks. 
And what makes the EU position on food even more absurd are the anti-farm policies that we are seeing in places like the Netherlands and Poland where farmers are being pressured to cut food production to meet climate change goals. 
The truth is that the global food crisis has been long in the making, and the cost to feed oneself is no longer affordable for hundreds of millions of people around the world. So face with the option of staying put and starving, or going to where there is food, it should then surprise no one that people will be going to where the food is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hank Goldberga tangy, explosive and witty Miami sports radio and TV personality who became nationally known for crippling horse racing and NFL games on ESPN, died Monday, his 82nd birthday, at his home in Las Vegas.
The cause was complications from chronic kidney disease, which required dialysis treatments and caused the amputation of his right leg below the knee last year, said his sister and sole immediate survivor, Liz Goldberg.
For more than 50 years, sport and gaming were inseparable spheres for Mr. Goldberg.  Accustomed to racetracks and casino sports betting, he writes for the famous bettor Jimmy Snyder, known as Jimmy the Greek, in the 1970s. He was an analyst for Miami Dolphins football games on radio, hosted sports talk shows on two Miami radio stations, and reported and anchored…]]></summary>

* US B-2A stealth bombers landed at a Queensland RAAF base for joint exercises 
* The USAF move is intended to be a warning show of strength to China's leaders 
* Their arrival comes as another Australian warship is stalked by Chinese military 
* Chinese aircraft, ships and submarines all chased HMAS Parramatta in open seas 
Rarely-seen USAF B-2A stealth bombers have landed in Queensland in a high-profile show of strength, as Australian Defence Forces have another encounter with a Chinese warship. 
At least four bombers - whose unique design makes them virtually invisible to radar detection - touched down on Sunday at the RAAF Amberely Base, west of Brisbane. 
The 'flying wing'-style aircraft flew 14,000km from their US base in Missouri on a 'training and strategic deterrence mission in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific'.

* Strategists lay out worst-case scenarios for stocks and bonds 
* Europe is caught in a ‘vicious circle,’ says Banque Syz CIO 
(Bloomberg) -- European stocks plunging 20%. Junk credit spreads widening past 2020 crisis levels. The euro sinking to just 90 cents. 
The predictions are ominous for financial markets if Russia cuts off all the gas supply to Europe. 
Shipments are currently running at reduced levels with the main pipeline shut for a 10-day maintenance, and fears are building over whether Moscow will turn the tap back on. Many investors are asking: How bad could this get? 
To that question, strategists across Wall Street have tried to put numbers on a scenario that would be unthinkable in normal times. There are so many variables, such as the length of any shutdown, the extent of supply cuts, and how far countries would go to ration energy, that anyone’s prediction is a guess at best.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is personally condemning Canada over its decision to grant a Canadian company a "time-limited and revocable permit," allowing them to return turbines from a Russian pipeline that supplies natural gas to Germany. 
Zelenskyy said that Canada's decision is about more than wrongly deciding to hand over the turbines, but that it was an "absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia."  "If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? 
This question is very dangerous," Zelenskyy said in a video and accompanying statement on Monday, that also stated the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs “had to summon Canada's representative to our country.”

* U.S. urged China to abide by international law and cease its provocative behavior 
* Manila also hailed the Hague ruling, saying it cannot be denied by anyone 
* The previous Duterte administration shelved the ruling to get Beijing on its side 
The U.S. has reiterated its support to the Philippines, stating it will back Manila in the event of an armed conflict in the South China Sea. 
Washington's statement came on the sixth anniversary of the significant Hague ruling, which rejected China's nine-dash claim over the South China Sea in favor of the Philippines, according to Philstar. 
"We also reaffirm that an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke the U.S. mutual defense commitments under Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press statement.

The BRICS—an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—held a summit on June 23. The meeting, chaired by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, was part of a lengthy series of BRICS cooperation events, which began on June 6 with the second finance ministers and central bank governors meeting and ended with the second meeting of the committee of senior energy officials on June 28. 
In his opening remarks, Xi stated, “We should also expand BRICS cooperation on cross-border payment and credit rating to facilitate trade, investment, and financing among our countries.”

Nick Kyrgios and Ons Jabeur brought new diversity to the men’s and women’s singles finals.  Jabeur of Tunisia became the first North African player to qualify for a singles final.  Kyrgios, a Malaysian-born Australian and a well-documented swagger that marks him as something completely different from his peers, was playing in his first Grand Slam final.  Jabeur and Kyrgios each ended up losing, but that’s not the point.
Not since 1975, when Arthur Ashe and Evonne Goolagong reached their final, combined the two league matches to be so diverse.  Tennis moves in spurts, and nowhere does that seem more true than at Wimbledon.

Another of his discoveries, Bobby Castillo, a converted third baseman known as Babo, taught Valenzuela how to throw a screwball.
“I’m not lying to you,” Brito told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. “Within a week, Fernando was throwing the ball as well as Babo.”
“For many, many Mexican prospects, he was a God,” Jaime Jarrina Spanish-language Dodgers broadcaster since 1959, told Baseball America last year.  “They loved him because he protected them.”
Mike Brito was born on August 21, 1934 in Cuba.  As a catcher, beginning in 1955, he played three seasons in the lower tiers of the Washington Senators minor league system and then several seasons in the Mexican League.
After retiring, he moved to Los Angeles, where he found work as a truck driver and started an adult amateur league in which he also played.
Scouting became his way of staying in baseball.  “Thank God I became a scout in the Mexican League,” he said in a short video profile, “The White Hat and the Wild Horse: The Scout Who Found Puig.” When Dodgers general manager Al Campanis asked him to work for the team, he recalled thinking, “It’s like finding a guy in the desert and asking him if he wants a drink. of water.

The UnHeard: The German economy is on the brink  
Putin can't be blamed for the country's economic malaise 
The economist Herbert Stein once wrote that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. 
This became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.

Update: Germany: Unprepared for a perfect storm (ING) 
 Update #2: "Social Peace Is In Great Danger": Germany Is Quietly Shutting Down As Energy Crunch Paralyzes Economy (Zero Hedge)   
WNU Editor: Germany's economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa flew out of the country early Wednesday.  
Daily Mail: Sri Lanka's embattled president FLEES his country after months of widespread protests over the island nation's worst-ever economic crisis 
* Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday 
* He, his wife and a bodyguard were among four passengers on board an Antonov-32 military aircraft which took off for the Maldives, immigration sources say 
* 'Their passports were stamped and they boarded the special air force flight,' an immigration official involved in the process said 
Sri Lanka's embattled president flew out of his country early Wednesday, in a probable prelude to his resignation after months of widespread protests over the island nation's worst-ever economic crisis. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday and clear the way for a 'peaceful transition of power', after fleeing his official residence in Colombo just before tens of thousands of protesters overran it. 
As president, Rajapaksa enjoys immunity from arrest, and he is believed to have wanted to go abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of being detained.

Daily Mail: Conscripts are being given call-up papers on the beaches of Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelensky's army suffers heavy losses 
Like many of his male friends, Serhiy no longer leaves his home in western Ukraine for fear of being sent to the front line to replace soldiers killed or injured in the fight against Russia. 
The construction worker spends his days hiding from military officials serving call-up papers at bars, beaches, checkpoints, malls and even church services. 
As casualties mount on both sides, there was anger last week after Ukraine’s military revealed plans to bring in permits prohibiting men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered under martial law.   
Read more ....   
Update: Ukraine’s military plans to limit free movement to make conscription easier (The Guardian)   
WNU Editor: Everyone in Ukraine knows that if conscripted, it will only be a manner of time before you are sent to the front-lines and the meat-grinder that awaits all those who go there. I personally know a few Russian-Ukrainians AND Ukrainians who are refusing to join, and are looking for a way out of the country. But it is almost impossible as a military age male to escape Ukraine right now. Ukraine is under marshal law, and it is being enforced with rigor. 
On a personal note. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 the first mission my father had was to forcibly conscript Ukrainians into the Soviet Army. He hated it because many men that he had to conscript were also his friends and classmates. When the war was over my father learned that every male he knew who was forcibly conscripted got killed in the war. It is something that my father never forgot.

Sighhhh ... and now history is repeating itself.]]></summary>

The reason for this aid is to support Ukraine's health-care system. Unfortunately .... it will not be enough. The hospitals are filled beyond capacity. Just yesterday the Ukraine government admitted that they lost 500 soldiers with untold more injured on one day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice," he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, poses for a picture at the Bundestag in Berlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sixteen people were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir, with rescuers searching for dozens more missing, after flash floods swept away hundreds of tents near a popular Hindu pilgrimage site, officials said Saturday.
Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whizzing helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.
"We found 16 bodies so far and at least 40 are missing," an official from the state disaster response agency told AFP.
"Security forces and all the rescue teams are looking for the missing and injured," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his official residence on Saturday shortly before protesters, angered by an unprecedented economic crisis, stormed and overran the compound.
Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa's resignation, has called an urgent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the "stoning of the devil" ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year's expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
"I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave," Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…]]></summary>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain's departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world's fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
"We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:
