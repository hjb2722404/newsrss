The fiery liquid illuminates the smoke-filled sky in Grindavik, a small fishing town just 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the capital, Reykjavik.

The eruption began Monday night, but it was no surprise: The area has been active for two years, with thousands of small earthquakes heralding the near-certain awakening of the volcano. 

Civil defense personnel are on high alert, blocking access to the road leading to the mountain, and flying in a helicopter over the lava floes to monitor volcanic activity. 

As Friday’s winter solstice nears — when Iceland sees just three hours of sunlight a day — residents gather, watching from a safe distance, to see the natural spectacle lighting up the long-dark sky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The National Intelligence Council report for the 2022 election walks through all the ways that Russia is continuing its attacks on American voting. 
Former FBI agent Peter Strzok highlighted pieces of the extensive report Tuesday, detailing imperative intelligence gathered about the use of social media to hurt the United States. Namely, the report claims Russia has continued its efforts to sow division in the U.S. using social issues. 
The report writes that Russia “sought to denigrate the Dem Party…and undermine confidence in the election, most likely to undermine US support for Ukraine.” 
A key piece of Russia's plan was “blaming multiculturalism and ‘leftist ideals’ for ostensibly driving the U.S. into crisis." The report said it "had elicited responses from US males who were more than 40 years old and interested in ‘rightwing conservatism.'"

"Russia's tactics before the midterms aimed to build on longstanding efforts to forge ideological inroads with U.S. constituencies that they believed were more sympathetic to Russia's emphasis on 'traditional values,' according to open-source information," the report continues. 
At another point, Strzok points to an excerpt on Russian actors casting "aspersions on the integrity of the midterm elections, including by claiming the voting software was vulnerable, Americans expected cheating to undermine the midterm elections, and Democrats were stealing the elections.”
It continues an ongoing effort by Vladimir Putin to undermine Western democracy as a flawed system.
Strzok explained it's "hard to overstate how critical the 2024 elections are to Russia — and Putin personally. Expect unprecedented interference across national races."

Newsweek: Germany Will Deploy Troops for First Time Since World War II 
A new agreement between Germany and Lithuania will lead to German troops' first permanent foreign deployment since World War II. 
The announcement was made Monday in Lithuania, where Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas met with his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, to outline a multiyear "Roadmap Action Plan" involving approximately 4,800 permanently stationed German soldiers. Both officials called the move a historical moment not just for their nations but for NATO as well. 
German troops, including those with families, will be stationed in the Lithuanian cities of Kaunas and Vilnius beginning in 2024, with most troops deployed in 2025 and 2026 and full-operation capability expected by 2027. In turn, Lithuania has committed to providing all necessary civilian and military infrastructure.

Euromaidan: Ex-Amb to UK believes Britain could send troops to Ukraine in case of “catastrophic events” 
In an interview, Vadym Prystayko shares insights into his communication with British diplomats, revealing their acknowledgment of the impending war and willingness to provide military support. 
Vadym Prystayko, the former Ukrainian ambassador to London, has asserted that the United Kingdom is among the countries that could deploy its armed forces to Ukraine in the event of a “catastrophic development of the war.” Prystayko shared this perspective in an interview with “Radio Svoboda.” 
Addressing one of Ukraine’s arguments for international assistance, Prystayko commented on President Zelenskyy’s statement: “If you don’t help Ukraine now, your children will sooner or later be fighting with Russia.”

As to his claim that the UK could send troops to Ukraine if war develops in catastrophic way .... hmmmm ....  I can see a situation where if the entire Ukraine army and government collapses, the West will intervene with military forces, but they will stay in the Western part of the country.]]></summary>

Near-final results show that President Aleksandar Vucic won 47% of the vote, despite the opposition claims of voter-bullying and bribes. 
An early official vote count appears to confirm Serbia’s governing populists’ claims of a sweeping victory in the Sunday election, despite the complaints of the opposition. 
The party of President Aleksandar Vucic, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), won some 47% of the ballots in the parliamentary vote, followed by Serbia Against Violence with 23%, according to a near-complete preliminary tally by the state election commission. If confirmed, this result would land the party around 130 seats in the 250-member assembly, giving SNS an absolute majority and the ability to form a government on its own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rolling Stone: ‘Dictator’ Trump Plans to Deploy Massive Number of Troops on U.S. Soil 
Donald Trump’s plans to give himself sweeping powers on “day one” of a new administration include sending vast numbers of U.S. troops — potentially “hundreds of thousands” — to close the southern border and to help build a new network of immigrant detention camps, three people familiar with the situation tell Rolling Stone. 
Trump and some of his lieutenants have repeatedly stated that any second administration must treat migrant crossings as a “war” on American soil. During Trump’s first term, officials and attorneys had thwarted similar plans for a military police force at the border due to legal fears, according to former top officials such as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.

Washington Post: Biden said to be increasingly frustrated by dismal poll numbers 
The night before President Biden departed Washington to celebrate Thanksgiving on Nantucket, Mass., he gathered his closest aides for a meeting in the White House residence. 
After pardoning a pair of turkeys, an annual White House tradition, Biden delivered some stern words for the small group assembled: His poll numbers were unacceptably low and he wanted to know what his team and his campaign were doing about it. He complained that his economic message had done little to move the ball, even as the economy was growing and unemployment was falling, according to people familiar with his comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.

Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau and his government are claiming the same thing .... the economy is growing/people are working/industries are being built. And to a certain degree they are right. But for most Americans/Canadians what we see food and general inflation, high interest rates, high mortgage rates, and wage increases that are not keeping pace.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: BP pauses all Red Sea shipments after rebel attacks 
Oil giant BP has announced it is pausing all shipments of oil through the Red Sea after recent attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels. 
The firm blamed the "deteriorating security situation" in the region as Iran-backed Houthis target ships they believe are bound for Israel. 
Many freight firms have suspended journeys as the attacks continue. 
BP said it would keep its "precautionary pause under ongoing review" and monitor the region. 
Analysts suggested that if other large oil firms follow suit, oil prices could rise. 
Brent crude, the international benchmark foroil prices, increased to $78.44 per barrel.

— Lara Seligman (@laraseligman) December 18, 2023
  
Warzone/The Drive: Newly Formed Operation Prosperity Guardian To Protect Red Sea Shipping 
A soon to be announced multi-national effort to protect Red Sea shipping comes after the U.S. and U.K. downed 15 Houthi drones Saturday.  
During his visit to the Middle East next week, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will announce the formation of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a new international effort deal with Houthi threats, a U.S. military official told The War Zone. That information comes as U.S. and British warships shot down drones the Houthis launched in a wave from Yemen early Saturday morning local time, marking the latest escalation of attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
The Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Carney downed 14 drones today, a U.S. military official told The War Zone. The Type-45 destroyer HMS Diamond downed one drone targeting merchant shipping in the Red Sea with a Sea Viper missile, U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement. It was the first time the Royal Navy shot down an aerial target in anger since the First Gulf War in 1991 when the Type 42 Destroyer HMS Gloucester destroyed an Iraqi Silkworm missile bound for a U.S. warship.

Reuters: Ukrainian troops face artillery shortages, scale back some operations - commander 
KYIV/LONDON (Reuters) - Frontline Ukrainian troops face shortages of artillery shells and have scaled back some military operations because of a shortfall of foreign assistance, a senior army general told Reuters. 
Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi was speaking after Republican lawmakers held up a $60-billion U.S. aid package and Hungary blocked 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion) in European Union funding for Kyiv as it battles Russia's invasion. 
"There's a problem with ammunition, especially post-Soviet (shells) - that's 122 mm, 152 mm. And today these problems exist across the entire front line," he said in an interview. 
Tarnavskyi said the shortage of artillery shells was a "very big problem" and the drop in foreign military aid was having an impact on the battlefield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has declared Catholic Church priests may now formally bless same-sex unions, saying "exhaustive moral analysis” should not bar them from God's love and mercy, while stressing the blessing may not be confused with or even made at the same time as a same-sex marriage or civil union.
Unlike previous pronouncements the Pope has made that were favorable to LGBTQ people, only to have the Church walk them back, this "radical change," as the Associated Press calls it Monday, comes as a policy change through the Vatican’s doctrine office.
“Ultimately, a blessing offers people a means to increase their trust in God,” the document said, according to the AP. “The request for a blessing, thus, expresses and nurtures openness to the transcendence, mercy, and closeness to God in a thousand concrete circumstances of life, which is no small thing in the world in which we live.”

The Vatican document states both that requests for blessings from same-sex couples should not be denied, and a priest blessing a same-sex union cannot be confused with support for same-sex marriage or civil unions. It also, the AP notes, "stresses that blessings should not be conferred at the same time as a civil union, using set rituals or even with the clothing and gestures that belong in a wedding."
While this may be the first time the Catholic Church will bless same-sex unions in modern times, a 1994 book by a Yale professor detailed the Church had blessed same-sex unions for centuries.
Professor John Boswell's book, "Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe," The LA Times reported that year, "asserted that from the 8th to the 18th Centuries, the Catholic church sanctioned same-sex unions and offered ceremonies complete with prayers for the couple’s union, Holy Communion and rubrics directing the couple to kiss a book of the Gospel, the priest and one another."]]></summary>

The Kremlin critic's lawyers have been prevented from meeting him since December 6, and he did not appear for a scheduled court hearing last Friday.
"I am greatly concerned that the Russian authorities will not disclose Mr. Navalny's whereabouts and well-being for such a prolonged period of time which amounts to enforced disappearance," said Mariana Katzarova, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Russia.
Navalny, 47 -- who has been a thorn in the side of Russian leader Vladimir Putin -- was jailed for 19 years on extremism charges in 2021 after surviving a poisoning assassination attempt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korea launched another long-range ballistic missile on Monday with a potential capability of striking the United States, Seoul and Tokyo officials said, extending a record-breaking number of weapons tests this year that have been condemned by the West.
The firing followed the test of a shorter range missile on Sunday night, with the back-to-back launches coming immediately in the wake of another bout of fearsome rhetoric between North Korea and the US-South Korean allies.
South Korea's military said it had detected the launch of a long-range ballistic missile from the Pyongyang area on Monday that flew 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) before splashing down in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.
The South reported the missile flew up rather than across, a method Pyongyang has previously said it employs in some weapons tests to avoid flying over neighbouring countries.
Japan's defence ministry said it was an ICBM-class missile with a potential range covering all of the United States.
"The ICBM-class ballistic missile launched this time, if calculated based on the trajectory, depending on weight of warhead, could have a flying range of over 15,000 kilometres (9,320 miles)," said Shingo Miyake, parliamentary vice-minister of defence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he was "proud" of preventing the creation of a Palestinian state during a press conference in Tel Aviv Saturday night.
Speaking alongside Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, Netanyahu claimed that he had halted the progression of the Oslo peace process, which began in 1993, calling the Oslo Accords "a fateful mistake" and said the results of the “little Palestinian state in Gaza” brought about by the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 demonstrated the danger of allowing Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank.
The Oslo Accords were an agreement signed by Israel and the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organisation) that saw the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza as part of a process that was meant to lead to a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Netanyahu's comments come after several Israeli officials said that there would be no two-state solution following the end of Israel's indiscriminate war on Gaza, which has destroyed much of the occupied territory and killed at least 18,800 Palestinians, primarily women and children, in Israeli attacks since October 7, according to the territory's health ministry.
Israel's right-wing ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, answered "absolutely no" when asked during an interview on Sky News last Wednesday about whether a two-state solution would arise following the end of the Gaza War. "Israel knows today, and the world should know now that the reason the Oslo Accords failed is because the Palestinians never wanted to have a state next to Israel," Hotovely said.]]></summary>

Reuters: Trump would install loyalists to reshape U.S. foreign policy. Diplomats gird for "doomsday" 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Donald Trump in a second term would likely install loyalists in key positions in the Pentagon, State Department and CIA whose primary allegiance would be to him, allowing him more freedom than in his first presidency to enact isolationist policies and whims, nearly 20 current and former aides and diplomats said. 
The result would enable Trump to make sweeping changes to the U.S. stance on issues ranging from the Ukraine war to trade with China, as well as to the federal institutions that implement - and sometimes constrain - foreign policy, the aides and diplomats said.

WNU Editor: This is a silly Reuters report. Of course a US President will install loyalists in his administration to implement his policies. Should he appoint his opponents? 
And I cannot let this one pass. In the above Reuters post it says the following ....  
.... During his 2017-2021 term, Trump struggled to impose his sometimes impulsive and erratic vision on the U.S. national security establishment. 
If according to Reuters President Trump's foreign policy was impulsive and erratic, I would love to know what they would call the current administration's foreign policy goals and achievements. This White House's foreign policy looks like an ongoing train wreck from where I stand.]]></summary>

Democrats and Republicans will not be able to strike a deal on US southern border policy changes this year, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday, following weeks of negotiations over tying tighter immigration restrictions to supplemental funding for Ukraine and Israel.
Republicans, Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” “feel that we’re being jammed. 
We’re not anywhere close to a deal. It’ll go into next year.”

Democrats and Republicans are urgently trying to reach an agreement on border policy changes before senators leave town for the holidays, but several congressional aides are skeptical a deal can be reached as sizable differences remain.

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come as US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is travelling to Israel to push for Israeli leaders to “scale back” the war. 

International support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza continues to wane as calls for a ceasefire grow. 

“The question continues to be number one, will Israel be able to neutralise Hamas permanently,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“And number two, will this dispute – will this war – spread over into other geographic areas.”]]></summary>

Trump addressed the rising number of immigrants entering the country.
 
“Unchecked, unvetted, going who knows where – we don’t know,” he said at the rally on Sunday night (local time).

“They have no idea.”]]></summary>

Under increasing political pressure in the US, the Biden administration is pushing Israel to move into a new phase in its war in Gaza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says Hamas has “likely been stealing” international aid to create its tunnel network. 

Mr Mulvaney’s remarks come after the Israel Defence Forces uncovered a large tunnel designed to carry Hamas fighters from Gaza to the Israel border. 

The IDF aims to decommission the hundreds of kilometres of underground passages and bunkers in an attempt to thwart Hamas manoeuvrability. 

“Keep in mind, think about how much money it costs to do what those videos show,” Mr Mulvaney told Sky News Australia. 

“Gaza doesn’t have a lot of money – Gaza gets most of its money from overseas aid.”]]></summary>

With Kid Rock and Dana White by his side, Donald Trump electrified the scene, engaging fans before the welterweight showdown between Leon Edwards and Colby Covington.

Trump earlier that day had slammed President Joe Biden at a New Hampshire rally, warning against the possibility of World War III and condemning Biden's leadership.

"We will not have World War III. We will keep you out of it. And we will keep you out of it because of strength," Trump said during the Durham, New Hampshire rally.

"Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual; he is truly the worst, most incompetent, most corrupt President in the history of our country."]]></summary>

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is travelling to Israel to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push for Israeli leaders to “scale back” the war. 

President Joe Biden has been under increasing political pressure – especially from the left of the Democrat Party – to pull back on support for Israel. 

The Biden administration has remained firmly pro-Israel in supporting its military campaign against Hamas, but increasingly, the progressive left of the United States has been highly pro-Palestine and critical of the US’ stance on the war. 

This is starting to become an issue for President Biden as he seeks re-election in 2024.]]></summary>

EurAsian Times: Not Enough F-35s With The US To Fight A War; Lockheed Faces Huge Task Of Supplying Upgraded Jets 
At a time when it is argued that US “Air Force readiness and capacity levels are at all-time lows” and American fighter pilots are flying fewer hours compared to their counterparts in China, the Pentagon and the US lawmakers are worried that Lockheed Martin is not meeting its contractual agreements to supply enough upgraded fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets. 
Pentagon officials say that hardware for the Technology Refresh-3 upgrade is not being produced fast enough, and these shortages are slowing deliveries of the F-35’s latest upgrade, which, as a result, would cost “almost US$1 billion more than expected”.

Newsweek: US Puts Second Nuclear Submarine by South Korea After Warning Kim Jong Un 
An American nuclear submarine arrived at a major South Korean port on Sunday, the second that has arrived in the country in the last two months, amid reports of a new North Korean missile test. 
As confirmed by the South Korean navy to the Yonhap news agency, the Virginia-class warship USS Missouri, also designated SSN-780, has arrived at one of the nation's key naval bases in the port city of Busan, roughly 200 miles southeast of the capital city, Seoul. 
The arrival comes in the wake of South Korea and the United States holding the second meeting of the Nuclear Deterrence Consultative Group in Washington, D.C., on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  ●    The recently announced Vocational Professionals Admission Scheme (VPAS) targets secondary school graduates from Mainland China and around the world. ●    Non-local students who complete their studies in the designated full-time Higher Diploma (HD) programmes, offered by the Vocational Training Council (VTC) and in five sectors selected by the Government, are eligible to apply for the scheme.  To alleviate the shortage of skilled labour in key local sectors, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) unveiled the introduction of VPAS, a scheme tied to employment for the admission of talent, during his 2023 Policy Address.   The VTC has been assigned by the Government to advance VPAS on the Mainland and other countries/areas. The Council will also coordinate with relevant industries and Government Bureaux/Departments to prepare for the pilot launch of the scheme in the 2024/25 and 2025/26 academic years.   Recent developments have paved the way for the introduction of VPAS, says Alaina Shum, Deputy Executive Director of VTC. The Government will raise the admission quotas for non-local students in Government-funded post-secondary institutions from 20 percent to 40 percent starting from the 2024/25 academic year.Additionally, work has been underway for a mutual recognition system of cross-border sub-degree qualifications. According to the Policy Address, Hong Kong will collaborate with the relevant Mainland authorities to take forward the mutual recognition of sub-degree level qualification, including the Higher Diploma qualification, and try out such arrangements on a pilot basis.  Therefore, an increase is expected in the enrolment of non-local students in Hong Kong’s vocational and professional education and training (VPET) programmes, she says. VTC is one of the city’s largest providers of VPET programmes.   Non-local students who have successfully completed their studies in one of the 27…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrayinska Pravda: ISW analyses Russia's war plan up to 2026, published by Bild 
The German publication Bild, referring to intelligence data and sources, has reported that Russia plans to occupy Ukrainian territory beyond the borders of the four illegally annexed Ukrainian oblasts during 2024-2026. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has noted that these targets coincide with the ongoing local offensive operations by the Russians.

 
Details: Bild said Russia plans to occupy the entire territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and up to the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast by the end of 2024. 
ISW noted that these targets overlap with Russia's ongoing local offensive operations in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv oblasts. 
 Bild noted that Russia also plans to occupy a large part of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts, including the city of Kharkiv, if possible, in 2025 and 2026.

WNU Editor: I have doubts that the German publication BILD and the sources it uses has Russia's war plans up to 2026. But I do not have any doubts that this war still has a long way to go before it ends, and that Russia has prepared itself for a very long conflict.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
