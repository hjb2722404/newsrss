        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FILE PHOTO: A view shows an armoured convoy of pro-Russian troops outside Donetsk   
Reuters: With troops in Ukraine, Russia's defence spending leaps 40% 
(Reuters) - Russia's defence spending was up nearly 40% in the first four months of the year, according to preliminary data released by the finance ministry on Wednesday, almost three months into Moscow's large-scale military campaign in Ukraine. 
Russia spent 1.7 trillion roubles ($26.4 billion) on defence between January and April, almost half the 3.5 trillion roubles, or 2.6% of GDP, budgeted for all of 2022. 
The ministry had initially forecast a budget surplus of 1% of GDP, or 1.3 trillion roubles, for 2022, but now expects a deficit of at least 1.6 trillion roubles, allowing for support payouts to counter the effect of an unprecedented barrage of Western economic sanctions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A file photo shows Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, June 23, 2021. (Reuters) 
Politico:  US to end Russia debt servicing allowance, says Treasury chief Janet Yellen  
She also floated the idea of imposing a tariff or price cap on Russian oil exports — which has yet to catch on in Brussels. 
BONN, Germany — Washington is willing to let a provision allowing Russia to make bond payments expire, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Wednesday — a move that increases the chance Moscow will default on its foreign debt. 
The clause, which falls under the U.S. sanctions regime, has allowed Russia to service its foreign debt so far with the approval of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It's set to expire on May 25. 
"The expectation was for it to be time limited. It’s reasonably likely to expect that the license will be left to expire," Yellen said, speaking to reporters in Bonn, Germany, ahead of a G7 finance ministerial meeting. "A final decision hasn’t been taken yet, but I think it’s unlikely that it would continue."

Update: US ‘likely’ to scrap Russia debt payment exemption: Yellen (AFP) 
WNU Editor: Russia's next debt payment is on May 27, two days after Moscow will be blocked from making a payment. My gut tells me that international financial markets are going to go through a roller coaster ride next week and beyond. 
On a side note.  After U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made her remarks, the Dow Jones tumbled 1,000 points (as of 14:00 EST). The blame is on poor results from Target and Walmart, but I think it is more than just that.]]></summary>

Reuters: Yellen: Not legal for U.S. to seize Russian official assets 
BONN, Germany (Reuters) -The United States does not have legal authority to seize Russian central bank assets frozen due to its invasion of Ukraine, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, but talks with U.S. partners over ways to make Russia foot the bill for Ukraine's post-war reconstruction are underway.

Update #1: Janet Yellen says 'it would not be legal now' for the US to seize Russian government assets to pay for Ukraine reconstruction (Business Insider)  
Update #2: Seizing Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine illegal – US (RT) 
WNU Editor: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was very careful in what she said. She said "it would not be legal now", meaning it may become legal in the future. My gut tells me that the decision to not return these seize assets has already been made, regardless on what happens in Ukraine or in Russia, and what Yellen said today was to not escalate the current tensions between the US and Russia.]]></summary>

   Daily Mail: Pentagon clears ITSELF over Syria war crimes: Review finds US troops did not deliberately kill 56 civilians including a woman and three children in airstrikes in 2019 and claims one child had taken up arms 
* Pentagon on Tuesday released findings from probe into 2019 strike on Baghuz 
* Four civilians were confirmed killed by US bombs as ISIS made its final stand 
* Now the Pentagon claims that the military did not violate the laws of war 
* Review acknowledges 'procedural mistakes' in the aftermath of the airstrikes 
* But no one, including the ground force commander, was disciplined 
A Pentagon investigation has determined that US troops did not commit war crimes or deliberately kill civilians in 2019 airstrikes in Syria that killed dozens of people, including women and children. 
The strikes on Baghuz, where desperate ISIS fighters were holed up and making their final stand, killed at least four civilians, but were kept secret for years until they came to light last fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BALTIMORE — The new wall in left field at Camden Yards served its purpose, denying Aaron Judge a home run on his 399-foot drive in the first inning.
“I learned my lesson and decided to go in the right field after that,” he said.


Ballpark couldn’t hold off Judge’s next two hits, a pair of solo homers that gave him a major league-leading 14 and helped the Yankees to a 5-4 win over the Yankees. Baltimore Orioles Tuesday night.  Judge and reliever Michael King was the biggest star in the win, New York’s 20th in its last 23 games.


According to Statcast, the judge’s two homers went 410 and 422 feet, after his double was just under 400. The judge’s reaction to the new dimensions at Camden Yards was about what you’d expect from a right-handed puncher .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He is also one of the best players in the NHL in any position.  He was named one of three finalists for the Hart Trophy for most valuable player of the regular season and is almost guaranteed to receive the Vézina Trophy for top goaltender.  All voters needed was his .935 save percentage and 2.07 goals-against average, both league-best.
Shesterkin, 26, was drafted out of Russia by Rangers in the fourth round of the 2014 draft and fit right into a line of Rangers goalkeepers dating back to the early 1990s with Mike Richter, who was followed , two years after his own retirement.  , by Henrik Lundqvist in 2005.
“What a series of goaltenders we’ve seen here with the Rangers,” said Eddie Olczyk, a TNT analyst and Richter’s teammate on the last Rangers team to win a Stanley Cup, in 1994. It hasn’t been a problem for Rangers, and when you have it, you have a chance to win every night.
Olczyk said he spoke to Gallant months ago about Shesterkin, and the coach praised him for the goalkeeper’s incredible ability to read, react and get in the right position before the shot or the pass.
“I don’t think you hear that very often,” Olczyk said.  “He seems to know what’s going to happen first.  When this happens, you are playing five card stud with six cards.  It’s a very good hand to play with.
Lundqvist was like that too.  He was still a Ranger when Shesterkin made his debut on January 7, 2020. Shesterkin spoke very little English then, and it was difficult for Lundqvist to communicate with him in a casual and thorough manner to get a sense of who Shesterkin was.  .  But he noticed his new team-mate was rather relaxed and chatty with other Russian-speaking Rangers players, like Pavel Buchnevich and Vladislav Namestnikov, both of whom are no longer with the team.
Now a Rangers analyst on the MSG Network, Lundqvist says Shesterkin’s laid-back demeanor was key to the Russian goalkeeper’s ability to withstand pressure and failure – what little he had of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But suburban and rural schools have not been spared.
In suburban Kansas City, the Olathe, Kansas, school district lost more than 1,000 of its approximately 33,000 students in 2020 as families relocated and switched to private schools or home schooling;  only about half of them returned this school year.
In rural Woodbury County, Iowa, south of Sioux City, the inscription at Westwood Community School District fell more than 5% in the past two years, from 552 to 522 students, despite a small influx from cities during the pandemic, Superintendent Jay Lutt said.  Today, in addition to demographic trends that have long eroded the size of rural Iowa school populations, diminishing funding, the district is grappling with inflation as the price of fuel for school buses has soared in arrow, Mr. Lutt said.
In some states where schools have avoided distance learning — Florida, for example — enrollment has not only rebounded, but remains robust. Analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank, concluded last month that distance education was a major driver nationwide, with enrollment declining the most in districts most likely to have delayed their return to classrooms in person.
Private schools also recorded enrollment gains.  Federal enrollment counts have yet to be released, but the National Association of Independent Schools and the National Catholic Educational Association have reported increases totaling about 73,000 K-12 students over the past two years.
At the same time, some families are leaving their local public schools not because they are dropping out of the system altogether, but because they have moved to other parts of the country that are more affordable.
Enrollment also increased in rural resort areasdriven by the relocation of tech workers and others able to work remotely, especially after the pandemic took hold.

The war in Ukraine is having a drastic impact on Africa. Prices for wheat, gas and gasoline are at record highs. Crisis regions could see things get worse than they already are. 
Every morning, the operators of a small kiosk located in an informal neighborhood in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, bake fresh chapati — a popular flatbread. 
Chapatis usually cost around 20 shillings (€0.17/$0.17). However, customers can hardly afford it anymore. "Chapati costs twice as much now. Life has become extremely expensive," one customer at the kiosk complained.

Market Insider: The G7 and EU are discussing seizures of Russian central bank assets for Ukraine aid, but the Kremlin calls it theft 
* The G7 and European Union are in talks to finance Ukraine aid with seized Russian assets. 
* "In the case of private assets, we have to see what is legally possible," Germany's finance minister said. 
* The Kremlin said that such an effort would be 'in fact, outright theft.' 
G7 and European Union leaders are discussing proposals to seize Russian Central Bank assets and use them to finance aid to Ukraine, Germany's finance minister said Tuesday. 
Christian Lindner said he is "politically open to the idea" but acknowledged that "in the case of private assets, we have to see what is legally possible." 
"We have to respect the rule of law, even if we are dealing with Russian oligarchs," he told the business daily Handelsblatt and other European media, according to Reuters.

Bloomberg: US Set to Block Russian Debt Payments, Raising Odds of Default 
(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is poised to fully block Russia’s ability to pay US bondholders after a deadline expires next week, a move that could bring Moscow closer to the brink of default. 
The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control is expected to let a temporary exemption lapse once it expires on May 25, according to people familiar with the matter. 
he waiver, issued shortly after the US levied sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine in February, has given Moscow room to pay coupons, helping it avert default on its government debt. 
The end of the carve-out could be the final straw in Russia’s debt saga after almost three months of war in Ukraine. It’s managed to make all its payments to creditors so far, weaving through the tangle of sanctions that closed off some avenues. 
That includes an 11th-hour escape earlier this month, when blocked payments were eventually allowed through after Moscow tapped its domestic dollar reserves. But it’s unclear how it can sidestep the end of the US loophole.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has replaced the head of its Territorial Defence Forces nearly three months into the war with Russia without giving a reason. 
The Defence Ministry said on Monday Zelenskiy had appointed Major General Ihor Tantsyura to take over from Yuriy Halushkin as commander of the forces that are helping the Ukrainian army defend the country following Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. 
The ministry described Tantsyura as an experienced officer who was previously chief of staff of Ukraine's ground forces.

DW: Did US intelligence-sharing with Ukraine cross a line? 
For years, the US has been arming and training Ukraine's army. But recent reports claim American intelligence is now helping deliver major blows to the Russian military. Could this heat up the Ukraine conflict further? 
Over two months into Russia's brutal invasion, Ukraine has continuously defied expectations while fending off a nuclear superpower that has tenfold its military budget. 
It is no secret that the backing of NATO and the US, the training and military assistance they have provided since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2014 and their recent shipments of weapons have all assisted in the success of Ukraine's armed forces.

WNU Editor: It is not only providing intelligence that the West has crossed a red-line. The Ukraine government is broke. It is only functioning right now because the West is paying its bills, salaries, providing humanitarian and military aid, and making sure the light stay on. The West is even paying the salaries for the Ukraine Army. If that is not crossing a red-line and getting directly involved in this war, then I do not what is.

Domestic terrorism,” Mr. Biden told mourners in this upstate New York town.  “Violence inflicted in the service of hatred and the vicious lust for power that defines a group of people as inherently inferior to any other group, a hatred that, through media and politics, the Internet, has radicalized individuals into angry, alienated, lost and isolated in the mistaken belief that they will be replaced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US State Department announced a new unit Tuesday to research, document and publicize alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine.
The Conflict Observatory will "capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine," the department said.
The Observatory will collect publicly and commercially available information, including what is seen on social media and commercial satellite imagery, for use in current and future civil and criminal legal processes.
Nearly three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv says it has identified thousands of suspected war crimes cases.
Most notorious have been the allegations of wanton murder of scores of civilians in Bucha, just outside Kyiv.
The Observatory will create an online platform "to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses," the department said.
The Observatory will be a joint effort by the department; Esri, a mapping software company; Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab; the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai, which combines artificial intelligence-based analysis with satellite imagery and other data.]]></summary>

Anti-war.com: The Leaders of France, Germany, and Italy Favor Negotiations to End Ukraine War  
The US, Britain, and other NATO countries don't hold the same view 
In recent weeks, the leaders of the three largest EU countries by population — France, Germany, and Italy — have all come out in favor of negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow as a way to end the fighting in Ukraine.
Unlike President Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi have all spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. 
The three European leaders have all signed off on sending weapons to the Ukrainians but have also been calling for a ceasefire. After speaking with Putin by phone on Friday, Scholz wrote on Twitter: “There must be a ceasefire in Ukraine as quickly as possible.”

WNU Editor: I do not see peace talks happening any time soon. 
Ukraine and most NATO countries have made it very clear that they are only focused on a military solution to the war. A war that will only end with the complete defeat of Russia and maybe regime change in Moscow. 
The Kremlin's conditions to end the war also remain the same, conditions that Kyiv has said more than once are completely unacceptable.
 Update: Western allies diverge over Ukraine war aims (Politico).]]></summary>

China Eastern flight MU5375 was travelling from Kunming to Guangzhou on March 21 when it inexplicably plunged from an altitude of 29,000 feet into a mountainside, killing all 132 people on board.
So-called black box flight data recorders recovered from the site were sent to the United States for analysis.
That data shows that someone -- possibly a pilot or someone who had forced their way into the cockpit -- input orders to send the Boeing 737-800 into a nosedive, according to Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the probe.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the two countries to abandon their military neutrality for NATO.

Leaders from Sweden and Finland said Tuesday they will officially turn in their NATO applications together on Wednesday. They will then head to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden, as the US makes a show of support for their bids.

DW: German state election leaves Chancellor Scholz reeling 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz is digesting a major defeat after his Social Democrats were comfortably beaten into second place in North Rhine-Westphalia. He now needs a favor from the surging Green Party. 
Sunday night's election victory in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) must have tasted extra sweet for the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU).

WNU Editor: I have been told that the high cost of living is what was/is on the minds of many Germans. And justifiably so. The Russian - Ukraine war is impacting Germany's energy supplies/prices, and in turn the economy. But while this was a major election loss for the SPD in one of their long held strongholds, it will not impact current German policy towards the war .... Scholz’s party keeps Ukraine policy despite state vote loss (AP).

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN)The Iran-backed political and militant group Hezbollah has lost its parliamentary coalition majority in a Lebanese election that delivered significant gains to its rivals as well as to a protest movement that swept the country in a 2019 uprising, final results showed Tuesday. 
Reformist political groups that sprung out of the nationwide demonstrations have won around 10% of the country's parliamentary seats, according to a CNN tally, in a sign of growing discontent with a ruling elite widely blamed for the country's economic collapse. Reformist parties won only one seat in the previous election cycle in 2018.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed guests at the Cannes Film Festival via video link on Tuesday as the annual event got under way.
Speaking during the opening ceremony, Zelensky drew a comparison to Charlie Chaplin's film "The Great Dictator" as he called on world cinema not to "remain silent" in the face of Russia's attack on Ukraine.
"Hundreds of people are dying every day," he said. "They will not get up after the final applause."
Afterwards, actress Julianne Moore officially opened the film festival, and the first film "Coupez!" (Final Cut) was screened.
The film by Michel Hazanavicius is a comedy set in a disused factory where the filming of a low-budget zombie film gets a little out of hand.
US Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, 60, also received a honorary Palme d'Or at the opening ceremony. Whitaker will present his film "For the Sake of Peace" in the French resort. It is about people who are working for peace in South Sudan.
The walls of shops and streets in Cannes are lined with film posters and a large "Top Gun" installation has been set up in front of the Grand Hôtel.
A giant pilot helmet points to one of the most anticipated screenings at the festival.
On Wednesday, Tom Cruise is scheduled to present "Top Gun: Maverick" - the sequel to the cult film from 1986.
The official poster for the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, which was designed as a homage to The Truman Show, is seen on the facade of the Palais des Festivals. The festival will take place from 17 to 28 May 2022. Frederick Injimbert/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — President Biden has signed an order authorizing the military to redeploy hundreds of special operations forces inside Somalia — largely reversing President Donald J. Trump’s decision to withdraw the quasi- all of the 700 ground troops stationed there, according to four officials familiar with the matter.
In addition, Mr. Biden has approved a request from the Pentagon for permanent authorization to target a dozen suspected leaders of Al Shabab, the Somali terror group affiliated with al-Qaeda, three of the officials said.

For months, the health worker, Bhanwar Bai Jadoun, had advised the woman to give birth in the hospital.  But the woman’s mother-in-law insisted on giving birth at home with the help of a local midwife.
Now complications had set in.  Mrs. Jadoun suggested taking the woman urgently to a hospital 10 miles from the village, Bagdoli;  she would notify the doctors there.  An auto rickshaw was arranged.  Both mother and baby were saved.

Later repaired, the red Gibson's destruction at the French capital's Rock en Seine festival in 2009 was "a cult moment" in music history, said Jonathan Berg, a guitar expert and cofounder of the Artpeges gallery that held the auction.
With a starting price at 150,000 euros ($160,000), the auctioneers said bids for the guitar could have reached as high as 500,000 euros.
A flagship of the 1990s Britpop movement built around the notoriously fractious Gallagher brothers, Oasis scored global success, selling 60 million albums and birthing hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back In Anger".
The band had been slated to play at …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power, air conditioning and railway service: such are the amenities of a sophisticated tunnel the length of five football fields, used to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the United States, said officials who made the shock discovery.
Federal authorities in California discovered the underground passageway last Friday as part of an investigation that led to the arrest and charging of six people, according to a Department of Justice criminal complaint.
Stretching from Tijuana, Mexico to a warehouse in Otay Mesa, south of San Diego, it is thought to be 1,744 feet (530 meters) long, 61 feet deep and four feet in diameter, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California said in a statement Monday.
Underground, officials found "reinforced walls, a rail system, electricity and a ventilation system."
Six people were charged with conspiring to distribute 1,762 pounds (800 kilograms) of cocaine, and officials also seized 164 pounds of methamphetamine and 3.5 pounds of heroin.
US Department of Homeland Security agents conducting surveillance on a suburban San Diego home tracked suspects to a stash location some 300 feet from the border. While inspecting the building, the agents discovered the tunnel access point, dug right out of the cement floor.
"There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel," US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a the statement. 
"We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities."
Cross-border tunnels are frequently used by traffickers who smuggle migrants lured by the "American dream," or drugs, into the United States, the world's largest consumer of South American cocaine. 
According to US figures, more than 90 tunnels have been discovered in southern California alone since 1993, including another "sophisticated" underground passageway located in March 2020.]]></summary>

 DW: Mexico's number of 'disappeared' people rises above 100,000 
There are now over 100,000 people in Mexico's national register of the "disappeared." The UN says organized crime is among the leading causes of missing people in the country. 
Mexico's official figure of missing people on Monday surpassed 100,000 for the first time as families pushed authorities to do more to find victims of violence linked to organized crime. 
The interior ministry compiles a national register of the "desaparecidos" — Spanish for missing people —  which is periodically updated. 
In the last two years the numbers have spiked from about 73,000 people to more than 100,000 — mostly men.

The first successful test of a prototype AGM-183A ARRW comes as the program’s future is increasingly uncertain. 
The Air Force says that it has finally successfully test-launched a prototype of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW. This follows three failed launch attempts last year and comes as the service is reassessing the future of the program. 
The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force announced the successful AGM-183A test flight late on May 16, 2022. The test itself had taken place on May 14. As had been the plan from the beginning, a B-52H Stratofortress from the 419th Flight Test Squadron launched the missile over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California.

The landslide victory of Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the country’s longtime dictator, has exposed one of liberal democracy’s greatest vulnerabilities.
 Last week, voters in the Philippines went to the polls — and, by an overwhelming margin, chose the son of the country’s deposed dictator as their next president.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr., widely referred to by his nickname, Bongbong, ran on a ticket with Vice President-elect Sara Duterte — the daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, a populist most famous for his policy of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers, who pushed the Philippines toward au…]]></summary>

Without amending the Constitution of Canada, Charles will automatically succeed Queen Elizabeth II as head of state of Canada, like all British monarchs since the founding of the country.  Poll after poll shows the 96-year-old Queen who has battled some recent health issues is widely respected by Canadians.
However, for several years an ever-decreasing number of Canadians, according to polls, have wanted to swear allegiance to another British monarch, in particular Charles, who is hated by many here and who represents an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Secret Service documents obtained by The Daily Dot show that agents charged with protecting former President Donald Trump feared that he would have a milkshake hurled at him during a 2019 trip to the United Kingdom.
Ahead of the trip, anti-fascists activists in the U.K. started a campaign called "Splash the Fash" that targeted far-right political figures such as Trump ally Nigel Farage with milkshakes.
To protect the then-president from the threat of getting pelted by a delicious summer treat, the Secret Service monitored social media accounts that fantasized about dousing him with milkshakes.
"We’ll have to keep an eye on SplashThe[Fash],” one Secret Service official wrote in a message obtained by The Daily Dot. “I’m sure it will get a lot of attention. I’ll pass it along to the person monitoring the trips.”

The official added that they would "not waste a milkshake" by using it to attack Trump.
At other points, the agents acknowledged that it would be very hard for them to contain all potential milkshakes that could potentially be lobbed at the president.
“At some point on this trip, one of the 4 of us is getting 'Milkshaked,'" one person in the Presidential Protective Division wrote in another message obtained by The Daily Dot.

The United States and Europe have coordinated closely to enact sweeping sanctions against Russia in the nearly three months since its president, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered an invasion.  But they have been less aligned with the need to help sustain Ukraine’s economy and help rebuild it once the war is over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christina Bobb, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, struggled to explain this week why her boss would endorse Mehmet Oz for Senate if the candidate would not falsely say the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
In an interview with Bobb, Real America's Voice host Ed Henry explained that host David Brody had asked Oz why he had refused to call the election "rigged" or "stolen."
"I want to be careful," Oz replied.
Henry seemed shocked by the answer.
"As you know, Oz was a very controversial endorsement by your boss, Donald Trump," the anchor told Bobb. "And now you add to it, when asked by David Brody -- again, not in a gotcha way -- do you think the last election was stolen? He basically wouldn't answer."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were midway through their set when Islamist militants sprayed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris with gunfire, cutting down revelers, frontman Jesse Hughes recounted before a French court on Tuesday. 
Guitar technician Eden Galindo's first thought had been that the sound system was exploding, but Hughes said he knew instantly the venue was under attack.
"Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gun shots," Hughes told the trial of Salah Abdeslam, the only suspected surviving member of the squad that killed 130 people at several locations on November 13, 2015.
"I knew that death was coming," he said.
The assailants burst through the music hall's main entrance and blasted automatic gunfire into the crowd as the band played.
"We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming," Galindo told the court. "After a while they reloaded and a technician told us, 'next time they stop, we run'."
The band escaped through a side door but their tour manager was killed.
The attackers took hostages inside the music hall during an hours-long assault that claimed 90 lives and ended after police shot dead one militant and the two others detonated their suicide vests.
Survivors have recounted playing dead for hours, or hiding in cupboards, not knowing if their friends or relatives were still alive. They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.
Abdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.

He told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.
Six years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.
"Evil did not win," he said. "You can't kill rock and roll."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - His doctors probably don't agree but Pope Francis thinks a shot of tequila just might help his painful knee.
While his popemobile stopped in St. Peter's Square at his last general audience, a group of Mexican seminarians shouted out to him, asking how his leg was doing.
"It's being naughty," the Argentine pope replied in Spanish. A flare up of pain in his knee and existing leg problems have forced the pope to use a wheelchair at times recently.
One of seminarians then thanked the seated pope for continuing to carry out his duties despite the pain, telling the 85-year-old Francis that his persistence was an example for them as future priests.
Noting that they were Mexican because of the flag they were carrying, the pope said: "Do you know what I need for my leg? A bit of tequila."
After much laughter, one of them shouted back: "If one day we go to Santa Marta, we'll bring you a bottle," referring to the guest house where Francis lives in the Vatican.
One of the seminarians, Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, posted the exchange, which took place at the general audience last Wednesday, on TikTok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported that Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine is still running strong in Russia, with a Kremlin spokesperson telling the Russian people that invasion of Ukraine will "make life better" for them.
This is in spite of the fact that the ensuing embargo by western nations has caused the Russian economy to implode, with a leaked internal Kremlin forecast projecting the economy to shrink by 12 percent just this year alone.
""We are in fact now living in the conditions of a perfect storm and the moment of truth, that very storm and moment of truth that will ensure and protect our interests, and make it so that your lives are better, more comfortable, more stable, and more secure," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to Daily Beast reporter Allison Quinn. 
Peskov also claimed that "our president knows where he is leading our country" and that 'the whole country supports him.'"

Quinn skeptically notes that "the war that the Kremlin has depicted as a heroic crusade against nonexistent neo-Nazi leaders in Ukraine has led to hundreds of foreign companies cutting ties with Russia, killed as many as 27,000 Russian troops, and, according to Ukrainian intelligence, left Putin’s military in shambles."
Meanwhile, experts believe Russia's military has taken such heavy losses that their war aims may have to be scaled back again. Even Russian military analysts appear to be more pessimistic in their reports on state TV.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's extremely rare for a Russian military expert to criticize the performance of the country's armed forces. 
But according to Mikhail Khodaryonok, a defense analyst, his country's war in Ukraine isn't going according to President Vladimir Putin's plan -- and likely is failing.
The BBC's Francis Scarr, who regularly monitors Russian state TV, posted a subtitled video clip on Twitter in which Khodaryonok offered his bleak assessment of the war effort in Ukraine.
"First of all, we shouldn't take information tranquilizers," he said, "because sometimes information is spread about some morale and psychological breakdown in the Ukrainian armed forces, which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis of morale and so on. All of that, to put it mildly, is false."

Khodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, "despite the resistance of a single senator." Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.
"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future," Khodaryonok said. "and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse."
Watch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.

In an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation. It's fairly long but worth your time so I've added subtitles.pic.twitter.com/0mr7WAgSx6

(Reuters) -Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies have lost their majority in Lebanon's parliament in a general election, a Reuters tally of final results showed on Tuesday, a major blow to the heavily armed group that reflects anger with Lebanon's ruling elite.
The Shi'ite Muslim movement and factions that support its possession of arms won around 62 of parliament's 128 seats in Sunday's election, a reversal of the 2018 result when they secured a majority of 71.
In the first election since Lebanon's economic collapse and the Beirut port explosion of 2020, reform-minded political newcomers won about a dozen seats, making an unexpectedly strong breakthrough into a system long dominated by the same groups.

His exhausted 28-year-old mother did not even bother to duck.
Valeria Kolakevych has heard so many shells whizz overhead in the third month of Russia's offensive that she knows instinctively how close each will land while it is still in the air.

   WNU Editor: Defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok is basically saying that you cannot fight a war with half measures. Ukraine and NATO are fully committed that Russia must be defeated on the battlefield, while Russia still regards this war as a "military action".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sandstorm engulfed Saudi Arabia's capital and other regions of the desert kingdom Tuesday, hampering visibility and slowing road traffic.
A thick grey haze made iconic Riyadh buildings such as Kingdom Centre nearly impossible to see from more than a few hundred metres (yards) away, though there were no announced flight delays or cancellations.
The kingdom's meteorology centre forecast "surface dusty winds" in the country's east and in Riyadh, "reducing horizontal sight", according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
Dusty conditions were also expected farther west in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to the forecast.
Electronic signs along Riyadh's highways warned drivers to reduce their speed because of the lower visibility.
In central Riyadh, sand layered cars and buildings, and residents struggled to keep it out of their homes.
"Working outside is very difficult because of the dirt," a Pakistani construction worker who gave his name as Kalimullah told AFP as he installed tiles.
"I try to wash my face from time to time," the 30-year-old added, wrapping a piece of cloth around his face to block the sand.
Saudi office worker Abdullah Al-Otaibi said he was grateful he works indoors.

"Dust storms are part of our culture and we are used to it, but some of them are severe," said Al-Otaibi, 39, rubbing his eyes as he hurried into his office building.
Parts of Saudi Arabia typically see sandstorms between March and May, with varying intensity. The frequency of the storms has increased in recent months in the region.
Neighboring Iraq has experienced eight sandstorms since mid-April, a phenomenon fueled by soil degradation, intense droughts and low rainfall linked to climate change.
In Iran on Tuesday, government offices and schools and universities were closed in many provinces due to "unhealthy weather" and sandstorms, state media reported.

Troops holed up in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol have begun evacuating, appearing to cede control of the once prosperous city to Russia after months of bombardment. 
Ukraine's military command said in the early hours on Tuesday that the mission to defend the Azovstal steel plant by "the heroes of our time" was over and it pledged to rescue servicemen still trapped inside. 
"The 'Mariupol' garrison has fulfilled its combat mission," the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said in a statement.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Ankara to convince it to approve their NATO bid. 
In a news conference, Erdogan said Turkey would not approve their bids to join NATO, calling Sweden a "hatchery" for terrorist organisations, and adding they had terrorists in their parliament. 
Ankara says Sweden and Finland harbor people it says are linked to groups it deems terrorists, namely the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt.

Reuters: Ukrainian force begins evacuating from last Mariupol stronghold  
KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) -The force holed up in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol began evacuating on Monday, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after months of bombardment. 
Five buses carrying troops from the Azovstal steelworks arrived in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk late on Monday, some 32 kilometres (20 miles) to the east, a Reuters witness said. 
Some of the evacuated troops were wounded and carried out of the buses on stretchers. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said 53 were taken to a hospital. 
It was not immediately clear how many troops were aboard the buses. Malyar said 211 other troops were taken to another site. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant.

The war in Ukraine is severely curtailing the European Union's economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic with this year's growth forecast sharply revised down, the European Commission warned on Monday. 
It lowered its economic growth forecast for the eurozone in 2022 by 1.3 points to 2.7% and increased its inflation forecast by 3.5 points to 6.1%.   Inflation for the whole of the EU is meanwhile expected to reach 6.8% this year.

					The UN migration agency, IOM, is running migrant centres across six provinces in Turkey as part of its refugee response, which provide migrants, refugees, and host community members, with education, social services, law, vocational guidance, and community support. One of those who has benefited from the centres is Leyla Al Darazi, originally from Lebanon, who although born male, has identified as female since a young age. To coincide with the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, marked on 17 May, Leyla told her story to Begum Basaran, a communications assistant with IOM Turkey.

OilPrice.com: The NOPEC Bill Could Send Oil Prices To $300 
* For decades, different forms of ‘NOPEC’ legislation designed to pave the way for lawsuits against OPEC have been considered by Congress. 
* Last week, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved the NOPEC bill, leading to pushback from both within and outside the U.S. 
* OPEC’s most influential energy ministers warned that the bill could send oil prices soaring by 200 or even 300 percent. 
If the U.S. passes the NOPEC bill, a bill designed to pave the way for lawsuits against OPEC members for market manipulation, the oil market could face even more chaos. OPEC’s most influential energy ministers warned against passing the legislation, suggesting it could send oil prices soaring by 200% or 300%.   “The last thing we want is someone trying to hinder that system,” the UAE’s Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said at a conference in Abu Dhabi, referring to the system OPEC has had in place for decades to ensure supply to the market is adequate (adequate according to OPEC’s view).

* Russia's oil export revenue has soared 50% this year, the International Energy Agency said. 
* The Kremlin is earning close to $20 billion per month in 2022. 
* Asia has boosted Russian crude purchases as global powers condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russian oil export revenue is up 50% since the start of 2022 with the Kremlin generating close to $20 billion per month in sales, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Export volume has rebounded to levels seen before Russia invaded Ukraine, which triggered a wave of international sanctions and a spike in crude prices that's helped oil revenue. 
In April, Russian oil exports climbed by 620,000 barrels per day from the prior month to 8.1 million, back to their January and February average, the IEA said. Increased demand from India and China offset declines from the US and Europe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fuel and medicine shortages, along with record inflation and lengthy blackouts, have brought severe hardships to Sri Lankans, in the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948    
Daily Mail: Sri Lanka is down to its last day of petrol and faces 'severe' shortage of medicine, new PM warns amid economic crisis that plunged country into turmoil sparking deadly riots 
* The nation has suspended repayment of $7 billion in foreign loans due this year 
* Sri Lanka's total foreign debt is $51 billion, about half of which is due in 2026 
* People face major shortages of petrol and essential medicine among other items 
* 'We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices,' PM Wickremesinghe said 
* The country has seen widespread protests in recent weeks amid the crisis 
* Nine people were killed and 300 injured in clashes with government supporters last week   Sri Lanka's new prime minister today declared the crisis-hit nation was down to its last day of petrol, as the country's power minister told citizens not to join the lengthy fuel queues that have galvanised weeks of anti-government protests. 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, appointed prime minister on Thursday, said in an address to the nation the country urgently needed $75 million in foreign exchange to pay for essential imports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remarkable new retail project is about to join the Downtown Brooklyn development boom.  The building at 555 Fulton St. by Steven Witkoff and Apollo – shown here for the first time – will occupy the wraparound corner where Fulton Street, DeKalb Avenue and Bond Street converge.
Designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, it will provide one lucky tenant with highly visible space with 7,902 square feet on the ground floor and an additional 6,459 square feet on the lower level.  The first pickaxe should take place soon.
GoodSpace brokers Chris DeCrosta and Hank O’Donnell said the image isn’t quite final.  “Because this is a customizable building, we’ll market to see if a tenant wants a say in the final design,” DeCrosta said.
They target sports brands such as Nike or Adidas, “which could make sales of $40 million to $50 million a year,” DeCrosta said.  O’Donnell added: “It’s a place to do crazy business.”  Brokers refused to quote an asking rent.
The area is seeing a meteoric rise in commercial and residential development, including City Point, a new Ace Hotel and giant apartment towers from Extell, JDS and others.

Reuters: IMF Lifts Weighting of Dollar, Chinese Yuan in SDR Basket 
BEIJING (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Saturday it has increased the weighting of the dollar and Chinese yuan in its review of the currencies that make up the valuation of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR), an international reserve asset. 
The review is the first since the yuan, also known as the renminbi, joined the basket of currencies in 2016 in what was a milestone in Beijing's efforts to internationalise its currency. 
The IMF raised the U.S. currency's weighting to 43.38% from 41.73% and the yuan to 12.28% from 10.92%. The euro's weighting declined to 29.31% from 30.93%, the yen's fell to 7.59% from 8.33% and the British pound fell to 7.44% from 8.09%. 
The IMF said in a statement its executive board had determined the weighting based on trade and financial market developments from 2017 to 2021.

Recommendations for Yoon-Biden Summit – Must Build on the Strong Alliance Foundation
19fortyfive.com · by David Maxwell · May 16, 2022
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol began his five-year term on May 10 with a midnight security briefing from the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff. This meeting, which precedes a May 21 summit between Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden, reflects Yoon’s view that North Korea is the South’s “main enemy.”
Yoon’s presidency comes at a tumultuous time in U.S. foreign policy. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine continues, and it enjoys Chinese support. Strategic competition is expanding with Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has conducted 16 missile tests in 2022 so far. Raising the possibility of internal instability in North Korea is the COVID-19 outbreak that Kim has finally admitted to, after more than two years of claiming zero cases in the country.
In this context, the South Korea-U.S. alliance remains as important as ever. The upcoming summit provides an opportunity not only to reaffirm the alliance at the start of the Yoon administration, but also to build on the ROK-U.S. vision laid out in the May 2021 summit.

There may be no easy answers.  Platforms like Facebook, Twitch and Twitter have made progress in recent years, experts said, in removing violent content and videos faster.  Following the shooting in New Zealand, social platforms and countries around the world joined an initiative called Christchurch Call to Action and agreed to work closely together to counter terrorism and violent extremism content.  One tool that social sites have used is a shared database of hashes, or digital fingerprints of images, which can flag inappropriate content and remove it quickly.

The central problem is that the coronavirus has become more adept at reinfecting people.  Already, people infected with the first variant of Omicron are reporting second infections with newer versions of the variant – BA.2 or BA2.12.1 in the United States, or BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa.
These people could have a third or fourth infection even within this year, researchers said in interviews.  And a small fraction may have symptoms that persist for months or years, a condition known as Long Covid.
“It seems likely to me that this will be somewhat of a long-term trend,” said Juliet Pul…]]></summary>

May 16 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble firmed past 64 per dollar on Monday and climbed towards its highest in nearly five years against the euro, supported by continuing restrictions on currency trading. 
The rouble is the world's best-performing currency this year, although this is due to artificial support from capital controls that Russia imposed to shield its financial sector in late February after sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

Reuters: EU ministers urge Hungary to sign up to planned Russian oil embargo 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU foreign ministers sought to publicly pressure Hungary on Monday to lift its veto of a proposed oil embargo on Russia, with Lithuania saying the bloc was being "held hostage by one member state".
The ban on crude imports proposed by the European Commission in early May would be its harshest sanction yet in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and includes carve-outs for EU states most dependent on Russian oil.  Germany, the European Union's biggest economy and a major buyer of Russian energy, said it wanted a deal to authorize the oil embargo, which it suggested could last for years.
