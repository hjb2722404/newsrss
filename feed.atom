        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Genco Picardy is not an American ship. It doesn't pay U.S. taxes, none of its crew are U.S. nationals, and when it sailed through the Red Sea last month, it wasn't carrying cargo to or from an American port. 
But when the Houthis, a tribal militant group from Yemen, attacked the ship, the crew called the U.S. Navy. That same day, the Navy fired missiles at Houthi sites.
On today's show: How did protecting the safe passage of other countries' ships in the Red Sea become a job for the U.S. military?  It goes back to an idea called Freedom of the Seas, an idea that started out as an abstract pipe dream when it was coined in the early 1600s – but has become a pillar of the global economy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Ukraine struggling with ammunition shortages in its fight against Russia, President Joe Biden on Friday called out Republicans who are still refusing to back a military aid package to the country.
In fact, noted Biden, the Republican-led House of Representatives will be on recess between now and the end of the month, which he called an unacceptably long break at a time when an American ally needed desperate help.
"It's about time they step up, don't you think, instead of going on a two-week vacation?" Biden asked rhetorically. "Two weeks! What are they thinking? My God! This is bizarre!"
Biden went on to explain how Republicans' decision to kill the foreign aid package, which also provided significant reforms to America's asylum and immigration laws, were a gift to foreign adversaries.
"It just reinforces the concern... about the United States being a reliable ally," he said.

The push to help Ukraine gained added urgency on Friday after it was revealed that longtime Russian dissident leader Alexey Navalny had died in prison.
While the cause of Navalny's death has not been disclosed, Russia's history of targeting dissidents with assassination has raised suspicions in many nations that foul play may have been involved.
Despite this, it does not appear that the House of Representatives is poised to move on an aide package anytime soon, as Speaker Mike Johnson has called any packages for aid that do not have significant border reforms to be dead on arrival.
What's more, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has vowed to file a motion to vacate the speakership should Johnson agree to bring any aid package for Ukraine to the floor of the House of Representatives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince Harry has suggested that King Charles's illness could help reunite the British royal family, and described how he immediately "jumped on a plane" to London after his father's cancer diagnosis.
In an interview with ABC's Good Morning America show on Friday, the prince made his first public comments on the king's health.
He said he heard the news directly from Charles "and went to go and see him as soon as I could."
"I love my family," Harry said, adding he was "grateful" to spend a brief amount of time with his father last week.
Harry spoke in Canada where he and his wife Meghan are attending training a year ahead of the Invictus Games for injured military veterans, an event that he organizes.
Asked if the illness could bring his family back together, Harry said "Yeah, I'm sure."
Referencing the games, he added that "throughout all the families that I see on a day-to-day basis (it is) the strength of the family unit coming together."
Harry declined to give details on his father's health, saying "that stays between me and him."
Prince Harry quit royal duties in 2020 and relocated to California where he lives with his American wife and their two young children.
"I have got other trips planned that would take me through the UK, or back to the UK so I will stop and see my family as much as I can," said Harry.
He also said he had considered seeking American citizenship, but it was not a current priority for him.
Charles' diagnosis came just 17 months into his reign following the death of his 96-year-old mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on September 8, 2022.]]></summary>

"Navalny was serving a 19-year jail term on charges widely considered politically motivated," the BBC reports. "He was moved to one of Russia's toughest penal colonies late last year."
"Within minutes of Navalny's death being announced by the prison service, the international community hailed the courage of Vladimir Putin's biggest domestic adversary," BBC added.

        <updated>2024-02-16T15:56:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Vice President Mike Pence on Friday came out with a stirring defense of the late Russian dissident Alexey Navalny, but many critics suggested he was overlooking a particularly large elephant in the room.
Writing on Twitter, Pence wrote that, "There is no room in the Republican Party for apologists for Putin" before adding "RIP Alexey Navalny."
While many of Pence's followers didn't disagree with the sentiment he was expressing, they did note that he failed to call out his one-time boss, former President Donald Trump, who has regularly gushed over Putin and has even suggested that he wouldn't come to the defense of NATO allies if Putin attacked them.
"HAVE YOU LISTENED TO TRUMP?" asked an incredulous Pradheep Shanker, a regular contributor to the conservative National Review.
DON'T MISS: ‘Boss Trump’ is a mobster finally facing the music: new book
Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA) similarly suggested that Pence's post would benefit from taking a shot at Trump.
"When Navalny went back to Russia he said, 'There must be those in Russia who don't lie to them, after all,'" she argued. "Today would be a good day for Mike Pence to do the same and say Donald Trump is an apologist for Putin. He’s never called him out. He’d give Ukraine to him. Please lead."
"Seems like there’s plenty of room," commented pollster Sarah Longwell. "Room made by the president you served."
And Bloomberg columnist Robert George had a sarcastic interpretation of Pence's statement that he believed made it more in tune with reality.
"'No room,' in the sense there are now so many Putin apologists in the GOP, it’s nearly impossible to accommodate more?" he cracked.
Russian media sources announced on Friday that Navalny had died in his prison cell. Although no cause of death has officially been determined, the Russian government under Vladimir Putin has a long history of targeting dissidents for assassination.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French cinema has been rocked by a new wave of allegations of child rape and sexual assault targeting household names in the industry, bolstering talk of a long-awaited breakthrough for the #MeToo movement in France following a nationwide controversy over Gérard Depardieu. The latest accusations shine a stark light on the culture of impunity that prevailed in a country where auteur worship has long served as a cover for abuse.
French cinema’s #MeToo breakthrough has been heralded, and pushed back, often enough to warrant caution – but there are signs the ground is finally shifting, more than six years after cinema’s feminist revolution kicked off across the Atlantic. 
In 2017, at the dawn of the #MeToo era, French actor Judith Godrèche was among the first to speak out against Hollywood mog…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seventy-seven of the 99 journalists killed in 2023 were killed in the Israel-Hamas war, making the last 12 months the deadliest for the media in almost a decade, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Thursday.
Killings of reporters would have dropped globally year-on-year had it not been for the deaths in that conflict, the CPJ said, although fatalities were stable in Somalia and the Philippines.
The toll is the highest since 2015 and an increase of nearly 44 percent on 2022's figures.
"In December 2023, CPJ reported that more journalists were killed in the first three months of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year," the CPJ said.
The vast majority of the 77 journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict -- 72 of them -- were Palestini…]]></summary>

Depardieu, 75, has been charged with rape in another case and has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women. He denies the allegations.
The woman registered a complaint on January 9 accusing Depardieu of "sexual assault on a vulnerable person by someone abusing the authority of their function", according to the document seen by AFP late Thursday.
She told regional newspaper Le Courrier de l'Ouest that he groped her "all over" and made "inappropriate" remarks while she was a 24-year-old assistant on the set in western France of 2015 film "Le magician et le Siamiois" ("The Magician and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rod Stewart, the singer whose hits include "Maggie May," is the latest artist to sell the rights to his music, The Wall Street Journal said Thursday.
The paper said Irving Azoff's Iconic Artists Group acquired Stewart's interests in his recorded music and publishing catalog, as well as some rights to his name as likeness, for a tidy sum of nearly $100 million.
News of the sale comes less than a week after reports of a blockbuster deal reached by Sony to acquire half of Michael Jackson's recording and publishing catalog rights from his estate.
Details of that transaction are scant, but reports from Billboard and The New York Times say it is likely the largest valuation of a single musician's assets.
The Times, citing people briefed on the deal, said it valued Jackson's assets at $1.2 billion or more, a valuation Billboard said meant Sony was paying at least $600 million for the stake.
Music rights in recent years became a hot market after a flurry of sales that saw the likes of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks and Neil Young cash in on their catalogs.
The burgeoning market appeared to cool somewhat, but the Stewart and Jackson deals are clear indications demand remains.
According to the WSJ, Azoff's Iconic has raised more than $1 billion in new capital to put towards catalog acquisitions.
Music catalogues are attractive as an asset class that investors see as having long-term value in the age of streaming.
Owners of a song's publishing rights receive a cut in various scenarios, including radio play and streaming, album sales, and use in advertising and movies. Recording rights govern reproduction and distribution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro lashed out at his Argentine counterpart Thursday, three days after the United States completed the seizure of a Venezuelan plane held in Buenos Aires since June 2022.
"They stole our plane... Milei the bandit stole the plane from Venezuela. Javier Milei, the hero of the extreme right," Maduro said in a televised statement about the Argentine president.
"He acts crazy or he is crazy or both at the same time," he added.
The Boeing 747 cargo plane owned by Venezuelan company Emtrasur has been held in Argentina since landing there in 2022 from Mexico with a shipment of auto parts.
The 19-member crew was comprised of Venezuelans and Iranians -- one of whom the United States suspected had links to the Al Quds Force, a group of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards classified as a terrorist organization by the United States.
All the crew were initially detained but later freed.
The plane was sold to Emtrasur, a subsidiary of state airline Conviasa, by Iran's Mahan Air in October 2021 which the US said contravened its sanctions against both countries.
Caracas and Tehran protested US attempts to seize the plane, but an Argentinian judge last month ordered it surrendered to the United States.
"The seized American-built aircraft was transferred by a sanctioned Iranian airline in a transaction that violated US export control laws and directly benefited the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is a designated terrorist organization," US Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division said in a statement this week.
"Mahan Air -- known to ferry weapons and fighters for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah -- violated our export restrictions by selling this airplane to a Venezuelan cargo airline. Now, it's property of the United States government," added Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of export enforcement.
Venezuela's foreign ministry said it would "take all actions" to have the plane returned to its "legitimate owner."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An informant who made derogatory claims about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter has been arrested by the FBI after a grand jury charged him with false statements and obstruction, reported Politico's Kyle Cheney on Thursday.
Alexander Smirnov, who was identified as a confidential human source in the investigation, was arrested at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas earlier this week, according to a statement released by the DOJ Thursday.
According to the indictment, Smirnov falsely claimed to FBI agents that executives at the Ukrainian industrial company Burisma told him they hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems," at a time when Biden was vice president and bribed both of them for their efforts.

At the time, Biden had been instrumental in pressuring Ukraine to remove prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, which Republicans have claimed was to prevent an investigation of Burisma. But this has been repeatedly debunked; Biden was acting in line with U.S. policy, Shokin was not planning to investigate Burisma, and international observers had accused him of corruption.
Per the DOJ statement, FBI officials became suspicious in part because Smirnov changed his story and provided different details when questioned at a later date.
This comes after a number of other failed Republican allegations against the Bidens, including a series of payments the younger Biden made to his father that turned out just to be repaying loans for a truck.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For half a century, during the Cold War, every U-S president painted Russia as the dominant threat. America's ideological opposite, a hostile and nuclear-armed power. Ronald Reagan went so far as to call the Soviet Union an Evil Empire.
So the events of recent days have been noteworthy. On top of a holdup of U-S aid for Ukraine, former President Trump said he might NOT come to the defense of a NATO ally who hadn't spent enough on defense.
And Tucker Carlson, the erstwhile Fox news host, flew to Moscow to sit down with Vladimir Putin for more than two hours of mostly softball questions. 
Afterward, he pronounced Putin "impressive" on stage at the World Government Summit.
So what gives? Why the romance between the American right and Russia?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Valentine's Day, you're under arrest!
Two Peruvian women accused of drug trafficking got more than they bargained for on Wednesday when a romantic gesture turned out to be a police raid leading to their arrests.
Police footage of the raid showed a giant teddy bear holding up gifts outside the women's home, while another officer held a heart-covered sign reading "You are my reason to smile".
One of the women rushed down the stairs to receive her offering.
But love can be deceiving, and the cuddly bear quickly sprang into action, tackling her to the ground. The second woman was arrested inside.
"It was a surprise operation for them as part of the day of love," the disguised officer later told AFP.
Police said the women, a mother and daughter, were part of a gang called "the drug cheats", and sold cocaine paste and marijuana from their home in northern Lima.
Hundreds of packages of drugs were seized at the location.
Peruvian police have become adept at disguises and operations launched on special dates to try to deceive and trap criminals.
The officers "disguised themselves using the teddy bear because drugs were sold there," Colonel Walter Palomino, head of the Green Squadron of the National Police, told AFP.
Peru is one of the world's biggest cocaine producers, yielding some 400 tonnes per year, according to official figures.
In 2023, authorities seized 21.5 tonnes of cocaine and dismantled 119 criminal networks linked to drug trafficking, according to the interior ministry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French yachtswoman has denied accusations of cheating in the last Vendee Globe solo non-stop round the world sailing race.
"We never cheated," Clarisse Cremer insisted on Thursday in a joint statement with her husband Tanguy Le Turquais.
They were responding to an anonymous e-mail sent to the French Sailing Federation (FFVoile) last Sunday.
In it Cremer was accused of using information relayed to her by the land-based Le Turquais to help plot her route during the 45,000-kilometre 2020/2021 Vendee Globe.
Outside assistance of this nature is strictly forbidden in the rules of the mythic race that sets out and finishes at the French port of Les Sables-d'Olonne every four years.
An international jury has been established to investigate the affair based on screenshots of WhatsApp conversations between the couple sent to the federation in Sunday's tip-off.
"During our chats which essentially concerned the intimacy between a couple, Tanguy never gave me the slightest bit of information that I didn't have already," insisted Cremer.
The 34-year-old, who skippered her yacht Banque Populaire into 12th, added: "No chat with him contributed to me changing course or making a strategic decision that would have had an impact on my race.
"All my performance decisions I made alone and without any assistance according to the rules."
The couple questioned the motive and timing of their anonymous accuser with the pair among the 44 candidates for the next Vendee Globe starting in November, with only 40 allowed to take part.
They are considering legal action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spanish farmers kept up their protests over the sector's troubles on Thursday, with tractors parked outside of the agriculture ministry in central Madrid before a meeting with Agriculture Minister Luis Planas.
Farmers slowly drove around 15 tractors, some decorated with Spanish flags, to the building which sits across the street from Madrid's busy Atocha train station, snarling traffic.
Once there they parked and unfurled banners that read "Farmers on a war path" and "Planas, the ruin of the countryside".
Around 250 farmers and agricultural union representatives gathered in the rain ahead of the meeting. Most had arrived by bus from other regions of Spain.
Planas was due to meet with Spain's main agricultural unions, Asaja, COAG and UPA, later on Thursday, a day after he met with the major players in the food supply chain
Farmers on Wednesday blocked roads across the country, especially in the south where they disrupted the first stage of a cycling race and in the northeastern region of Catalonia where they blocked parts of the AP-7 highway linking Spain and France.
Angry farmers have been protesting across Europe over rising costs, high fuel prices, bureaucracy and the environmental requirements in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its forthcoming "Green Deal".
Spanish farmers are also protesting low prices for their produce and the lack of financial aid to the sector.
The unions are planning a huge rally in front of the agriculture ministry on February 21, and will rally again in Madrid on February 26 to coincide with the meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels.
Often referred to as Europe's vegetable garden, Spain is one of the bloc's leading producers of salad, fruit and vegetables but its farms have suffered from a long-running drought in the Iberian Peninsula for the past three years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a test of new surface-to-sea missiles and warned that the country would take a more aggressive military posture in disputed sea boundaries with war-divided rival South Korea, the North’s state media said Thursday.
The report by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea's military said it detected the North firing multiple cruise missiles in waters off its eastern port of Wonsan. The test, the North’s sixth missile launch event of 2024, added to a provocative run in weapons demonstrations since 2022 that escalated tensions to the highest point in years.
Some experts say Kim may seek to further dial up pressure in an election year in South Korea and the United States. There are growing concerns in South Korea about a direct military provocation and a possible area of conflict could be the Koreas’ poorly drawn western sea boundary, which has been the site of several bloody skirmishes in past years.
Kim supervised the test launches of the missiles he described as key weapons for his navy. He also accused South Korea of frequently violating what he decried as North Korean territorial waters with its maritime patrols and interdiction of third-party ships. He ordered his navy to strengthen its defense posture in waters near the South Korean border islands of Baekryeong and Yeonpyeong, where a North Korean artillery bombardment killed four people in 2010.

Soon he is moving through the deserted corridors to open the doors of some of the most visited galleries in the world.
"There are exactly 2,797 keys... Each one has between one and five copies, so we have more than 10,000," said the 51-year-old Roman, who knows every lock by heart.
From Bramante's spiral staircase to the Gallery of Maps, Crea's silhouette weaves its way through the museums, between marble sculptures, Roman antiquities and Renaissance paintings.
In a few hours, thousands of tourists will be crowding into the museums' 1,400 rooms.

For decades NATO has a nuclear deterrent that works for the Western military alliance, Stoltenberg said. "We should continue to ensure that it remains safe and reliable," he said.

        <updated>2024-02-14T13:24:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty on Wednesday by a Paris appeals court of illegal campaign financing over his failed 2012 re-election bid, confirming a previous ruling by a lower court.
He was sentenced to one-year year prison sentence, half of which is suspended, that can be served through alternative means like wearing an electronic bracelet without going to jail.

Sarkozy had been handed a one-year prison sentence in 2021 when first found guilty, though that was suspended while he launched his appeal.
Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, remained an influential figure among conservatives and is on friendly terms with President Emmanuel Macron - despite a string of trials and investigations linked to various legal issues surrounding his campaign finances.
He has always denied accusations that his party Les Republicains, then known as the UMP, worked with a public relations firm named Bygmalion to hide the true cost of his campaign - marked by lavish show events previously unseen in French politics. 
During a hearing, Sarkozy put the blame on some members of his campaign team: "I didn't choose any supplier, I didn't sign any quotation, any invoice," he told the court.
France sets strict limits on campaign spending. Prosecutors allege that the firm invoiced UMP rather than the campaign. They say Sarkozy spent 42.8 million euros on his 2012 campaign, almost double the permitted amount.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
