Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) had willed a resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib," Greene said on Wednesday. "This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC."

She created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. 
They include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. 

	Earlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.
"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger," she said. "And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate."
The media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.
"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib," tweeted Chat Pergram.
Melanie Zanona also tweeted: "motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans."

And CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: "House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. 
Capitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.
After a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. 
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Taking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). 
The news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. 
It's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.]]></summary>

That line is budging. 
Officials are fuming at  Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) after it was discovered over the weekend that Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith, who had been doubling as both the top No. 1 and No. 2 Marine Corps leader since July, suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized on Sunday — leaving a three-star general to hold the prestigious post, according to a report published by Politico.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
The potential overextension of Smith and the stalling of more than 300 critical leadership roles was iced out by Tuberville's blockade installed as a protest against the Pentagon's policy to permit time off and reimbursement for abortions.

EruAsian Times: French Rafales ‘Trounce’ Eurofighters As Germany Blocks Sale Of Typhoon Jets To Saudi Arabia – Reports

 
Germany loosened export restrictions against Saudi Arabia earlier this year. Still, it refused to allow the sale of the 4.5th generation Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet to the kingdom, despite the UK government’s intense lobbying.

The United Kingdom is likely to see a loss of 6,000 jobs in the defense sector and no manufacturing of fighter jets for a decade in the face of Germany’s unwillingness to green-light the sale of Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the Royal Saudi Air Force, British newspaper The Sun reported.
Berlin is blocking a multibillion-dollar agreement to sell 48 Typhoons to Saudi Arabia, and ministers have threatened to “close” BAE production lines if the contract is refused. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz clarified in July this year that Germany will not deliver Eurofighter combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al-Monitor: West Bank death toll exceeds 120 as US warns Israel over settler violence 
Over 120 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed amid raids by the Israeli army and settler attacks since Oct. 7. 
As Israel expands its ground incursion in the Gaza Strip, violence in the West Bank is also escalating, with at least 115 Palestinians killed and more than 2,000 injured since the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, according to the United Nations. 
Clashes between Palestinians in the West Bank and the Israel Defense Forces as well as attacks by Jewish settlers are common, but both have intensified in recent weeks. 
The IDF has been conducting an increasing number of raids in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Since then, more than 8,500 Palestinians have been killed in the subsequent Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

Pakistan’s government announced a major crackdown earlier this month 
Pakistan's government plans to deport over 1.4 million Afghan nationals after November 1, and the United Nations is calling for the country to hold off to avoid human rights violations. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a press release that it is "extremely alarmed" by Pakistan’s deportation announcement, as there are currently over two million undocumented Afghans living in the country. 
Of the two million, more than 600,000 are immigrants who left Afghanistan after the Taliban reclaimed power in August 2021.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month, the White House announced on Tuesday. 
The leaders of the world’s two largest economies are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit in San Francisco. 
“Intense competition means intense diplomacy,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a press briefing. “Our policy and how we move forward with China has not changed.” 
Jean-Pierre declined to provide details about Biden’s agenda other than he is expected to have “a tough conversation” with Xi.

He says Hamas or other terror groups could exploit conflict to carry out attacks. 

FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday warned that the threat of a terror attack against Americans has been raised to a "whole other level" due to ongoing conflict in the Middle East. 
"The reality is that the terrorism threat has been elevated throughout 2023, but the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level," Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Homeland Security Committee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media users have reacted online after pro-Palestinian activists took over London's Liverpool Street Station to stage a sit-in protest, calling for an end to Israel's attacks on Gaza.
 
Over 500 pro-Palestinian activists organised a sit-in protest, denouncing the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 
The sit-in, orchestrated by the direct action group Sisters Uncut, featured Palestinian music and chants like "ceasefire now".
 
Various activist groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement and International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, joined the demonstration.
 
The protest concluded around 7 p.m. and the station continued its operations, a Network Rail spokeswoman confirmed.
 
British Transport Police responded to reports of the protest and reportedly ensured a safe dispersal of the crowd, allowing passengers access to the station.
 
A similar sit-in involving more than 200 people occurred at London Waterloo station on the preceding Saturday.]]></summary>

With just the sun and a solar panel, a theater can be set up in areas where people struggle to access food and water and make a decent living. But what it truly requires is the courage to not view creativity as a luxury. Sydelle and Rowand, the founders of Sunshine Cinema, a network of mobile movie theaters, are not just entertaining people; they are crossing a bridge.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35193">Read the full story, “Can Creativity Change the World?”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

Creating resilience is crucial to adapting to climate change and ensuring climate justice. 
 Although women account for more than three-quarters of the agricultural labour force and manage 40 percent of small-scale farms, historically, they neither owned nor controlled the land because land rights were passed down to male relatives. It is a historic gender injustice whereby women could only access land through close male relatives.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35192">Read the full story, “Women Correct Historical Injustices, Build Climate Resilience Through Cash Pooling”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

* Houthi rebels said they fired a series of drones towards Israeli city of Eilat 
* Iran today warned the situation in the Middle East could 'get out of control' 
Iran today boasted its powerful proxies 'won't stay silent' and hinted the fighting between Israel and Hamas could engulf the Middle East after the Tehran-backed Huthi rebels fired drones into the Jewish state from Yemen. 
The Huthis, who seized Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and control large swathes of the country, said they fired a series of drones towards the Red Sea city of Eilat this morning in retaliation to Israel's war against Hamas. 
'These drones belong to the state of Yemen. We are fighting with words and drones,' Abdelaziz bin Habtour, prime minister of the Huthi government, said.

Zero Hedge: Bills On Israel, Ukraine 'Dead On Arrival' In Both House And Senate As Shutdown, Funding Battles Gear Up 
As the nation celebrates Halloween, the House and Senate are engaged in some spooky late-stage Republic chaos over aid to Israel and Ukraine amid a backdrop of yet another government shutdown looming in two weeks. 
* The government will run out of money (again) in roughly two weeks, requiring Congress to act (again). 
* According to Democrats and GOP Neocons such as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, America needs to send billions of taxpayer funds to both Israel and Ukraine, and won't consider any legislation that doesn't combine the two. 
* House Republicans under newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), as well as a group of Senate Republicans, want Israel aid separated from Ukraine aid, while the Biden White House wants to jam a $105 billion foreign aid package ($14B to Israel, $60B to Ukraine) through Congress. 
* The House's plan (if they can even pass it) to separate Israel aid from Ukraine aid is DOA in the Senate, while both the Senate's combined package and the Biden admin's package is DOA in the House.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new poll shows that President Joe Biden's support among Arab Americans has dropped significantly, from 59% in 2020 to just 17% now. This decline in support is attributed to growing anger over Biden's support for Israel's attacks on Gaza. The poll also reveals that a majority of Arab Americans no longer identify as Democrats, with 32% identifying as Republicans and 31% as independents. The poll highlights the challenge Biden may face in winning over key Arab American voters.]]></summary>

France 24: A record 6.9 million people are internally displaced in DR Congo, says UN 
Escalating violence has pushed the number of people internally displaced within the Democratic Republic of Congo to a record 6.9 million, the United Nations said Monday. 
The conflict between M23 rebels and militias loyal to the DRC's government has intensified in the eastern province of North Kivu since early October, particularly north of the provincial capital Goma. 
The UN's International Organization for Migration said many people who have fled their homes but stayed within the DRC's borders desperately needed help to meet their basic needs.

 VOA: 24 Attacks Target US Forces in Iraq, Syria 
Pentagon — U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked with drones or rockets at least 24 times in recent days, including at least three attacks on Monday, according to U.S. defense officials. 
At least five of these attacks were launched after U.S. forces struck two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups during the early morning hours of Friday. 
None of the attacks carried out since the U.S. retaliatory strikes on Friday have caused casualties or damage, according to defense officials. 
The latest attack on Monday used multiple rockets to target al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq, a defense official told VOA on condition of anonymity due to security sensitivities.

Volodymyr Zelensky was running late. 
The invitation to his speech at the National Archives in Washington had gone out to several hundred guests, including congressional leaders and top officials from the Biden Administration. Billed as the main event of his visit in late September, it would give him a chance to inspire U.S. support against Russia with the kind of oratory the world has come to expect from Ukraine’s wartime President. It did not go as planned. 
That afternoon, Zelensky’s meetings at the White House and the Pentagon delayed him by more than an hour, and when he finally arrived to begin his speech at 6:41 p.m., he looked distant and agitated. He relied on his wife, First Lady Olena Zelenska, to carry his message of resilience on the stage beside him, while his own delivery felt stilted, as though he wanted to get it over with. At one point, while handing out medals after the speech, he urged the organizer to hurry things along.

There are also runors that Ukraine President Zelensky will be firing Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny .... Tensions Rising Between Zelensky and Top Brass Over Ukraine Counteroffensive (Sputnik).
As to what is my take.
The West is distancing itself away from the Russia - Ukraine war, and they are certainly distancing themselves from Ukraine President Zelensky.]]></summary>

Oil prices could rise to more than $150 a barrel if the conflict in the Middle East escalates, according to the World Bank. 
A drawn-out war in the region could drive big rises in energy and food prices, just a year after prices spiked due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
For now oil prices remain steady at around $90 a barrel and are predicted to fall. 
However, the Bank warns that this outlook could quickly reverse. 
Under its worst case scenario, the World Bank said a situation could develop that was comparable with the oil crisis of the 1970s, which would could push oil prices up to between $140 and $157 a barrel.

The Hill: Johnson suggests Israel-only aid bill could come to House floor this week 
Newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Sunday said a standalone bill for Israel aid will come to the House floor this week, sending an indication that President Biden’s request for aid to Ukraine will be further delayed. 
“We’re going to move a stand-alone Israel funding bill this week in the House. I know our colleagues, our Republican colleagues in the Senate, have a similar measure,” Johnson said in an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The Cradle: Leaked: Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza

 
The plan advocates the forced transfer of the population of the Gaza Strip to Sinai permanently, and calls for the international community to be leveraged to assist the move 
 Israeli culture magazine Mekovit published on 28 October a leaked document issued by Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence recommending the occupation of Gaza and total transfer of its 2.3 million inhabitants to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. 
The document, issued on 13 October, identifies a plan to transfer all residents of the Gaza Strip to North Sinai as the preferred option among three alternatives regarding the future of the Palestinians in Gaza at the end of the current war between Israel and the Hamas-led Palestinian resistance.

Times of Israel: Far from Gaza hardships, Hamas chief and family enjoy easy life in Qatar

 
Thanks to Doha’s sponsorship and the wealth he accumulated as Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh and his children today live a life of wealth and privileges denied to other Gazans 
Shortly after the start of Hamas’s brutal attack against Israel on October 7, a video began circulating of the terror group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh in his elegant office in the Qatari capital Doha, watching the bloody onslaught unfold on Al Jazeera and “prostrating in gratitude” with a group of other Hamas officials for the killing of over 1,300 Israelis, among them at least 1,000 civilians.
For years, Haniyeh has been rebuked by many Palestinians for leading a comfortable life away from the hardships of Gaza in the oil-rich Gulf monarchy, which offers shelter to the terror group’s leaders and an internationally recognized platform to spread its propaganda through Al Jazeera.

The Federalist: No Mitch McConnell, Ukraine Aid Is Not ‘Rebuilding Our Industrial Base’ 
Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to reassure Ukrainian aid skeptics that billions in foreign assistance is being spent on American manufacturers to build weapons at home. 
“If you look at the Ukraine assistance,” McConnell said on CBS, “a significant portion of what’s being spent in the United States and 38 different states, replacing the weapons that we send to Ukraine with more modern weapons, so we’re rebuilding our industrial base.” 
But a closer examination of the aid for Ukraine reveals an overwhelming majority of taxpayer dollars are going overseas. Just a fraction of the $113 billion spent has gone to “rebuilding our industrial base.”

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
