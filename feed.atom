What is Heat Stroke and What to do if you have It?
Getting heat stroke can be very dangerous, especially if you don’t know how to identify it and have no idea what to do if it happens to you. Thanks to climate change, summers are now hotter and heat waves are becoming more common , and that means we need to be more careful about things like hydration, sunscreen, and […]

An opposition leader called for three days of protests against a finance bill. 
LONDON -- Kenya was bracing for days of anti-government protests led by the government's political opposition over a contentious new finance bill and the rising cost of living. 

At least six people were shot and killed and at least a dozen others were injured on Wednesday, the first day of a planned three-day protest against higher taxes, Mathias Kinyoda, of Amnesty International Kenya, told ABC News. At least 87 demonstrators were arrested nationwide, he said. 
The protests were called by opposition leader Raila Odinga. The unrest was set to take place despite Kenya's President William Ruto vowing no protests would take place in the East African Nation.

Newspapers reducing their print editions, frequency, page counts, or ceasing publication as a paper product altogether due to falling demand has become quite common. The most recent example is Wiener Zeitung. However, the fact that some newspaper printers in Germany and Austria will now also be shutting down completely in a brief time is a further worsening of the situation due to a steady decline in circulation and the accompanying increasing inefficiency in production.

Global Times: PLA warship activities set new record around island of Taiwan 
The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) recently ramped up warship activities around the island of Taiwan, breaking the record for the number of vessels deployed in its drills in the region. 
Analysts said Sunday that the recent intensive exercises demonstrate the PLA's capabilities in encircling the island, and likely featured amphibious landing training.

“I mean, some of these phenomena we know have already had an impact on our training ranges for, you know, when pilots are out trying to do training in the air and they see these things, they’re not sure what they are and it can have an impact on their ability to perfect their skills.

Defense News: F-35 delivery delays to cost Lockheed hundreds of millions in 2023 
WASHINGTON — Problems with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s newest upgrades will cause the aircraft’s manufacturer to miss its 2023 delivery goal by up to roughly 50 jets, Lockheed Martin officials said Tuesday. 
The delays could bring down Lockheed’s revenue for 2023 by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Lockheed originally planned to deliver between 147 and 153 fighters this year. But software problems with the upgrades known as Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3, are causing significant delays. The Pentagon announced in June that it would not accept newly built F-35s with TR-3 until the upgrades are completely ready.

This week's attack on the Crimea Bridge and today's attack on Russia's largest arms depot in Crimea has made that a certainty.

The Russian leader’s contribution will be “comprehensive” despite joining the event remotely, spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said 

Russian President Vladimir Putin will take part in the summit of BRICS leaders in South Africa via video link, spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. 
The host nation announced earlier on Wednesday that the Russian leader will not attend the high-profile event in person.

Putin’s contribution to the gathering next month will be “comprehensive” despite its remote nature, Peskov told the Russian media on Wednesday.

Russia will be represented by Foreign Minister Lavrov at the summit.

Ukrainian commanders have yet to use the large-scale offensive tactics they have been trained on, as Kyiv says it needs more weapons to fight the war Washington wants 
Ukraine is making limited advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces but has yet to employ the kind of larger-scale operations that American officials believe could enable a breakthrough, officials and analysts say, deepening questions among some of Ukraine’s chief backers about whether Kyiv can move fast enough to match a finite supply of munitions and arms. 
Five weeks into the highly anticipated operation, Ukrainian forces are attempting to weaken Russian defenses by firing fusillades of artillery and missiles and sending small teams of sappers into the sprawling minefields that constitute their adversary’s outermost ring of defense.

WNU Editor: No surprises from Franz-Stefan Gady in the above post. He basically goes to Ukraine to see the front-lines and is given one by the Ukraine military and his Ukraine hosts. And even though this "tour" was tightly controlled by the Ukraine government and military to give the best possible light on the war, they were still certain things that could not be hidden. Things like old men on the front-lines. Ukraine is conducting direct assaults, not probing attacks. Russia has yet to commit its reserves. 

But the best part of his thread was at the end, where this explanation on why Ukraine was not achieving its counteroffensive goals was made .... 
.... But soldiers fighting on the frontline we spoke to are all too aware that lack of progress is often more due to force employment, poor tactics, lack of coordination btw. units, bureaucratic red tape/infighting, Soviet style thinking etc. & ...Russians putting up stiff resistance. 
Russians putting up stiff resistance. No kidding.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Arresting Vladimir Putin in South Africa would be 'declaration of war', says Ramaphosa 
Any attempt to arrest Vladimir Putin when he visits South Africa would be a declaration of war against Russia, the country's president says. 
Cyril Ramaphosa made the warning with weeks to go before an international meeting happens in Johannesburg, to which the Russian president is invited.
But if Mr Putin leaves Russian soil, he will be subject to an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant. 
South Africa is an ICC signatory and should therefore help in his arrest. 
Yet it has refused to honour that obligation in the past - allowing safe passage in 2015 to Sudan's then-President Omar al-Bashir who was wanted for war crimes against his own people.
Mr Putin has been invited to South Africa in August, when the country hosts a summit for members of the Brics countries - an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. 
This bloc of fast-growing economies is seen by some as an alternative to the G7 group of advanced economies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico:  Trump says he’s received a target letter from special counsel Jack Smith’s Jan. 6 investigators 
It’s the clearest sign yet that Trump may soon face his third criminal indictment — this time for his effort to subvert the 2020 election results. 
Donald Trump said Tuesday he expects to be indicted by special counsel Jack Smith’s Jan. 6 grand jury, citing a “target letter” he received from investigators on Sunday.

Update #1: Trump says he’s been informed he’s target of investigation into efforts to overturn 2020 election (AP)
 
Update #2: Trump told by special counsel he is criminal target in Jan. 6 probe (CNBC)

 
WNU Editor: These charges are serious. If convicted former President Trump could not only be barred from running, but should he win the Presidential election, he could be barred from assuming office.

The top U.S. military officer says Ukrainian forces have a “significant amount of combat power” that hasn’t yet been committed to the war 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian forces have a “significant amount of combat power” that hasn't yet been committed to the war, the top U.S. military officer said Tuesday, saying Kyiv is conserving some of its tactical effort while troops slowly work their way through deadly Russian minefields. 
Speaking to reporters after defense leaders from around the world met to discuss Ukraine's military needs, Army Gen.

He said Ukraine will decide when to use the combat power and complex training the U.S. and allies have provide. He flatly dismissed suggestions the offensive is failing.

WNU Editor: In the above video Gen. Mark Milley is saying that the majority of Ukraine's army's combat power has yet been committed to the war. My sources and contacts in Ukraine tell me otherwise. 
So who is right? You tell me. 
In the meantime there are numerous reports from Ukraine that Russia has launched a major offensive in the northeast part of Ukraine .... Russians concentrate on five fronts, Ukrainian forces continue offensive in the south – General Staff report (Ukrainska Pravda).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cohen, who has previously said that former president Donald Trump's disrespect for the security of classified information really amounts to a disrespect for the men and women behind that classified information who put their lives on the line for the country, was asked on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta about the "far-right Republicans" who argue that culture war add-ons recently passed in the House as part of a military budget "will help rid the military to what they describe as wokeness."
Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
"We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars," he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a "wokeness problem," Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
"What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of "permanent, irreversible harm" to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister's granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps' successor Mark Harper said he was "satisfied" that the project's "harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits".
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
"This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it's not over yet," Gooding said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey on Friday spent a second day in the witness box at a London court, denying sexual assault charges and claiming the prosecution case against him was weak.
The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a "sexual bully" who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men's crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a "big flirt" but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…]]></summary>

The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine.
"I feel total despair," said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
"If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned," he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

Underground fires, which scientists believe started in a mine accident in 1916, create sinkholes that swallow people and homes. Coal pickers and activists report hundreds of people have died over the decades.

The country may be synonymous with the beautiful game, but it banned women from the sport for nearly four decades until 1979.
Ahead of the Women's World Cup starting next week in Australia and New Zealand, where Brazil will be in action, Mendes recalled the lengths she went to in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a soccer player.
As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil's impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.
She used to dig a hole next to the pitch to hide in until the enforcers left, then crawled out again to continue kicking the ball aroun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Athens Acropolis, Greece's top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening "to protect workers and visitors", Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
"It's highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday)," the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
"Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?" asked Blitzer.
"He needs to lift the holdings," said Austin. "This is a national security issue, a readiness issue."
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin's call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?" asked Blitzer.
"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy," said Austin. "I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them."
"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?" asked Blitzer.
"That's our policy," said Austin.

"Put on your CIA director cap for a moment," said Tapper. "What do you think went through Putin's mind today when President Biden declared that Putin has already lost the war?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been "eaten alive."
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates "do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door." 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions," she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a "racial justice issue," citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doctors were able to complete a "miracle" surgery where they reattached a boy's head who had suffered an "internal decapitation" as a result of being hit by a car while he was riding his bike, Fox News reported.  
Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was "almost completely detached from the base of his neck." The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use "new plates and fixations in the damaged area." 
"Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room," Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
"The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing," Einav said.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-13T14:52:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a "big flirt" but denied any "aggressive" behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to "come off the road".
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said "it didn't happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way".
"It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic," Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a "big flirt".
But the alleged victim "made it clear that he did not want to go any further," the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt "crushed" after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a "stab in the back".
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as "madness".
"I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn't and never have to anyone in my life," Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn't recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", was artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
