In a revised indictment, prosecutors accused Trump of seeking to erase security camera footage at Mar-a-Lago. 
Special counsel Jack Smith has brought three new felony charges against former President Donald Trump, including explosive claims that he asked an employee of his Mar-a-Lago club to delete security camera footage sought by investigators probing his handling of classified documents. 
In a 60-page superseding indictment unveiled Thursday, prosecutors also accused Trump of possessing a highly classified war plan that he shared with people lacking security clearances months after his presidency ended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: In the past two days the Western news media narrative is that Ukraine is making significant gains with Russia retreating from three main frontal attacks (see videos above). 
The Russian news media narrative is the opposite .... More Western-made Ukrainian tanks destroyed – Moscow (RT). More here .... Russia’s Battlegroup South repels attacks of Ukrainian assault groups in three directions (TASS). 
So who is right? 
I am not there, but it looks like Ukraine has committed everything in the past few days (including all of its reserves) to break the Russian lines even though there is no air support for their offensive. Ukraine needs a major victory, and they need it in the next few weeks. 
On a side note. It is reported that Putin told African leaders last night during a Russia - Africa summit dinner that the Kremlin believes Ukraine has only enough weaponry, ammo, and men to continue the offensive until the end of August. After that the Ukraine army, without more support from the West, will have a problem holding back any Russian counteroffensive should the Kremlin decide to launch one.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Responsible Statecraft: Moscow and Washington shadowboxing in the skies over Syria

 
Tensions related to the war in Ukraine are resulting in actual physical altercations on another battlefront thousands of miles away. 
U.S.-Russian tensions continued to rise this week as two U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones were damaged by flares released from Russian jets over Syria. 
The first incident on Sunday damaged the drone’s propeller but did not cause it to crash, but it echoed a similar episode over the Black Sea in March when the drone crashed after a collision with a Russian jet. Another incident occurred Wednesday over northwest Syria and resulted in damage to one of the drone’s wings. 
That makes for a reported total of six incidents involving Russian and American aircraft in July. The confrontations were a reminder of the potential dangers of U.S. and Russian forces operating in close proximity to each other in Syria, and they raise the question of why U.S. forces are still operating in a country where they have no legal mandate.

 Beijing and Moscow kicked off their largest joint naval and air exercise in the Sea of Japan earlier this month, underscoring how their collaboration has gained pace following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The white paper, which was approved by prime minister Fumio Kishida’s cabinet on Friday, also noted that the overall military balance between China and Taiwan was “rapidly tilting” in Beijing’s favour.

NIAMEY (Reuters) -Leaders of the coup in Niger declared General Abdourahamane Tiani as the new head of state on Friday, and said they had suspended the constitution and dissolved all former institutions after overthrowing President Mohamed Bazoum. 
Tiani was the head of the presidential guard, whose soldiers shut Bazoum in his palace on Wednesday and said it had ousted him because of bad governance and worsening security. 
The general appeared on state television on Friday with a banner on the screen that described him as the president of a newly formed military council, the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland (CNSP).
"The President of the CNSP is the head of state. He represents the state of Niger in international relations," an officer said, reading out a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[General Abdourahamane Tchiani is the new leader of Niger following a military takeover, state television reported Friday, two days after the country’s president was detained by members of his own guard.
Tchiani, the head of the Presidential Guard, has been named "president of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland," a statement said.
Appearing on state television, the general said soldiers had seized power to the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel country.
The country’s elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, has been detained by the putschists since Wednesday morning.
Earlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron described the coup as "dangerous" for the region as Western powers scramble to preserve a key ally in the insurgent-stricken Sahel.
"This coup is completely illegitimate and profoundly dangerous, for Nigeriens, for Niger and for the whole region," Macron said.
Macron said he had spoken to Bazoum, who is being held in his palace, and called for him to be reinstated.
Niger's government had been seen by many in the international community as a bulwark against Islamist militancy in a vast, arid region that is beset by security challenges.
French and UN troops were in recent years forced to withdraw from neighboring Mali, but Paris still has 1,500 soldiers in Niger. Bazoum's overthrow could put the future of their deployment in doubt.
Macron, speaking during a visit to Papua New Guinea, said it was imperative that the constitutional order be restored and vowed to support regional groupings like ECOWAS in mediation or sanctions against putschists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Russian, Chinese officials join Kim at North Korea military parade 
SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese and Russian officials stood shoulder to shoulder with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they reviewed his newest nuclear-capable missiles and attack drones at a military parade in the capital, North Korean state media showed on Friday. 
The widely anticipated parade in Pyongyang the previous day commemorated the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, celebrated in North Korea as "Victory Day".
 Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's visit was the first by Moscow's top defence official since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. The Chinese delegation was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Their appearance at events with the North's nuclear-capable missiles - banned by the U.N. Security Council with Chinese and Russian support - was in contrast from previous years, when Beijing and Moscow sought to distance themselves from their neighbour's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan said Friday that North Korea posed a more serious threat to its national security than "ever before", as nuclear-armed Pyongyang rattles its neighbors with repeated missile tests and belligerent rhetoric.
In its annual white paper -- a rundown of the most pressing military threats and plans to ensure stability -- Japan's defense ministry made a case for a significant hike in domestic defense spending as the world enters "a new era of crisis".
While China's growing military might and Russia's invasion of Ukraine were major focuses of the white paper, North Korea also ranked as a key concern for Japan.
"North Korea's military activities pose an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan's national security than ever before," the document said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Representatives from various African and Caribbean entities joined forces at a historic event this week in the capital of Barbados, Bridgetown, to demand reparations for slavery and its legacy in today's society.
The University of the West Indies (UWI), the Economic, Social and Cultural Council of the African Union (AU), Barbados' government, grant-making network Open Society Foundations and the Caribbean Pan African Network teamed up to "call for reparations for historical crimes".
The meeting in Bridgetown, from Monday to Thursday, included strategy sessions and plenaries and marked the beginning of an "intercontinental campaign", the UWI said in a statement, describing it as "ground-breaking".
Attendees included ambassadors and representatives from AU member states and the Caribbean Community political and economic union (CARICOM).
"This is a historic moment... humanity cannot go forward with all the toxic interferences of colonisation," Hilary Beckles, head of the CARICOM reparations commission, told a news conference on Thursday. "We have to clean up this mess to allow humanity to function."
Outcomes of the meeting include a proposal for a roadmap for cooperation between the AU and CARICOM, the UWI statement said.
"It is crucial to recognize how slavery, colonialism and racism intersect and impact the lives of Black people around the world," said AU official Youssouf Mandoha.

Hosted by HKU, the meeting spanned from June 25 to 27 and revolved around the theme "From Invention to Implementation – Solutions for a Sustainable Future".   The collaboration initiatives outlined in the MoU aim to collectively advance research and educational programmes centred around sustainability and carbon neutrality in the Asia Pacific region. The participating institutions have committed to undertaking the agreed-upon initiatives to achieve this shared objective.   As specified in the MoU, HKU, Fudan University and The University of Sydney will strive to formulate university-wide carbon neutrality targets. This collaborative effort will involve designing and implementing strategies to reduce carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality within their respective institutions.  The participating institutions will also co-organise regular round-table workshops and student exchange programmes, providing students with valuable opportunities to acquire knowledge and practical experience in environmental initiatives.  During his welcome remarks, Prof Xiang Zhang, President and Vice-Chancellor of HKU, stated that the MoU serves the pivotal role in enabling three universities in advancing university-wide carbon neutrality targets across respective institutions and leading research that brings sustainability and carbon neutrality throughout Asia-Pacific.     “It’s indeed an honour to witness and celebrate the beginning of a new…]]></summary>

She struggled, got out and today helps other women in Argentina to find an escape valve.

She’s done as much as anyone to sour US-Russia ties; now, she is one of Washington’s top diplomats. 
In a little-remarked move, the Biden administration announced Monday that Victoria Nuland will take over as the acting second-in-command at the State Department. She replaces Wendy Sherman, who plans to retire at the end of this week.

The Intercept:  Niger Coup Leader Joins Long Line of U.S.-Trained Mutineers

 
Brig. Gen. Moussa Salaou Barmou, who trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, helped oust Niger’s democratically elected president. 
Brig. gen. Moussa salaou barmou, the chief of Niger’s Special Operations Forces and one of the leaders of the unfolding coup in Niger, was trained by the U.S. military, The Intercept has confirmed. U.S.-trained military officers have taken part in 11 coups in West Africa since 2008. 
“We have had a very long relationship with the United States,” Barmou said in 2021. “Being able to work together in this capacity is very good for Niger.” Just last month, Barmou met with Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, the head of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, at Air Base 201, a drone base in the Nigerian city of Agadez that serves as the lynchpin of an archipelago of U.S. outposts in West Africa. 
On Wednesday, Barmou, who trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the National Defense University in Washington, joined a junta that ousted Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s democratically elected president, according to Nigerien sources and a U.S. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

A spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov, said the Ukrainians had mounted a “massive” assault with three battalions, reinforced with tanks, south of the town of Orikhiv, and then another a few miles farther south near the village of Robotyne, according to the state news agency Tass.

Across the Maghreb region, which takes in parts of the Sahara desert and is plagued by scorching summer heat, countries are banking on new desalination plants and facilities that can purify wastewater for farming.
In Tunisia, struggling through its fourth year of drought, engineers recently inspected a desalination plant being built in the southern town of Zarat on the Mediterranean coast.
Across the region, "the only solution is the desalination of seawater for human consumption", said Mosbeh Helali, outgoing CEO of Sonede, the company constructing the plant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 100 pilot whales have died after beaching in Western Australia, wildlife officials said Thursday, following desperate rescue attempts.
The pod of 97 long-finned pilot whales gathered in shallow water off Cheynes Beach, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Perth, on Tuesday, with scores stranding themselves on the sand.
By the next morning, 51 of the cetaceans had died.
Some 250 volunteers joined 100 wildlife experts in a vain struggle to save the rest of the pod throughout the day Wednesday.
Dozens of people in wetsuits stayed in the water, a few on kayaks or surfboards, trying to coax the tightly packed group of remaining pilot whales into deeper waters, and then out to sea.
"Volunteers and everyone attempted to get them back out into the deeper water, and then they re-beached themselves," a spokeswoman for the Parks and Wildlife Service told AFP.
"From that point, the vets assessed them and it was determined on welfare grounds that they needed to be euthanized."
Incident controller Peter Hartley thanked rescuers for their "enormous efforts" to save the whales in cold waters.
"Probably one of the hardest decisions in my 34 years in wildlife management -- really, really difficult," he told journalists Thursday.
But the decision to euthanize the pilot whales was "considered", Hartley said.
"We know that whale strandings are a natural phenomenon but we gave it a good go, spending the whole day in the water with those animals to give them the best opportunity," he added.
"Very hard to see. But this is nature, and it is a natural phenomenon that we do understand very little about."
Scientists do not fully understand why mass strandings occur, but pilot whales -- which can grow to more than six meters (20 feet) long -- are highly sociable, so they may follow pod-mates who stray into danger.]]></summary>

Niger’s President Mohamed Bazoum has reportedly been seized by members of the presidential guard, leading to a protest in the capital and triggering warnings from regional powers a coup is underway. 
The country’s interior minister, Hamadou Souley, was arrested by the presidential guard on Wednesday morning local time and is being held in the presidential palace in the capital Niamey along with Bazoum, a journalist on the ground, who spoke to the minister, confirmed to CNN. 
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said there had been an “attempt to seize power by force” in the West African country, in a statement on Wednesday.

Days after a House hearing on censorship that saw Democrats attempt to prevent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from testifying, a new Harvard-Harris poll showed that he has a higher favorability rating than any other presidential candidate. 
Mr. Kennedy has a net favorable rating of 47 percent and a net unfavorable mark of 26 percent according to the survey, which was released on July 23 and conducted from July 19 to July 20 among 2,068 registered voters (pdf). 
Poll respondents said that former President Donald Trump has a favorability rating of 45 percent compared to a 49 percent unfavorability number. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has a 40 percent favorable rating and 37 percent unfavorable, and President Joe Biden has 39 percent favorable and 53 percent unfavorable rating, also lagging behind Mr. Kennedy. 
Mr. Trump would win the Republican primary and defeat Mr. Biden in a general election, according to the survey, with a 45 percent to 40 percent margin.

New York Times: ‘They Shoot Without Stopping:’ Where Russia Is on the Attack in Ukraine 
Three Russian attack helicopters swooped in low over the city of Kreminna, strafing Ukrainian frontline positions just outside the city. Russian drones circled overhead while Moscow’s ground forces fired heavy machine guns to flush out Ukrainians from foxholes hidden in the dappled light of the pine forest. 
As exploding artillery shells shook the ground around him on Saturday morning, Vlad, a 27-year-old Ukrainian drone operator, spotted a Russian armored personnel carrier bringing more troops to the battle. It was a possible prelude, he said, to another assault.

WNU Editor: This report makes the New York Times the first major Western news outlet yo admit that there is a major Russian counteroffensive in northeast Ukraine. WNU has been reporting on this offensive for the past few days. 
And while the New York Times is saying that Russian advances are minor and being accomplished at great costs, I am reading reports frm sources that I trust that the Ukraine front-lines along this part of the front have collapsed, the Ukraine army is withdrawing, and that in some cases Russian forces have advanced over 10km along a major section of the front. 
This is the first major Russian offensive since the start of the war. It involves over 100,000 soldiers, heavily backed by armor and air superiority. 
Here is an easy prediction. I expect more Western coverage in the coming days.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) -U.S. actor Kevin Spacey was found not guilty on Wednesday by a jury at a London court of committing historical sex offences against four men. The 64-year-old Oscar-winner was acquitted of nine charges, including sexual assault, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity. Spacey began to cry in the dock when the not guilty verdicts were returned by the jury.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
