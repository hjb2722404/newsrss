He said Russia wants to “destroy” Ukraine’s sovereignty, and it “will not stop”. 

“This is not about the territory – this is about the Ukrainian people,” he told Sky News Australia. 

“About human lives who will be suffering there … and they will suffer even more under the Russian occupation.”]]></summary>

"Biden leaves crowd in stunned silence during official Israel visit after telling them to “keep alive the honor of the Holocaust” after his brain breaks," said Benny Johnson.

   DW: Gazprom will not guarantee functioning of Nord Stream pipeline 
The Russian energy giant said it did not know if a turbine engine would be returned from Canada. Moscow announced earlier that the pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, was shut down for repairs. 
Gazprom, Russia's energy giant, said Wednesday that the functioning of Nord Stream could not be guaranteed even when a "critical" turbine for the pipeline returns from Canada where it is being repaired. 
In a statement, the Russian state energy company said, "Gazprom does not have a single document to allow Siemens to take out of Canada the gas turbine engine currently being repaired there."

WNU Editor: The turbine that Gazprom needs for its natural gas pipeline network is still stuck in Canada. I do not see how this turbine can be shipped and transported to Russia and installed by the July 22 date when this pipeline is suppose to be re-opened .... Is July 22 'Doomsday' For Europe?

Bloomberg: Russia Earns More Despite Lower Oil Exports in June, IEA Says 
(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s oil exports rose back above $20 billion in June despite lower shipments abroad because of a rally in energy prices, according to the International Energy Agency. 
That was an increase by $700 million from a month earlier, even as Russia’s daily exports of crude-oil and products fell by 250,000 barrels to 7.4 million barrels, the lowest since August, the IEA estimated in its monthly report published on Wednesday. 
Benchmark Brent averaged more than $117 a barrel last month as the global oil market remained tight. High international prices helped to partially offset the discount for Urals crude, which deepened amid the European Union’s preparations to gradually phase out seaborne oil imports from Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - Workers walk past a storage tank at the Kaleikino oil pumping station of Transneft Kama Region, near Almetyevsk, Russia, April 27, 2022.   
Business Insider: Oil prices could jump to $140 per barrel if Russian crude doesn't get a price cap, US Treasury official says 
* Crude prices could jump 40% to about $140 if a Russian price cap isn't implemented, a US Treasury official said, per Reuters. 
* On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks with Japanese officials on the price cap proposal. 
* In June, G7 leaders discussed a price cap on Russian crude of about $40 to $60 to slow down Moscow's funding of its war machine. 
Oil prices could jump about 40% to $140 a barrel if Russian crude doesn't get hit with a proposed price cap, a senior US Treasury official said Tuesday, according to a Reuters report. 
On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold talks over the price cap proposal with Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki. 
Japanese officials have shown hesitance to adopt a price cap set too low, but have not yet rejected the idea.

WNU Editor: This US push to put a cap on Russian oil does not make sense. If Russia does not get the price that it wants for its oil, it will simply not produce it. And if that happens you do not get $140 per barrel oil, you will get $200 per barrel (or more).

USNI News: U.S. Destroyer Performs South China Sea FONOP; China Says it Expelled Warship 
A U.S. guided-missile destroyer passed near a South China Sea island chain claimed by China as part of a Freedom of Navigation operation and drew complaints from Beijing. 
USS Benfold (DDG-65) sailed near the Paracel Islands early Wednesday local time in a FONOP and was monitored by the People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate Xianning (500), according to the Chinese Ministry of Defense. 
“This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam and also by challenging PRC’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands,” reads a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ayeshea Perera, BBC News: Sri Lanka: Why is the country in an economic crisis? 
A state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka, and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country. 
His departure follows months of mass protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel.  The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and it has already missed debt interest payments.    
Read more ....   
Update: Sri Lanka in crisis: What, why and how? (Al Jazeera)   
WNU Editor: There are many reasons why Sri Lanka has collapsed. Government mismanagement starting with the printing of massive amounts of money. Insane fiscal and green policies that banned the imports of fertilizer that crippled Sri Lanka's agriculture sector. Too much debt. 
And while the Western narrative is to blame China for Sri Lanka's unsustainable debt levels that has led to the current crisis, the truth is that it is the Western countries that are the main creditors (see below): 

Sri Lanka owes 81% of its external debt to US and European financial institutions and Western allies Japan and India.
China owns just 10%.
But Washington blames imaginary "Chinese debt traps" for the nation's crisis, as it negotiates a 17th IMF bailout.https://t.co/Tk49cuLvNS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Europe faces huge surge in migration from Middle East and Africa due to food crisis created by war in Ukraine, EU warns 
* Around 20million tonnes of grain are currently blocked in Ukrainian ports 
* Food prices have rocketed which could fuel a migration wave towards Europe 
* Putin has been accused of deliberately weaponizing food supplies 
Europe is facing a huge migration wave from the Middle East and Africa because of the food crisis aggravated by the war in Ukraine, the EU has warned. 
Ukraine is one of the biggest grain exporters in the world but production and dispatch have been severely affected by Putin's barbaric invasion. 
Around 20million tonnes of grain from last year's harvest are blocked in Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. 

Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The EU is fixated on exporting Ukraine grain to alleviate the global food crisis. But many are predicting that Ukraine itself is going to face serious food shortages this winter because of the war. IMHO this is the wrong time for Ukraine to export its food stocks. 
And what makes the EU position on food even more absurd are the anti-farm policies that we are seeing in places like the Netherlands and Poland where farmers are being pressured to cut food production to meet climate change goals. 
The truth is that the global food crisis has been long in the making, and the cost to feed oneself is no longer affordable for hundreds of millions of people around the world. So face with the option of staying put and starving, or going to where there is food, it should then surprise no one that people will be going to where the food is.

Accustomed to racetracks and casino sports betting, he writes for the famous bettor Jimmy Snyder, known as Jimmy the Greek, in the 1970s.

* US B-2A stealth bombers landed at a Queensland RAAF base for joint exercises 
* The USAF move is intended to be a warning show of strength to China's leaders 
* Their arrival comes as another Australian warship is stalked by Chinese military 
* Chinese aircraft, ships and submarines all chased HMAS Parramatta in open seas 
Rarely-seen USAF B-2A stealth bombers have landed in Queensland in a high-profile show of strength, as Australian Defence Forces have another encounter with a Chinese warship. 
At least four bombers - whose unique design makes them virtually invisible to radar detection - touched down on Sunday at the RAAF Amberely Base, west of Brisbane. 
The 'flying wing'-style aircraft flew 14,000km from their US base in Missouri on a 'training and strategic deterrence mission in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific'.

* Strategists lay out worst-case scenarios for stocks and bonds 
* Europe is caught in a ‘vicious circle,’ says Banque Syz CIO 
(Bloomberg) -- European stocks plunging 20%. Junk credit spreads widening past 2020 crisis levels. The euro sinking to just 90 cents. 
The predictions are ominous for financial markets if Russia cuts off all the gas supply to Europe. 
Shipments are currently running at reduced levels with the main pipeline shut for a 10-day maintenance, and fears are building over whether Moscow will turn the tap back on. Many investors are asking: How bad could this get? 
To that question, strategists across Wall Street have tried to put numbers on a scenario that would be unthinkable in normal times. There are so many variables, such as the length of any shutdown, the extent of supply cuts, and how far countries would go to ration energy, that anyone’s prediction is a guess at best.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is personally condemning Canada over its decision to grant a Canadian company a "time-limited and revocable permit," allowing them to return turbines from a Russian pipeline that supplies natural gas to Germany. 
Zelenskyy said that Canada's decision is about more than wrongly deciding to hand over the turbines, but that it was an "absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia."  "If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? 
This question is very dangerous," Zelenskyy said in a video and accompanying statement on Monday, that also stated the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs “had to summon Canada's representative to our country.”

* U.S. urged China to abide by international law and cease its provocative behavior

* The previous Duterte administration shelved the ruling to get Beijing on its side 
The U.S. has reiterated its support to the Philippines, stating it will back Manila in the event of an armed conflict in the South China Sea. 
Washington's statement came on the sixth anniversary of the significant Hague ruling, which rejected China's nine-dash claim over the South China Sea in favor of the Philippines, according to Philstar. 
"We also reaffirm that an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke the U.S. mutual defense commitments under Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press statement.

The BRICS—an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—held a summit on June 23. The meeting, chaired by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, was part of a lengthy series of BRICS cooperation events, which began on June 6 with the second finance ministers and central bank governors meeting and ended with the second meeting of the committee of senior energy officials on June 28. 
In his opening remarks, Xi stated, “We should also expand BRICS cooperation on cross-border payment and credit rating to facilitate trade, investment, and financing among our countries.”

Nick Kyrgios and Ons Jabeur brought new diversity to the men’s and women’s singles finals.  Jabeur of Tunisia became the first North African player to qualify for a singles final.  Kyrgios, a Malaysian-born Australian and a well-documented swagger that marks him as something completely different from his peers, was playing in his first Grand Slam final.  Jabeur and Kyrgios each ended up losing, but that’s not the point.
Not since 1975, when Arthur Ashe and Evonne Goolagong reached their final, combined the two league matches to be so diverse.  Tennis moves in spurts, and nowhere does that seem more true than at Wimbledon.

Another of his discoveries, Bobby Castillo, a converted third baseman known as Babo, taught Valenzuela how to throw a screwball.
“I’m not lying to you,” Brito told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. “Within a week, Fernando was throwing the ball as well as Babo.”
“For many, many Mexican prospects, he was a God,” Jaime Jarrina Spanish-language Dodgers broadcaster since 1959, told Baseball America last year.  “They loved him because he protected them.”
Mike Brito was born on August 21, 1934 in Cuba.  As a catcher, beginning in 1955, he played three seasons in the lower tiers of the Washington Senators minor league system and then several seasons in the Mexican League.
After retiring, he moved to Los Angeles, where he found work as a truck driver and started an adult amateur league in which he also played.
Scouting became his way of staying in baseball.  “Thank God I became a scout in the Mexican League,” he said in a short video profile, “The White Hat and the Wild Horse: The Scout Who Found Puig.” When Dodgers general manager Al Campanis asked him to work for the team, he recalled thinking, “It’s like finding a guy in the desert and asking him if he wants a drink. of water.

The economist Herbert Stein once wrote that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. 
This became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.

 Update #2: "Social Peace Is In Great Danger": Germany Is Quietly Shutting Down As Energy Crunch Paralyzes Economy (Zero Hedge)   
WNU Editor: Germany's economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa flew out of the country early Wednesday.  
Daily Mail: Sri Lanka's embattled president FLEES his country after months of widespread protests over the island nation's worst-ever economic crisis 
* Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday 
* He, his wife and a bodyguard were among four passengers on board an Antonov-32 military aircraft which took off for the Maldives, immigration sources say 
* 'Their passports were stamped and they boarded the special air force flight,' an immigration official involved in the process said 
Sri Lanka's embattled president flew out of his country early Wednesday, in a probable prelude to his resignation after months of widespread protests over the island nation's worst-ever economic crisis. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised at the weekend to resign on Wednesday and clear the way for a 'peaceful transition of power', after fleeing his official residence in Colombo just before tens of thousands of protesters overran it. 
As president, Rajapaksa enjoys immunity from arrest, and he is believed to have wanted to go abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of being detained.

Daily Mail: Conscripts are being given call-up papers on the beaches of Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelensky's army suffers heavy losses 
Like many of his male friends, Serhiy no longer leaves his home in western Ukraine for fear of being sent to the front line to replace soldiers killed or injured in the fight against Russia. 
The construction worker spends his days hiding from military officials serving call-up papers at bars, beaches, checkpoints, malls and even church services. 
As casualties mount on both sides, there was anger last week after Ukraine’s military revealed plans to bring in permits prohibiting men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered under martial law.   
Read more ....   
Update: Ukraine’s military plans to limit free movement to make conscription easier (The Guardian)   
WNU Editor: Everyone in Ukraine knows that if conscripted, it will only be a manner of time before you are sent to the front-lines and the meat-grinder that awaits all those who go there. I personally know a few Russian-Ukrainians AND Ukrainians who are refusing to join, and are looking for a way out of the country. But it is almost impossible as a military age male to escape Ukraine right now. Ukraine is under marshal law, and it is being enforced with rigor. 
On a personal note. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 the first mission my father had was to forcibly conscript Ukrainians into the Soviet Army. He hated it because many men that he had to conscript were also his friends and classmates. When the war was over my father learned that every male he knew who was forcibly conscripted got killed in the war. It is something that my father never forgot.

Sighhhh ... and now history is repeating itself.]]></summary>

KYIV (Reuters) - Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States on Tuesday for its "incredible support" after Ukraine received a further $1.7-billion in international financial assistance. 
Shmyhal confirmed receipt of a grant which he said on Saturday would come from a Single-Donor Trust Fund created by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction, the International Development Association and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
"Grateful to U.S. & @POTUS (U.S. President Joe Biden) for incredible support," he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[bitcoin (BTC) could see a massive price rally in the coming months, based on an indicator that marked bear market lows in 2015 and 2018.
What is the Bitcoin Pi Cycle Lower Indicator? 
Nicknamed “Bottom of Pi cycle“, the indicator includes a 471-day simple moving average (SMA) and a 150-period exponential moving average (EMA). In addition, the 471-day SMA is multiplied by 0.745; the result is opposite to predicting the bottom of the underlying market.
Notably, each time the 150-period EMA fell below the 471-period SMA, it signaled the end of a Bitcoin bear market. 
For example, in 2015, the crossover coincided with Bitcoin hits nearly $160 in January 2015, followed by an almost 12,000% bull run towards $20,000 in December 2017.

Reason: Biden Told Congress U.S. Troops Are Fighting in the Middle East. Now He Says They Aren't.  
He claims he'll be "the first president to visit the Middle East since 9/11 without U.S. troops engaged in a combat mission there." But that's not true. 
President Joe Biden will travel to the Middle East on Wednesday in an attempt to strengthen ties with some countries and address threats posed by others. Key stops include Israel and Saudi Arabia—neither of which is without controversy. 
Biden took to the pages of The Washington Post to justify the trip in advance and outline what he sees as his administration's wins in the Middle East, which he called "more stable and secure than the one [his] administration inherited 18 months ago." One of his successes, Biden wrote, has been keeping American soldiers out of conflicts: "Next week, I will be the first president to visit the Middle East since 9/11 without U.S. troops engaged in a combat mission there," he said. "It's my aim to keep it that way."

Officially, the Russian army has suspended its efforts to seize Ukrainian territory.  But in recent days he has intensified its anarchic attacks against civilian areas, with strikes from warplanes, artillery and missiles.  Ukrainian residents and soldiers were terrified, maimed and killed by the strikes.
Ukrainian officials said yesterday that in the past 24 hours Russian strikes have killed at least eight civilians.

His opening victory this summer European Women’s Football Championship had been satisfying enough, a solid but unspectacular first step towards a major prize he never won.  But with the Lionesses scoring just one goal, England’s main rivals for the title were filling the net and raising the stakes.
Norway scored four goals in their first match.  Spain and Germany soon followed suit.  After France drew five against Italy on Sunday, maybe, just maybe, the tournament host country felt he had to show that he could.

New York (CNN Business)For the first time in 20 years, the exchange rate between the euro (EUU) and the US dollar has reached parity -- meaning the two currencies are worth the same. 
The euro hit $1 on Tuesday, down about 12% since the start of the year. Fears of recession on the continent abound, stoked by high inflation and energy supply uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The European Union, which received roughly 40% of its gas through Russian pipelines before the war, is attempting to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas. At the same, Russia has throttled back gas supplies to some EU countries and recently cut the flow in the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany by 60%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge: Majority Of Europeans Unwilling To 'Pay The Price' To Defend 'Democracy' In Ukraine 
When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, it didn’t take long for the international community to condemn the attack and react accordingly. Within a few days, Western powers imposed strict sanctions on Russia, hoping to cripple the country’s ailing economy and force Putin to retreat. More than four months and tens of thousands of casualties later, hopes of a quick resolution of the conflict have vanished, as a drawn-out war of attrition looks increasingly likely. 
However, as Statista's Felix Richter details below, while the sanctions against Russia have thus far failed to deplete Putin’s war chest, their impact is being felt around the world. The embargo of Russian fossil fuels has resulted in sky-high energy prices, while food prices have also surged as a result of the sanctions and Russia’s blockage of Ukrainian grain exports. As both Ukraine and Russia are among the world’s biggest exporters of wheat and other grains, the conflict is threatening food security across the globe, especially in poorer regions that rely on imports from both countries.

It was a murder caused by a personal grudge rather than political terrorism. And it was not a direct grudge against Mr. Abe. A religious group had supported Mr. Abe, and a murderer with a grudge against the religious group killed him. Murders targeting politicians are often related to political messages or claims. This is a very unique case in that the murder was committed out of a personal grudge, not against the individual for what he did, but against the organization that supported the individual.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2022/07/11/31351">Read the full story, “Recalling Shinzo Abe with Respect”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

RT: Russia offers fast-track citizenship to all Ukrainians 
All Ukrainians, as as well as citizens of the two Donbass republics, may now apply using a simplified procedure 
Any Ukrainian national may now apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified scheme, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Monday. 
The measure also applies to stateless persons permanently living in Ukraine as well as to citizens of the two Donbass republics, recognized earlier by Russia as independent. 
Ukrainians may now file the relevant request without the need to live in Russia for five years, to have a source of income or to pass a Russian-language test – something foreigners are normally required to do before they can apply for Russian citizenship.

WNU Editor: Kyiv has responded .... Ukraine Condemns Russian Decree Allowing Ukrainians Expedited Citizenship (RFE). 
There is a Russian law that permits the children of former Soviet Union citizens to apply to become a Russian citizen even though they were born in another country. But this new decree apparently makes the entire process simpler and more quicker to apply for.

 CNBC: India set to overtake China as the world’s most populous country in 2023, UN says 
 * “India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country during 2023,” the U.N. says. 
* According to the U.N., its latest projections show that the global population could reach roughly 8.5 billion in 2030 and 10.4 billion in 2100. 
* In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres talks of a “shared responsibility to care for our planet.” 
India is on track to overtake China as the planet’s most populous country next year, according to a U.N. report published on Monday. 
The report, from the population division of the U.N.’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said China and India were each home to over 1.4 billion people in 2022. 
“India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country during 2023,” the U.N. said. 
The Indian government’s census for 2011 put the country’s population at more than 1.2 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice," he said in a statement.
	

		It was not clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions.
	

		Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
	

		Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive.
	

		Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin.
	

		The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers.
	

		He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an "offended liver sausage" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv.
	

		Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada.
	

		Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe, but Kyiv had urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying a return would violate sanctions on Moscow.
	

		Canada said on Saturday it would return the turbine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery. Michael Kappeler/dpa
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.
Ukraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.
Melnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.
Recently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.
Melnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.
The Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of "distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people."
Melnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. "Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms," Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations "absurd."
Melnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.
Some German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.]]></summary>

The attack showed gun violence cannot be totally eliminated even in a country where tough gun laws mean it is nearly unheard of for citizens to buy or own firearms. There have been some cases in recent years where people illicitly made weapons themselves in Japan. But still, gun crime is very rare in Japan: last year th...]]></summary>

Blaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.
Some have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages. Johnson’s premiership fell because it seemed to recognize no dis…]]></summary>

Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whizzing helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty years ago, the Cold War was transposed to a chessboard as Bobby Fischer of the United States took on defending world champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a thrilling East-West clash dubbed the "match of the century".
Some 50 million TV viewers tuned into the two-month-long tussle in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, where chess's enfant terrible Fischer set out to wrest the championship from the Soviet Union, which had dominated the game for decades.
AFP reported daily from the competition. This account is based on its reporting.
Polar opposites
On one side of the table is Fischer, an eccentric, fiercely competitive 29-year-old former boy wonder, who was holding his own among America's greats by the age of 12 and has already won eight US chess championships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his official residence on Saturday shortly before protesters, angered by an unprecedented economic crisis, stormed and overran the compound.
Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for the painful downturn.
As protesters surged at the gates of the President's Palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold back the tide until Rajapaksa was safely removed, a top defense source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The president was escorted to safety," the source added. "He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa's resignation, has called an urgent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muslim pilgrims cast pebbles in the "stoning of the devil" ritual marking the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday on Saturday, as this year's expanded hajj pilgrimage was winding down.
From first light, small groups of worshippers made their way across the valley of Mina, near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, to throw stones at three concrete walls representing Satan.
The ritual is an emulation of Abraham's stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God's order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.
The stoning ritual has in past years led to deadly stampedes, as millions of participants converge on a tight space.
The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, is among the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by a…]]></summary>

People from all walks of life formed a long line on Saturday on the otherwise ordinary street outside a train station where Abe was shot while campaigning ahead of weekend elections.
Afternoon downpours did not deter the crowds who came to offer condolences, some having travelled great distances like 51-year-old Yoshikazu Tokudome, who flew hundreds of kilometers from the Tokyo region to the city of Nara.
"I'm just in pain, and I thought the least I could do was come here and lay some flowers," the company worker told AFP.

Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government have taken the president's offices.
Those are less than a kilometre from the presidential residence, which had already been stormed by protesters angered by the collapse of the economy. Police have used tear gas to try to stop the protesters, but to no avail.
Rajapaksa has been moved to safer area, an official with the president's office said.

Signalling that the Kremlin was in no mood for compromise, President Vladimir Putin said continued use of sanctions against Russia for the invasion it launched in February risked causing "catastrophic" energy price rises. His top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, clashed with his Western counterparts at a G20 meeting, where they urged Russia to a...]]></summary>

The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military.
"I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave," Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working.
He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict…]]></summary>

Johnson quit as leader of the ruling Conservative party on Thursday, after a frenzy of nearly 60 resignations in less than 48 hours in opposition to his scandal-hit leadership.
But the 58-year-old premier, whose three-year premiership has been defined by Britain's departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is found.
As candidates readied for a battle to replace Johnson, he faced calls to leave straight away and for an acting leader to be appointed to head the world's fifth-largest economy in the interim.

Abe, 67, was shot from behind in Nara in western Japan while giving a campaign speech. He was airlifted to a hospital but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Abe was Japan’s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020 for health reasons. Police arrested a suspected gunman at the scene. 
"Japan lost a great prime minister who dedicated his life to his country and worked for the stability of our world", French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a tweet, addressing France's condolences to the Japanese people.

Abe, who left office in 2020, was shot and killed on Friday during an election campaign speech in an attack his protege and incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called "absolutely unforgivable".
The lawmaker first became premier in 2006, lasting just a year before returning for a rare second stint in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values.
He was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean towns along the border with China were flooded this week after heavy rain, threatening to exacerbate an already critical food and economic situation in the country.
North Korea state broadcasters said the city of Sinuiju had reported its heaviest rainfall of the year on Thursday, with at least 132.5 mm (5.2 inches) of rain by 4 p.m.
Video footage showed buses and other vehicles driving through water that had filled intersections, while pedestrians waded nearby.
To the east, in North Hamgyong Province, officials were working to ensure water supplies remained sanitary by supervising sewage disposal and ensuring that residents boiled water before drinking, state news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has reported an epidemic of an unspecified intestinal disease - suspected by South Korean officials to be cholera or typhoid - and has blamed foreign objects from the border with South Korea for sparking a COVID-19 outbreak.
The natural disasters and epidemics may exacerbate food shortages in North Korea, which is under international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and has closed its borders to most trade to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
An annual United Nations report on food security released on Thursday found that the percentage of undernourished North Koreans reached 41.6% from 2019 to 2021, compared with 33.8% from 2004 to 2006.
In the south, North Korea appeared to have released water from a dam near its border with South Korea, prompting vacationers in the neighbouring country to evacuate as water levels on the Imjin River rose on Monday.

KYIV/KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the raising of the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in the Black Sea was a sign his country would not be broken, as President Vladimir Putin warned the West that its efforts to defeat him would bring tragedy to Ukraine.
In a hawkish speech to parliamentary leaders more than four months into the war, Putin said Russia had barely got started in Ukraine and the prospects for negotiation would grow dimmer the longer the conflict dragged on.
"We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us tothe last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people,but it seems that everything is heading towards this," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.
Flooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.
"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week," state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.
About 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.
Hundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.
Taking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.
River catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.
"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others," Sullivan said.
More than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.
A La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -G20 foreign ministers attended a joint summit on Friday that has put some of the staunchest critics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the same room as Moscow's top diplomat, the first such meeting since the war started in February.
The buildup to the gathering on the Indonesian island of Bali has been dominated by the war and its impact on the global economy, with top officials from Western countries and Japan stressing it would not be "business as usual" at the forum.
Shouts of "When will you stop the war" and "Why don't you stop the war" were heard as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi at the start of the meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.
Earlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com "Love Actually," asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast "Yakety Sax" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy "The Benny Hill Show" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.
 "Morning @snb19692," tweeted Grant. "Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?"
Lucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:

"Following years of doubt and fears that Trump would face criminal repercussions for his unwillingness to accept defeat in presidential elections, Russian experts are now firmly convinced that their favorite candidate will come through unscathed — despite being 'lynched,' as they put it, by the January 6 Committee," reported Julia Davis.
