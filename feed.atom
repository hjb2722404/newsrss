Moscow Times: Russian General Arrested Following Wagner Mutiny – MT Russian 
Russian General Sergei Surovikin has been arrested, The Moscow Times' Russian service reported Wednesday, citing two sources close to the Defense Ministry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The Defense Ministry has yet to comment on the alleged arrest of Surovikin, who has not been seen in public since Saturday, when Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched an armed rebellion against Russia's military leadership.
 "The situation with him was not 'OK.' For the authorities. I can't say anything more," one of the sources said. 
According to the second source, the arrest was carried out "in the context of Prigozhin."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  The Hong Kong Jockey Club (“the Club”) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the Hangzhou Municipal People’s Government to further strengthen Hangzhou-Hong Kong cooperation and exchange with the aim of promoting and driving the development of the equine sports industry in the country. The MOU was signed at the opening ceremony of Hong Kong & Macao - Zhejiang Week & Zhejiang and Hong Kong Cooperation Theme Forum 2023 on 26 June.  The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region John Lee, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Secretary Yi Lianhong and other guests witnessed the signing of the MOU by the Executive Deputy Mayor, Hangzhou Municipal Government, Chen Jin and the Club’s Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.  The National Equine Industry Development Plan 2020-2025 promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the General Administration of Sport in September 2020 provides a framework for the development of the equine sports industry in the country. In line with this, Hangzhou is capitalising on its hosting of the Asian Games by exploring the equine leisure and sports markets. In particular it is seeking to become a national major sports industry demonstration base and a sports consumption demonstration city, thus contributing to economic development in the Yangtze River Delta.  The Club has long contributed to the development of equine sports and related industries in the Mainland, assisting the country in promoting and implementing the goals of the National Equine Industry Development Plan. In May 2023, the Club signed an MOU with the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022 Organising Committee (“HAGOC”) under which the Club will provide technical support for the equestrian events of the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games.

Reuters: US to give Ukraine $500 million in additional military aid -Pentagon 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will provide Kyiv with a new military package worth up to $500 million, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, in a show of support for Ukraine's fight against Russia as Moscow deals with the aftermath of a mutiny by mercenary fighters. 
The package will include ground vehicles including Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armored personnel carriers, and munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, according to a statement from the Pentagon. 
The package "includes key capabilities to support Ukraine's counteroffensive operations, strengthen its air defenses ... and other equipment to help Ukraine push back on Russia's war of aggression," the Pentagon said.

New York Times: Russian General Knew About Mercenary Chief’s Rebellion Plans, U.S. Officials Say 
WASHINGTON — A senior Russian general had advance knowledge of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s plans to rebel against Russia’s military leadership, according to U.S. officials briefed on American intelligence on the matter, which has prompted questions about what support the mercenary leader had inside the top ranks.
The officials said they are trying to learn if Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the former top Russian commander in Ukraine, helped plan Prigozhin’s actions last weekend, which posed the most dramatic threat to President Vladimir Putin in his 23 years in power. 
Surovikin is a respected military leader who helped shore up defenses across the battle lines after Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year, analysts say. He was replaced as the top commander in January but retained influence in running war operations and remains popular among the troops.

Update: Senior Russian General Knew About Wagner Leader’s Mutiny Plans – NYT (Moscow Times)

 
WNU editor: If Gen. Sergei Surovikin knew about Prigozhin’s plans to launch a mutiny, and did nothing about it, he would not be in the position that he is in today. He would have been fired/demoted on the spot.
Update #2: The Kremlin has just denied this New York Times report.]]></summary>

FOX News: Biden's Joint Chiefs chairman nominee accused of 'race-based' hiring in military by conservative group

 
Air Force Gen Charles Brown Jr has publicly encouraged military to hire, promote diverse candidates 
A conservative watchdog group is accusing Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. of embracing race-based hiring and promotions in the military for the sake of "diversity." 
The American Accountability Foundation (AAF), an opposition research group that has claimed credit for dismantling several Biden nominations, is now targeting Brown, who is the president's nominee to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At issue for the group are various public statements Brown has made in which he offered full-throated support for the military's diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. 
Brown, the first Black man to lead any branch of the U.S. military, has been outspoken in his belief that the military should be proactive in elevating diverse candidates to key positions. His previous public statements that articulated his views provide ample ammunition for critics like AAF and Republican opponents of DEI policies to attack his nomination.

WNU Editor: I  expect this will all come out during the confirmation hearings. But for now it does look like Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. will be the next US Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs. 
One more note. General Brown may be the the first Black man to lead any branch of the U.S. military, but he will not be the first Chairman of the Joints Chiefs. That honor belongs to General Colin Powell.]]></summary>

While voters continue to have serious concerns about Joe Biden’s mental health, they are even less impressed with his vice president, according to the latest national NBC News poll. 
Kamala Harris has a historically low approval rating of 32 percent in survey, compared with 49 percent who have a negative view of her. Thirty-nine percent of respondents said they had a “very negative” view of Harris. Her net negative rating of -17 is reportedly the worst for any vice president in the NBC poll’s history.

     
In Oct. 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence had a 34% positive, 38% negative rating (-4). 
In Dec. 2010, Joe Biden’s rating was 34% positive, 33% negative (+1). 
 In May 2003, Dick Cheney was at 47% positive, 24% negative (+23).

    And in March of 1995, Al Gore’s rating in the poll was 42% positive, 27% negative (+15).

Washington Post: Ukraine faces mines and manpower challenges in offensive’s early weeks 
Ukrainian forces are navigating giant minefields and mounting initial attacks on Russian positions along a sprawling front line, U.S. and Ukrainian officials said, as Kyiv takes the first, halting steps of what is expected to be a prolonged and punishing counteroffensive campaign. 
Ukrainian officials say they have thus far reclaimed at least 130 square kilometers, or about 50 square miles, in the country’s south from Russian forces, which have spent months hardening fortifications and positioning reinforcements in their bid to protect territory seized since President Vladimir Putin’s 2022 invasion.

WNU Editor: Even the Washington Post is admitting that after weeks of heavy fighting and heavy casualties only 130 square kilometers, or about 50 square miles, has been reclaimed. No mention from the Washington Post that the Ukraine army has not even reached the first line of three of fortification lines that the Russian military has set-up. 
My contacts in Ukraine tell me that Ukraine has started a rush mobilization campaign to replace soldiers that have been killed or wounded in this counteroffensive. I shudder to think what the real casualty numbers must be for the Ukraine government to be forced to do this.]]></summary>

Small Wars Journal−El Centro Fellow Pablo A. Baisotti has published a research paper on Chinese influence operations in Latin America. The paper, "China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]" was published by the Florida International University's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy,
Abstract: This paper analyzes the expansion of Chinese media and public diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Through its “discourse of power” and an attempt to extend its soft power across the continent, Chinese and some LAC media (print, audiovisual, and digital) sustained, amplified, and exalted the “achievements” of the Communist regime and the possibility of sharing them as a “community of common destiny” for all the world’s peoples. China strives to promote a positive image through communication and propaganda campaigns, incorporating LAC journalists, academics, politicians, and others who can improve its image as a reliable and supportive partner of the “Global South.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Japan's best-known kabuki actors was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of assisting his mother's suicide, police said, after both parents were found unconscious at his home last month.
Last month, Ennosuke Ichikawa "allegedly made a 75-year-old woman take sleep-inducing pills at his home and die of psychoactive drug addiction, thereby assisting in her suicide," Tokyo police told AFP.
The 47-year-old is a star of the classical form of theatre and has performed in London, Amsterdam and at the Paris Opera House.
In May, rescue workers found Ichikawa's 76-year-old father -- also a kabuki actor -- and his 75-year-old mother unconscious at his home in the capital.
Both were later confirmed dead, and police are also investigating his father's death, media reports said.
Ichikawa was on Tuesday quoted by Jiji Press as telling investigators that he was "going to follow my parents and kill myself," admitting to the charges.
He was discovered collapsed at his home on the day, and was taken to hospital where he was questioned.
The suspect told officers that the family "discussed dying and being reborn" and that his parents had taken sleeping pills, according to NHK.
An apparent suicide note written by Ichikawa was also reportedly found inside his home.
Ichikawa, whose real name is Takahiko Kinoshi, made his kabuki debut in 1980 and went on to become one of the country's most renowned performers.
He was once nominated for a Laurence Olivier award for dance performance, according to his website.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Olivia Chow won election Monday to become the first Chinese-Canadian mayor of Toronto, vowing to pursue a more progressive approach in Canada's largest city after ending more than a decade of conservative rule.
Hong Kong-born Chow, who emerged victorious from a record field of 102 candidates, has promised to raise property taxes and do more to support tenants to help tackle the city's housing affordability crisis.
In her acceptance speech Monday evening, Chow highlighted "the mandate for change" voters in Canada's economic capital had given her.
"If you ever doubted what's possible together, if you ever questioned your faith in a better future and what we can do with each other, for each other, tonight is your answer," she told supporters shortly after the announcement of her victory.
Chow won with 37.2 percent of the vote, ahead of Ana Bailao on 32.5 percent. Former city police chief Mark Saunders came in third with 8.6 percent.
An immigrant who arrived in Canada at the age of 13, Chow takes charge of Toronto at a time when the city of 2.7 million is struggling with a surge in rents, a massive budget deficit and public safety concerns.
The previous mayor of Toronto, John Tory, resigned in February after admitting to having had an extramarital affair with an employee.
During the election campaign, Ontario Premier Doug Ford had backed Saunders, saying a Chow victory would be an "unmitigated disaster."
Monday evening, however, Ford congratulated Chow on her election as Toronto's mayor.
"Throughout Olivia's life, she has proven her desire and dedication to serving the city that many of us call home," the conservative premier said.
"While we're not always going to agree on everything, what we can agree on is our shared commitment to making Toronto a place where businesses, families, and workers can thrive," he said in a social media post.
A former member of parliament for the New Democratic Party, Chow, 66, previously served as a city councilor in Toronto.]]></summary>

As dawn broke, groups of worshippers recited Koran verses on the rocky rise, where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have given his final sermon.
The ritual is the high point of the annual pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam, that officials say could be the biggest on record after three years of Covid restrictions.
More than 2.5 million pilgrims were expected to join the hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings and a source of legitimacy for the oil-rich country's royal rulers.

In his first address to the nation since the rebels pulled back, Putin said he had issued orders to avoid bloodshed, and granted amnesty to the Wagner fighters whose mutiny served up the greatest challenge yet to his two-decade rule.
"From the start of the events, on my orders steps were taken to avoid large-scale bloodshed," Putin said in a televised address, thanking Russians for their "patriotism".

This rebellion is being seen as the strongest challenge to President Vladimir Putin's rule, and despite being swiftly defused, questions remain within Russia about his authority and the country's war in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prosecution of a nurse accused of killing seven babies at a UK hospital where she worked has been "riddled by the presumption of guilt", her lawyer said on Monday.
In a closing speech in Lucy Letby's defense after months of testimony at Manchester Crown Court, Ben Myers said everything presented by prosecutors has been "treated as evidence of guilt".
"What is really at work is best described as the presumption of guilt," he added.
"I am going to ask you to approach the evidence with something else at the forefront of your mind -- that's something called the presumption of innocence," Myers implored the jury of eight women and four men.
"Being fair and working on the basis that someone is innocent until proven guilty is how our law works."
Letby, 33, who is also accused of attempting to kill another 10 babies in the neo-natal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northwest England, has denied harming children.
'Very calculating'
Jurors have been hearing the case since October, and are set to begin deliberations shortly over the 22 charges she faces.
Letby is accused of targeting newborns by various means between June 2015 and June 2016, including giving them injections of insulin, air or milk.
She was removed from the neo-natal unit in July 2016 but continued working at the hospital on clerical duties before her arrest two years later.
Prosecutors argued she was a "very calculating woman" who told lies deliberately, telling the jury she had "murdered many children".
But when she entered the witness box last month, Letby insisted she "always wanted to work with children" and said it was "devastating" to find out she was blamed for the deaths of the babies.
She is facing seven murder charges and 15 of attempted murder, as she allegedly tried to kill some children more than once.

Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday that a one-day mutiny by his Wagner force had been intended not to overthrow Russia's government but to register a protest over what he said was its ineffectual conduct of the war in Ukraine. 
In his first public comments since ending the mutiny late on Saturday, Prigozhin repeated his frequent claim that Wagner was the most effective fighting force in Russia "and even the world", and that it put to shame the units that Moscow had sent into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The UN has expressed deep concern about an escalation of hostilities in north-western Syria after at least 11 people were reportedly killed in Russian air strikes on rebel-held Idlib province. 
Nine were killed when warplanes dropped bombs next to a market outside Jisr al-Shughour on Sunday, rescuers said. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported that it was the deadliest Russian attack this year.

Another two people were killed in an air strike near Idlib city, it said. 
There was no immediate comment from the Russian military, whose air campaign in support of the Syrian government has been crucial in turning the tide of the 12-year civil war in its favour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korea held mass rallies in Pyongyang where people shouted slogans vowing a "war of revenge" to destroy the United States, as it marked the 73rd anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, state media reported on Monday.
About 120,000 working people and students took part in the rallies held across the capital on Sunday, state news agency KCNA reported.
Photos released by state media showed a stadium crowded with people holding placards reading "The whole U.S. mainland is within our shooting range" and "The imperialist U.S. is the destroyer of peace."
Sunday's anniversary came amid concerns Pyongyang could soon conduct another launch of its first military spy satellite to boost monitoring of U.S. military activities after its first attempt ended in failure on May 31.
North Korea now had "the strongest absolute weapon to punish the U.S. imperialists" and the "avengers on this land are burning with the indomitable will to revenge the enemy," KCNA said.
Nuclear-armed North Korea has been testing various weapons including its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile, ramping up tension with the South and the South's main ally, the United States.
In a separate foreign ministry report, North Korea said the U.S. was "making desperate efforts to ignite a nuclear war," accusing Washington of sending strategic assets to the region.
North and South Korea remain technically at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty.

Quebec province's most populous city had 'unhealthy' air quality according to IQAir, which tracks pollution around the globe, as hundreds of wildfires burned across the country.
Environment Canada issued smog warnings in several Quebec regions due to the fires, saying, "high concentrations of fine particulate matter are causing poor air quality and reduced visibilities," with conditions to persist until Monday morning.
The agency urged residents to avoid outdoor activities and wear face masks if they must go outside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's Prince William will launch Monday a new UK-wide initiative aiming to show that it is possible to end homelessness and make it "rare, brief, and unrepeated", Kensington Palace announced.
William, 41, the heir to the throne, and his charitable Royal Foundation will help give six flagship locations across Britain "space, tools, and relationships" to work on preventing homelessness locally.
Promising a "transformative approach" to the issue, the five-year initiative -- dubbed Homewards -- will try to create a "tried and tested model that can be scaled across the UK and beyond".
It aims to unlock "unprecedented partnerships" and boost understanding of homelessness, with the program launching alongside new research suggesting that one in five people in Britain have some experience of homelessness.
"In a modern and progressive society, everyone should have a safe and secure home, be treated with dignity and given the support they need," William said in a statement.
"Through Homewards, I want to make this a reality and over the next five years, give people across the UK hope that homelessness can be prevented when we collaborate.
"It's a big task, but I firmly believe that by working together it is possible to make homelessness rare, brief, and unrepeated and I am very much looking forward to working with our six locations to make our ambition a reality."
The prince will embark on a two-day nationwide tour starting Monday in London, during which he will announce the six locations.
In each place chosen, Homewards will help form locally led coalitions of people, organizations and businesses which will work on preventing homelessness in their areas based on local needs and expertise.
The initiative will also provide access to an unprecedented network of "best-in-class expertise, partners and funders at a local and national level", Kensington Palace said.
That includes up to £500,000 ($635,000) of flexible seed funding in each location that can be accessed to support the delivery of their action plans, it added.]]></summary>

Crediting Mitsotakis and his New Democracy party for bringing economic stability to the erstwhile EU debt laggard, voters gave the conservatives their widest winning margin in almost 50 years on Sunday.
"No adversary, absolute dominance of Mitsotakis," headlined centrist newspaper Ta Nea.
Hailing the "strong mandate", Mitsotakis said that "major reforms will proceed rapidly", adding that he had "ambitious" targets for his next four years in power that could "transform" Greece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appearing on MSNBC on Sunday morning, retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffery suggested that, not only is Vladimir Putin damaged within his own country after the Wagner Group rebellion was aborted, but that his allies in the international community may be hesitant to help him out in the near future.
Speaking with host Chris Jansing, McCaffery noted that the Russian president has been getting help from outside his country with much-needed military technology following his invasion of Ukraine, but now his precarious position, as evidenced by a threat of a possible coup, may make those sources dry up.
Asked by the MSNBC host if Putin will survive after the rebellion was quelled, McCaffery said the Russian president has a whole new set of problems that he will have to deal with.
"Well, in the long run, it surely doesn't look very good for him," he admitted. "His international partners are going to be very hesitant to back him up with new infusions of military technology. He's an economic disaster zone. The only thing he ever had was energy to sell the world and the Europeans have walked away from that."
"It looks as if he's really in a very weakened position," he added. "I think the internal part was the biggest threat to him."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
