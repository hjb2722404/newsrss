        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Navy commander Frank Owen says the banging noises heard near the search area of a missing submersible could be the result of the advice from the former French Navy commander on board.

Mr Owen said the advice given to submariners inside a disabled submarine is to bang on the hull for three minutes at a time on the hour and half hour. 

“The fact that it is happening at 30-minute intervals, says to me that he is sending a message,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That suggests very much that there is life on board.”]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-21T21:38:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Michigan Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday voted against a child marriage ban. 
Michigan in among 42 states in which child marriage is currently legal, of which 20 states don’t have a minimum age for marriage, The Detroit Free Press reports, citing data from the human rights group Equality Now.
Children who are 16 or 17 years of age can enter marriages with the written consent of a parent or guardian under current Michigan law. House Bill 4293 would ban such marriages. 
The Michigan state House passed the measure resoundingly, but GOP Reps. Steve Carra, Neil Friske, Matt Maddock, Angela Rigas and Josh Schriver all voted against the measure, Heartland Signal reports on its Twitter feed.
So far this century, 5,400 children (under the age of 18) were married in Michigan, but the numbers have declined steadily in recent years, the report said, noting 468 girls married in Michigan in 2000 compared to just 32 in 2021.
Democratic Rep. Kara Hope, one of the bill’s sponsors, said, "It's hard to believe that this practice is still legal in Michigan in the year 2023," according to the report. 
"Victims of child marriage have less stability in their financial situations, more unwanted pregnancies and worse health outcomes," it says.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged battlefield progress has been "slower than desired", weeks into Ukraine's military offensive to recapture areas occupied by Russia. 
"Some people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It's not," he told the BBC. What's at stake is people's lives." 
Ukraine says its counter-offensive has reclaimed eight villages so far in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk to the east. 
Mr Zelensky said the military push was not going easily because 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces. 
"Whatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best," Mr Zelensky added.

Right now, the field is expanding very quickly in terms of methodology and data collection techniques, so I am confident that demand for data scientists will continue to grow.”  As a result, each September intake for the MSDS admits around 100 students. They are expected to take five core courses and five electives to achieve a total of 30 credits. The foundational modules cover areas such as exploratory data analysis and visualisation, statistical machine learning, and storing and retrieving data. This provides strong training in key aspects of both theory and practice.  The list of electives gives students scope to pick courses…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France 24: EU proposes 50 bn-euro package to support Ukraine 
Brussels (AFP) – Brussels on Tuesday asked EU member states to back a 50-billion-euro ($55 billion) package to support Ukraine over the next four years, as part of a boost to the bloc's budget. 
"This financial reserve will allow us really to calibrate our financial support according to the evolution of the situation on the ground," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. 
The proposal from the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is aimed at helping prop up Kyiv's finances and covering immediate reconstruction costs caused by Russia's war. 
The money, 33 billion euros in loans and 17 billion in grants, is part of the review to plug gaps in the EU's budget for the period 2024-2027 left by the fallout of the Covid pandemic and the conflict. 
Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal thanked von der Leyen "for such steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine".

The ex-cop, Michael McMahon, was working as a private investigator with two Chinese men, Zheng Congying and Zhu Yong. Zhu hired McMahon to track down the former official, who was living in New Jersey with his wife, according to the Department of Justice.

The German chancellor met the Chinese premier in Berlin and the latter preferred to focus on trade. 
BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday reiterated his appeal to China to use its influence on Russia to help end the war in Ukraine. But his guest from Beijing wanted to talk about deepening trade ties instead. 
In a statement to journalists following a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Scholz said that he had "again appealed to the Chinese government to exert even more influence on the Russian government in this war." 
 He added: "As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China carries a very special duty here ... Russia must — as we see it — withdraw its troops; otherwise it will not be possible to achieve a good peace."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With rainfall increasingly scarce, irrigating crops can be a major challenge, but farmers in southeastern Spain have long relied on recycled wastewater in a model that is winning attention abroad.
"Here the water is still dirty... but by the end, it will be crystal clear and bacteria-free," said Carlos Lardin, operations manager at Esamur, the public body overseeing wastewater management in the Murcia region.
At his feet, brownish water bubbled in a de-silting tank, the first step before being sifted, filtered and then biologically treated to give it "a second life", explained the 45-year-old engineer.
Some 23 years ago, Murcia -- an arid region with chronic water shortages that claims to be the EU's leading producer of fruit and vegetables -- set itself a huge challenge of reusing wastewa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The black fedora worn by pop superstar Michael Jackson just before he dazzled the world with his moonwalk dance for the first time will be up for grabs in September during a Paris auction of music memorabilia.
The King of Pop whipped off the hat while breaking into his hit "Billie Jean" during a televised Motown concert in 1983.
A few minutes later Jackson, at the height of his fame, showed off what would become his trademark move -- a seemingly effortless glide backwards while appearing to move forward.
The hat, with an estimated value of 60,000 to 100,000 euros ($65,000-$110,000), will be the star attraction at an auction of rock-and-roll items by Drouot on September 26.
Other items include a guitar owned by the legendary bluesman T-Bone Walker that could fetch up to 150,000 euros; a suit worn by Depeche Mode's Martin Gore; and one of Madonna's gold records.
The sale is being organised by Artpeges and Lemon Auction, which last year made a splash with the 385,500-euros sale of the infamous guitar that broke up Oasis, the British band formed by the brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher.
A full list of the roughly 200 items will be published online by Hotel Drouot on July 4.]]></summary>

SCMP: China’s Shandong aircraft carrier sails through Taiwan Strait days after Antony Blinken’s visit to Beijing 
* The transit follows the trip to China by the US Secretary of State, who failed to persuade his hosts to resume high-level military dialogue 
* Washington wants a channel of communications to reduce the risk of miscalculations in potential flashpoints such as the Taiwan Strait 
The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, just two days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded a fence-mending visit to China. 
While both sides described his talks with senior officials - including President Xi Jinping - as constructive, Blinken failed to persuade his Chinese hosts to agree to resume high-level military dialogue between the two countries. 
The US has been pushing for a channel of communication between senior commanders to help reduce the risk of miscalculations and misunderstandings amid rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

A squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which have a 120mm rifled gun and a 7.62mm machine gun, were gifted by Britain earlier this year as the West continue to show their unwavering support to Ukraine in their fight against Vladimir Putin's invasion.

* Ukraine's military shared a video this week of Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi engaged in war efforts. 
* A mysterious Baby Yoda patch could be spotted on his uniform, and its not exactly clear why. 
* The little patch immediately stoked intrigue and admiration on social media. 
Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's "Iron General," was spotted this week wearing an unusual new patch. Military uniform patches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and can carry a wide range of meaning, but his is something of a mystery at the moment. 
Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces published a video on Monday showing Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, sporting a Baby Yoda patch in the center of his uniform as he discusses details on the war with other top officials. 
The new video includes scenes of Zaluzhnyi hovering over blurred-out information and walking alongside individuals whose faces have been censored. A clock on the wall at one point in the video indicates that the footage is from Saturday.

WNU Editor: This video was quickly released after Russian President Putin was trolling the General on where he may be .... Who Is Commanding Ukraine's Military Forces? (June 19, 2023). 
Everything about this video is staged, including always showing a calendar in the background on what day this video was taking place. But a Baby Yoda patch?!?!? I guess they want to send out the message that the "Force" is with them.]]></summary>

The Guardian/Reuters: Biden calls Chinese president Xi a ‘dictator’ a day after Blinken visit aimed at easing tensions

 
US president’s comments come just as two countries seek to dial down intense rivalry 
US president Joe Biden has called Chinese president Xi Jinping a dictator and said Xi was very embarrassed when a Chinese balloon was blown off course over the US earlier this year. 
Biden made the remarks one day after secretary of state Antony Blinken met Xi on a trip to China that was aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. 
“The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two box cars full of spy equipment in it was he didn’t know it was there,” Biden said at a fundraiser in California on Tuesday.

Newsweek: U.S. Volunteers Clash With Russian Forces in Intense Urban Warfare Video

 
New footage circulating online appears to show U.S. volunteers fighting Russian troops in Ukraine under near-constant mortar fire. 
The footage shows soldiers advancing through a smoke-filled urban area with visibly damaged buildings. Faces captured in the footage have been blurred, but dialogue and what appear to be American accents can be heard over the sound of firing in the clips. 
At several points in the footage, the group takes shelter in what looks to be the basement of an abandoned building. 
Newsweek could not independently verify this footage, which was shared on social media by Eastern European outlet Visegrad 24. The outlet did not specify details about the fighters in the video, nor when or where the footage was filmed.

Daily Mail: Putin's suicide tank attack: Russia packs remote-control tank with six tons of explosives and drives it up to Ukrainian soldiers before detonating it in massive fireball - as counter-offensive is 'paused' 
* Ukraine's much-anticipated counter-offensive has yielded a mixed response 
* Russia's dominance in the air is having a major impact on Ukraine's push 
* Putin also resorting to suicide tanks in a bid to restrict Ukrainian advances 
Russian soldiers are packing tanks with explosives and remotely driving them at Ukrainian trenches and detonating them in a terrifying new tactic. 
It comes as Kyiv is forced to pause its counter-offensive in the south amid heavy losses of Western armoured vehicles, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
New video footage from Donetsk shows a remote-controlled T-54 laden with explosives lumbering towards a Ukrainian trench this week.

According to the US Coast Guard, contact with the submersible was lost about one hour and 45 minutes into the dive, with five people onboard. The vessel was reported overdue at 9.13pm local time on Sunday (12.13pm AEST, Monday).
The expedition was being run by US company OceanGate as part of an eight-day trip with guests paying US$250,000 per head to visit the wreck site.

Kyiv’s forces may be temporarily halting their counteroffensive operations to re-evaluate their tactics for future operations, according to military experts.

Reuters: Ukraine targets initial $40 billion for 'Green Marshall Plan' 
LONDON (Reuters) -Ukraine is seeking up to $40 billion to fund the first part of a "Green Marshall Plan" to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry, a senior Ukrainian official said ahead of an international summit. 
Politicians and financiers will discuss short-term funding issues as well as look at long-term reconstruction efforts at the two-day meeting, starting in London on Wednesday and co-hosted by Ukraine and Britain. 
It is expected to launch a "war risk" insurance scheme to cover companies that begin investing in Ukraine again and see government officials discuss behind the scenes if and how to use frozen Russian assets to fund some of the rebuild effort. 
The World Bank estimates Ukraine's reconstruction will cost more than $400 billion, three times the country's gross domestic product. Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, external backers have poured $59 billion into Ukraine to support it during the war.

WNU Editor: I just finished talking to a friend who lives in Odessa. And all that he talked about (besides the war) was how bad the corruption has become in the country. Basically if you want something, be ready to pay a bribe. 
I have zero confidence that the monies for this 'Green Marshall Plan', plus an EU financial package of $50 billion that is now being arranged, will go to the people who will rebuild the country. It is going to go somewhere else.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Government ethics experts are already raising alarms about former President Donald Trump's business dealings with Oman, and New York Times reporter Eric Lipton said on Tuesday that the arrangement Trump has forged is truly without precedent.
Writing on Twitter, Lipton broke down what makes this particular Trump deal particularly troublesome.
"As a NYT reporter, I've been investigating Trump family international deals since 2016. India, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Panama," he wrote. "I have never seen anything like the Oman deal, [regarding] the potential for a conflict of interest."
What makes the deal such a giant red flag, argues Lipton, is that the land being used to build the Trump real estate project in the country is actually owned by the government of Oman.

Added to this, notes Lipton, "the developer, Dar al Arkan, is a Saudi real-estate company with close ties to the Saudi royal family," which has also put large investments into Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm.
"Oman is enormously important player in the Middle East," Lipton adds. "Close ties with Saudi Arabia and Iran. US has sold F-16s/other military equipment. It is now involved in negotiations between US and Iran. [Imagine] adding a multi-billion real-estate deal to that mix as a president decides policy."

Daily Mail: Biden warns Putin's threat to use tactical nuclear weapons is 'real' after Russian despot moved them close to the Polish border in Belarus 
* President Biden denounced Russia's deployment of such weapons in Belarus 
* Belarus said they have started taking delivery of the tactical nuclear weapons 
Joe Biden has warned the threat of Russian President Vladimir Putin using tactical nuclear weapons is 'real', days after denouncing Russia's deployment of such weapons in Belarus. 
It comes after Biden on Saturday called Putin's announcement that Russia had deployed its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus 'absolutely irresponsible'. 
'When I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,' Biden told a group of donors in California on Monday.

Hunter Biden has reached a deal with prosecutors that would see him plead guilty to a trio of crimes but likely avoid jail time, according to new Justice Department filings. 
The president's son has been under investigation for five years for tax and financial allegations, as well as for paperwork for purchasing a handgun where he attested that he did not abuse drugs.

The brothers deny all the accusations. If found guilty, they would face years in prison.

It’s unclear if Beijing and Havana have already struck a deal, or when one would be completed. 
China and Cuba are in active conversations about creating a new joint military training facility on the island nation 100 miles from the American homeland. 
According to a senior U.S. official, Beijing and Havana are discussing what kind of training would take place at the facility and what the leadership structure would look like. Biden administration officials have brought up these talks with their counterparts in Beijing and Havana. It’s unclear, however, how far along China and Cuba are in their chats about the prospects for a deal, the official said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Search and rescue teams are racing to find a deep-sea vessel that went missing with five people on board during a dive to explore the wreck of the Titanic ocean liner. 
The US Coast Guard is leading the search for the small craft, named Titan, in the North Atlantic Ocean. The remote area is where the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew.
The Titan's dive on Sunday is one of many that have been made to the wreck by OceanGate Expeditions since 2021. The sunken ship is about 2.4 miles (3.8 kilometers) below the surface.
The undersea exploration company has been chronicling the ship's decay as well as the underwater ecosystem that has sprung up around it over the last century. 
Here's what we know so far:

An austere greeting on the airport tarmac in Beijing sans a red carpet. A stone-faced handshake from China’s top foreign policy official. A seat looking up at the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, perched at the head of a long table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  After a four-year hiatus, the FIVB Volleyball Nations League made a long-awaited return to Hong Kong this month. From June 13 to 18, eight world-class teams gathered at the Hong Kong Coliseum to compete for final-round qualification in a thrilling display of athleticism and teamwork.  Not only volleyball enthusiasts and sports fans but also students and community members with physical disabilities came together to witness the action-packed event.  The FIVB Volleyball Nations League Hong Kong leg was organised by the Volleyball Association of Hong Kong, China. The event's official community partner was The Hong Kong Jockey Club, reflecting the Club's commitment to supporting community engagement and promoting healthy activities.  The event got off to a superb start as the China women's national team claimed a straight-sets victory over Canada with a score of 3-0, setting the tone for an intense and thrilling competition.  Following the tournament's opening ceremony, the Club Steward Dr Silas Yang was presented with a volleyball signed by the China women's national team players by President of Volleyball Association of Hong Kong, China Wilfred Ng, in appreciation for the Club's valuable contribution to the Jockey Club Volleyball Community Programmes. The programmes enable community members to experience world-class volleyball first-hand and participate as volunteers and audience members.     The programmes offered up to 200 volunteers the opportunity to assist in various activities related to the competition, such as welcoming participating national teams, venue set-up, and promotional activities.    In the run-up to the competition on June 10, the In Touch with the China Volleyball National Team event took place, providing an opportunity for the public, students, and visually impaired individuals to participate in a practice session with the national team. Drawing in around 3,000 attendees, the event was highly popular…]]></summary>

Politico: Western countries launch a raft of plans to keep up with Ukraine’s weapons needs

 
NATO leaders are expected to sign off on a new defense production plan next month. But can industry keep up? 
NATO defense ministers wrapped up two days of meetings in Brussels Friday where they pledged billions more in military aid for Ukraine as Kyiv enters the second week of its long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia.

Zero Hedge: China Says Xi, Blinken Meeting Was Just A "Courtesy", Castigates US For "Misperceptions" 
Initial statements to come out of Monday's meeting between President Xi Jinping and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken were generally positive and upbeat, with an emphasis on healing ties. But more statements were issued in follow-up upon the conclusion of Blinken's two day visit to Beijing. 
It seems China wants to let it be known that it will maintain the upper hand while not being too eager to embrace diplomatic détente. According to the latest from Bloomberg:

— Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) June 18, 2023
  
First Post: 'Iron General': Putin hints that Ukraine's top general may be abroad 
In a report by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency last month, citing a security source, it was claimed that Zaluzhny had suffered severe injuries in a Russian missile strike near Kherson in early May 
During a meeting with Russian military correspondents and bloggers, President Vladimir Putin suggested that General Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of Kiev’s armed forces, could be outside of Ukraine. 
Speculation about Zaluzhny’s whereabouts arose after he missed a high-profile NATO meeting and reports claimed he was gravely wounded in a Russian missile strike. 
While the Ukrainian Defense Ministry denies these allegations, Putin stated that he believes Zaluzhny is abroad, although he admitted that he could be mistaken.

WNU Editor: You do not miss critical NATO meetings if you are head of the Ukraine military. But General Zaluzhny has. My gut now tells me that he has not been wounded, he has been fired, especially since it was known that he was been against the counteroffensive in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: Ukraine says eight villages retaken from Russian forces in two weeks 
KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine said on Monday it had driven Russian forces from an eighth village in its two-week-old counteroffensive, a settlement on a heavily fortified part of the front line near the most direct route to the country's Azov Sea coast. 
A Russian-installed official said on Sunday that Ukraine had taken control of the village, Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. He later said Moscow had pushed them out and on Monday morning he said Ukraine was attacking again. 
Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had not only retaken Piatykhatky but had advanced by up to seven km (4.3 miles) into Russian lines in two weeks, capturing 113 square km (44 square miles) of land.

Israeli military vehicle hit by roadside bomb, gunfire; helicopter gunship fires missiles at gunmen to allow evacuation of wounded troops; 91 Palestinians said hurt
Five Palestinians were killed as heavy clashes broke out between gunmen and Israeli troops in the city of Jenin on Monday morning. 
An Israeli helicopter gunship carried out rare strikes, the first in the West Bank in some two decades, in order for seven wounded soldiers to be evacuated from the battle zone after a vehicle was hit by an explosive device, the military and local officials said.
In a brief joint statement, the Israel Defense Forces and Border Police said forces entered the northern West Bank city in the early morning hours to detain two wanted Palestinians.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
