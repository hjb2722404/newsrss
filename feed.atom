The clandestine actions of these ordinary citizens played a key role in the liberation of Kherson. Driven only by their conscience, these Ukrainian men and women managed to thwart the Kremlin's plans to annex their region to Russia. Behind Russian lines, Gwendoline Debono was also able to gain access to a Ukrainian military unit responsible for conducting military operations in enemy territory.]]></summary>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States marked the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Friday with new sanctions, export controls and tariffs against Russia and its allies aimed at undermining Moscow's ability to wage war. 
Washington also said it would provide another $2 billion in weaponry for Kyiv as it prepares for a spring offensive. The aid did not include F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested.

WNU Editor: Countries and middlemen are making a fortune by evading/ignoring Russian sanctions to sell their resources to nations that need it. They are not going to stop, and these sanctions are not going to impact the bottom line of the Russian economy. 
The only way these sanctions can work ifs if you blockade Russian ports and seize ships that are carrying Russian resources. But such actions will not only mean a direct war against Russia, but also a breakdown in relations with countries that are dependent on Russian resources (China and India to name a few).

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Fully Reopens Crimea Bridge to Cars on Eve of Anniversary 
Moscow on Thursday announced the full reopening to road traffic of the controversial Crimea Bridge, which has been closed and under repair since it was badly damaged in an explosion in October. 
The announcement came on the eve of the first anniversary of the Russian offensive in Ukraine, with both Moscow and Kyiv keen to control the narrative and project images of victory. 
Moscow has always blamed Kyiv for the attack on the bridge, which links the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula to mainland Russia and is known to be a prestige project for Russian President Vladimir Putin personally. Kyiv has always denied its involvement in the attack, however. 
 "All lanes of the Crimean bridge are fully open to car traffic 39 days ahead of schedule," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said, according to his press service.

The bloc chose economic ruin to be a vassal of the US, Moscow’s envoy to the UN has said  
Relations between the European Union and Russia are practically nonexistent, consumed by the abyss of EU subservience to the US, the Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on Thursday. 
Moscow had said in June 2022 that the “bottom had fallen out” when it came to relations with Brussels, Nebenzia said in his speech at the UN. 
“It turns out there was an entire abyss below still, that swallowed up not only our relations – which are basically nonexistent now – but also the EU itself,” he said. 
“A year after completely severing ties with our country, the GDP growth of the EU has stuck near zero. At the same time, record inflation rates are measured by double-digit indicators. Rejoicing that it jumped off the ‘Russian gas needle,’ the EU got hooked on ‘hard drugs’ – expensive American liquefied natural gas,” the Russian diplomat added.

WNU Editor: Saying relations "no longer exist" is an understatement. The only thing left is the closing of embassies, and if that happens, history tells us that the next step will be war.]]></summary>

Reuters: Putin says Russia to deploy Sarmat nuclear missiles 
MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would pay increased attention to boosting its nuclear forces by deploying a much delayed new intercontinental ballistic missile, rolling out hypersonic missiles and adding new nuclear submarines. 
A year since ordering the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has signalled he is ready to rip up the architecture of nuclear arms control - including the big powers' moratorium on nuclear testing - unless the West backs off in Ukraine. 
Putin on Tuesday sought to underscore Russian resolve in Ukraine by suspending a landmark nuclear arms control treaty, announcing new strategic systems had been put on combat duty and warning that Moscow could resume nuclear tests.

— TIME (@TIME) February 24, 2023
   Bloomberg: China Calls for Cease-Fire as War in Ukraine Enters Second Year 
China called for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine in a 12-point proposal for ending the war that appears to have little chance of winning support from those backing the government in Kyiv. 
The position paper issued by the Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Friday called for ending hostilities, protecting nuclear plants, resuming peace talks and eliminating unilateral sanctions — a provision the US has consistently rejected. 
“All parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive cease-fire,” the ministry said.

Over 75 years have passed since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and more than 12,000 nuclear warheads are still scattered across the world from silos in Montana to isolated corners of European airbases and even to the ocean depths where ballistic missile submarines lurk as a deterrent nearly impossible to detect. 
Hiroshima was the first of two atomic bombings in 1945 and it involved a 15-kiloton device while the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki three days later had a 22 kiloton yield. Modern nuclear warheads are far more powerful with the U.S. Trident missile yielding a 455 kiloton warhead while Russia's SS ICBM has an 800 kiloton yield.

* US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro voiced concern in remarks on Wednesday 
* Said China has 340 active warships, compared to about 280 for the US Navy 
* Claimed US naval shipyards can't match the output of Chinese ones 
The US Secretary of the Navy has raised the alarm that China's naval fleet surpasses America's in number of ships, and is growing faster than the US has current capacity to match. 
'It is no secret that the People's Republic of China seeks to upend our dominance on the oceans across the globe,' said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in remarks at the National Press Club in Washington DC on Wednesday. 
Del Toro said that China's navy has recently added over one hundred combatants to its fleet, calling it 'a naval buildup that is a key component of its increasingly aggressive military posture globally.'

“I want to pay tribute to the courage and resilience and determination of the people of Ukraine, led by President Zelenskyy and with such courage, who withstood an invasion by a much larger and more powerful country," Mr Albanese said on Friday.

"They have made enormous sacrifice, a sacrifice in lives, a sacrifice in infrastructure, a sacrifice in their standard of living.

"And yet they have stood tall ... not just in their interest but in the interests of all who hold democratic values so clearly around the world.

The so-called table-top exercise held in Washington focused on hypothetical scenarios of North Korea’s use of nuclear weapons, the Pentagon said in a statement late Thursday. They were the first of their sort since South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol took office about a year ago and bolstered joint military exercises with the US, a move that angered Pyongyang and led it to step up its provocations. 
“Both sides discussed various options to demonstrate the Alliance’s strong response capabilities and resolve to respond appropriately to any DPRK nuclear use,” the Defense Department said, referring to North Korea by its formal name.

Strategic cruise missiles hit a target after travelling 2,000km, says state media, to demonstrate ‘war posture’ of nuclear force
North Korea test-fired four strategic cruise missiles during a drill designed to demonstrate its ability to conduct a nuclear counterattack against hostile forces, its state media said. 
The exercise on Thursday involved an apparently operational strategic cruise missile unit of the Korean people’s army, which fired the four Hwasal-2 missiles in the area of Kim Chaek city, North Hamgyong province, towards the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, the news agency KCNA said. 
Other units conducted firepower training at hardened sites without live firing.

Moscow Times/AFP: G7 Presses IMF to Provide More Aid to Ukraine on Eve of Invasion Anniversary 
G7 finance chiefs pressed the IMF on Thursday to urgently provide more aid to war-stricken Ukraine on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion.
"On February 24 last year, Russia launched its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which is also an attack on the rule of law and the principles of the UN Charter," the G7 said in a statement issued by current chair Japan. 
After talks in India, the group urged the International Monetary Fund "to deliver a credible, ambitious, fully financed and appropriately conditioned IMF program by the end of March 2023." 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire previously said he wanted the IMF to provide $15 billion over four years.

The Kremlin strongman hoped to take the capital Kyiv in a few days and overthrow President Volodymyr Zelensky, without the West reacting. Far from being welcomed as liberators, the Russian soldiers were rapidly stopped and repelled. What was supposed to be a ‘blitzkrieg’ has turned into brutal trench warfare. Whole cities have been destroyed and millions of Ukrainians are now refugees. According to varying casualty tolls, tens or even hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or wounded on both sides. FRANCE 24 looks back at this brutal conflict.]]></summary>

CNBC/Reuters: China and Japan square off over arms and balloons at first security talks in four years 
China said it was troubled by Japan’s military build up and Tokyo took aim at Beijing’s military ties to Russia and its suspected use of spy balloons during the Asian powers’ first formal security talks in four years on Wednesday. 
The talks, aimed at easing tensions between the world’s second- and third-largest economies, come as Tokyo worries that Beijing will resort to force to take control of Taiwan in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, sparking a conflict that could embroil Japan and disrupt global trade. 
Japan in December said it would double defense spending over the next five years to 2% of gross domestic product — a total of $320 billion — to deter China from resorting to military action. Beijing, which increased defense spending by 7.1% last year, spends more than four times as much as Japan on its forces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Trump rips into Georgia 'kangaroo court' after grand jury forewoman GIGGLED and admitted it would have been 'awesome' to subpoena him: Legal experts say she has jeopardized looming MAGA indictments 
* Emily Kohrs has been giving clues about grand jury in series of interviews 
* She has been on a cable TV media tour touting her involvement in the case 
* Trump cited her and bashed Georgia's 'illegal Kangaroo Court' 
The forewoman on the Georgia grand jury that could indict Donald Trump laughed and said she 'kind of wanted' to subpoena him just to get the chance to swear him in – on a bizarre media tour that is already causing headaches for prosecutors. 
In just one of her multiple interviews about a usually shrouded process, forewoman Emily Kohrs told MSNBC why she personally wanted to hear from Trump.   'I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly, I wanted to subpoena the former president because I got to swear everybody in,' she said.
'And so I thought it would be really cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump, of me looking at him and be like, "Do you solemnly swear," and me getting to swear him in,' she continued.

WNU Editor: More details on the grand jury forewoman are being revealed .... REVEALED: Georgia grand jury forewoman who said it would have been 'awesome' to subpoena Trump is a 'WITCH' who shares spells and magic on wacky Pinterest page (Daily Mail). 
What a train wreck. This is every prosecutor's nightmare.

* Trump praised the courage of local workers and law enforcement 
* Said they had been the victims of 'betrayal' and 'indifference' by those in power 
* He brought truckloads of water for the residents reeling from the derailment 
Donald Trump told residents of East Palestine they are victims of 'betrayal' by President Biden and the federal government, and said his visit finally sparked them to act during a tour of the toxic train derailment site on Wednesday. 
The former president greeted crowds furious at the lack of action from the White House, 19 days after the disaster in Ohio, and brought in thousands of bottles of his own water, cleaning supplies and canned food. 
He then stopped at a local McDonald's where he ordered Big Macs for first responders and members of his team, and handed out signed MAGA hats to the customers.

— War News Updates (@WarNewsUpdates) February 23, 2023
     
Reuters: The Pentagon’s Vague Threat to China Over Arming Russia 
China is employing a well-trod tactic to try to outmaneuver the U.S. as it appears more ready than ever to start helping Russia gain new ground in Ukraine with weapons shipments. 
The Pentagon on Wednesday pledged “consequences” for Beijing if it heeds Moscow’s desperate pleas for arms and ammunition but yet again stopped short of detailing how it would follow through on the stern but vague threat. 
 Spokeswoman Sabrina Singh delivered the cagey response during a press conference in which she demurred despite repeated requests for specifics.

WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. When the Pentagon, the military branch of the US government, issues a threat that there will be consequences if China deepens their ties with Russia, it is not going to be well received in Beijing. 
As of this posting there has been no response from China. I think they are reacting the same way that I reacted when a reader gave me a heads-up last night that this threat was made. I did not believe it. But as the above video shows, the threat that there will be consequences (military I presumed) was made, and there has been no drawback or clarification from the Pentagon, US State Department, or the White House.]]></summary>

Tensions flared there - as well as fears of a broader escalation - a day after an Israeli raid on Nablus in the occupied West Bank killed 11 Palestinians and wounded more than 100.
Palestinians went on strike across the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza on Thursday. 
Schools, universities, shops and banks closed their doors. 
Nafez Sider lives in Hebron.  "It is a day of mourning and a strike. How could we work or eat or drink while our brothers in Nablus are being killed? We had to stand in solidarity with them, with the people of Nablus, and there had to be a general strike in the whole West Bank and Gaza and thank God there is."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Researchers at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) have identified and demonstrated for the first time a therapeutic small molecule, M1, that can restore the visual function in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), offering hope for patients with optic nerve damage such as glaucoma-related vision loss.  Traumatic injuries to the CNS, including the optic nerve, the brain and the spinal cord, are the leading causes of disability worldwide for which there is no available treatment. M1 stimulates the fusion and motility of mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell to generate energy) and induces robust axon regeneration by enhancing the intrinsic growth capacity of injured neurons.  Led by Dr Eddie Ma Chi-him, Associate Head and Associate Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Director of the Laboratory Animal Research Unit at CityU, this research breakthrough heralds a new approach that could address unmet medical needs in accelerating functional recovery within a limited therapeutic time window after CNS injuries.  “Photoreceptors in the eyes [retina] forward visual information to neurons in the retina. To facilitate the recovery of visual function after injury, axons of neurons must regenerate through the optic nerve and relay nerve impulses to visual targets in the brain via the optic nerve for image processing and formation,” said Dr Ma.    “M1 treatment sustains long-distance axon regeneration from the optic chiasm, i.e. midway between the eyes and target brain region, to multiple subcortical visual targets in the brain. Regenerated axons elicit neural activities in target brain regions and restore visual functions after M1 treatment. Our study highlights the potential of a readily available and non-viral therapy for CNS repair.”  The seven-year-long study builds on the team’s previous research on peripheral nerve regeneration using gene therapy.  “This time we have used the small molecule M1 for repairing…]]></summary>

— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) February 23, 2023
   Jerusalem Post: US considers release of intelligence on China's potential arms transfer to Russia - WSJ 
The US and Europe think that China may just resupply what Russia lost in the war and not necessarily provide advanced weapons. 
The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons to support Russia's war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 
According to the report, the move is being considered following a series of closed-door messages to China not to supply Russia with arms which ended with a formal warning last weekend. 
Though the US reportedly has intelligence that China intends on transferring arms to Russia, it is still unclear what kind of weapons China will hand over.

Update: US considers intel release on China-Russia arms transfer (News Nation)   
WNU Editor: I say release it. 
What a change in the media narrative. Last week the worry in the press and among the EU and NATO leadership was that Ukraine was running out of ammo, and everyone must step in to help Kyiv. The narrative is now shifting that Russia is running out of ammo, but they will be saved by China. 
I said it before and I will say it again. The Western media and its political leaders are masters at projection.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: China is 'planning to turn hundreds of retired Cold War fighter jets into suicide drones' that could be used for massive attack on Taiwan 
* The Chengdu J-7 fighter jets are based on the Soviet MiG-21 from the 1960s 
* It comes amid growing tensions in the Taiwan strait and between China and US 
China is reportedly planning to turn hundreds of retired Cold War fighter jets into suicide drones that could be used for a massive attack on Taiwan. 
China's last Chengdu J-7 fighter jets may leave active service this year and some may be converted into drones, according to state media. 
Experts believe the weapons would be relatively cost-effective and capable, reported Business Insider. The drones would have similar characteristics to the original planes and reduce the number of China's casualties.

   FOX News: US sending up to 200 more troops to Taiwan as China tensions grow  
Only 30 American troops were in Taiwan a year ago, report says 
The U.S. is preparing to send 100 to 200 troops to Taiwan for training amid rising tensions with China, a U.S. official familiar with the planning confirmed to Fox News on Thursday. 
This number will expand a much smaller training program which has included the National Guard, Special Ops, and U.S. Marines in the past. 
The Michigan National Guard will also train a contingent of the Taiwanese Army, including some training as part of larger exercises, on U.S. soil. 
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, cited U.S. officials as saying only around 30 American troops were stationed in Taiwan about a year ago.

Space News: Secretive military space agency stepping out of the shadows

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scene of an alleged Israeli airstrike in the Kafar Sousah neighborhood of Syria's capital, Damascus, early February 19, 2023. (Social media)   
Jerusalem Post/Reuters: Rocket strike in Damascus hit Iranian military sites, experts, sources say 
A rocket attack in Damascus on Sunday that Syria blamed on Israel hit an installation where Iranian officials were meeting to advance programs to develop drone or missile capabilities of Tehran's allies in Syria, sources told Reuters. 
Iran has been a major backer of President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's nearly 12-year conflict. Its support for Damascus and the Lebanese group Hezbollah has drawn regular Israeli air strikes meant to curb Tehran's extraterritorial military power. 
A source close to the Syrian government with knowledge of Sunday's strike and its target said it hit a gathering of Syrian and Iranian technical experts in drone manufacturing, though he said no top-level Iranian was killed.

VOA: Biden, Stoltenberg Meet Bucharest Nine Leaders in Warsaw  
U.S. President Joe Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday attended the summit of the so-called Bucharest Nine, or B-9, countries on NATO's easternmost flank; Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. 
This little-known grouping is an initiative launched in 2015 by Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and Polish President Andrzej Duda. It is aimed at enhancing cooperation among NATO's newest members to support the alliance's objectives of improving security and stability between the Baltic and Black Seas. 
Duda, host of the summit, said Wednesday's meeting would determine next steps ahead of a B-9 summit in Bratislava, Slovakia, and a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, as well as "the possibilities to provide further support to Ukraine."

According to the Russian leader, NATO representatives are now giving Russia an ultimatum to comply with the New START (Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms) 
MOSCOW, February 21. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he had signed a week ago a decree on putting new ground-based strategic missile systems on combat duty.

Are they going to inspect our defense facilities, including the newest ones, as if nothing had happened? A week ago, for example, I signed a decree on putting new ground-based strategic missile systems on combat duty," he said in his State of the Nation Address to the Federal Assembly on Tuesday. "They're going to stick their nose in there, too," the president continued, "Do they really think we're easily going to let them in there just like that?"

RT:  Serbia warns ‘everyone is preparing for war’  
Belgrade says it is profiting from the arms and ammunition race, but is worried about NATO encirclement 
Serbia’s military industry has ramped up production of weapons and ammunition to keep up with skyrocketing demand driven by the conflict in Ukraine, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Tuesday. Visiting the IDEX weapons fair in UAE, Vucic said the world is preparing for war.  “Everyone needs ammunition. 
Everyone is buying everything, anything we can make gets sold,” Vucic said. “I don’t know how some of this stuff hasn’t ended up on the battlefields of Ukraine yet.” 
Demand for things like rockets for ‘Grad’ multiple launcher systems has gone up by 70%, the Serbian president added, noting that Belgrade is looking to expand some of its ammunition production, since it’s all spoken for. 
“Ammunition is selling like hotcakes,” Vucic said.

WNU Editor: The Serbian President is correct. He is at the IDEX weapons fair in UAE, and he is seeing first hand on how hot the arms market is.    
Update: Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is also probably correct about this .... Vucic announced serious changes in the special operation zone in coming three days (SB.BY).]]></summary>

Russia carried out a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears to have failed around the time President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. 
Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that “such testing is routine.” Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. 
The test of the heavy SARMAT missile – nicknamed the Satan II in the West and capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads – appears to have failed, officials said. It has been successfully tested before and had this one worked, US officials believe Russia President Vladimir Putin would have highlighted the test in his State of the Nation address on Tuesday. n Pr

Update #1: Russia Tested Nuclear Capable Missile During Biden’s Ukraine Trip – CNN (Moscow Times)  

Update #2: Russia's 'Satan 2' Sarmat missile can carry more than a dozen nuclear warheads and destroy entire cities - if it ever works (IBTimes)   
WNU Editor: This blog follows U.S. and Russian missile tests very closely. A few weeks ago the Russian Ministry of Defense did announce that a Russian missile test was slated between February 12 - February 25. But no mention on the type of missile that was gong to be tested, or the exact date. 
So was a missile test conducted when President Biden was in Ukraine with his nuclear football .... a test that would definitely result in US nuclear alerts being raised around the world and the rest of us not knowing about it? I doubt it.]]></summary>

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Russia suspends New START and is ready to resume nuclear testing 
On Tuesday, in his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Moscow would suspend its participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty, but not withdraw from it. Putin added that Russia stands ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the United States does. 
The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is the only bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, which possess the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals and more than 90 percent of its nuclear warheads. 
Since 2010, New START has limited the United States and Russia to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 delivery vehicles each. In addition, the treaty allows each party to conduct 18 on-site inspections every year. New START is set to expire in February 2026—three years from now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden at the Bucharest Nine summit in Warsaw on February 22.    
Daily Mail: Biden says Putin has made a 'BIG MISTAKE' in suspending vital nuclear arms control treaty: Tensions between world's two biggest arsenals grow as U.S. president meets European allies 
* The New START treaty limits the deployment of strategic nuclear warheads 
* Putin on Tuesday said he was suspending Russian involvement in the deal 
* 'Big mistake,' said Biden a day later as he met with Eastern European allies 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday condemned Vladimir Putin's decision to suspend Russian cooperation with the last remaining U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control treaty, further escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow.
Putin made the announcement in his state-of-the-nation address on Tuesday, as he railed against the West. 
A day later, Biden was asked for his response just ahead of a meeting with Eastern European allies in Warsaw.  'Big mistake,' was his terse response.

WNU Editor: Russia's parliament has just approved the suspension of START .... Russian lawmakers endorse suspension of nuclear pact with US (ABC News/AP). 
 As to what is my take on Russia suspending START. Anyone who knows anything about nuclear arms control understands how dangerous this move by Moscow is. Even though the Kremlin has stated that they will still abide by the limits imposed by START, I cannot help but feel that this will only be the first step in a new nuclear arms race.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic's presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society's political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination," Murangira said.
"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB."
"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime."
Rwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children's hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.

And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the "toxicity" of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, "and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes", Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was "now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire", Cumming said.
"So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!"
The queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London's West End, the city's theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a "telescopic urinal" when he became trapped, police said.
"We're sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene," Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
"Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration," said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence," added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a "quagmire."
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
"The victim publicized (the) Iranian government's human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution," Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, "highly dangerous" and a "propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology".
"You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you," Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS," he wrote. "SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!"
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES," Trump said. "Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!"
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a "genius" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.]]></summary>

The UAE named Sultan Al Jaber, chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), to head the crucial COP28 climate meeting in November, sparking an outcry from activists.
He is the first CEO to take the role at the UN summit.
NGOs and civil society organisations from around the world said in an open letter Thursday the "decision threatens the legitimacy and efficacy of COP28.
"This is no cause for celebration," it added in the letter to UN chief Antonio Guterres and Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), under which all climate nego…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An asteroid will have one of the closest encounters Earth ever recorded.
The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
"Before encountering Earth, the asteroid's orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth's orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun," NASA said in a statement. "After its encounter, the asteroid's orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth's and Mars' orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days."
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Egypt unveiled Thursday a gold-laced mummy and four tombs, including of an ancient king's "secret keeper", discovered in the Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.
The vast burial site at the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to more than a dozen pyramids, animal graves and old Coptic Christian monasteries.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former antiquities minister, announced the latest discovery, dating from the fifth and sixth dynasties—around the 25th to the 22nd centuries BC—to reporters at the dig site.
The largest tomb, "decorated with scenes of daily life," belonged to a priest, inspector and supervisor of nobles named Khnumdjedef, said Hawass.
It was found in the pyramid complex of Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty, who reigned some 4,30…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” 
I question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Danish government's plan to abolish a public holiday to help fund the defense budget amid the war in Ukraine is putting Denmark's cherished welfare model at risk, the country's biggest trade union warned.
"It's a big threat to the Danish model", said Lizette Risgaard, the head of the FH union which has 1.3 million members in a country of 5.9 million inhabitants.
"Politicians should stay out of labour market issues. If they go through with this they'll be imposing their will and violate our agreements", she thundered in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.
The left-right government coalition in power since December, headed by Social Democratic Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, plans to scrap the religious holiday known as "Great Prayer Day", observed since the 17th century.
