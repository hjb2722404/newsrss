Aspiring young talents of Ensemble Traversée will perform seven novel, cross-genre, cross-cultural, and cross-generational works composed by three faculty composers and four outstanding student composers. Hailing from The University of Hong Kong (Prof. Chan Hing-yan, Austin Leung, Jing Wang), South China Normal University (Dr. Yeung-ping Chen), The Tianjin Juilliard School (Dr. Yiwen Shen) and the Bard College Conservatory of Music (Samuel Mutter, OGA), they broke new ground by composing for mixed ensemble of Chinese and Western instruments that respond to their selected ink artworks from M+.  Breaking new ground with young talents    The genesis of the year-long multi-party collaboration ‘Ink Art and New Music’ Creative Exchange Project started back in 2018 when Prof. Chan, Dr. Chen, Dr. Robert Martin (former director of the Bard Conservatory), Dr. Jindong Cai (director of the US-China Music Institute), Dr. Lesley Ma (former curator at M+ and current associate curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Sharon Lu (programme director of HKU MUSE) met up in Hong Kong. “Ink art and Chinese musical instruments are part of Chinese culture with a long history; both need to find a contemporary voice. So we came up with the idea to create new music with a mixed ensemble featuring a very unique combination of instruments that responds explicitly to specific ink paintings. It has never been done before,” explains Prof. Chan.   Divided into three phases, the project eventually kicked off in September 2021 under the auspices of the HKU MUSE series, whose mission is to inspire a life-long passion for the arts through innovative and educational programmes. Run by the HKU Cultural Management Office, HKU MUSE has presented many innovative educational programmes. They include the Literature X Music Series with Musical Pushkin and…]]></summary>

   Warzone/The Drive: Russia Has Begun Using Iranian Kamikaze Drones On Ukraine 
The first evidence has come to light of an Iranian loitering munition, or ‘Kamikaze’ drone, used by Russia in its war in Ukraine.   Ukrainian officials are claiming the destruction of the first example of an Iran-supplied drone used by Russia in the war in Ukraine. 
The assertion is backed up by photos showing the apparent remains of what looks very much like an Iranian Shahed-136 loitering munition, or ‘suicide’ drone, reportedly found in eastern Ukraine. 
This appears to confirm that Iranian-made drones have not only been delivered to Russia but are now being employed in combat, including in strike missions.

Warzone/The Drive: KC-135 Boom-Down Emergency Landing Was Result Of Incident With B-1 
A B-1 bomber and a KC-135 tanker made emergency landings on Guam and in Japan after a refueling incident high over the Pacific. 
The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that an incident on Saturday that left a KC-135 aerial refueling tanker with its boom broken and prompted an emergency landing at Yokota Air Base in Japan, also forced a B-1B bomber to divert to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. Both aircraft were able to get on the ground safely at the respective bases and there were no reported injuries as a result of the incident.

For years during the late 80s and early 90s the British Isles seems to have been menaced by these shapes and sounds, with the reports often being branded as UFOs.

The Ukrainian military has reportedly been making advances over the past week on the Eastern front, gaining back territory in the regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk that were taken by the Russian military after its invasion of the country that started in late February. Around 3,000 square kilometers were retaken, according to accounts that cannot be independently verified, and many towns liberated. The Russian side meanwhile spoke of a "regrouping" of its troops as apparent videos from the front showed abandoned Russian tanks and other vehicles. Russian shelling of infrastructure like power stations intensified with the recent developments, causing blackouts in the affected regions.

Business Insider: The US has given Ukraine nearly a million 155 mm artillery shells. Now it's looking for US companies to build more of them. 
* The US Army is looking for companies that can build up to 12,000 155 mm artillery shells a month. 
* The Army's survey comes as the US supplies Ukraine with arms, including some 800,000 155 mm rounds. 
* The scale of the effort to supply weapons has raised concerns about the status of US stockpiles. 
With US ammunition stockpiles being depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, the US Army is looking for new manufacturers for 155 mm howitzer shells. 
The Army recently put out a market survey to identify US and Canadian companies that can manufacture up to 12,000 M795 155 mm high-explosive shells a month. 
The M795 is the standard shell for Army and Marine 155 mm howitzers and would be the prime ammunition for any US-designed 155 mm howitzers sent to Ukraine, which is already using M777 towed 155 mm guns sent by the US and Canada.

Reuters: Exclusive-U.S. considers China sanctions to deter Taiwan action, Taiwan presses EU 
The United States is considering options for a sanctions package against China to deter it from invading Taiwan, with the European Union coming under diplomatic pressure from Taipei to do the same, according to sources familiar with the discussions. 
The sources said the deliberations in Washington and Taipei's separate lobbying of EU envoys were both at an early stage -- a response to fears of a Chinese invasion which have grown as military tensions escalate in the Taiwan Strait. 
In both cases, the idea is to take sanctions beyond measures already taken in the West to restrict some trade and investment with China in sensitive technologies like computer chips and telecoms equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Queen Elizabeth II is still dead, several American media continued to confirm it on Monday.
The 96-year-old British monarch died on Thursday, ending a 70-year reign.  Her death sparked a relentless barrage of media coverage about her and the royal family – not just in the UK, but in the US, which has said no to the monarchy.
Yet despite this innate aversion to hereditary aristocracy as a guiding principle, the American media covered the death of Elizabeth, the rise of her son King Charles IIIand all the mini-dramas around it, but ultimately stupid.
The most incredible part is that the British throne wields little real political power, thus making it all a largely aesthetic matter.  We’re actually talking about ‘optics’, and in one of the most superficial ways imaginable.

An expert on the British Empire explains “Her Majesty’s government” in the 20th century.
 Queen Elizabeth II’s death last week has prompted both an outpouring of grief and complicated reactions across the globe — in large part because during her 70 years on the throne, she ruled over the twilight of the British Empire.
At the height of that empire after the First World War, the United Kingdom had colonies on every continent save Antarctica, ruling one out of every five people in the world. Over the centuries, Britain extracted wealth from those colonized lands — by one estimate, $45 trillion in today’s dollars from India alone.
