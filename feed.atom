ABC News Australia: China seeks region-wide Pacific Islands agreement, FSM decries draft plan as threatening 'regional stability' 
Foreign Minister Penny Wong is promising to blitz the Pacific with a host of visits over coming weeks as Australia grapples with the fallout from a renewed push by China to dramatically expand security and commercial ties with the region. 
On Wednesday, Reuters revealed that China will seek a region-wide deal with almost a dozen Pacific islands, covering policing, security and data communications cooperation. 
A draft communique and five-year action plan sent by Beijing to 10 Pacific islands ahead of a foreign ministers meeting on May 30 prompted pushback from at least one of the invited nations, which says it showed China's intent to control the region and "threatens regional stability".

        <updated>2022-05-25T19:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan placed Bitcoin’s (BTC) fair price at $38,000, 28% higher than its current level of around $29,500, according to a note to clients the bank released on Wednesday.  “Last month’s crypto market correction looks more like a capitulation from last January/February and looking forward, we see an upside for bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,” the note reads.  Bank strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was the main author of this document.
A note from bank investors placed the fair value of bitcoin at the same level in February.  It was trading around $43,000 at the time.
Crypto has outmoded real estate as the preferred “alternative asset” of the bank, along with hedge funds, continues the note.  This mentioned:

“So far, there is little evidence of VC [venture capital] funding dries up after Terra’s collapse.  Of the $25 billion in VC funding year-to-date, nearly $4 billion has come after Terra.  Our best guess is that venture capital funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be avoided.

Venture capital funding would be key to avoiding this crypto winter, he added.
On the same day, the great venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its fourth cryptocurrency fund at $4.5 billion.  Also on Wednesday, crypto-focused venture capital firm NGC Ventures launched its third blockchain fund with $100 million raised from investors such as Babel Finance, Huobi Ventures and Nexo Ventures.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly said expressed his personal antipathy to cryptocurrency, going so far as to call it a fraud, but the bank itself has taken a more practical stance.  This becomes the first major bankin the Metaverse earlier this year.  Dimon praised crypto for its ease of cross-border payment.

The Conservative Political Action Committee wrapped up a two-day event Friday night in Hungary, one that should concern all Americans about the prospect of rising illiberalism within the conservative movement.
The fact that CPAC Hungary even happened should have made headlines in America.  Not only because Hungary is a country that is increasingly moving away from democracy and back towards authoritarianism, but because the event included video messages from the two leading figures of the Republican Party: donald trump and Tucker-Carlson.
Not to mention the fact that CPAC Hungary took place in the shadow of Orban-ally by Vladimir Putin brutal invasion of Ukraine.

Let’s tighten restrictions on poisonous hate speech on social media.  It is imperative that we conduct threat assessments.  Absolutely, no more gun control regulations.  And, we must analyze the racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic, white supremacist manifestos.  But if we do all of this and continue to minimize or ignore how these murderous men were socialized as boys and young men, the mass shootings will continue to plague us.

Ukraine’s top military intelligence official says he knows just how long Vladimir Putin’s army can last. 
As Russian forces enter the third month of war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin only has enough supplies and equipment to last him another 12 months on the war effort, according to Ukrainian intelligence. 
And by the end of the year, Putin’s military’s juices will be running out, Ukraine’s top military spy, Kyrylo Budanov, said in a newly published interview.
“The active phase should go to the maximum decline by the end of the year,” Budanov told local newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda. “Russia has 12 months of resources to wage a normal war.”

Chinese military researchers have been drawing up plans to destroy Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system should Beijing deem it a threat to Chinese national security. 
A paper published last month stated that China needs to develop capabilities to track and monitor and if necessary destroy each and every Starlink satellite in orbit around the Earth.

Congress has approved $40 billion in aid for Ukraine and other countries affected by the conflict―the sixth aid package since the war began. A major change is that this package looks ahead months rather than weeks. 
The aid package provides $19 billion for immediate military support to Ukraine, continuing the effort that has been vital to sustaining Ukrainian resistance, and $3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe. The package also contains about $16 billion for economic support to Ukraine, global humanitarian relief, and a wide variety of international programs as well as $2 billion for long-term support to NATO allies and DOD modernization programs. 
Although some elements of the aid package will be available quickly, many will take years to fully implement. This raises questions about why long-term elements could not have gone through the regular congressional authorization and budget processes.

WNU Editor: This is where the $40 billion US aid package is going .... 
$3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe 
$16 billion for economic support to Ukraine and global humanitarian relief 
$2 billion for long-term support to NATO allies and DOD modernization programs 
Hmmmm .... $21.9 billion already spent and none of it is going to the Ukraine military. 
As for the rest .... 
$6 billion for training, equipment, weapons, logistic support, supplies and services, salaries and stipends and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of Ukraine (and the specifics of the expenditures remain to be determined). 
$9 billion to replenish U.S. weapons stocks already sent to Ukraine. 
$4 billion for the Foreign Military Financing Program (this allows a foreign country like Ukraine to buy brand new weapon systems).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angela Lansbury, acclaimed and adored star of stage, film and television, will be honored this year with a special Tony Lifetime Achievement Award.
Lansbury, 96, who has already won five competitions Tony Awardwill receive the lifetime achievement award on June 12, when this year’s ceremony will take place at Radio City Music Hall and air on CBS.

She was already a three-time Oscar nominee, including for ‘The Manchurian Candidate’ in 1962, when she landed her role on Broadway, starring as the free-spirited lead character in 1966’s ‘Mame’. She won his first Tony Award for this performance.


She starred in several Sondheim musicals, winning Tony Awards for playing the theater’s most famous stage mother, Momma Rose, in “Gypsy,” as well as the scheming pastry chef owner Mrs. Lovett in ” Sweeney Todd”.  His most recent Tony nomination, in 2010, was for his work in a revival of another Sondheim musical, “A little night music.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One night in May 1997, in Tacoma, Washington, Kimonti Carter machine-gunned a car he believed to be carrying rival gang members.  It wasn’t – not that it should matter.  One of the five passengers in the car, a student, Corey Pittman, 19, was killed.  Carter, who had just turned 18, was sentenced to life in prison.
In director Gilda Sheppard’s sympathetic documentary “Since I Been Down”, punishment is also a crime.
Filled with archival visuals of Tacoma in the late 1980s and 1990s, when crack cocaine and gang violence took their toll, the documentary’s greatest strength is its listening tour, with Carter as the main guide.


Because Carter fired from a car, he was charged with aggravated first-degree murder, which carries an automatic mandatory life sentence.  (His reconviction hearing is scheduled for July 8.) He is not the only one facing harsh prison terms.  Washington state’s three-stroke sentence (which abolished parole in 1984) can be particularly difficult for young offenders.


Over the decades, Carter expressed remorse, but it was his role as a beneficiary and leader of inmate-led initiatives, the Black Prisoner Collective and TEACH, or Taking Education and Changing History, that suggests a transformation.
Other inmates here share their insights, as do two former detectives, some former gang members, and the mothers of victims and perpetrators.  One former inmate, Tonya Wilson, who served 17 years, is particularly insightful about the personal and societal forces that led to her incarceration.
Another prisoner said, “We say that a lot of the answers that people are looking for in society will be found in prison.
“We caused pain,” said this inmate, “mainly because we are in pain.”
Far from looking like an excuse, in “Since I Been Down”, this observation sounds like a way to take account and change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jen Psaki, who became famous as President Biden’s first White House press secretary, presiding over 200 briefings and earning TikTok stardom for his sometimes thorny exchanges with reporters, will join cable news channel MSNBC later this year.
She will serve as a political analyst throughout this year’s midterm elections and during the 2024 presidential campaign, the channel said on Tuesday.  She is also set to host a show starting next year on a streaming-only channel, MSNBC on Peacock.
Ms Psaki’s last day in the West Wing was May 13 and her appearance on television news was widely expected.  Speculations on his potential work at MSNBC started this year while she was still presiding over the White House pulpit.  Ms Psaki said at the time that she adhered to ethical guidelines while discussing future job prospects.
She is the second major hire by MSNBC from the Biden administration. Symone D. Sanders, a former spokeswoman for Vice President Kamala Harris, hosts a weekend show for the network.  Ms. Psaki said in a statement provided by MSNBC that her program would focus on “factual, thoughtful conversations about the big issues that matter to people across the country.”


MSNBC is popular with Democrats and left-leaning viewers, and its election and main-evening coverage already includes savvy hosts like Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace.  Now its viewers will receive real-time commentary from a key member of Mr. Biden’s first term inner circle.
Ms. Psaki previously worked as an on-air contributor to CNN.  Prior to that, she served as White House Communications Director for former President Barack Obama and Chief Spokesperson for former Secretary of State John Kerry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some Asian elephants are a little shy about their eating habits.  They sneak into dumpsites near human settlements at the edge of their forest habitats and quickly gobble up trash – plastic utensils, wrappers and all.  But their guilty pleasure for fast food is traveling with them – elephants carry plastic and other human waste deep into the forests of parts of India.
“When they defecate, the plastic comes out of the feces and settles in the forest,” said Gitanjali Katlam, an ecology researcher in India.
While much research has been conducted on the spread of plastics from human pollution in the world’s oceans and seas, much less is known about how this waste moves with terrestrial wildlife.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mercury is meaningless.  It is a bizarre piece of rock with a composition that is different from its neighboring rocky planets.
“It’s way too dense,” said David Rothery, a planetary scientist at the Open University in England.
Most of the planet closest to the sun is occupied by its core.  It lacks an Earth-thick mantle, and no one really knows why. A possibility is that the planet was much larger – perhaps twice its current mass or more.  Billions of years ago, this nascent proto-Mercury, or super Mercury, could have been hit by a large object, stripping away its outer layers and leaving behind the rest we see.

WNU Editor: There are currently 8 million Ukrainians internally displaced .... Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis (Relief Web). Many have lost their homes, and most are dependent on humanitarian aid to survive. 
Is this the time for Ukraine to export the very food that it needs to feed its population? 
I have family, friends, and contacts in Ukraine who are telling me how serious the humanitarian crisis is in Ukraine right now. Having not enough food is one of them, and it is a situation that everyone is telling me is going to get worse.
But the Western narrative is that Ukraine must export its crops to avoid a global food crisis. 
Am I the only one who sees a disconnect here?]]></summary>

The world faces an unprecedented wave of famine and hunger triggered by a further “explosive” increase in food prices, experts have warned, after new figures revealed the extent to which the war in Ukraine will decimate global supplies of wheat. 
Forecasts supplied exclusively to The Independent suggest that Russia’s brutal campaign, including its blockade of vital Ukrainian ports, is likely to cause even deeper disruption to food supplies than was previously feared. 
Wheat production is now expected to be halved this year – a significantly worse outcome than previous forecasts predicted, said MHP, one of Ukraine’s largest exporters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Zealand's Reserve Bank is holding its May cash rate decision today and it's expected to sharply increase interest rates.

Sky News Australia discussed the issue with Sky News Business reporter Edward Boyd.

"Reserve Bank in New Zealand has been lifting the cash rate sharply, it's at one and a half per cent right now, it's going to get up to two per cent probably by the end of today.

"We haven't actually seen inflation start to come down in New Zealand and that's a pretty good indicator for Australia as well. 

"Our Reserve Bank's lifting the cash rate and so far it hasn't really had any impact on inflation – I think they're going to need to lift it a lot more to start pushing down those inflationary pressures."
 
Mr Boyd said the RBA isn't expecting inflation to start declining until the middle of next year.

"It's going to peak at about six per cent headline inflation at the end of this year and slowly start to fall in mid 2023."]]></summary>

“What struck me was that this kind of mass shooting rarely happen anywhere else in the world,” he said. 

“Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God’s name is our backbone … it’s time to act ... we have to do more."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Hungary's pro-Putin Prime Minister Viktor Orban announces new State of Emergency due to concerns over Ukraine – replacing the Covid one that would have expired next week 
* Hungary has declared a legal 'state of danger' in response to war in Ukraine 
* Orban's party passed a constitutional amendment to allow the declaration 
* The government can now enact laws by decree without parliamentary oversight 
* A similar measure introduced amid Covid was set to expire on June 1 
* Despite Hungary's NATO membership, Orban has maintained strong relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin 
Hungary has declared a legal 'state of danger' in response to Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, the prime minister announced Tuesday, allowing the right-wing nationalist government to take special measures without the participation of the legislature. 
In a video on social media, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the war in Ukraine represents 'a constant threat to Hungary' which was 'putting our physical security at risk and threatening the energy and financial security of our economy and families.'

WNU Editor: Hungarian Prime Minister Orban believes that the world is on the brink of an economic crisis brought on by the Ukraine war. Here is an easy prediction. In the coming months many European governments (and governments outside of Europe) are going to be doing the same thing.

(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least three suspected ballistic missile Wednesday, just hours after as U.S. President Joe Biden wrapped up a visit to American allies South Korea and Japan, where he discussed the security threat posed by Kim Jong Un’s regime. 
The projectiles were fired at around 6 a.m., 6:37 a.m. and 6:42 a.m. from an area near Pyongyang’s airport and flew toward waters off North Korea’s east coast, the South’s Joint Chief of Staff said. 
Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said officials were looking at the whether at least one of the rockets was an intercontinental ballistic missile and told reporters two suspected ballistic missiles appear to have already splashed down outside of the country’s exclusive economic zone. 
Kishi said the launches were unacceptable.

Bush by smuggling in Middle East kill team through Mexico as revenge for the invasion of Iraq': FBI informants uncovered plot from asylum seeker in Ohio, WhatsApp messages and videos from former president's Dallas home 
* The FBI reportedly foiled a plot this year to murder George W. Bush 
* A search warrant claims an ISIS operative wanted to kill the former president 
* Shihab Ahmed Shihab, an Iraqi asylum seeker sought revenge for Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, according to an FBI search warrant 
* The FBI relied on two confidential informants for their evidence 
* The warrant was unsealed in the Southern District of Ohio this week 
An FBI search-warrant application alleges that an ISIS operative plotted to assassinate George W. Bush with a plan that included smuggling a kill team into the country via Mexico. 
The application was filed on March 23 and briefly unsealed this week in the Southern District of Ohio 
It describes how the suspect, Shihab Ahmed Shihab, an Iraqi asylum seeker, visited Dallas in November and took video footage of the area around the former president's home.

The Guardian: YouTube removes more than 9,000 channels relating to Ukraine war  
Exclusive: Platform takes ‘unprecedented action’ to address content guideline violations since invasion 
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But Osaka is uncertain, although she may travel to Berlin to play in the new grass-court event that will count towards her ranking.
“Overall, I feel like I’m going to stop telling myself I’m bad on these surfaces,” she said of grass and clay, “and at the place, keep your head down and keep working really hard, because I think that’s what I’ve been doing all year. I can’t expect everything to happen at once. I hope so that, gradually, I will have the results I want.
So far, she has four Grand Slam singles titles, all on hard courts, most recently at the 2021 Australian Open about 16 months ago.  The pecking order changes and is not in his favor.  After breaking down in tears mid-match at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., in March after a heckler rocked her in a second-round loss, she bounced back to reach the final of the Miami Open, where Swiatek beat her, 6-4, 6-0.
Osaka, who plays for Japan and is based in the United States, remains one of the biggest stars in the sport and the highest paid female athlete in the world by far.  She has enough lucrative long-term endorsement deals to justify recently break up with IMG to set up his own management agency with Stuart Duguid, his agent.
But Osaka will be ranked around world No. 40 after Roland Garros, and while his portfolio looks strong in redwood, how does that affect the bottom line and his place in the sporting landscape if a young player like Swiatek takes the real control of the sport and younger, possibly hungrier players like Anisimova continue to dominate Osaka at the start of major tournaments?
To what extent, in the age of social media, should results and stardom continue to align once the millions of followers are already acquired?
Osaka, left ankle wrapped, seemed genuinely determined to change her luck on Monday, digging into the corners and maintaining positive energy almost to the end.  But Anisimova has been more consistent on serve and more devastating from the baseline and, crucially, on the returns.

For thousands of years, there have been rules to control the types of weapons in warfare - for instance, the use of poison in armed combat was forbidden in Ancient Greece. 
But it wasn’t until the 19th century that international agreements were made to legally regulate the types of weapons that are allowed (and banned) in wars around the world. 
In the infographic below, Visual Capitalist's Carmen Ang and Sabrina Fortin outlines the weapons that are banned or limited in war, according to international humanitarian laws that are outlined in the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).

    WNU Editor: A month ago the media narrative was that defense companies were not benefiting from the Russia - Ukraione war .... Defense companies aren't getting a boost from Russia's war with Ukraine (CNN). Today's narrative is that they are benefiting fromt he war .... Not Only in Ukraine: Major Weapons Makers Profiting Off War Worldwide (Common Dreams). 
Fertilizer suppliers are benefiting enormously from the war and sanctions .... Fertilizer Sector Set for Biggest Profits in Years on Russia-Ukraine Conflict (Reuters). Bank profits are mixed, but energy suppliers are doing well .... 2 wild charts show how Big Oil profits are skyrocketing as prices at the pump rise (Business Insider).

The big losers ..... besides those in Ukraine .... are those dependent on energy and food imports.]]></summary>

Washington: US President Joe Biden said in a memorandum that he officially designated Colombia to be considered a major non-NATO ally to the United States.
“By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America… I hereby designate Colombia as a Major Non-NATO Ally of the United States for the purposes of the Act and the Arms Export Control Act,” Biden said in the memorandum on Monday. 
The designation will provide Colombia the opportunity to benefit from special access to US military and economic programs, but it does not provide security guarantees like those given to NATO members.

Veteran US statesman Henry Kissinger has urged the West to stop trying to inflict a crushing defeat on Russian forces in Ukraine, warning that it would have disastrous consequences for the long term stability of Europe. 
The former US secretary of state and architect of the Cold War rapprochement between the US and China told a gathering in Davos that it would be fatal for the West to get swept up in the mood of the moment and forget the proper place of Russia in the European balance of power. 
Dr Kissinger said the war must not be allowed to drag on for much longer, and came close to calling on the West to bully Ukraine into accepting negotiations on terms that fall very far short of its current war aims.

Henry Kissinger gave more details on his views on the Russia - Ukraine war at a Financial Times event two weeks ago (see video below).

“I think we worked really well at bat,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.  “Gerrit Cole has great stuff.  It’s an ace.  He’s an ace for a reason and to be able to score some runs against him, I’m proud of our hitters.


Urías started Baltimore’s four-point third with a double down the left field line, then broke a tie at 4 by fielding a 0-1 fastball on the short porch to right field past Cole (4-1).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday, the advantage belonged to Boston all along.  The Celtics were quicker to drop balls, more active in disrupting passing lanes, and more coordinated in switches, limiting quality looks for Miami.  They were more pressing to get back on defense and turn in the paint, not allowing the Heat to push for quick breaks like they did on Saturday.  Boston’s defense was so effective that Miami only fired two 3-pointers in the first quarter, limiting its chances of closing the deficit until it was too late.  That was exactly the kind of energy Boston was sorely lacking in the first half of Game 3. Miami’s starters combined for 18 points.
What made the game even weirder was that the Celtics didn’t play well offensively.  They were just 5 for 27 of 3 when they entered the fourth quarter with 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In less than a month, the crypto mining bill in the Russian parliament lost several key points, such as the obligation for mining operators to register in a special register and a one-year tax amnesty for all those who registered.  According to the reasoning, the previous project would result in federal budget losses. 
The new draft law “On Mining in the Russian Federation”, dated May 20, appeared in the database of the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma.  The document has several significant changes from the previous version, present by the co-sponsors on April 29. 
While the text remains unchanged in general, the new draft misses the subsection on a register of mining operators, which companies should register in order to continue their work.  In the latest version, to start mining, crypto mining companies must register as sole proprietor or self-employed.  Companies would follow a standard procedure for company registration.

Another correction swept away the promise of tax amnesty in the first year of registration.  The grace period would apply to the clearance of mining equipment, any profits made before the law was passed, and any violations of strict limits on money transfers abroad adopted by the Russian government on March 8. .  local media, in its review of the project, the legal department of the State Duma critical registration and tax amnesty initiatives, stating that they could “eventually incur costs on the federal budget”.
On April 7, the head of the State Duma’s Financial Markets Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, revealed that changes to the federal tax code regarding crypto should be adopted. by the end of summer parliamentary session.  It is unclear if they would include specifications regarding mining.

Claiming its one-China principle is different from China's, the US is only retreating from its own promises and the common ground it reached with China, with the intention of obstructing China's peaceful reunification and attempting to build Taiwan into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday at a press briefing in response to remarks from US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price on the one-China principle. 
Price said on Twitter on May 21 that China "continues to publicly misrepresent US policy. The US does not subscribe to the PRC's 'one-China principle' - we remain committed to our longstanding, bipartisan one-China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, Three Joint Communiqués, and Six Assurances."

Update: China says US shipped $70 bln worth of weapons to Taiwan (TASS)   
WNU Editor: The key paragraph from the above Global Times article is the following ....  .... What's more, the military ties between the two sides are becoming more frequent and open, and the scale of US arms sales to Taiwan is increasing, totaling more than $70 billion, which is in violation of the US commitment to gradually reduce arms sales to the island. The US side has also hyped the expansion of Taiwan's so-called "international space," trampling on its promises that the US has no intention of implementing "two Chinas" or a "one China, one Taiwan" policy.

Times of India: Explosive audio leak details China's plan to invade Taiwan 
NEW DELHI: An unprecedented and explosive audio leak of a top-secret meeting of the Peoples Liberation Army has reveal China's detailed plan to attack Taiwan. 
Experts say that the audio clip posted on the YouTube channel of Lude media appears authentic. This will be the first time since the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 that a recording of a top-secret meeting of a military command has been leaked. 
Apparently, "allies" within the Communist Party of China (CPC), especially the military (codename "Thunder") carried out the recording of the meeting that took place on May 14. No wonder the knives are out to nail the source of the leak. The Lude media recording was also posted on the twitter account of Jennifer Zeng @jenniferatntd.

WNU Editor: The leaked audio (in Chinese) can be heard here (link here). 
I do not know if this leak is real, or it is part of a disinformation campaign. But if it is true to say that it is disturbing is an understatement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles says it is “important” that America has presence in east Asia, following President Joe Biden’s recent remarks about the United States’ willingness to defend Taiwan militarily against China. 

Mr Biden was asked whether the US would be willing to get its military involved to defend Taiwan during a press briefing before the Quad meeting on Monday, to which he responded: "Yes - it's a commitment we made".

When questioned if Australia would respond in the same way if China invaded Taiwan, Mr Marles said the Americans have made an “important statement”, however, he doesn’t think it’s wise to start “commenting on hypotheticals”. 

“It is important that the Americans have made the statement that they have because what it represents is an American presence in the region which is something which is very much in our national interest,” he told Sky News Australia.

“That’s what we want to encourage and that’s why the Quad is important and that’s why it was so important that Anthony Albanese attends the Quad so shortly after the election. 

“We work very closely with the United States. I think it’s important to not walk down hypothetical paths but it’s also very important to make clear that we stand with the United States, and that we have a very close alliance with the United States.”]]></summary>

President Biden had confirmed the United States would come to the defence of Taiwan if China were to invade the territory.

Mr Biden was asked whether the US would be willing to get its military involved to defend Taiwan during a press briefing on Monday, to which he responded: “Yes – it’s a commitment we made”.

The White House has since released a statement confirming Mr Biden’s comments do not reflect a change in US policy.

"It's always an unnamed, anonymous White House official that cleans up the blunder," Ms McEnany said.

The Pentagon announced Monday that about 20 countries have pledged new security assistance packages for Ukraine, including new anti-ship missiles, additional attack helicopters and tanks. 
Forty-seven nations now have joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which was organized by the Pentagon to help address Kyiv’s immediate and long-term needs as it seeks to beat back the Russian military’s protracted invasion. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday singled out Denmark for providing Ukraine with a Harpoon launcher and missiles to help defend its coast, and the Czech Republican for agreeing to send helicopters, tanks and rocket systems. 
Other participating nations, he said, have donated artillery rounds and armored vehicles, or agreed to provide the Ukrainians with training and assistance to maintain its military systems. 
The group is scheduled to meet again June 15, on the sidelines of a meeting of NATO defense ministers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yahoo: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been 'slow and unsuccessful,' Pentagon says 
WASHINGTON — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to be hampered by consistent military assistance to Ukraine from allies in Europe and elsewhere, U.S. military leaders said on Monday after a meeting with allies who made new pledges of weaponry as the war in Eastern Europe is on the cusp of entering its fourth month. 
“We remain committed, resolved and united in our assistance to Ukraine,” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley said at a Pentagon briefing after a second meeting of the Ukraine Contact Group, a consortium that now includes nearly 50 nations, most of them in Europe, committed to defending Ukraine against the invasion that the Kremlin launched in late February.

WNU Editor: I understand the Pentagon needs to paint an optimistic picture on the war in order to maintain public support, but in the month of May I have been seeing consistent and critical Russian military successes on the battlefield. 
It was only last week that thousands of Ukraine's best fighters surrendered en-masse at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, and there are now reports that thousands of Ukrainian fighters are about to be surrounded (if not already) at a key city in the Donbas .... Here’s how Russia is zeroing in on key Ukrainian stronghold Severodonetsk (The Print). And then there is this sobering on the ground report from Euronews on how dire the situation is becoming in eastern Ukraine (see video below). 
If this is slow and unsuccessful, then why the rush to send tens of billions in arms? Why escalate a greater involvement in this conflict? 
My gut tells me that the Pentagon leadership are very worried on the military situation that is unfolding right now, and are trying their best to assist the Ukrainians as best as they could to contain the Russian military and their offensive in the Donbas. But will it be enough? I have my doubts.]]></summary>

For this reason, Russia should rely entirely on its own resources, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council underscored 
MOSCOW, May 20. /TASS/. The sanctions imposed on Russia will apparently stay in effect for a very long time, possibly, decades, and the special military operation in Ukraine is not the reason, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said at a meeting of the inter-departmental commission for creating a national system of protection from new infections in Moscow on Friday. 
"We are well aware that the introduced sanctions will apparently stay in effect for a very long time. And this is not connected with Russia’s special operation in Ukraine. Obviously, these sanctions will last long, the way it was in the past, including the Soviet era. In other words, for decades," he stated.   Read more ....   
Update #1: Medvedev urged to prepare for decades of sanctions – Hindustan News/The Moscow Times  
Update #2: Russian Security Council V.C. Medvedev names the duration of anti-Russian sanctions - Pravda   
WNU Editor: Iran has been experiencing sanctions for decades, and they have adjusted. In the case of Russia the population will adjust also. 
As for when sanctions will be removed? 
It will not happen with Putin in power. It will also not happen if one of the Western demands is Russia gives-up Crimea. This is non-negotiable not only to the Kremlin, but also to almost every Russian citizen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al Jazeera/Bloomberg: Ruble surges as Russia considers looser capital controls  
The ruble’s rebound has left it more than 30 percent stronger against the dollar than it was before Russia invaded Ukraine. 
The ruble’s blistering rebound picked up pace on Monday, ratcheting up pressure on Russia to ease a key capital-flow control that’s underpinned the currency’s recovery. 
With the gains now threatening to hurt budget revenue and exporters, a decision to cut the share of hard-currency earnings that exporters convert into rubles could come as early as this week, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The mandated proportion could be reduced to 50% from 80% currently, the people said, who requested anonymity because the details of the plan aren’t public.

Update #1: Russian rouble leaps to near 7-year high vs euro (Reuters)  
Update #2: How Russia made its ruble the world’s top-performing currency (Quartz)   
WNU Editor: My friends/family/and contacts in Russia are telling me that the worse of the economic crisis has passed. That prices have stabilized and there are no shortages in the stores. Many foreign firms have left, but everyone is telling me that the economy has adjusted, and Western goods that are blacklisted are still entering the country from other countries like China. 
I am also reading reports that the Russian Central Bank is buying foreign currencies to halt the rise of the Russian ruble. I do not know who is buying rubles (my gut tells me that it is China), but it is a clear violation of Western sanctions. 
Bottom line. 
The upward trajectory of the Russian ruble was certainly not expected, and worse, the perception now is that Europe is facing dire economic consequences because of it. And while Ukraine President Zelensky is calling for more sanctions, I think some European leaders are beginning to understand that these measures are not working.]]></summary>

RFE: France's European Minister: A Ukraine EU Bid Would Take At Least 15-20 Years  
France’s European affairs minister said that any bid for Ukraine to join the European Union would take at least 15 to 20 years to complete, putting a damper on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's hopes of gaining a quick entry into the bloc. 
"We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying," Clement Beaune told France’s Radio J on May 22. 
"It's probably in 15 or 20 years -- it takes a long time."  "I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies," he added.

CNBC: IMF says global economy faces ‘confluence of calamities’ in biggest test since World War II 
* In a blog post ahead of this week’s World Economic Forum, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its “biggest test since the Second World War.” 
* In combining the Russia-Ukraine war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the spike in volatility in financial markets and persistent threat from climate change, the IMF said the world faces a “potential confluence of calamities.” 
The International Monetary Fund has warned against “geoeconomic fragmentation” as policymakers and business leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
In a blog post ahead of this week’s event, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its “biggest test since the Second World War,” with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine compounding the residual economic effects of Covid-19 crisis, dragging down growth and driving inflation to multi-decade highs.

   RT:  Russia halts electricity supply to another EU country 
Exports to Lithuania were stopped due to the nation’s "inability" to pay 
Russia has stopped supplying power to Lithuania, the country’s electricity transmission system operator Litgrid announced on Sunday. 
Inter RAO, which was the only importer of electricity from Russia to Lithuania, confirmed the suspension of deliveries. Earlier this month, Inter RAO’s Nordic branch also stopped supplying electricity to Finland.

   CNN: Biden admin considering sending US special operations forces to protect US embassy in Kyiv 
(CNN)The Biden administration is in the early stages of discussions about sending special operations forces into Ukraine to help guard the US Embassy in Kyiv, several US officials tell CNN. 
The discussions are in very preliminary stages and a proposal has not been presented to President Joe Biden for a decision, the sources added. 
For now, the embassy and its limited number of personnel are protected by State Department diplomatic security officials. 
The discussion centers around whether an increase in security is needed if the number of personnel increase, and whether special operations forces are best equipped to fulfill those requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The key part from yesterday's interview is this ....  .... Tom Cotton: It’s important that we support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this war of aggression by Vladimir Putin. So, first off I do understand the reservations some people had about the legislation. And there was some excessive or unnecessary measures. But a lot of that money went to support our own military and our own troops to replenish the stockpiles of our weapons that those troops need to defend themselves and protect our country. And not just support our allies in Europe but in the Western Pacific, Taiwan in particular. Second, I think it is important that we help the Ukrainians fight their own war. This is much like what Ronald Reagan did in Afghanistan… And finally, I think our main adversary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party is watching very carefully what is happening in Europe.
