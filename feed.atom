NYPost: Putin fell down stairs, soiled himself as speculation over worsening health grows: report  
Russian President Vladimir Putin fell down the stairs and soiled himself this week amid mounting speculation that his health is declining, an anti-Kremlin Telegram channel with apparent links to his security team reported. 
Putin, 70, suffered the unfortunate fall at his Moscow official residence on Wednesday evening, according to the Telegram channel “General SVR,” which purports to be run by a former Russian spy. 
The ailing Russian leader allegedly fell down five steps before landing on his coccyx, or tailbone.   Although his security guards immediately rushed to his aid, the impact of the fall caused Putin to “involuntarily defecate” due to “cancer affecting his stomach and bowels,” according to the channel.

WNU Editor: I have lost count over the years on how many reports I have read that Putin is sick. Putin is dying. Putin has incurable diseases. Etc.. 
I an sure Russian President Putin is going to die one day. But he looked good yesterday (see above picture from Reuters).]]></summary>

DW: Germany, Norway seek NATO role in undersea infrastructure 
The leaders of Germany and Norway have said they will propose that NATO plays a role in protecting undersea infrastructure like gas pipelines or fiber optic cables. This follows the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said on Wednesday that they would be speaking with the head of NATO about involving the alliance in future operations to protect critical undersea infrastructure like gas pipelines or fiber optic cables.  
Store said Norway had already increased vigilance at such sites in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and even more so after the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. 
Store was visiting the German capital on Wednesday for bilateral talks and to attend the Berlin Security Conference with Scholz.

WNU Editor: Germany has stated that they know who was responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline attacks. But they will not release that information due to national security. 
I think it would be helpful if we do know who was responsible for those attacks. To make that information and evidence public so we will know who are we defending our infrastructure against, and why billions must be spent to do so.

In a video message, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that during a "year of extremes", it was essential to fund lifesaving operations next year, which were a "source of hope for millions of people in desperate need."

Russian President Vladimir Putin is "open to negotiations" on Ukraine but the West must accept Moscow's demands, the Kremlin says, a day after US President Joe Biden said he was willing to talk with the Russian leader. 
Speaking after talks on Thursday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Biden said he was ready to speak with Mr Putin "if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war", adding the Russian leader "hasn't done that yet". 
Mr Biden has not spoken directly with Mr Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

NewsGuard said it had identified 160 videos on the short-video platform that "allude to, show, or glorify acts of violence" by the mercenary group, founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.

BBC: Ukraine war: Kyiv displays dummy nuclear-capable missile fired by Russia 
Russia is now using nuclear-capable missiles with non-explosive warheads to exhaust Ukraine's air defences, the Ukrainian military has said. 
It displayed what it said were fragments of Soviet-made X-55 cruise missiles - designed for nuclear use - found in Ukraine's two western regions. 
The rockets are being launched to "exhaust the air-defence system of our country," a Ukrainian official said. 
He said tests on the fragments did not show abnormal levels of radioactivity. 
Ukrainian military experts say Russia may have significantly depleted its vast missile arsenal after carrying out wave after wave of massive strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure in recent weeks. 
Moscow is now resorting to using blunt projectiles that still cause devastation, they say. A UK intelligence report in November came to similar conclusions.

Update #2: Russia's use of Soviet-made missiles aimed at distracting air defenses - General Staff (Ukrinform)   
WNU Editor: Pentagon officials reported the same thing a few days .... Russia firing unarmed missiles to deplete Ukraine air defense, says U.S. military official (Reuters). 
I know Russia has thousands of these old missiles. They are not running out of missiles as this report is claiming .... Putin fires cruise missiles with dummy nuclear warheads at Ukraine because their missile stocks are so depleted, UK government says (Daily Mail).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Independent: Biden willing to discuss end to Ukraine war with Putin but says Russian victory is ‘beyond comprehension’ 
President Joe Biden on Thursday said he would be willing to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin to learn whether he’s willing to end his nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine, but not unilaterally and only after discussions with America’s Nato allies first. 
Speaking at a news conference alongside French president Emmanuel Macron after a three-hour bilateral meeting between the two leaders and their respective advisers, Mr Biden said he’d take a meeting with Mr Putin “if he’s willing to talk to find out what he’s willing to do”. 
“But I’ll only do it in consultation with my Nato allies. I’m not going to do it on my own,” he added.

Update #2: Biden has 'no immediate plans to contact' Putin, will only speak if he is 'looking for a way to end the war' (FOX News) 
WNU Editor:I see zero chance of Biden and Putin talking anytime in the near future .... Biden has ‘no immediate plans’ to contact Putin (The Hill).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Spain letter bombs: Spanish PM targeted amid spate of explosive packages 
Spain has stepped up security after revealing a number of letter bombs have been sent to high-profile targets, including the prime minister. 
On Wednesday, an employee of the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid was lightly injured when a similar device exploded. 
Officials say the defence minister was among the other targets. Another device was also sent to the US embassy. 
It is thought the bombs could be linked to Spain's support for Ukraine, but no-one has yet claimed to have sent them.  Russia - which invaded Ukraine in February - has condemned any "terrorist" activity, saying such threats or acts were "totally reprehensible".

Improved design layouts and advanced technologies onboard the US Navy’s (USN’s) new Ford-class aircraft carriers are enabling enhanced aircraft operations onboard and a higher sortie generation rate, a USN officer onboard first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford confirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico: House, Senate negotiators agree to add $45B to Biden’s defense budget 
The policy bill would authorize a total of $847 billion for national defense for fiscal 2023, if approved by both chambers. 
An emerging compromise on annual defense policy legislation will endorse a $45 billion increase to President Joe Biden’s defense spending plans, according to four people familiar with the negotiations. 
The deal would set the budget topline of the fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act at $847 billion for national defense, and would go as high as $858 billion when including programs that fall outside of the jurisdiction of the Senate and House Armed Services committees. The level mirrors the increased budget approved by Senate Armed Services in June.

Update: Lawmakers Set to Propose Record $847B for Defense, $45B Over Biden’s Request (Truthout)   
WNU Editor: If this budget increase is agreed to, it will be the largest-ever US defense budget, and I predict President Biden will sign it. 
So why the massive increase?
You have to take into account inflation, but it also looks like the Russia - Ukraine war and the rise of China is spooking US lawmakers.]]></summary>

Warzone/The Drive: Behold 40% Of B-2 Bomber Fleet Executing An ‘Elephant Walk’ 
Eight B-2 Spirit bombers took to the tarmac at their Missouri base for an unprecedented display of stealthy airpower. 
While an ‘elephant walk’ is by now a well-known part of airpower exercises by the U.S. military and other air forces elsewhere around the world, the concept still has the power to impress. Case in point, the eight B-2 Spirit stealth bombers that took to the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, at the culmination of the recent Spirit Vigilance 22 training exercise. 
The maneuvers involved the 509th and 131st Bomb Wings at Whiteman — the only operational B-2 base — and concluded on November 7, with an elephant walk and subsequent fly-off. This seems to be the first time that the flying-wing bombers had been involved in a mass launch of this scale.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a video address on Tuesday estimated it will cost more than $1 trillion to rebuild his country following the Russian assault, now over nine months in. 
If this number sounds absolutely shocking and unrealistic... it is, given this would be five times Ukraine's entire GDP. 
"The reconstruction of our country will become the most momentous economic, technological, and humanitarian project of our time. Even now, we engage dozens of our partner countries to rebuild Ukraine," Zelensky said during his nightly video address Tuesday, translated by Newsweek. 
"The total volume of work amounts to over a trillion dollars."   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The Ukraine President is dreaming if he thinks the West is going to give him a check for $1 trillion. His only hope is that the West forces Russia to pay reparations of $1 trillion. Again. He is dreaming if that is going to happen. 
So what is the bottom line?
When the war is finally over, Ukraine (or what is left of it) will find itself in debt to the West for hundreds of billions of dollars because of weapons purchases and loan guarantees.

VOA: Nigerian President: Ukraine War Funneling Arms, Fighters into Lake Chad Basin  
Abuja — Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari says the war between Russia and Ukraine is allowing arms and fighters to stream into the Lake Chad region, bolstering the strength of terrorist groups. 
The Nigerian leader spoke Tuesday in Abuja to a summit of heads of state from the Lake Chad Basin Commission, or LCBC.  Buhari called for more vigilance and cooperation among the commission’s six member nations against the increased proliferation of weapons into the Lake Chad basin. 
He said weapons meant for the Ukraine war and to combat terrorism in the Sahel are being diverted to West Africa and ending up in the hands of terrorist groups.

WNU Editor: This is a serious accusation from the Nigerian President. But I am not surprised. There is really no control of the weapons being flooded into Ukraine right now. The temptation for some in Ukraine to make money by shipping weapons elsewhere must be overwhelming.

   Reuters: Uniper seeks billions of euros in compensation from Gazprom 
DUESSELDORF — German utility Uniper has launched an arbitration process in the hope of securing billions of euros in compensation from Russia’s Gazprom over undelivered gas volumes, Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach said on Wednesday. 
Gazprom’s export arm denied it was in breach of contract regarding gas supplies to Uniper and said it did not accept the legality of the company’s claims. 
Uniper, which is in the process of being nationalized in a state bailout to survive the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, puts the cost of replacing Russian gas at around 11.6 billion euros ($12.02 billion) to date.

And now Germany's gas giant Uniper is suing Russia's Gazprom for failure to deliver gas because because they do not want gas delivered through the Nord Stream 2 lone pipeline that was not destroyed in an attack over two months ago.

The Guardian: Fighting in east Ukraine descends into trench warfare as Russia seeks breakthrough 
The town of Bakhmut has been mostly abandoned as relentless shelling reduced buildings to rubble 
Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting.

WNU Editor: Ukraine is denying reports that the town of Bakhmut is surrounded by Russian forces. My Russian sources say that in the past week a number of towns around Bakkhmut have been seized by their forces. I do not know who is right, but I do know that the worst fighting of this war is now happening in this part of the Donbas.

CNN: Pope Francis calls Chechens and Buryats ‘the cruelest’ Russian troops fighting in Ukraine 
Pope Francis has described two of Russia’s ethnic minority groups, the Chechens and Buryats, as some of the “cruelest” troops fighting in Ukraine.

An explosion occurred Wednesday at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid, injuring one Ukrainian employee who was handling a letter addressed to the country’s ambassador to Spain, officials said. 
The individual was slightly injured and is being treated at hospital, while police are investigating, Spain’s foreign ministry said.
It later added that Kyiv’s ambassador to Spain, Serhil Pohoreltsev, was the intended recipient of the envelope.  Ukraine has ramped up security at all of its embassies in response. 
 Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, said the life of the injured employee “is not at risk,” and descsribed the staffer’s position as “commandant.”

The new rule, introduced this week, further squeezes women out of an ever-shrinking public space that already sees them banned from traveling without a male escort and forced to wear a hijab or burqa whenever out of the home. 
Schools for teenage girls have also been shut for over a year across most of the country.
"For the past 15 months, we tried our best to arrange and sort it out -- and even specified the days," said Mohammad Akif Sadeq Mohajir, spokesman for the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

"Begin to pull out troops," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia's commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its "special military operation" and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow's forces since the offensive began on February 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is yet another sign of growing discontent in Russia with the way the war in Ukraine is going. This time, the criticism comes directly from the front. The elite Russian soldiers expressed their anger in an open letter published on Sunday, prompting the ministry of defense's response about the human cost for Russia of the "special military operation" in Ukraine.

Soldiers of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade broke their silence following a particularly harsh battle not far from the city of Donetsk in the Donbas region. "As a result of the 'carefully' planned offensive by the 'great commanders', we lost about 300 people [..] 50 percent of vehicles," write the authors of the open letter, which was widely shared on Telegram, the main communication app used by Russian military and political …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities in western Iran went on strike Wednesday in solidarity with mourners marking 40 days since security forces killed dozens in a crackdown on protests in the country's strife-torn southeast, a rights group said.
Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.
The crackdown on nationwide protests since her death has killed at least 304 people, including 41 children and 24 women, according to a combined toll issued…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
