        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Euronews: Which countries have the most strikes in Europe and what is the impact on the economy? 
A nationwide strike is taking place in France on Thursday in response to plans by President Emmanuel Macron’s government to reform the pension system and raise the retirement age. Strikes may continue beyond January 19 as France’s largest trade union has described Thursday as only a starting point. 
 Strikes have been happening in the UK, too. Nurses went on strike in England in December 2022 for the first time in 106 years. Rail workers have been on strike in recent weeks, and teachers and health workers are planning to strike in February.  Strikes are a significant part of the culture of working life in Europe. People in several EU member states including Spain and Germany went on strike recently, primarily asking for better pay and working conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The streets of France filled with outraged workers on Thursday as rail employees, teachers, and others walked off the job to protest President Emmanuel Macron's deeply unpopular plan to overhaul the nation's pension system by raising the official retirement age from 62 to 64.
The union-led demonstrations—which ground significant portions of the country, including many schools and transportation systems, to a halt—come as Macron is attempting to steamroll far-reaching opposition to his pension overhaul, declaring that "we must work longer."
Macron's government formally presented its draft law last week, the first step in the process of enacting a reform that would force French citizens to work longer to qualify for a full pension.

"Today Is a First Step"

"I had no food. There was only a bottle of ketchup that was on the boat, garlic powder and (bouillon cubes) Maggi. So I mixed it up with some water for me to survive 24 days in the sea," Elvis Francois, 47, said in English in a video released by the Colombian Navy.
The islander had the word "help" carved on the hull of the boat when he was found 120 nautical miles northwest of Puerto Bolivar in the northern department of La Guajira.
Francois said he saw other boats pass by and tried to flag them down, even lighting a fire on his vessel, but they did not see him.

PARIS (Reuters) -French workers went on strike and joined marches across the country on Thursday, halting trains and cutting electricity production in protest against government plans to raise the retirement age by two years to 64. 
The stoppages are a major test for President Emmanuel Macron, who said on Thursday that his pension reform plan, which opinion polls show is hugely unpopular, was "just and responsible" and had to be carried out.  Protesters disagreed. 
"It's salaries and pensions that must be increased, not the retirement age," read one large banner carried by workers that opened the protest march in Tours, in western France.
"I'll have to prepare my walking frame if the reform goes through," said Isabelle, 53, a social worker, saying her job was too tough to add two more years.

OilPrice.com: IEA Sees Global Oil Demand Hitting A Record High In 2023 
* The International Energy Agency believes global oil demand will hit a record high of 101.7 million barrels per day this year. 
* The IEA raised its demand estimate by 200,000 bpd, with the agency saying China will drive nearly half of global demand growth. 
* Oil prices continued to rally early on Wednesday morning on IEA estimates that oil markets are set to tighten in 2023. 
China’s reopening is set to drive global oil demand to a record high of 101.7 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up by 1.9 million bpd from 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday, raising its demand growth estimate for 2023 by 200,000 bpd from 1.7 million bpd growth expected in December. 
Almost half of the oil demand growth this year will come from China after Beijing lifted its Covid restrictions, the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report (OMR) for January.   At the same time, world oil supply growth in 2023 is set to slow to 1 million bpd, following last year’s OPEC+ led growth of 4.7 million bpd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: U.S. government touches debt limit 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government was due to hit its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit on Thursday, amid a standoff between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Joe Biden's Democrats that could lead to a fiscal crisis in a few months. 
Republicans, with a newly won House majority, aim to use the congressionally mandated federal debt ceiling to exact spending cuts from Biden and the Democratic-led Senate. 
Thursday's deadline will have little immediate effect, because Treasury officials are prepared to begin employing emergency cash management measures to stave off default. More serious risks will emerge closer to June, when the government approaches the so-called X date, beyond which the Treasury would run out of emergency maneuvers.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thursday's shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world's youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the punishing demands faced by women in power.
Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old politician said she had next to nothing left "in the tank" and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office.
"Politicians are human," she said. "We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it's time. And for me, it's time."
But the remarks that followed were more revealing, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand's University of Canterbury.

Davos: Cybersecurity is increasingly influencing how and where businesses invest and a vast majority believe that global geopolitical instability is likely to lead to a catastrophic cyberattack in the next two years. 
According to a report released here on Wednesday by the World Economic Forum at its Annual Meeting 2023, half of the companies surveyed feel the current landscape is making them re-evaluate the countries in which their organisation does business.

Evaluation of alliance's support to Ukraine tops agenda 
A two-day meeting of NATO military chiefs to discuss a variety of issues, including the alliance's support to Ukraine, started in Brussels on Wednesday. 
The session, which began after opening remarks by Adm. Rob Bauer, chair of the NATO Military Committee, and Mircea Geoana, NATO deputy secretary general, will be chaired by Bauer and attended by the allied military chiefs as well as their counterparts from invitees Finland and Sweden. 
"Unfortunately, we are seeing the dawn of a new era of collective defense. However, it is an era that NATO is ready for," Bauer said. "We have shown the world that we are capable of quickly scaling up our presence whenever and wherever necessary."

Update: NATO Chiefs of Defence meet in Brussels (NATO)   
WNU Editor: When this two-day meeting of NATO military chiefs is over later today (i.e. Thursday), the next big meeting will be a day later at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany .... Trans-Atlantic Rush of Meetings Ahead of Jan. 20 Ramstein Global NATO Defense Contact Group Summit (EIR). 
The main stream media is not giving the coverage of this meeting of NATO military chiefs that it deserves. You do not have this type of summit to discuss sending a few dozen tanks to Ukraine. You have this type of meeting to discuss waging war on a massive level. 
I hope I am wrong, but this Friday could be an inflection point for NATO's direct involvement in the Russia - Ukraine war. Their rhetoric certainly tells me that they are ready .... NATO warns of extended war in Ukraine, vows to be ready (AP).]]></summary>

* Ms Ardern became NZ's youngest-ever prime minister on October 26, 2017 
* Led her country through Covid pandemic and Christchurch mosque massacre 
* Resignation shocked everyone as she denied speculation she would leave 
* Insisted she was just burned out and had nothing left in the tank to continue  
Jacinda Ardern has choked back tears as she announced her resignation as New Zealand Prime Minister in an emotional press conference. 
Her resignation comes into effect on Sunday if the Labour Party can elect her replacement in a two-thirds vote on that day, or on February 7 if the process is drawn out. 
Ms Ardern said she hoped to find the energy and heart during the Christmas break to stay in the job, 'but I have not been able to do that'.

    Summit News: Joe Rogan on Biden: “They’re Trying to Get Rid of Him”  
Top Dems sabotaging president to prevent 2024 run. 
During a discussion on his podcast, Joe Rogan suggested the latest scandals surrounding Joe Biden suggested that top Democrats are “trying to get rid of him.” 
The president has been embroiled in more controversy after it was revealed that at least 20 classified documents relating to his time as vice-president were found at Biden’s home. 
Biden is now being investigated by a special counsel appointed by the US Department of Justice, having previously called Donald Trump “irresponsible” after his home was raided by the FBI for similar reasons. 
According to Joe Rogan, the scandal is part of a Democrat subversion campaign to ensure Biden doesn’t try to run for office again in 2024. 
“I don’t know jack shit about politics, but if I had to guess — they’re trying to get rid of him. My guess would be they’re trying to get rid of him,” said the podcast host.

Washington (AFP) - The owner of China-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato was arrested in Miami on Wednesday, along with five associates in Europe, during an international operation against "darknet" markets.
Anatoly Legkodymov, 40, a Russian living in Shenzhen, China, appeared in handcuffs and leg shackles in a Miami courtroom on money laundering charges, and was denied bail by a judge who deemed him a flight risk.
He was detained for his role in allegedly transmitting a total of $700 million in illicit funds, the US Department of Justice charged, with officials saying that criminals used the exchange as a haven for narcotics…]]></summary>

Washington (AFP) - The United States is not currently prepared to provide advanced Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said Wednesday, citing difficulties in maintenance and training.
Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for modern Western tanks to help battle Russia's invasion, and Germany has reportedly linked its decision on whether to do so to Washington's willingness to provide Abrams.
"I just don't think we're there yet," US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told journalists when asked about providing Abrams to Ukraine, though he did not completely close the door on a shift in the future.
"The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It's expensive, it's hard to train on, it has a jet engin…]]></summary>

Why the world’s most populous country (for now) is experiencing population decline.
 More than 60 years ago, something rare happened in China: More people died than were born. 
That estimated one-year drop in population was due to the Great Famine, perhaps the worst human-made catastrophe in history, resulting in the deaths of as many as 45 million people. Combined with a short but drastic drop in the birthrate, China shrank by roughly 700,000 people between 1960 and 1961. Once Chinese leader Mao abandoned the forced industrialization policies …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.
Just days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.
He ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was "convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors."
In a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil's presidents live.
Leftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.
As he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.

The president said last week that any "radical bolsonarista" found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.
"How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?" asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.
Bolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula's inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.
He has denied any link to the riots.
In a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed "regret" over the events, which he described as "unbelievable".

They can instead "come to church to give thanks for their civil marriage or civil partnership and receive God's blessing," it added.
Bishops met on Tuesday to finalize recommendations, which will affirm the church's teaching that Holy Matrimony exists between one man and one woman for life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notorious drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman has appealed to Mexico's president for help due to alleged "psychological torment" he is suffering in a US prison, his lawyer said Tuesday.
"In the six years that Joaquin has been in the United States, he has not seen the sun," said Jose Refugio Rodriguez, a Mexico-based legal representative of the Sinaloa cartel founder.
The message, described as "an SOS," was transmitted via one of Guzman's lawyers in the United States as well as his family, Rodriguez said.
Guzman is only allowed outside three times a week to a small area where he "doesn't get the sun," and has fewer visits or phone calls than other inmates, the lawyer said in an interview with Radio Formula.
"He is suffering psychological torment," he said, adding that the lack of sunshine was also bad for the convicted drug trafficker's physical health.
Guzman wants President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address alleged procedural violations during his extradition in 2017 under the former government, Rodriguez added.
The Mexican embassy in Washington confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that it received an email from Rodríguez on January 10. 
Without referring to the content of the email, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard downplayed the chance of any government intercession in favor of the notorious drug trafficker. 
"He is serving a sentence there, he has a sentence," he told journalists. "So, frankly I don't see any possibilities for him, but I'm going to review it with the prosecutor's office." 
El Chapo is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in 2019 of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.
One of his sons, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested by Mexican security forces this month in an operation that left 29 people dead and sparked a dramatic shootout at an airport in the city of Culiacan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When dozens of defense ministers meet at an airbase in Germany on Friday, all eyes will be set on what Berlin is - and is not - willing to provide Ukraine.
Defense leaders from roughly 50 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will confer at Ramstein Air Base, the latest in a series of meetings since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago.
The focus is expected to be not on what the United States will provide, but on whether Germany will send its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve their transfer from third countries.
"The U.S. is expecting Europeans to take the lead," said Rachel Rizzo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council. "I would expect the U.S. to be rightly privately pushing the Europeans to dedicate more of their re…]]></summary>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Katherine Swidan, whose son Mark has been imprisoned in China for over 10 years, has not seen even a photograph of him over the last decade. The last time she heard his voice was in 2018.
She and the families of other Americans, who according to the U.S. government are wrongfully held in China, are hoping that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken can push the Chinese authorities for the release of their loved ones as he visits Beijing next month.
"My message for Blinken is: say their names," said Katherine Swidan in a phone interview from her home in Luling, Texas. "They're American citizens. They've been wrongfully detained. Enough is enough."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: China's population falls for first time since 1961 
China's population has fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the national birth rate hitting a record low - 6.77 births per 1,000 people. 
The population in 2022 - 1.4118 billion - fell by 850,000 from 2021. 
China's birth rate has been declining for years, prompting a slew of policies to try to slow the trend. 
But seven years after scrapping the one-child policy, it has entered what one official described as an "era of negative population growth". 
The birth rate in 2022 was also down from 7.52 in 2021, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics, which released the figures on Tuesday. 
In comparison, in 2021, the United States recorded 11.06 births per 1,000 people, and the United Kingdom, 10.08 births. The birth rate for the same year in India, which is poised to overtake China as the world's most populous country, was 16.42. 
Deaths also outnumbered births for the first time last year in China. The country logged its highest death rate since 1976 - 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, up from 7.18 the previous year.

But when I working in China in the 1980s a Chinese regional leader told me that for China to develop and have a society that was rich and sustainable for its population, it needed to have a population of about 600 million. He also told me that it would take over a century to accomplish it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Vietnam politics: Power shift as President Nguyen Xuan Phuc quits 
Vietnam's President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has announced he is stepping down, sparking a potential power shift among the communist-ruled country's leaders.
The move had been widely rumoured and follows the departure of two deputy prime ministers who served under him. 
Mr Phuc, a former prime minister, had held the post of president since 2021. 
The news that he is quitting comes during an anti-corruption drive led by hard-liners. 
Hundreds of Communist Party members are being investigated. 
The president's resignation requires approval from the National Assembly, which will hold an extraordinary vote on Wednesday that is expected to be a formality.

Update #2: Vietnam's under-fire President Nguyen Xuan Phuc submits resignation -- France 24   
WNU Editor: The Presidency is a ceremonial position that Nguyen Xuan Phuc​ has held for under two years. Apparently he is being forced to resign over corruption scandals during his time as prime minister from 2016 to 2021.]]></summary>

CNN: US carrier strike group begins operating in South China Sea as tensions with China simmer 
A US carrier strike group began operating in the South China Sea on Thursday, the Navy announced, amid heightened tensions with Beijing, which claims much of the body of water as its sovereign territory. 
Two Chinese ships are already tailing the US group, a defense official told CNN, which consists of an aircraft carrier, a guided missile cruiser, and three guided missile destroyers. 
The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group, which has lethal and non-lethal capabilities from “space to undersea, across every axis, and every domain,” according to its commander, entered the South China Sea for the first time as part of its current deployment. 
The deployment comes as the US military bolsters its presence in the region in an effort to deter China, which is undergoing a rapid modernization and expansion of its own military and nuclear capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.
The suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.
The industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France's unions are united.
"It'll be a hellish Thursday," Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.
Paris public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.
Services would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.
Elsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.
Most slow trains between cities would be halted.
Up to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.
Opinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron's last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.
The 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.

And the decline is set to continue as factors including rising living costs, more women entering the workforce and having children later mean people in some countries are having fewer babies.
China's population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, official data showed Tuesday, and it is expected to be overtaken by India this year as the most populous nation.
Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to UN figures published last July which forecast how the world's population will develop between now and 2100.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italy's National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.
Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum "for having had 'le palle' (the balls) to invite me tonight", according to Deadline and Variety reports.
The museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as "unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation".
Its "Stella della Mole" award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film "American Beauty" and drama series "House of Cards" -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.
Spacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
His stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.
The actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.
Last summer he appeared at London's Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.
Now on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, "deepfake" video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.
Cave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.
The chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.
The Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave's website, asked the tool to produce a song "in the style of Nick Cave".
One of the AI-created verses runs: "I'm the king of the abyss, I'm the ruler of the dark / I'm the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark."
"This song sucks," wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT's work "replication as travesty".
He followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn't, describing the process of writing as "an act of self-murder".
"Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don't feel," he wrote.
He added: "Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit."
Cave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- "I've got the fire of hell in my eyes."
"I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it's ChatGPT," he concluded.
