POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

	"We are here together, not to talk about the problems at home, which are many," Graham shot back.


	"You're not going to screw this up!" Graham shouted.


	"Get this guy out of here!" Graham exclaimed.


	"I'm an American," Graham said, pounding on the podium.

	"And I believe in free speech," Graham continued. "I don't believe what the squad has to say at all. But I came here with Democrats and Republicans to let everybody in the world know."


	Graham later apologized after his temper cooled.

Final results show sizeble gains for the far-right Swiss People’s Party, and important losses for the Greens. 
The far-right and euroskeptic Swiss People’s Party (SVP) came out as a clear leader in Switzerland’s national elections, according to final results released late Sunday. 
The SVP, which has centered its campaign on anti-immigrant rhetoric in an election dominated by domestic issues, has won 28.6 percent of the vote in the Parliament’s lower chamber, the National Council — up from 25.6 percent four years ago — winning 62 seats, nine more than in 2019. 
While the centrist The Center party maintained its score at 14.6 percent (29 seats), the liberal FDP party suffered a small loss, losing one seat.

Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza following Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an open warning against Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon, discouraging them from invading Israel as his country is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza. 
The expected ground invasion follows Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities.

While visiting troops in northern Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu said if Hezbollah were to launch a war and invade Israel, "it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating."

The Biden administration has pressed Israel to delay its imminent invasion of Gaza to allow for the release of more hostages held by Hamas and for aid to reach Gaza, according to two sources briefed on the discussions. 
The release of two Americans held by Hamas Friday signaled that more of roughly 200 people believed to be kidnapped by the militant group may be freed after they were taken during the group’s deadly attacks launched against Israel two week ago. 
“The [administration] pressed Israeli leadership to delay because of progress on the hostage front,” and the need to get trucks of aid into Gaza, one person familiar with the discussions said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is pushing for a major American foreign policy change in his second administration that would likely upend decades of global national security infrastructure.
Sources tell Rolling Stone that Trump is planning to pull the United States entirely out of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance unless it caves to his demands that include one that would seem to undermine the entire purpose of the alliance.
In addition to his standard calls for other NATO countries to chip in more for their defense spending, Trump also reportedly wants to rip up the strategic doctrine that an attack on one NATO country represents an attack on all NATO countries.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"When he was in office, Trump would repeatedly scoff at this collective-defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty, known as Article 5," the publication writes. "One former senior administration official recalls to Rolling Stone a moment in the Oval Office in mid-2018 when the then-president started reading from a written list of smaller NATO countries, some of which he argued most Americans had never even heard of before."
Tearing up Article 5 would be a major boon for the likes of Russia, which attacked non-NATO member Ukraine in 2022 but notably has not attacked other NATO members on its border such as Estonia and Latvia.
Dr. Aaron Stein, a Black Sea Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, tells Rolling Stone that Trump's plan would be a "tremendously stupid endeavor" and added that "trading away allies based on ignorance, and Trump is ignorant about this issue, is just silly for broader U.S. national security."]]></summary>

With tensions mounting, Washington also announced Sunday it had ordered non-emergency staff to leave its embassy in Iraq.
"We are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks against our own personnel, our own people," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS News. "We expect there is a likelihood of escalation."
"No one should take advantage of this moment to escalate to further attacks on Israel or, for that matter, attacks on us on our personnel."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The organiser of the Web Summit, one of the tech sector's leading events, announced his resignation Saturday following a backlash over his online posts following the Hamas attacks on Israel.
"Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event," Paddy Cosgrave of Ireland explained in a brief statement sent to AFP.
"I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused," added the co-founder of the tech mega gathering created in 2009 in Dublin but held in Lisbon since 2016.
A spokesperson for the organization said: "Web Summit will appoint a new CEO as soon as possible, and Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon will go ahead as planned."
This year's edition from November 13 to 16, is set to bring together some 2,300 startups and more than 70,000 participants, say organizers.
Several companies, including tech giants Google and Meta, which is behind Facebook and Instagram, as well as event headliners have announced they are boycotting the gathering since Cosgrave's remarks.
He had written on X, formerly Twitter, that he was "shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments" in support of Israel.
"War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are," he wrote on October 13.
Since shock Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, which left 1,400 dead, Israel has launched devastating air and ground bombardments of Gaza. The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.
The boycott by Meta and Google followed other exits by companies and tech figures, including Intel, Siemens and US comedian Amy Poehler and X-Files actor Gillian Anderson.]]></summary>

Two by-election losses to the main opposition Labour Party on Thursday underscored how Sunak, 43, has failed to revive the Conservatives' beleaguered fortunes during his first 12 months in charge.
"The more people see of Sunak, the less they like him in some ways," Tim Bale, author of a book about the right-wing Conservatives since Brexit, told AFP.
"He doesn't really project authority, he doesn't necessarily give the impression that he's in control of events.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Joe Biden met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet during his visit to Israel, the U.S. president assured them: "I don't believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, and I am a Zionist." 
The politicians and generals gathered in the ballroom of the Tel Aviv hotel nodded in approval, according to a U.S. official knowledgeable of the closed-door remarks, even as Israel bombarded Gaza in retaliation for a devastating attack by Palestinian Hamas militants and with a ground invasion looming. 
Biden, who is of Irish Catholic descent, has used similar words in the past to profess his affinity for Israel. But the moment, which has not been previously reported, illustrates how Biden's decades as one of the leading "Friends of Israel" in American politics seem to be guiding him during a defining crisis of his presidency.

Simmering racial divisions were exposed earlier this month when just over 60 percent of Australians voted against a referendum to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders within the 1901 constitution.
In the wake of the result, many Indigenous leaders embarked on a "week of silence", asking for time to grieve what they saw as a crushing rejection at the hands of Australia's white majority.
Some leaders ended that silence in a scathing open letter addressed to the government, criticizing the "appalling and mean-spirited" outlook of milli…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A teenage Iranian girl, who fell into a coma earlier this month following an alleged encounter with officers over violating the country’s hijab law, is said to be "brain dead", Iranian state media reported on Sunday.
"Follow-ups on the latest health condition of Armita Geravand indicate that her health condition as brain dead seems certain despite the efforts of the medical staff," the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said.
Iranian authorities have denied claims by rights groups that the 16-year-old was hurt after a confrontation on Oct. 1 with officers enforcing the mandatory Islamic dress code in the Tehran metro.

The report on Geravand could revive nationwide protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini last year in the custody of morality police.

The storm came ashore about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of the resort city of Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California coast, gradually weakening from a Category 3 as it approached land.
Norma was moving northeast at 9 kph, packing winds of up to 130 kph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported at 2100 GMT. 
Norma was expected to bring rainfall of up to 45 centimeters (18 inches), producing "flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain," the NHC said.
"Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions" would affect the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for the next couple of days.
Hotel employees in Cabo San Lucas urged guests to stay indoors until authorities give the all-clear, Gustavo Matamoros, a hotel worker, told AFP.
Local authorities say about 60,000 tourists are staying in the area, most of them international visitors.
Footage from Milenio TV showed flooded streets as Norma arrived. No casualties have been reported by authorities.
Norma should continue to weaken to a tropical storm as it moves toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday.
Two people died last week when Hurricane Lidia struck the western states of Jalisco and Nayarit.

The Agriculture Minister says since the beginning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Labor government have “condemned Hamas’ attack on innocent Israeli lives”.

“We’ve said consistently that Israel has a right to defend itself,” Mr Watt told Sky News Australia. 

“But that doesn’t get away from the fact that every life in this conflict is worth something.

“We don’t want to see any more lives lost than absolutely needed.”]]></summary>

Several have signed a loyalty pledge to support the winner of the first vote, aiming to avoid the vote-counting confusion that followed Mr Jordan’s candidacy. 

This comes after earlier this month, former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted. 

“If we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern, and every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” Republican Representative Michael McCaul said. 

A secret vote with the GOP conference is scheduled for Tuesday as Republicans are encouraged to sign a unity pledge, promising to support whoever wins the vote.]]></summary>

The decision to remove the sanctions clears the way for the Prime Minister to visit Beijing next month.

Mr Tyrrell said Chinese wine consumption has dropped by about 60 per cent because “they can’t get the wine that they really like to drink”.

“As more and more Chinese people have travelled over the last 10 years, they’ve got to know Australia, they like Australia, they like Australians and got a great taste for Australian wine, so we really need to be back in that market,” he told Sky News Australia.

Mr Tyrrell hopes China’s economy will grow and Australian wine sales will grow with it.]]></summary>

FOX News: McConnell calls China, Russia, Iran new 'axis of evil' that US must deal with: 'This is an emergency' 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says Israel-Hamas war is a 'worldwide problem' posing 'immediate threat' to US

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Sunday deemed China, Russia and Iran the new "axis of evil" amid wars in Ukraine and Israel, while addressing U.S. funding of allies' responses to those duel conflicts. 
In a new sit-down interview with "Fox News Sunday" host Shannon Bream, McConnell, the highest-ranking Senate Republican, agreed with fellow Republican Kentuckian Sen. Rand Paul that the $1.5 trillion deficit is "entirely too big." 
But while Paul remarked last month that the U.S. under the Biden administration was borrowing heavily from China just to send aid to Ukraine, McConnell instead emphasized Sunday that the deficit also expanded during the prior administration under former President Donald Trump.

Additional U.S. military forces in the U.S. have also been placed in a higher state of readiness for a possible future deployment to the Middle East on short notice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A secret recording revealed by "60 Minutes Australia" exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. 
Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a "favor" for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do," admitting not only to the bribery but also that it's frequent behavior for him. 

"It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings," The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insider: Israel is now fighting on 3 fronts as airstrikes and violence escalate across the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and Syria 
 * Israel is now waging war on three fronts — the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and Syria. 
 * As the conflict spreads, the US is beefing up its military presence in the region. 
 * US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it was in response to "recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces." 
Following the Palestinian militant group Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on the group. 
Now, that conflict is spilling over into the neighboring countries of Lebanon and Syria as Israel ramps up airstrikes on the two Arab states. 
The US has sent more military assets to the region to bolster Israel's forces following what US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called "recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces."

This continent will bring extreme temperatures, rendering it uninhabitable for mammals. The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth's climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.]]></summary>

Pratt, the Australian billionaire that Trump revealed classified information to, told around 45 people about the classified info as well as a number of things about his presidential pal.  
Not only did Trump tell his wife, Melania, to strut around the property in a bikini, but Pratt paid Trump tens of thousands of overages for ticket prices for events at the country club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While appearing on ABC's This Week, host Jonathan Karl pressed Scott on his claim that U.S. "weakness" led to the terrorist attacks.

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?be allowed to run for office?


	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration's decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	"And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that's beyond the pale, isn't it?" the ABC host asked.


	"There's no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost," Scott opined.

China and the Philippines on Sunday accused each other of causing collisions in a disputed area of the South China Sea, the latest in a string of maritime confrontations between the two countries that have heightened regional tensions. 
In a statement, Philippine authorities said a Chinese Coast Guard ship carried out “dangerous blocking maneuvers” that caused it to collide with a Philippine vessel carrying supplies to troops stationed in Ayungin Shoal, also known as Second Thomas Shoal, in the Spratly Islands chain. 
China’s move was “provocative, irresponsible and illegal” and “imperiled the safety of the crew” of the Philippine boats, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said.

* 32% have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in media’s news reporting 


* New high of 39% have no confidence at all, compared with 27% in 2016 


* Democrats’ trust is down 12 points since last year; lowest since 2016 


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The 32% of Americans who say they trust the mass media “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to report the news in a full, fair and accurate way ties Gallup’s lowest historical reading, previously recorded in 2016. Although trust in media currently matches the historical low, it was statistically similar in 2021 (36%) and 2022 (34%). 


Another 29% of U.S. adults have “not very much” trust, while a record-high 39% register “none at all.” This nearly four in 10 Americans who completely lack confidence in the media is the highest on record by one percentage point. It is 12 points higher than the 2016 reading, which came amid sharp criticism of the media from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump -- making the current assessment of the media the grimmest in Gallup’s history. In 2016, U.S. adults were most likely to say they had “not very much” trust (41%).

* No consensus at the Cairo Summit on the Israel-Palestinian violence. 
* The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened Saturday, allowing the transportation of humanitarian aid. 
* Clashes between Israel and Hamas continue, with Israeli airstrikes killing 19 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian media. 
* Israel issued a warning advising its citizens against traveling to Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, and if they are in those countries to leave as soon as possible. 
A Cairo summit hosted by Egypt Saturday failed to reach an agreement on how to contain the violence between Israel and Hamas. 
Arab leaders condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza while mostly Western countries said civilians should be shielded, but with Israel and senior U.S. officials absent there was no consensus on how to resolve the conflict.

The Israeli military on Saturday stepped up warnings to Gazan residents and continued preparations for an offensive in the war-torn territory, including for ground operations, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. 
The IDF again instructed the roughly 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza to evacuate, threatening that “no matter where you are,” there will be “significant combat.” 
Residents in Gaza reported that Israeli planes rained red leaflets on neighborhoods Saturday, urging residents to evacuate. Those with cell phones also received the message digitally, according to social media reports.

The Guardian: Chinese ship is focus of investigation into damaged pipeline, Finland says

 
Police focusing on Newnew Polar Bear cargo ship that was in the area when gas pipeline was damaged 
Finnish police have said a Chinese ship whose movement coincided with the time and place of the suspected sabotage of a pipeline between Finland and Estonia that was damaged this month is now the focus of their investigation. 
After a leak led to the shutdown of the Balticconnector pipeline on 8 October, Finnish authorities have been investigating the damage they say was caused by “external” activity. 
On Friday, they said their focus was on the Newnew Polar Bear, a cargo ship that reportedly came under Chinese ownership this year. Between 2017 and 2022 it was known as the Baltic Fulmar, the Finnish broadcaster YLE reported.

Argentina votes on Sunday in one of the most open presidential elections for decades. 
The effects of a deep economic crisis have proved fertile ground for an unorthodox far-right front-runner, with wild hair, big sideburns and a totally radical approach to ruling the country. 
Javier Milei was, until recently, a relative unknown. An economist, pundit and rock fan, he came top in recent primaries and polls now put him ahead in Sunday's first round.
He is very clear about wanting to shake things up. At one campaign event, he wielded a chainsaw to send a message that he intends to slash spending to improve Argentina's economy.

China has developed an arsenal of more than 500 operational nuclear warheads and is set to double that number by the end of the decade, exceeding previous Pentagon estimates, according to a Defense Department report. 
The figures, released in an unclassified public report to Congress on Thursday, are part of a broad assessment of China’s military goals and developments in the past year, and highlight the rapid advances in Beijing’s multi-decade plan to build a nuclear weapons arsenal that rivals that of the United States.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.
