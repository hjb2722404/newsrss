* The German lender’s shares retreated for a third consecutive day and have now lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month. 
* The emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS, in the wake of the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, triggered contagion concern among investors, which was deepened by further monetary policy tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. 
Deutsche Bank shares fell on Friday following a spike in credit default swaps Thursday night, as concerns about the stability of European banks persisted. 
The Frankfurt-listed stock was down 14% at one point during the session but trimmed losses to close 8.6% lower on Friday afternoon. 
The German lender’s Frankfurt-listed shares retreated for a third consecutive day and have now lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month. Credit default swaps — a form of insurance for a company’s bondholders against its default — leapt to 173 basis points Thursday night from 142 basis points the previous day.

The Guardian: ‘Brazil is back’: Lula to visit Xi as he resets diplomatic relations with China 
Meeting is part of high-profile tour as Brazil’s president attempts to repair country’s reputation after the Bolsonaro era 
One of them wants the world to know his country is battling its way back to its former glory after three years of zero-Covid lockdowns and a long and humiliating history of foreign exploitation. 
The other wants to signal his country is bouncing back from four chaotic years under a far-right populist who took a sledgehammer to its place in the world. 
The two revival-seeking politicians – China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – will meet in Beijing next week during a high-profile tour that is part of the latter’s efforts to repair his country’s overseas reputation after Jair Bolsonaro’s era of antagonism and isolation.

"If I now look in hindsight, it was not really about weapons of mass destruction. It was about regime change," he said. ElBaradei added: "They (the US) thought the best pretext was to say that Saddam Hussein was linked to al Qaeda and had WMDs (...) They didn't really have any evidence. It was all about belief.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday said Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia sends a “troubling message.” 
Xi earlier this week concluded his three-day visit to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a visit seen by the West as Beijing doubling down on its support for the Kremlin in its war in Ukraine. 
“Xi’s visit to Putin and remaining there for a couple of days I think sends a very troubling message, a message of support,” Austin told lawmakers on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.

France 24: China says again drove away US warship in South China Sea; US says asserting navigational rights 
China’s defence ministry said on Friday that it yet again had to monitor and drive away the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Milius that entered its territorial waters in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands. 
“We sternly demand the U.S. to immediately stop such provocative acts, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen incidents,” a spokesperson said in a statement from the Ministry of National Defence. 
The U.S. Navy said the guided-missile destroyer was asserting its navigational rights and freedoms.  “Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations,” the U.S. Navy 7th fleet said in an emailed statement.

Street battles between the trouble-makers — a volatile combination of anarchists, ultra-leftists and radicalized yellow vest activists — and police in several parts of the country are leaving some city centers looking like wastelands.

President Emmanuel Macron inflamed public anger by sending his already unpopular plan to raise the retirement age by two years, from 62 to 64, through parliament without a vote.

Violence hit a new high during Thursday's ninth union-organized nationwide marches. Clashes in Nantes, in western France, in Lyon, in the southeast, and in Paris grew increasingly brutal.

Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich told NBC News that Russian jets have violated the airspace of At Tanf Garrison roughly 25 times this month, including Wednesday. 
Armed Russian jets have flown over a U.S. military garrison in Syria nearly every day in March, violating a 4-year-old agreement between the U.S. and Russia and risking escalation, according to the U.S. general in charge of air operations in the region. 
 Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, combined forces air component commander for U.S. Central Command, told NBC News on Wednesday that the most recent Russian overflight of At Tanf Garrison (ATG) happened just a few hours earlier, and that Russian jets have violated the airspace roughly 25 times so far this month, compared to zero times in February and 14 in January.
“It is a substantial increase,” he said, explaining that at this rate they are “on track to be double what it has been in the past.”

* Iran-backed fighters fired three missiles at US military base at Al-Omar oil field 
* US killed 11 militants in strikes after Iranian drone strike killed American 
The White House today insisted America is not seeking a conflict with Iran after President Biden launched a series of retaliatory air strikes against Tehran-backed fighters who had killed an American contractor in an Iranian suicide drone attack. 
Biden ordered the U.S. Central Command forces to launch 'precision airstrikes' against facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps in northeast Syria on Thursday, killing at least 14 pro-Iran fighters. 
White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said today that the retaliatory airstrikes against the IRGC, a wing of the Iranian military which is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Washington, were aimed at protecting American personnel in Syria.

* Pentagon official Gil Cisneros faced grilling on the controversy in House hearing 
* DoD Education Activity diversity boss Kelisa Wing tweeted the remarks last year 
* Cisneros says she was transferred for unrelated reasons, but not disciplined 
A top Pentagon official has said that a diversity officer who tweeted disparaging remarks about white people will not face workplace discipline following a lengthy internal investigation. 
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros faced tough grilling on the controversy from Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing on Thursday. 
Cisneros confirmed that DoDo employee Kelisa Wing will not be fired or otherwise sanctioned for tweets she wrote prior to taking a job as the chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer in the Department of Defense's Education Activity office (DoDEA), which oversees schooling for children of military families.

WNU Editor: If this Pentagon diversity officer was white and he/she had made disparaging remarks about nonwhites, you can take this to the bank, this person would be fired immediately.
 Update:The Pentagon's media allies are pushing back on accusatons that the US Department of Defense is becoming a woke institution .... The Pentagon prepares for its next battle: GOP accusations of ‘wokeness’ (Politico). But as the above video illustrates, they have their work cut out.]]></summary>

USNI News: Ford Aircraft Carrier John F. Kennedy to Deliver a Year Later 
The next Ford-class aircraft carrier will now deliver to the Navy in 2025, one year later than the service’s most recent projection, according to Fiscal Year 2024 budget documents released this week. 
The Navy delayed future carrier John F. Kennedy’s (CVN-79) delivery date from June 2024 so the service could alter the ship’s Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) and perform more work during construction, according to the service’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget documents. 
“The Navy is implementing a strategy to pull baseline work from the Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) into the construction period in order to provide more capability at ship delivery,” the Navy’s shipbuilding budget books read.

North Korea claimed Friday to have tested an underwater attack drone capable of unleashing a "super-scale radioactive tsunami" if armed with a nuclear warhead. 
The brazen claim — which many experts doubt  — was part of the Kim Jong Un regime's angry response to the latest joint war games by the U.S. and South Korean militaries. 
The North released pictures of Kim admiring what the country's official news service said was the new underwater drone, and others purportedly showing it at sea, along with an underwater explosion. 
The regime claimed the weapon cruised underwater for almost 60 hours before blowing up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: King Charles’ visit to France postponed after wave of protests 
* The new British monarch’s first state visit was scheduled to run from March 26 to March 29 and see him visit Paris and Bordeaux. 
* In Paris, tear gas and water cannons have been fired at protesters and police have been injured. 
* The French government last week announced it would use special constitutional powers to force its unpopular pension bill through the lower house of parliament without a vote. 
King Charles III’s visit to France has been postponed, as protests continue over the Paris government’s pension system reforms. 
This trip was due to be the new British monarch’s first state visit and was scheduled to run from March 26 to March 29. 
Unions on Thursday called for a national day of action involving strikes and protests on March 28.  The decision to cancel the visit was taken by the French and British governments after a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and King Charles, according to a statement.

Saudi state television reports that the two countries are in talks to resume consular services. 
Saudi Arabia and Syria are in talks over a resumption of consular services between the two countries, according to Saudi state television, an indication of a possible restoration of ties between the two countries. 
Saudi Arabia, which backed the Syrian opposition in the country’s war, closed its embassy in Damascus and expelled the Syrian ambassador in 2012.

WNU Editor: Quite a contrast in the reporting. On the one hand the Western media is saying that Saudi Arabia and Syria are in talks to restore ties. Arab news agencies are saying that the talks have been concluded, and that ties will be restored with the reopening of their embassies. I am trusting the Arab sources on this one.

* The Defense Department said intelligence ops determined the drone was Iranian 
An American contractor has been killed and five service members were wounded when an Iranian suicide drone struck a facility on a coalition base in northeast Syria on Thursday, the Pentagon said. 
In retaliation, President Biden ordered the U.S. Central Command forces to launch 'precision airstrikes' against facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, killing 11 pro-Iran fighters. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the airstrikes against the IRGC, a wing of the Iranian military which is blacklisted as a terrorist group by the US, were carried out by F-15 fighter jets.

Reuters: Zelenskiy tells Europe: Be quicker with military aid or face a long war 
KYIV (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday urged Europe to increase and speed up supplies of modern weaponry and impose tougher sanctions on Russia, saying otherwise the war could drag on for years. 
In a long and sharply worded video address to EU leaders, delivered from a train, Zelenskiy said it was up to the 27-nation bloc to take action to contain Russia more than a year into its invasion of Ukraine. 
Although Ukrainian officials have repeatedly urged partners to step up supplies of weapons, Zelenskiy's comments represented an unusually open display of frustration. 
"If Europe waits, the evil may have time to regroup and prepare for years of war. It is in your power to prevent this," he said in an address to EU leaders, who held talks with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

WEST OF SOLEDAR, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops, on the defensive for four months, will soon launch a counterassault as Russia's huge winter offensive weakens without capturing the eastern city of Bakhmut, Ukraine's top ground forces commander said. 
The remarks on Thursday were the strongest indication yet from Kyiv that it is close to shifting tactics, having absorbed Russia's onslaught through a brutal winter. 
Russia's Wagner mercenaries "are losing considerable strength and are running out of steam", Kyiv's ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a social media post.

In the midst of the raging Russia-Ukraine war, Kyiv’s western allies like the US, UK and NATO have showcased their support to the war-stricken country to combat the wrath of the Russian forces.

China's show of solidarity with Russia displeased officials in Brussels, where concerns are growing that Beijing is considering supplying arms to Moscow. 
But for now there is no real desire to decouple from China.  If Xi Jinping chooses to "befriend a war criminal, it is our duty to get very serious about China," Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told DW when asked what he thought about the Chinese president's three-day visit to Moscow and his meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. 
The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin late last week, accusing him of war crimes.  The only way forward for the European Union now, Landsbergis said, is to take "first steps on de-risking and eventual decoupling from China. The sooner we start, the better for the union."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FOX News: Mike Pompeo sounds alarm on China-Russia alliance: Biden is making an 'enormous strategic mistake' 
 Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday on "America's Newsroom" that the Biden administration is making an "enormous strategic mistake" by seeking to downplay the meeting between China and Russia's presidents. Pompeo said the Biden foreign policy has failed, as Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin strengthen ties against the West. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement to expand their economic ties during a bilateral meeting in Moscow on Tuesday. 
Xi arrived in Moscow for a multiday series of meetings with his Russian counterpart, aimed at demonstrating the two countries' new "friendship without limits." Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of jointly safeguarding their countries' energy security.  Read more ....   
Update #1: Pompeo: The Biden administration allowed the Chinese and Russians to come together (Modern Diplomacy)  
Update #2: Biden making ‘enormous’ mistake on China – former US secretary of state (RT)   
WNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. The Russia - China alliance is going to be a strategic political/economic/and military adversary that Washington is going to have a lot of problems countering in the years to come. And the sad part of this story is that this could have all been prevented if Washington took Moscow's national security concerns and proposals seriously in the fall of 2021.]]></summary>

Han Dong, the Toronto-area MP at the centre of allegations involving Chinese government interference in Canada's affairs, says he is leaving the Liberal caucus and will sit as an Independent. 
"I'm taking this extraordinary step because to [sit] in the government caucus is a privilege and my presence there may be seen by some as a conflict of duty and the wrong place to be as an independent investigation pursues the facts in this matter," he said , reading a statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday night.

China’s military said guided-missile destroyer USS Milius intruded into China’s territorial waters near the contested Paracel Islands 
The United States has denied Chinese claims that a US destroyer was driven out from waters around the contested Paracel Islands after it “illegally” entered the area in the South China Sea. 
In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese military said the guided-missile destroyer USS Milius illegally intruded into China’s territorial waters, without the approval of the government, undermining peace and stability in the busy waterway.  The United States Navy, however, declared this to be false.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Seven out of 30 allies met NATO's military spending target of 2% of GDP in 2022, one country less than in 2021 before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday, urging allies to boost defence investment more quickly. 
Stoltenberg told reporters in a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels that the alliance originally had expected two more countries to meet the goal. 
"But because GDP has increased more than expected for a couple of allies, two allies that we expected to be at 2% are now slightly below 2%," he said. 
 Stoltenberg did not reveal which countries reached the goal but referred to NATO's annual report to be published later on Tuesday.

   PJ Media: Trump Continues to Increase His Primary Lead Over DeSantis After Indictment Threat 
Donald Trump had been slowly increasing his national primary lead over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis since the fall — a trend that continues now that the former president is under threat of indictment. 
The spread between the former president and the Florida governor is now 11% in the Morning Consult poll. It’s 41-27% in the Monmouth Poll and 46-32% in the Quinnipiac Poll. 
Despite unprecedented negative coverage by the national media and the hype surrounding “the first president ever, ever, evah, to be indicted,” Trump has grown his lead over DeSantis since the beginning of the year.

* Police are maintaining a high-profile presence in New York City on Wednesday 
* The country is bracing for a potential indictment against Trump in the case of his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels as a grand jury convenes in NYC 
* A new report notes the grand jury was canceled and it's likely no indictment is coming this week 
Donald Trump will not be indicted Wednesday after the Manhattan District Attorney told grand jury members not to come into the court, DailyMail.com confirmed with a court official. 
Thursday's session is still scheduled to go on as scheduled, the official added.  Jurors are remaining on standby and likely won't be notified about the plans for Thursday until Wednesday evening.

WNU Editor: Some are wondering if this means the DA is having trouble in convincing a grand jury to issue indictments. I do not know the answer to that, but this certainly is not going to help the DA's case if it is true .... EXCLUSIVE: Is this the smoking gun? Letter from Michael Cohen claiming Donald Trump did NOT reimburse him for hush money paid to Stormy Daniels appears to fly in the face of the star witness's grand jury testimony (Daily Mail).]]></summary>

   AFP: Ukraine needs $411 bn for reconstruction, recovery: World Bank 
Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery needs have grown to $411 billion, just over a year since Russia's invasion, the World Bank said Wednesday. 
The assessment, made jointly by Ukraine's government, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations, is an increase from the $349 billion estimated in a report released in September. 
The latest evaluation expects Kyiv to require $14 billion for critical and priority reconstruction and recovery investments in 2023. 
Meeting these needs will call for $11 billion in financing beyond what Ukraine's government has already addressed in its 2023 budget, according to the assessment.

A White House spokesperson dismissed the ties as a "marriage of convenience." 
HONG KONG and LONDON -- Chinese President Xi Jinping departed Moscow on Wednesday after two days of highly symbolic meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two presented a united front and an alternative vision for global leadership. 
Much of the summit seemed to be directed at countering narratives from the United States, NATO and other nations that have stood against Putin's invasion of neighboring Ukraine more than a year ago.

    NBC/Reuters: Xi and Putin pledge to shape a new world order as the Chinese leader leaves Russia with no peace in sight for Ukraine  
The White House said China’s position was not impartial and urged Beijing to pressure Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin set their sights on shaping a new world order as the Chinese leader left Moscow on Wednesday, having made no direct support for Putin’s war in Ukraine during his two-day visit. 
Xi made a strong show of solidarity with Putin against the West, but he barely mentioned the Ukraine conflict and said on Tuesday that China had an “impartial position”. There was no sign that Xi’s efforts to play the role of peacemaker had yielded results. 
Yet, as Xi departed he told Putin: “Now there are changes that haven’t happened in 100 years. When we are together, we drive these changes.” 
“I agree,” Putin said, to which Xi responded: “Take care of yourself dear friend, please.”

Update #2: ‘Right now there are changes, the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years.’ What China President Xi said to Putin before leaving Russia. (Market Watch)   
WNU Editor: US President Nixon went to China in 1972 (link here) to pursue a policy to make sure that Russia and China do not partner-up, and for 50 years US presidents have been successful in keeping both countries apart. I can now say with confidence that this US foreign policy priority is now in shambles .... Xi and Putin solidify 'strategic partnership of coordination' between China, Russia (SCMP).]]></summary>

North Korea fired two missiles from a submarine in the East Sea, as the Sea of Japan is also known, over the weekend, North Korean state media said on Monday.
State-controlled KCNA said two "strategic cruise missiles" were fired from the submarine 8.24 Yongung in an "underwater launching drill" on Sunday morning.
The submarine was in the waters off Kyongpho Bay and "precisely hit the preset target" in the East Sea after traveling the 1,500 kilometres in "eight-shaped flight orbits" for over two hours, KCNA reported.
The agency said that Pyongya…]]></summary>

The Left Party called on the Hamburg Senate to clarify unanswered questions about the rampage, said Deniz Celik, interior policy spokesman for the Left Party in Hamburg's State Parliament, in a statement on Sunday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Sunday, adding that he hoped the exchange would take place soon.
"Regarding the issue of prisoner swaps between Iran and the U.S. we have reached an agreement in the recent days and if everything goes well on the U.S. side, I think we will witness a prisoner exchange in a short period," Amirabdollahian said.
"On our part everything is ready, while the U.S. is currently working on the final technical coordination."
One of several Americans held in Iran is Siamak Namazi, a businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, who was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government.
Emad Sharghi, an Iranian-American businessman was first arrested in 2018 when he was working for a tech investment company, is also jailed in Iran, as is Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship.
Iranian sources told Reuters that two regional countries were involved in the series of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington for the release of prisoners.
For years, Tehran has sought the release of more than a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the glitz of Sunday's Oscars, the first Irish language film to earn a nomination is sparking renewed interest in a native tongue spoken by so few it is considered endangered by the United Nations cultural agency.
Competing for best international feature, "An Cailín Ciúin" (The Quiet Girl) last year became the first Irish language film to gross more than 1 million euros ($1.06 million) at the UK and Irish box office. It has remained a fixture in cinemas across English-speaking Ireland.
Director Colm Bairéad says the success feels like it is boosting a language he grew up feeling self-conscious about because of its rarity. Raised in a bilingual household, the Dubliner's father would make a point of shouting across the street in Iri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court's powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.
As the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.
"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids," said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.
The protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.
National police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.
The now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and "will not yield to any political pressure on the matter".
Netanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.
"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister'," said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.

Greece has asked for others to imitate the Vatican Museums after they agreed this month to return three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon. London and Athens are in talks over the Parthenon Sculptures held by the British Museum.
The Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis in Athens, was completed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the goddess Athena, and its decorative friezes contain some of the greatest examples of ancient Greek sculpture.
Greece has repeatedly called for the permanent return of the sculptures, which British diplomat L…]]></summary>

The 20-year-old man suspected of keeping 11 people hostage in a pharmacy for five hours on Friday in Germany's south-western city of Karlsruhe has been taken into custody, authorities said on Saturday
According to the public prosecutor's office and the police, a judge issued an arrest warrant on charges of hostage-taking.
The 20-year-old suspect, who is known to the police, held the 11 hostages for almost five hours until special forces stormed the pharmacy and overpowered him.
The perpetrator was armed but he acted alone, police said earlier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has deplored new "brutal terrorist attacks" by Russia on cities and towns across his country.

Day and night there are these attacks, Zelensky said in his nightly video message broadcast in Kiev on Saturday. "Rockets and artillery, drones and mortars: The vicious state uses a variety of weapons with the one goal of destroying life and leaving nothing human behind," Zelensky said.
"Ruins, rubble, craters where missiles hit are the self-portrait of Russia that it paints where life exists without Russia," the Ukrainian head of state said. The country stands for evil, he said. "It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment."
Zelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.]]></summary>

Rosalia Messina Denaro was arrested earlier this month not far from Palermo, where her godfather brother was caught on January 16 after 30 years on the run.
She is accused of issuing orders, keeping the books and transmitting secret messages for her sibling while he was in hiding.
For many years, women linked to the Cosa Nostra Mafia seemed born to become widows, portrayed in films as black-veiled Madonnas, leading funeral processions in sorrowful dignity.
The reality is far more complex, with many wives, daughters and sisters playing active roles while their men are on the run, in prison…]]></summary>

BEIJING (Reuters) -Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China's premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity's sclerotic stock market.
Li's back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.
In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai's new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China's hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mexican authorities have arrested five people over the deadly kidnapping of a group of Americans, after the suspects were left in the street with their hands tied by alleged cartel members, officials said Friday.
The four US citizens, two of whom died, were snatched at gunpoint after crossing the border into crime-plagued Tamaulipas state on Friday in a minivan, apparently so that one could have cosmetic surgery.
Tamaulipas prosecutor Irving Barrios said that a warrant had been executed for five people for the crimes of kidnapping and homicide.
They are the same five men who were found Thursday with their hands bound on a street in the city of Matamoros, apparently dumped by fellow members of the Gulf Cartel, a source in the prosecutor's office told AFP.

"The world has gone mad," says one mourner holding a bouquet of white roses and approaching the entrance of the brick building, cordoned off by police.
The body bags are carefully placed in hearses before being driven away and the man with the bouquet leaves with his flowers still in hand.
"It really upsets me," says Tatjana Popczy, who lives just 200 metres (yards) from the centre where a former member of the Jehovah's Witnesses burst into a service at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) on Thursday, killing six people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won't be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia's year-long military invasion.
As reported by CBS News' Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a "bigger war" in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was "done" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while "America First" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow on Friday accused foreign countries of fomenting days of mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia's borders.
Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial "foreign agent" legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
